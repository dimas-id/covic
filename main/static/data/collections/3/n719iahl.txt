Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) contains a single spike (S) protein, which binds to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), induces membrane fusion and serves as a neutralizing antigen. A SARS-CoV-S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype using the VSVDeltaG* system was generated. Partial deletion of the SARS-CoV-S protein cytoplasmic domain allowed efficient incorporation into VSV particles and led to the generation of a pseudotype (VSV-SARS-St19) at high titre. Green fluorescent protein expression was demonstrated as early as 7 h after infection of Vero E6 cells with VSV-SARS-St19. VSV-SARS-St19 was neutralized by anti-SARS-CoV antibody and soluble ACE2, and its infection was blocked by treatment of Vero E6 cells with anti-ACE2 antibody. These results indicated that VSV-SARS-St19 infection is mediated by SARS-CoV-S protein in an ACE2-dependent manner. VSV-SARS-St19 will be useful for analysing the function of SARS-CoV-S protein and for developing rapid methods of detecting neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS-CoV infection.

Smokers being witnessed with the mild adverse clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, the in-silico study is intended to explore the effect of nicotine binding to the soluble angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor with or without SARS-CoV-2 binding. Nicotine established a stable interaction with the conserved amino acid residues: Asp382, Gly405, His378 and Tyr385 through His401 of the soluble ACE2 that seals its interaction with the INS1. Also, nicotine binding has significantly reduced the affinity score of ACE2 with INS1 to -12.6 kcal/mol (versus -15.7 kcal/mol without nicotine) and the interface area to 1933.6 square Angstrom (versus 2057.3 square Angstrom without nicotine). Nicotine exhibited a higher binding affinity score with ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex with -6.33 kcal/mol (Vs -5.24 kcal/mol without SARS-CoV-2) and a lowered inhibitory contant value of 22.95 micromolar (Vs 151.69 micromolar without SARS-CoV). Eventhough ACE2 is not a potential receptor for nicotine binding in the healthy people, in COVID19 patients, it may exhibit better binding affinity with the ACE2 receptor. In overall, nicotines strong preference for ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex might drastically reduce the SARS-CoV-2 virulence by intervening the ACE2 conserved residues interaction with the spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2.

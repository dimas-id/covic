Abstract In November 2007, China implemented its Emergency Response Law to ensure national unified leadership and collaboration when responding to emergencies. In recent years, China’s main focuses for enhancing disaster management have included emergency preparation, emergency management, and legal system mechanisms. However, its well-designed management system faced a great challenge during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. By examining the literature on the development of disaster management, we realized that enhancing self-organization in communities can effectively resolve problems caused by collective actions and strengthen resilience to disasters. In the decade since the Wenchuan earthquake, the literature has focused more on empowering communities during disaster management in China. However, literature on the compatibility of social resilience and the government-dominant model in China is still scant. This study investigates China’s current disaster management system design; specifically, it identifies ways and methods for counteracting any conflicts between disaster management under social synergies and China’s emergency management system. It further explores what factors facilitate the balance between social synergies and the emergency management system if the two concepts were fused together. Using case studies, in-depth interviews, and a focus group in the field of public administration, this study collected qualitative data to understand the changes in China’s disaster management system since the Wenchuan earthquake as well as provide recommendations for future reform.

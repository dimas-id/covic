The outbreak of severe pneumonia due to the new SARS‐CoV‐2 has created a world emergency that is putting global public health institutions at high alert. Since the first official paper on January 20 up to now more than 10.000 publications have appeared on PubMed. Surprisingly, no single paper has been dealing with the potential impact of the COVID‐19 on Down Syndrome (DS). As COVID‐19 presents as an acute severe respiratory syndrome and DS is by far the most frequent chromosomal disease with the highest susceptibility to develop respiratory infections and complications (1), it seems timely to focus on this syndrome during the ongoing pandemic.

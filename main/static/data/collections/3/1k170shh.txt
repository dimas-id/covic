Abstract A clinical case of fatal HBoV infection in an adult cystic-fibrosis patient awaiting lung transplantation is reported. The case is important as the genetic background of the underlying disease is congruent with the background of the sole permissive permanent cell culture CuFi-8 which originates also from a CF patient donor.

Abstract ORF8a protein is 39 residues long and contains a single transmembrane domain. The protein is synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis and reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers that forms cation-selective ion channels with a main conductance level of 8.9±0.8pS at elevated temperature (38.5°C). Computational modeling studies including multi nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations in a hydrated POPC lipid bilayer are done with a 22 amino acid transmembrane helix to predict a putative homooligomeric helical bundle model. A structural model of a pentameric bundle is proposed with cysteines, serines and threonines facing the pore.

The preferred surgical approach for many gynecologic oncology procedures is now laparoscopy. Reduced morbidity, shorter hospitalization and a more rapid recovery have been associated with minimally invasive surgical approaches when compared to laparotomy. Incisional morbidity, including vascular and viscous injury, postoperative hernia, infection, and pain remain significant concerns. Use of fewer and smaller incisions during laparoscopy may be expected to further minimize these risks. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), or single incision laparoscopy, describes the use of one small skin incision to complete laparoscopic surgical procedures. Recent advances in instrumentation have allowed increasingly complex procedures in gynecologic cancer patients to be completed. This review will serve as an update in regards to implementation of LESS in gynecologic oncology. Technical challenges encountered during performance of LESS as well as strategies to overcome these challenges will be discussed.

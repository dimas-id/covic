COVID-19 pandemic caused infection in a season when influenza is still prevalent. Both viruses have similar transmission characteristics and common clinical manifestations. Influenza has been described to cause respiratory infection with some other respiratory pathogens. However the information of COVID-19 and influenza co-infection is limited. In this study, we reported our co-infected cases and reviewed the literature. We included all COVID-19 diagnosed patients. All patients with a presumed diagnosis of COVID-19 were routinely screened for influenza. Their thorax radiology was reviewed for COVID-19 -influenza differentiation. During the study period, 1103 patients have been diagnosed COVID-19. Among them, 6 patients (0.54%) were diagnosed co-infected with influenza. There have been 28 more co-infected patients reported. Laboratory-based, screening studies reported more patients. Thorax radiology findings were compatible with COVID-19 in 5 and with influenza in 1 one of our patients. Our cases were mild-to-moderate in severity. The reported cases in the literature included patients died (n=2) and those living ventilator dependent or under mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 and influenza co-infection is rare. Screening studies report more cases, suggesting that unless screening COVID-19 patients, the co-infection remains undiagnosed and underestimated. Increasing experience in thoracic radiology may contribute to diagnose the responsible virus(es) from the clinical illness. Influenza vaccine for larger population groups can be recommended to simplify clinicians' work. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND In the literature, there is a wide range of reported morbidity and mortality rates after acute paraesophageal hernia (PH) repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected from all patients undergoing PH repair between December 2001 and October 2011. Outcome data were compared between the acute and elective groups. RESULTS Over the study period, 268 patients underwent PH repair, of which 42 patients underwent acute repair compared with 226 elective repairs. Morbidity and mortality rates were both higher, albeit nonsignificantly, in the acute group (16.6% vs. 6.6%, P=0.058 and 4.8% vs. 0.4%, P=0.065, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Because of the poorer preoperative medical status, lower success rates of minimal access surgery, and longer inpatient stay, combined with the trends toward increased morbidity and mortality rates, of patients undergoing acute repair of PH, we would recommend routine elective laparoscopic surgery as the standard of care for individuals with symptomatic PH and minimal comorbidities.

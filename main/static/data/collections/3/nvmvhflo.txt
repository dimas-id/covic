Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of widely used flame-retardants. Fifty honey samples labeled as being from different countries and regions were analyzed for 27 PBDE congeners. The concentrations of the 26 PBDEs, excluding BDE-209, ranged from 300 to 10,550 pg/g while the concentrations of BDE-209 ranged from nondetected to 9,260 pg/g. The honey samples labeled as originating in developed countries generally displayed higher concentrations of the total 27 PBDEs than those labeled as being from developing countries. Concentrations of 26 PBDEs ranged from 2,720 to 10,550 pg/g in honeys originating in developed countries and ranged from 1,030 to 3,470 pg/g in those from developing countries. BDE-209 was a dominant PBDE congener in all honey samples, on average accounting for 16% and 65% of the total 27 PBDEs in honeys from developed and developing countries, respectively. Honeys originating in developing countries, however, showed much higher BDE-209 levels and higher ratios of BDE-209 relative to the other PBDE congeners. In addition, some highly brominated PBDE congeners such as BDE-196, -197, -206, and -207 showed elevated concentrations in honeys from developing countries. The findings were in agreement with the long, heavy historical uses of PBDE products in developed countries and the current, heavy uses of BDE-209 in developing countries. When BDE-209 was fortified in honey and incubated in the dark for four weeks at 25 or 60 degrees C, BDE-153, -183, -206, and -207 were detected as debromination products of BDE-209. Less brominated congeners in honeys may primarily come from the environment. Debromination of BDE-209 is also a source of less brominated congeners in honeys. The detection of PBDEs in honeys suggests that human exposure to PBDEs occurs as a result of honey consumption.

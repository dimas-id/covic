OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study is to report our initial experience of Onyx embolization of the high-flow fistula part of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) using a double-lumen balloon catheter. METHODS A Scepter C balloon catheter was used in 2 patients with AVMs associated with high-flow fistulas. The fistulas were located in the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery. RESULTS Onyx embolization was successful in 2 cases, resulting in elimination of the high-flow fistula part of the AVM. There were no treatment-related events. CONCLUSIONS The double-lumen Scepter balloon appears to be a safe and convenient device for Onyx embolization of high-flow fistulas.

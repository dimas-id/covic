N-PAT is a new model-checking tool that supports the verification of nested-models, i.e. models whose behaviour depends on the results of verification tasks. In this paper, we describe its operation and discuss mechanisms that are tailored to the efficient verification of nested-models. Further, we motivate the advantages of N-PAT over traditional model-checking tools through a network security case study.

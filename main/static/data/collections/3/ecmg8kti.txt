COVID-19 has created havoc in the world by causing thousands of demises in a short period of time. Up till now, several attempts have been made for potential therapeutics against SARS-COV2. In this retrospective, single-center study, we extracted data from 122 COVID-19, RT-PCR confirmed patients. who were treated with a new treatment strategy of lianhuaqingwen with Arbidol Hydrochloride. The patients were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms for COVID-19 disease. Of 122 patients 21 (17.21%) patients undergo severe conditions of COVID-19, However total 111 (90.9 %) experienced mild symptoms such as fever in 93 (76.22%) patients, cough in 23 (20.17%) and muscle pain were observed in total 8 (7%) patients. Furthermore our newly applied combination (Lianhuaqingwen and Arbidol Hydrochloride) showed effects in 5-7 days for patients with mild symptoms and was found effective with 98 % recovery rate. We found the new combination is very effective against patients with mild symptoms and asymptomatic patients. Further extensive clinical investigations are required.

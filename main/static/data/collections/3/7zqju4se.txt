Since 2010, continual outbreaks of highly virulent variants of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belonging to genotype GII have led to serious economic losses for the Chinese swine industry. To better understand the biological characteristics and pathogenicity of the current prevalent Chinese PEDV field strains, in this study, a highly virulent Chinese genotype GIIa PEDV strain, CH/HBXT/2018, was isolated and serially propagated using Vero cells. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that strain CH/HBXT/2018 contained novel insertion and deletion mutations in the S gene region relative to the classical strain and belonged to the genotype GIIa, similar to other recently isolated PEDV strains from China and the United States. Pig infection studies indicated that the CH/HBXT/2018 strain was highly virulent in suckling piglets, and the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD(50)) was 8.63 log(10)PDD(50)/3 mL at 7 days postinfection (DPI). The results of the present study are important for future PEDV challenge studies and the development of new PEDV vaccines based on prevalent field strains for the prevention and control of PED in China.

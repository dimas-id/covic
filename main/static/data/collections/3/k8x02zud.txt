No crisis is ever exactly the same as any other. There are always variations and different factors to be taken into consideration, even in incidents which appear to be identical. But much can be learned from case histories. The details of those which follow have been culled from published information or personal experience. Some have been selected as interesting examples of how a problem has been tackled or even exploited. Others have been chosen because, in the view of the author, they have been watersheds in establishing guiding principles in the way in which crises should be handled. Some of the content may even be hearsay, but this is felt to be important to convey the atmosphere at the time.

BACKGROUND: Patients with oncologic diseases, particularly those with hematologic malignancies, are at an increased risk of common infections and unique treatment-related complications with high mortality and morbidity. The annual incidence and prevalence of cancer in Germany is rising. Although modern treatments have generally led to improved survival, increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty of the patients require multidisciplinary strategies for handling complex therapeutic concepts and treatment of the associated complications. METHODS: A selective literature search and guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hämatologie und Medizinische Onkologie, DGHO), the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the DGHO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Infektionen in der Hämatologie und Onkologie, AGIHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) formed the basis of this study. CONCLUSION: Recognition of severe infections in cancer patients and their discrimination from treatment-associated complications is a challenge. Neutropenic fever is the most frequent infectious emergency in oncology. Early empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and escalated diagnostic strategies are needed to successfully treat this vulnerable patient group. In this article, a range of potentially life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients are discussed.

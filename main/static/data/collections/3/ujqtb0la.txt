There is a need to develop reliable methods to assess the safety of genetically modified and other novel foods. The aim of this study was to identify protein biomarkers of food allergy in mice exposed to ovomucoid (OVM), a major food allergen found in chicken egg white. BALB/c mice were repeatedly sensitized by gavage with OVM and cholera toxin (CT) and control mice were exposed to a mixture of amino acids with CT. At the endpoint, all mice were challenged intraperitoneally with OVM and alum. Type-1 hypersensitivity was confirmed in OVM-sensitized mice by observation of clinical signs of anaphylaxis and elevated levels of plasma histamine, OVM-specific IgE and OVM-specific IgG by ELISA. Differential protein expression was assessed in albumin-depleted plasma as well as in mesenteric lymph node, liver, spleen, and ileum by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed proteins were identified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma proteins overexpressed in OVM-sensitized mice included haptoglobin (41-fold), serum amyloid A (19-fold) and peroxiredoxin-2 (1.9-fold). Further validation of these plasma proteins in other animal models of food allergy with different food allergens is required to assess their potential as candidate biomarkers for use in evaluating the allergenicity of novel foods.

OBJECTIVE The ideal location of specimen extraction in laparoscopic-assisted colorectal surgery is still debatable. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of incisional hernias and surgical site infections in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection for recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis by performing specimen extraction through left lower transverse incision or Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision. METHODS A total of 269 patients operated between January 2014 and December 2017 were retrospectively screened for inclusion in the study. Patients with specimen extraction through left lower transverse incision (LLT) and patients with specimen extraction through Pfannenstiel-K incision (P-K) were matched in 1:1 proportion regarding age, sex, comorbidities, and previous abdominal surgery. The incidence of incisional hernias and surgical site infections were compared by using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS After matching 77 patients in the LLT group and 77 patients in the P-K group, they were found to be homogenous regarding the above mentioned descriptive characteristics. No patients in the P-K group developed an incisional hernia compared with 10 patients (13%) in the LLT group (p = 0.001). All these patients required hernia repair with mesh augmentation. The rate of surgical site infections was 1/77 in the P-K group and 0/77 in the LLT group (p = 1.0). In the P-K group, a wound protector was used in 86% of patients whereas in the LLT group, 39% of the wounds were protected during specimen extraction (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION The Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision may be the preferred extraction site compared with the left lower transverse incision given the significant reduction of the risk of incisional hernias.

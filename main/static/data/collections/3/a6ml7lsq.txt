The contribution of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) relative to that of other respiratory viruses as a cause of respiratory infections in children less than 1 year old has been evaluated. From October 2003 to April 2004, nasopharyngeal samples from 211 children less than 1 year old were analyzed to detect respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the predominant virus isolated (96 children [45.5%]), followed by influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus type 1, which were only occasionally detected. From January 2004 to April 2004, a nested retrotranscription-PCR, using in-house primers directed to the matrix protein gene of hMPV, was carried out on samples in which no other viruses were detected. hMPV was detected in 18 (16.2%) children, indicating that this virus was the second-most-frequent cause of viral respiratory infections in children less than 1 year old. The rate of hospitalization for RSV- and hMPV-infected children was higher than 75%. While RSV had a peak from December to February, hMPV was increasingly detected from January to April. The mean age of hMPV-infected children (6.44 +/- 3.64 [mean +/- standard deviation] months) was significantly higher than that of RSV-infected children (3.99 +/- 2.96 [mean +/- standard deviation] months). On the other hand, 64.3% of the RSV-infected children and 12.5% of the hMPV-infected children showed high levels of C-reactive protein. Although several authors have reported that clinical symptoms of hMPV-positive patients mirrored those of RSV-positive patients, differences between the two viruses can be found.

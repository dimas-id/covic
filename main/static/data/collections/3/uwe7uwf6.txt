Human norovirus (HuNoV) is a major causative agent of food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. Currently, there are no vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions for this virus. Development of an attenuated vaccine for HuNoV has been hampered by the inability to grow the virus in cell culture. Thus, a vector-based vaccine may be ideal. In this study, we constructed a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-VP1) expressing VP1, the major capsid protein of HuNoV. Expression of the capsid protein by VSV resulted in the formation of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically similar to native virions. Recombinant rVSV-VP1 was attenuated in cultured mammalian cells as well as in mice. Mice inoculated with a single dose of rVSV-VP1 through intranasal and oral routes stimulated a significantly stronger humoral and cellular immune response than baculovirus-expressed VLP vaccination. Moreover, we demonstrated that mice inoculated with rVSV-VP1 triggered a comparable level of fecal and vaginal IgA antibody. Taken together, the VSV recombinant system not only provides a new approach to generate HuNoV VLPs in vitro but also a new avenue for the development of vectored vaccines against norovirus and other noncultivable viruses.

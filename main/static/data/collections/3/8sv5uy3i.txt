The current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection poses new challenges in the management of patients with gastrointestinal or liver disease. Consultations with patients with chronic diseases should ideally be done via telemedicine and treatments administered at home if possible. The latter should be maintained in non-infected subjects to limit the risk of decompensation of their underlying disease. In the event of proven infection, immunomodulatory or biological treatments will tend to be reduced or discontinued unless the disease is in a severely active phase. Elective endoscopy should be postponed, and urgent procedures should be performed with appropriate personal protective equipment.

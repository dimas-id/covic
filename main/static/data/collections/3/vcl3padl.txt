Abstract To study response to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) under ammonia stress, Penaeus japonicus were exposed to 5 mg l−1 ammonia-N and challenged orally with WSSV (NW). Controls consisted of an ammonia-N-exposed control group (N), a WSSV-challenged positive control group (W), and an untreated control group (control). Immune parameters measured were total haemocyte count (THC), haemocyte phagocytosis, plasma protein content and haemolymph enzymatic activities for prophenoloxidase (proPO), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). THC and plasma protein had downward trends with time in all treatment groups (NW, N, and W) in contrast to the untreated control group (control). The percentage phagocytosis, NOS activity, and ALP and proPO activity of W and NW decreased initially then increased from 6 to 78 h (except for NOS and ALP, from 6 to 54 h) before declining thereafter until the end of the experiment. Compared with untreated controls (control), there was a downward trend for all measured parameters in the treatment groups (N, NW, and W), but the degree was W>NW>N. WSSV was detected at 78 h postchallenge in both W and NW. In conclusion, 5 mg l−1 ammonia-N reduced the immunocompetence of P. japonicus and may have decreased the virulence of WSSV.

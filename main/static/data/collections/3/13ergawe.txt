INTRODUCTION Primary obesity surgery, endoluminal (POSE) is a promising procedure for weight loss surgery because it is outpatient, is incisionless and has short recovery time. We demonstrate the POSE procedure as a potential option for the bariatric patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using an endoluminal camera, we videotaped one of our surgeons performing the POSE procedure. With rows of sutures in the fundus and antrum, the stomach's volume is reduced. RESULTS We demonstrate a successful POSE procedure in its entirety. CONCLUSIONS The POSE procedure is a promising option for the bariatric patient. Long-term studies are needed to show its efficacy.

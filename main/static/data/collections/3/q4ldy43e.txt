Moyamoya disease is a progressive occlusive vasculopathy that involves the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and Circle of Willis, and results in the formation of collateral vessels at the skull base. The progressive nature of this disease leads to cerebral ischemia and sometimes intracerebral hemorrhage. The treatment of moyamoya disease is mainly surgical revascularization, using revascularization techniques that include direct, indirect, and combined strategies.

PURPOSE: The PSVPro mode is increasingly being used for surgeries under laryngeal mask airway owing to improved ventilator-patient synchrony and decreased work of breathing. We hypothesized that PSVPro ventilation mode would reduce consumption of anesthetic agents compared with pressure control ventilation (PCV). METHODS: Seventy children between three and eight years of age undergoing elective lower abdominal and urological surgery were randomized into PCV group (n = 35) or PSVPro group (n = 35). General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and a Proseal LMA™ was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion to maintain the entropy values between 40 and 60. In the PCV mode, the inspiratory pressure was adjusted to obtain an expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL·kg(−1) and a respiratory rate of 12–20/min. In the PSVPRO group, the flow trigger was set at 0.4 L·min(−1) and pressure support was adjusted to obtain expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL·kg(−1). Consumption of anesthetic agent was recorded as the primary outcome. Emergence time and discharge time were recorded as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The PSVPro group showed significant reduction in propofol consumption compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 33.3 µg(−1)·kg(−1)·min(−1); 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.2 to 42.2). There was decrease in the emergence time in the PSVPro group compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 3.5 min; 95% CI, 2.8 to 4.2) and in time to achieve modified Aldrete score > 9 (mean difference, 3.6 min; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.2). CONCLUSION: The PSVPro mode decreases propofol consumption and emergence time, and improves oxygenation index in children undergoing ambulatory surgery.

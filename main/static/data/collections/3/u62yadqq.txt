BACKGROUND A short-term randomized controlled trial shows that the one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is a safe and effective alternative to the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to evaluate the OAGB at our University Hospital between 2006 and 2013. PATIENTS One thousand patients have undergone an OAGB. Data were collected on all consecutive patients. The mean follow-up period was 31 months (SD, 26.3; range, 12-82.9), and complete follow-up was available in 126 of 175 patients (72 %) at 5 years after surgery. RESULTS Mortality rate was 0.2 %. Overall morbidity was 5.5 %; 34 required reoperations: i.e., 6 leaks, 5 obstructions, 5 incisional hernias, 7 biliary refluxes, 2 perforated ulcers, 2 bleeds, 2 abscesses, and 1 anastomotic stricture. Four patients were reoperated for weight regain. Overall rate of marginal ulcers was 2 % (n = 20), all in heavy smokers. Conversion from an OAGB to a RYGB was required in nine cases (0.9 %): seven for intractable biliary reflux, two for a marginal ulcer. At 5 years, percent excess body mass index loss was 71.6 ± 27 %. One hundred patients with type-2 diabetes, with a mean preoperative HbA1C of 7.7 ± 1.9 %, were followed for >2 years; the total resolution rate was 85.7 %. CONCLUSION This study confirms that the OAGB is an effective procedure for morbid obesity with comparable outcomes to RYGB; in addition, it seems to be safer with lower morbidity. Its technical simplicity represents a real advantage and makes it an option that should be considered by all bariatric surgeons.

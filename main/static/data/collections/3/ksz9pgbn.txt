OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility, instrumentation, and learning curve for single-port laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (SPLPN) in a pig model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten transumbilical SPLPN were performed using the R-Port (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) multi-instrument port, a 5-mm flexible laparoscope (Olympus Surgical, Orangeburg, NY, USA), and custom-engineered articulating needle drivers, graspers, and scissors (Cambridge Endo, Framingham, MA, USA). After general anaesthesia, the pig was placed in the flank position. After umbilical placement of the R-Port, Gerota's fascia was incised and hilar dissection performed with the newly engineered articulating instruments. Either the upper or lower pole of the kidney was scored and excised after placing a bulldog clamp on the renal pedicle. The bolsters were prepared with absorbable haemostat, placed at the site of excision, and secured with polyglactin sutures. RESULTS A fascial incision of > or =2.5 cm should be made to allow adequate room for passing the instruments. Also, use of the 5 mm flexible laparoscope minimizes instrument crowding and allows for optimal visualization. The mean (sd, range) time for hilum dissection was 12.2 (4.3, 7-20) min, while that for total excision was 9.8 (1.7, 8-12) min. Modified suturing techniques were developed to achieve reconstruction in a small working space. Specialized instrumentation is essential for a successful SPLPN with no need for an additional port for triangulation. The mean duration of intracorporeal suturing was 27.7 min (declining from 40 to 15 min). The total ischaemia time decreased from 50 min in the first case to 27 min in the last (mean 37.4 min). The mean estimated blood loss was 81.1 (31.7, 50-150) mL. CONCLUSIONS SPLPN is technically feasible but further refinement of instrumentation and techniques is needed to decrease the ischaemia time and optimize the procedure.

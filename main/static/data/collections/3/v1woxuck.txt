Devising efficient and secure signature schemes based on coding theory is still considered a challenge by the cryptographic community. In this paper, we construct a signature scheme by exploring a new approach to the area. To do this, we design a zero-knowledge identification scheme, which we then render static via standard means (e.g. Fiat-Shamir). We show that practical instances of our protocol have the potential to outperform the state of the art on code-based signatures, achieving small data sizes with a low computational complexity.

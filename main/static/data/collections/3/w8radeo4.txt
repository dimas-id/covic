UNSTRUCTURED During this ongoing global Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, people in different regions of the world have been greatly affected. Recently delivered mothers and currently pregnant women face a dilemma during this period, since they need professional antenatal care while there are high infection risks of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in hospitals. Therefore, online antenatal care would be a preferable choice for these women because it could provide pregnancy-related information and online clinic consultations. In addition, online antenatal care could help to provide relatively cheaper medical services and diminish health inequality due to its convenience and cost-effectiveness, especially in developing countries or regions. However, some pregnant women will doubt the reliability of such online information. Therefore, it is important to determine how to ensure the quality of online services and establish a stable mutual trust between pregnant women and online programs. Here we report how the COVID-19 pandemic brings not only opportunities for the development and popularization of online antenatal care programs but also challenges.

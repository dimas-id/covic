High-throughput microchip devices used for nucleic-acid amplification require sealed reactors. This is to prevent evaporative loss of the amplification mixture and cross-contamination, which may occur among fluidically connected reactors. In most high-throughput nucleic-acid amplification devices, reactor sealing is achieved by microvalves. Additionally, these devices require micropumps to distribute amplification mixture into an array of reactors, thereby increasing the device cost, and adding complexity to the chip fabrication and operation processes. To overcome these limitations, we report microfluidic devices harboring open (unsealed) reactors in conjunction with a single-step capillary based flow scheme for sequential distribution of amplification mixture into an array of reactors. Concern about evaporative loss in unsealed reactors have been addressed by optimized reactor design, smooth internal reactor surfaces, and incorporation of a localized heating scheme for the reactors, in which isothermal, real-time helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) was performed.

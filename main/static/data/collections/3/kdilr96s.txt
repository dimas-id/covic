Finland’s first COVID-19 infection was recorded in late January 2020. The person infected was a tourist from China in Lapland. Authorities recommended regular handwashing, coughing in one’s sleeve, not touching your face, physical distancing, and home lockdown for those at risk. The pandemic spread at different paces in different regions, and the first Finnish fatality was recorded on March 20 in Uusimaa province, where the number of documented infections was considerably higher than elsewhere. In late March, the parliament granted the government emergency powers for swift regulations and restrictions. Uusimaa province was isolated from the rest of the country for a fortnight, restaurants were closed, meetings of more than 10 people were forbidden, and schools and universities assumed distant-working modes, as did businesses and civil services where this was feasible.

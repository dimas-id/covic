OBJECTIVES: To investigate the imaging findings and clinical time course of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 113 baseline and follow-up CT scans from 24 January 2020 to 18 February 2020 were longitudinally collected from 29 confirmed COVID-19 patients in a single center. The changes in the clinical and laboratory characteristics, imaging features, lesion-to-muscle ratio (LMR), and pulmonary inflammation index (PII) at baseline, 1–6 days, 7–13 days, and ≥ 14 days were compared. RESULTS: Of the 29 COVID-19 patients enrolled, the baseline chest CT scan was obtained 3 ± 2 (0–9) days after the onset of symptoms, and each patient had an average of 4 ± 1 (3–5) CT scans with a mean interval of 5 ± 2 (1–14) days. The percentage of patients with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia obviously decreased at 7–13 days with regular treatment (p < 0.05). The lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and oxygenation index worsened within 1–6 days but improved sharply at 7–13 days. Compared with those at the other three time points, the LMR, PII, and number of involved lobes at 1–6 days were the highest, and gradually improved after 7–13 days. CONCLUSIONS: Lung lesion development on chest CT reflects the clinical time course of COVID-19 progression over 1–6 days, followed by clinical improvement and the resorption of lesions. CT imaging may be indicated when patients fail to improve within a week of treatment, but repeated chest CT may be unnecessary when the patients show improvements clinically. KEY POINTS: • Chest CT reflects the development of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia (COVID-19). • COVID-19 usually shows progressive lesions over up to 9 days with subsequent resorption. • Unusual clinical time course of COVID-19 may indicate repeated chest CT.

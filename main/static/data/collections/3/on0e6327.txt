Introduction There is a concern that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) induced hypochlorhydria could potentially predispose to severe COVID-19. Methods We studied the association between prehospitalization PPI use and clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results In our study, 15.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were on PPI. Mortality among PPI-users was 2.3 times higher than non-users, along with 2.5 times higher risk of mechanical ventilation. This relationship existed even after adjusting for confounding variables. Discussion These results warrant further investigation to evaluate if PPI-induced hypochlorhydria is associated with a higher risk of GI symptoms and worse outcomes because of the omnipresence of ACE-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.

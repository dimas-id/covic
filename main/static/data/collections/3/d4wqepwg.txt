Abstract The performance of the CLART® PneumoVir system with that of the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay for detection of most common respiratory viruses in upper and lower tract respiratory specimens (n=183) from unique patients with influenza-like syndrome or lower tract respiratory infection. Nested PCR coupled to automated sequencing was used for resolution of discrepancies. Fully concordant results were obtained for a total of 122 specimens, whereas 56 specimens gave partially (n=21) or fully discordant (n=35) results (Kappa coefficient, 0.62). The overall specificity of the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay was slightly higher than that of the CLART® PneumoVir assay for human bocavirus, influenza A virus/H3N2, influenza B virus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus, whereas the sensitivity of the latter was higher for most targeted viruses except, notably, for picornaviruses. This was irrespective of either the origin of the respiratory specimen or the age group to which the patients belonged.

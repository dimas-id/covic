Abstract Pathogenesis encompasses all the sequence of events accompanying acute and persistent infections. It includes entry of the virus into the body, multiplication and spread, the development of tissue damage, and the production of an immune response; the latter may contribute to the pathology of an infection. It includes the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms, the eventual resolution of the infection and, in most cases, virus elimination. Understanding viral disease pathogenesis requires knowledge of each of the stages of infection and an awareness of the underlying mechanisms. There may be variation from individual to individual in the severity and/or the duration of these events, but a sound working knowledge of a typical sequence associated with each infection is crucial in both making an accurate diagnosis and recommending the appropriate treatment.

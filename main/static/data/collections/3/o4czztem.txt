A 2-year-old boy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome that required multiple cardiovascular surgeries and a heterozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation with resulting thrombophilia maintained on warfarin presented with acute right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction manifesting as a left hemiplegia. An MRI revealed a complete occlusion of the right M1 segment with an area of restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia representing only a small area of acute infarction. Patchy areas of subacute infarction were also present in the right MCA territory. He underwent endovascular mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever. This is an account of a successful mechanical thrombectomy performed in the youngest patient reported in the English literature to date.

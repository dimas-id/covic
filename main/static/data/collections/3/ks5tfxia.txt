With the recent influx of technology, Unsolicited Bulk Emails (UBEs) have become a potential problem, leaving computer users and organizations at the risk of brand, data, and financial loss. In this paper, we present a novel bio-inspired hybrid parallel optimization algorithm (Cuckoo-Firefly-GR), which combines Genetic Replacement (GR) of low fitness individuals with a hybrid of Cuckoo Search (CS) and Firefly (FA) optimizations. Cuckoo-Firefly-GR not only employs the random walk in CS, but also uses mechanisms in FA to generate and select fitter individuals. The content- and behavior-based features of emails used in the existing works, along with Doc2Vec features of the email body are employed to extract the syntactic and semantic information in the emails. By establishing an optimal balance between intensification and diversification, and reaching global optimization using two metaheuristics, we argue that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of UBE detection, by selecting the most discriminative feature subspace. This study presents significant observations from the extensive evaluations on UBE corpora of 3, 844 emails, that underline the efficiency and superiority of our proposed Cuckoo-Firefly-GR over the base optimizations (Cuckoo-GR and Firefly-GR), dense autoencoders, recurrent neural autoencoders, and several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the instructive feature subset obtained using the proposed Cuckoo-Firefly-GR, when classified using a dense neural model, achieved an accuracy of [Formula: see text].

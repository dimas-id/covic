Acute exacerbations of COPD involve increased symptoms such as cough, dyspnea and sputum production. These exacerbations are associated with increased mortality as well as decline in lung function. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is the preferred method of ventilatory support in respiratory failure secondary to AECOPD. NIPPV reduces work of breathing, improves oxygenation and ventilation and decreases both mortality and the risk of invasive ventilation. Other therapies for AECOPD include inhaled bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids. Antibiotics are recommended for severe exacerbations. Future areas of interest in treatment for AECOPD include utilization of biomarkers and extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal.

In the course of a lifetime a decrease of the immunofunction occurs in adults, in particular of the adaptive immune system.Therefore, respiratory virus infections are usually mild and uncomplicated in young healthy people while elderly and frail adults more frequently develop serious diseases of the lower respiratory tract.Even “harmless” agents such as rhino- or coronaviruses frequently induce acute disorders or exacerbations in people with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases or asthma.For rapid diagnosis, detection of the viral antigen, viral genome, and infectivity by shell vial culture are suitable because the humoral immune response is delayed.Primarily, a nasopharyngeal sample should be used and in addition a specific local sample depending on the symptoms. The sensitivity of antigen assays is rather low. A combination of PCR and detection of infectivity increase the detection rate.Among the main respiratory viruses only influenza is preventable by vaccination.The annual revaccination of the elderly and patients with risk factors such as chronic cardiopulmonary diseases is important.Improved vaccines can enhance the immunoreaction.For therapy and prophylaxis against influenza A amantadine may be used.The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir represent potent drugs for antiviral therapy against influenza virus A and B infection. Pleconaril, a capsid function inhibitor with effective antiviral activity against rhinovirus infection, awaits approval.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cardiovascular complications and coagulation disorders. OBJECTIVES: To explore the coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Study analyzed clinical and biological profiles of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at admission, including hemostasis tests and quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CECs). RESULTS: Among 96 consecutive COVID-19-suspected patients fulfilling criteria for hospitalization, 66 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present with fever (p=0.02), cough (p=0.03) and pneumonia at CT-scan (p=0.002) at admission. Prevalence of D-dimer >500 ng/mL was higher in COVID-19 positive patients (74.2% vs. 43.3%; p=0.007). No sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation were identified. Adding D-dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in ROC curve analysis significantly increased AUC for COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (p=0.008) than COVID-19 negative ones. COVID-19 positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had less CECs (p=0.02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and ACEi or ARBs had even lesser CECs (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Curative anticoagulation could prevent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and endothelial lesion.

Peptidases and esterases are hydrolytic enzymes; 2â€“3% of all gene products are assigned to this group alone. They are therefore, an important group of target proteins for the design of new medicines and have a special importance for structure-based drug design. This is reflected in the fact that about 14% of all known human peptidases are presently being investigated as possible target structures for drug therapy.

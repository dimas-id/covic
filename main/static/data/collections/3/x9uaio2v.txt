The epidemic caused by COVID-19 has been highly concerned by the international community including World Health Organization (WHO). This is an ongoing battle for human life and health. We should always remember and learn lessons from the past, which could be promoted to all over the country, even the world. Many phenomena and problems in the work of epidemic prevention, control and treatment are worthy of our deep reflection. We should use scientific approach and dialectical materialism to make a practical and realistic summary. The purpose is to win the battle as soon as possible, and more importantly, to avoid repeating the same mistakes and prevent pestilence before it happens.

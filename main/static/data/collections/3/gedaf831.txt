Objective: Our study aimed to investigate whether the metabolic indicators associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the general population have changed during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective self-controlled study enrolled adult participants with metabolic indicators relate to NCDs followed at Fujian Provincial Hospital and Fujian Provincial Hospital South Branch. The metabolic indicators followed during January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020, the peak period of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, were compared with the baseline value in the same period last year. Pared-samples T-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed to analyze the differences between paired data. Results: The follow-up total cholesterol was significantly increased than that of the baseline (4.73 (4.05, 5.46) mmol/L vs 4.71 (4.05, 5.43) mmol/L, p=0.019; n=3379). Similar results were observed in triglyceride (1.29 (0.91, 1.88) vs 1.25 (0.87, 1.81) mmol/L, p<0.001; n=3381), uric acid (330.0 (272.0, 397.0) vs 327.0 (271.0, 389.0) umol/L, p<0.001; n=3364), and glycosylated hemoglobin (6.50 (6.10, 7.30) vs 6.50 (6.10, 7.20) %, p=0.013; n=532). No significant difference was observed in low density lipoprotein, body mass index and blood pressure. Conclusions: Metabolic indicators associated with NCDs deteriorated in the COVID-19 outbreak. We should take action to prevent and control NCDs without delay.

With the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 having caught the world almost unaware millions of people across the globe are presently grappling to deal with its acute effects . Our previous experience with members of the same corona virus family (SARS and MERS) which have caused two major epidemics in the past albeit of much lower magnitude , has taught us that the harmful effect of such outbreaks are not limited to acute complications alone .Long term cardiopulmonary, glucometabolic and neuropsychiatric complications have been documented following these infections .In the given circumstance it is therefore imperative to keep in mind the possible complications that may occur after the acute phase of the disease subsides and to prepare the healthcare system for such challenges.

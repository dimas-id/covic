BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection has been reported to be related with an increased risk of thrombotic complications because of the hypercoagulability state and inflammation. At the moment, no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID-19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 67-year-old male patient, who had undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft 6 years before, was admitted to the emergency department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia, and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Owing to the progressive impairment of the respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission, the day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died on the arrival in the radiological suite. CONCLUSIONS: Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID-19 infection. In COVID-19 patients with prosthetic graft, an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.

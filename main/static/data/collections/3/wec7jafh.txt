Native human antibodies are defined as those that arise naturally as the result of the functioning of an intact human immune system. The utility of native antibodies for the treatment of human viral diseases has been established through experience with hyperimmune human globulins. Native antibodies, as a class, differ in some respects from those obtained by recombinant library methods (phage or transgenic mouse) and possess distinct properties that may make them ideal therapeutics for human viral diseases. Methods for cloning native human antibodies have been beset by technical problems, yet many antibodies specific for viral antigens have been cloned. In the present review, we discuss native human antibodies and ongoing improvements in cloning methods that should facilitate the creation of novel, potent antiviral therapeutics obtained from the native human antibody repertoire.

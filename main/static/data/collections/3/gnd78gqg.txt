The current COVID-19 pandemic is the most disruptive event in the last 50 years with global impact on healthcare and world economies. It is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as an entry point to the cells. ACE2 is a transmembrane carboxypeptidase and member of the renin-angiotensin system. This mini-review, summarizes the main findings regarding ACE2 expression and function in endocrine tissues. We discuss rapidly evolving knowledge on the potential role of ACE2 and SARS coronaviruses in endocrinology and the development of diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism, pituitary and thyroid diseases.

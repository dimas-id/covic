Intestinal epithelium functions as a barrier to protect multicellular organisms from the outside world. It consists of epithelial cells closely connected by intercellular junctions, selective gates which control paracellular diffusion of solutes, ions and macromolecules across the epithelium and keep out pathogens. Rotavirus is one of the major enteric viruses causing severe diarrhea in humans and animals. It specifically infects the enterocytes on villi of small intestines. The polarity of rotavirus replication in their target enterocytes and the role of intestinal epithelial integrity were examined in the present study. Treatment with EGTA, a drug that chelates calcium and disrupts the intercellular junctions, (i) significantly enhanced the infection of rotavirus in primary enterocytes, (ii) increased the binding of rotavirus to enterocytes, but (iii) considerably blocked internalization of rotavirus. After internalization, rotavirus was resistant to EGTA treatment. To investigate the polarity of rotavirus infection, the primary enterocytes were cultured in a transwell system and infected with rotavirus at either the apical or the basolateral surface. Rotavirus preferentially infected enterocytes at the basolateral surface. Restriction of infection through apical inoculation was overcome by EGTA treatment. Overall, our findings demonstrate that integrity of the intestinal epithelium is crucial in the hostâ€™s innate defense against rotavirus infection. In addition, the intercellular receptor is located basolaterally and disruption of intercellular junctions facilitates the binding of rotavirus to their receptor at the basolateral surface.

The World Health Organization has received reports of 4,836 cases, of which 293 persons have died.

Symptoms of the disease include fever, shortness of breath and cough. Ten percent of patients afflicted with SARS require artificial breathing. The mortality rate is 6-7%. A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Infection is transmitted from person to person through direct or close contact with airborne droplets or personal objects of an infected person. Patients must be isolated and treated by contact and airborne isolation. Treatment consists of support care and artificial respiration when required. The use of anti-viral medications has not yet proven effective.

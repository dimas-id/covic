Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an economically important pathogenic virus in the swine production. Current vaccines against PRRSV do not induce sterile immunity and the virus evolves at a rapid rate with frequent appearances of new strains. In this study, we screened a library of 502 highly purified natural product compounds to identify specific inhibitors of PRRSV replication cycle. Our observations showed that many of the inhibitory compounds identified have activity on the cellular ion transport mechanisms. We identified for the first time, four compounds which inhibit the PRRSV replication cycle at micro molar concentration or less, namely, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate, ouabain, bufalin and valinomycin. Further, we have identified 15 other compounds which can inhibit the PRRSV replication at the concentration of 8Î¼M. This study provides a basis for further development of pharmacological agents to inhibit PRRSV replication.

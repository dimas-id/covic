BACKGROUND Partial nephrectomy is the treatment of choice for clinical stage 1 renal tumours. Open partial nephrectomy is the standard operative technique. The use of minimally-invasive strategies such as laparoscopic, robot-assisted partial nephrectomy or laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) partial nephrectomy has increased in recent years. PATIENTS/MATERIAL AND METHODS In this retrospective study, patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy between December 2008 and November 2013 were evaluated. All patients presented with renal lesions suspicious for malignancy. Operations were performed as conventional laparoscopic transperitoneal partial nephrectomies (cLPN) or LESS partial nephrectomies (LESS-PN) in SITUS technique (single incision transumbilical surgery). The aim of the study was to compare perioperative outcome parameters such as duration of surgery, time of ischaemia, complications, need for transfusion, conversion rates, changes in renal function and duration of hospital stay in both groups. RESULTS A total of 85 laparoscopic partial nephrectomies were performed in this study (72 cLPN and 13 LESS-PN). The average tumour size was 2.68±1.47 cm (cLPN) vs. 2.46±1.11 cm (LESS-PN). The mean duration of surgery was 175.17±50.026 min (cLPN) and 185.77±35.991 min (LESS-PN). 45 (62.5%) operations (cLPN) vs. 10 (76.9%) (LESS-PN) were performed in zero-ischaemia technique. There were no significant differences in perioperative outcome parameters between both groups. Postoperative complication rates (Clavien-Dindo≥3) were 11.1% (cLPN) vs. 7.7% (LESS-PN). CONCLUSIONS LESS partial nephrectomy in SITUS technique is an attractive alternative to conventional laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy.

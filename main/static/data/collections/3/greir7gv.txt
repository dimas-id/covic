BACKGROUND The internal thoracic artery (ITA) is a useful graft for coronary artery bypass grafting. Skeletonization, a technique that uses an ultrasonic scalpel, is increasingly used. However, the cost of an ultrasonic scalpel is extremely high. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a new electrosurgical cautery device (ForceTriad™) is as effective as an ultrasonic scalpel. METHODS Bilateral ITAs were harvested from eight pigs using the skeletonizing technique. The ITA on one side was harvested with an ultrasonic scalpel and on the other side using the ForceTriad™. Macroscopic and histological examinations were performed in sixteen ITAs. RESULTS No significant differences in the time required for harvesting were observed. The macroscopic findings revealed no significant change in any of the samples. The histological findings showed that the degree of thermal injury was similar. The normal structure was maintained in all samples. The ForceTriad™ costs US$ 226.82 less per patient than the ultrasonic scalpel. CONCLUSION The new electrosurgical cautery device ForceTriad™ was less expensive, but it was equally effective. It appears that skeletonization performed with the new device is equivalent to that performed with an ultrasonic scalpel.

The neuropeptide oxytocin has attracted great attention of the general public, basic neuroscience researchers, psychologists, and psychiatrists due to its profound pro-social, anxiolytic, and "anti-stress" behavioral and physiological effects, and its potential application for treatment of mental diseases associated with altered socio-emotional competence. During the last decade, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the complex neurobiology of the oxytocin system, including oxytocinergic pathways, local release patterns, and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain, as well as intraneuronal oxytocin receptor signaling. However, the picture of oxytocin actions remains far from being complete, and the central question remains: "How does a single neuropeptide exert such pleotropic actions?" Although this phenomenon, typical for many of about 100 identified neuropeptides, may emerge from the anatomical divergence of oxytocin neurons, their multiple central projections, distinct oxytocin-sensitive cell types in different brain regions, and multiple intraneuronal signaling pathways determining the specific cellular response, further basic studies are required. In conjunction, numerous reports on positive effects of intranasal application of oxytocin on human brain networks controlling socio-emotional behavior in health and disease require harmonic tandems of basic researchers and clinicians. During the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, oxytocin research seems central as question of social isolation-induced inactivation of the oxytocin system, and buffering effects of either activation of the endogenous system or intranasal application of synthetic oxytocin need to be thoroughly investigated.

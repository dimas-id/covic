Most eukaryotic expression systems make use of host-cell nuclear transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries. Here, we present the first generation of the chimeric cytoplasmic capping-prone phage polymerase (C3P3-G1) expression system developed by biological engineering, which generates capped and polyadenylated transcripts in host-cell cytoplasm by means of two components. First, an artificial single-unit chimeric enzyme made by fusing an mRNA capping enzyme and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Second, specific DNA templates designed to operate with the C3P3-G1 enzyme, which encode for the transcripts and their artificial polyadenylation. This system, which can potentially be adapted to any in cellulo or in vivo eukaryotic expression applications, was optimized for transient expression in mammalian cells. C3P3-G1 shows promising results for protein production in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. This work also provides avenues for enhancing the performances for next generation C3P3 systems.

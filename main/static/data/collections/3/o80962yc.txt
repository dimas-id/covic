OBJECTIVE The goals of this study were to determine baseline and postbariatric surgical characteristics associated with type 2 diabetes remission and if, after controlling for differences in weight loss, diabetes remission was greater after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) than laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS An observational cohort of obese participants was studied using generalized linear mixed models to examine the associations of bariatric surgery type and diabetes remission rates for up to 3 years. Of 2,458 obese participants enrolled, 1,868 (76%) had complete data to assess diabetes status at both baseline and at least one follow-up visit. Of these, 627 participants (34%) were classified with diabetes: 466 underwent RYGBP and 140 underwent LAGB. RESULTS After 3 years, 68.7% of RYGBP and 30.2% of LAGB participants were in diabetes remission. Baseline factors associated with diabetes remission included a lower weight for LAGB, greater fasting C-peptide, lower leptin-to-fat mass ratio for RYGBP, and a lower hemoglobin A1c without need for insulin for both procedures. After both procedures, greater postsurgical weight loss was associated with remission. However, even after controlling for differences in amount of weight lost, relative diabetes remission rates remained nearly twofold higher after RYGBP than LAGB. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes remission up to 3 years after RYGBP and LAGB was proportionally higher with increasing postsurgical weight loss. However, the nearly twofold greater weight loss-adjusted likelihood of diabetes remission in subjects undergoing RYGBP than LAGB suggests unique mechanisms contributing to improved glucose metabolism beyond weight loss after RYGBP.

Ferrets are an increasingly popular pet in the United States. They are active, gregarious pets that delight their owners with playful antics. One of the issues that ferret owners and veterinarians have had to deal with is their shortened life span.

Most information on senior ferrets has focused on neoplastic diseases. This article discusses husbandry and nutritional issues of the aging ferret, more commonly seen geriatric diseases, and diagnostic and treatment options.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic pelvic fracture (TPF) is a significant injury that results from high energy impact and has a high morbidity and mortality. PURPOSE: We aimed to describe the epidemiology, incidence, patterns, management, and outcomes of TPF in multinational level 1 trauma centers. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with TPF between 2010 and 2016 at two trauma centers in Qatar and Germany. RESULTS: A total of 2112 patients presented with traumatic pelvic injuries, of which 1814 (85.9%) sustained TPF, males dominated (76.5%) with a mean age of 41 ± 21 years. In unstable pelvic fracture, the frequent mechanism of injury was motor vehicle crash (41%) followed by falls (35%) and pedestrian hit by vehicle (24%). Apart from both extremities, the chest (37.3%) was the most commonly associated injured region. The mean injury severity score (ISS) of 16.5 ± 13.3. Hemodynamic instability was observed in 44%. Blood transfusion was needed in one third while massive transfusion and intensive care admission were required in a tenth and a quarter of cases, respectively. Tile classification was possible in 1228 patients (type A in 60%, B in 30%, and C in 10%). Patients with type C fractures had higher rates of associated injuries, higher ISS, greater pelvis abbreviated injury score (AIS), massive transfusion protocol activation, prolonged hospital stay, complications, and mortality (p value < 0.001). Two-thirds of patients were managed conservatively while a third needed surgical fixation. The median length of hospital and intensive care stays were 15 and 5 days, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 4.7% (86 patients). CONCLUSION: TPF is a common injury among polytrauma patients. It needs a careful, systematic management approach to address the associated complexities and the polytrauma nature.

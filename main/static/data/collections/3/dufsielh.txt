The primary targets for SARS-CoV infection are the epithelial cells in the respiratory and intestinal tract. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. ACE-2 has been shown to be expressed at the apical domain of polarized Calu-3 cells. In this report, interferon alfacon 1 was examined for inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV on human lung carcinoma epithelial Calu-3 cell line and the other three African green monkey kidney epithelial cell lines. Interferon alfacon 1 demonstrated significant antiviral activity in neutral red uptake assay and virus yield reduction assay. The data might provide an important insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV allowing further development of antiviral therapies for treating SARS infections.

As the time for finding a definitive and safe cure as a vaccine for novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is still far, there is need to study in depth about the other potential drugs, which can save millions of lives due to Covid-19 pandemic. Right at the center of the debate is the use of drug “Hydroxychloroquine” as a prophylaxis as well as a treatment strategy against Covid-19 in conjunction with azithromycin. In this review, we will study the cellular and molecular aspects of hydroxychloroquine, which had driven its use in Covid-19 patients, as well as its chemistry and pharmacokinetics along with clinical trials going on worldwide using hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19.

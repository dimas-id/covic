Abstract With the development of information society and network technology, people increasingly depend on information found on the Internet. At the same time, the models of information diffusion on the Internet are changing as well. However, these models experience the problem due to the fast development of network technologies. There is no thorough research in regards to the latest models and their applications and advantages. As a result, it is essential to have a comprehensive study of information diffusion models. The primary goal of this research is to provide a comparative study on the existing models such as the Ising model, Sznajd model, SIR model, SICR model, Game theory and social networking services models. We discuss several of their applications with the existing limitations and further categorizations. Vulnerabilities and privacy challenges of information diffusion models are extensively explored. Furthermore, categorization including strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Finally, limitations and recommendations are suggested with diverse solutions for the improvement of the information diffusion models and envisioned future research directions.

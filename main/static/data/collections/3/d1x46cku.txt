Future viral outbreaks are a major threat to societal and economic development throughout the world. A rapid, sensitive and easy-to-use test for viral infections is essential to prevent and control such viral pandemics. Furthermore, a compact, portable device is potentially very useful in remote or developing regions without easy access to sophisticated laboratory facilities. In this report we discuss the application of a Young interferometer sensor device for ultrasensitive and real-time detection of viruses. The essential innovation in this technique is the combination of an integrated optical interferometric sensor with antibody-antigen recognition approaches to yield very sensitive, rapid virus detection. The technology is amenable to miniaturization and mass production and, thus, has significant potential to be developed into a handheld, point-of-care device.

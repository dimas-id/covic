PURPOSE This study was designed to determine the feasibility and safety of ultrasound-guided transhepatic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of masses in the right kidney. METHODS Between June 2001 and December 2011, 18 patients who underwent transhepatic renal RFA procedures to treat 19 tumors were retrospectively identified. Complications (Clavien-Dindo classification system) and local tumor control were evaluated for all patients. RESULTS Median maximal diameter of the treated renal tumors was 1.9 (range 1.1-4.3) cm. No major complication developed during any of the procedures. No hepatic tumor seeding was identified during imaging follow-up. There was a single technical failure (5.3%). Median cross-sectional imaging follow-up was 28 (range 3-121) months. Primary technique failure (local recurrence) occurred in 1 of the 16 tumors with follow-up imaging (5.3%). CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous ultrasound-guided transhepatic RFA of renal neoplasms is technically feasible, effective, and associated with a low rate of complications. The transhepatic approach may allow safe ablation of renal tumors that would otherwise be difficult to treat.

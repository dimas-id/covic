This narrative review describes the existing body of evidence supporting the potential role of oral rinses in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV2. Multiple sources were searched for evidence including PubMed, Researchgate and Google Scholar. References that were identified were then investigated further to find additional source material and the original primary research. Academic and clinical experts were consulted for additional input on virology, immunology, lipid biochemistry, microbicides as well as dental and clinical practice. The authors also collaborated with a number of commercial companies to acquire information on the specific formulations of oral rinses, information not available within the public domain. There were no restrictions on language for the search strategy.

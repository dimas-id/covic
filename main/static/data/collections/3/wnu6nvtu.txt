Background There is a critical need for effective therapies that are immediately available to control the spread of COVID-19 disease. In this study, we assessed currently marketed intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products for antibodies against human common coronaviruses that may cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methods Gamunex®-C and Flebogamma® DIF (Grifols) IVIG were tested against several betacoronaviruses antigens using ELISA techniques: HCoV (undetermined antigen), HCoV-HKU1 (N protein), SARS-CoV (culture lysate), MERS-CoV (N protein; S1 protein/RBD; S protein), and SARS-CoV-2 (S1 protein). Results Both IVIG products showed consistent reactivity to components of the tested viruses. Positive cross-reactivity was seen in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. For SARS-CoV-2, positive reactivity was observed at IVIG concentrations ranging from 100 μg/mL with Gamunex-C to 1 mg/mL with Flebogamma 5% DIF. Conclusion Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF IVIG contain antibodies reacting against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. These preparations may be useful for immediate treatment of COVID-19 disease.

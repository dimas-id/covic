Iatrogenic acute dissection of ascending aorta following coronary angiography and percutaneous intervention is a rare complication. Most reports involve localized aortic dissections as a complication of cannulation of a coronary artery with propagation into the ascending aorta. It is usually treated by sealing the intima with a stent in the ostium of the coronary artery or conservative management, while extensive dissections may require a surgical intervention. We describe a case of the subclavian dissection extending into the ascending aorta that occurred during diagnostic catheterization using the radial approach. The patient was successfully treated utilizing conservative management.

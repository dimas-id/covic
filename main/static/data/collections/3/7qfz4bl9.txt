The aim is to test the claim made in the Introduction to this volume that Britain has a unique tabloid culture that combines on a single platform a range of serious and trivial elements, from international news and investigative journalism to sex and gossip. The three most prominent stories from the digital editions of five tabloids—the Sun, the Star, the Mirror, the Mail and the Express—were checked between 16.30 and 17.30 GMT on Friday 24 January 2020. It was found that all five tabloids gave adequate coverage to what Reuters considered the main item of international news that afternoon, and two prioritised serious articles that were critical of the British government. However, sensationalised and frivolous pieces also featured among the most prominent posts, which confirmed the eclectic nature of tabloid content.

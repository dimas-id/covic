A 6-year-old neutered male, Golden retriever presented with regurgitation and excitement-induced coughing. Two years prior, extra-thoracic tracheal collapse was diagnosed and extra-luminal tracheal ring prostheses were placed. Radiographs at presentation showed mineralized and undulant cervical tracheal cartilages. A dorsally broad-based soft tissue opacity bulged into the caudal cervical tracheal lumen. Esophageal dysmotility and barium accumulation were identified at this level on contrast esophography. Computed tomography showed migration of a prosthetic tracheal ring, resulting in perforation of the esophagus. Hair, foreign material, and dynamic tracheal narrowing were identified on esophagoscopy and tracheoscopy, respectively. Esophagostomy and foreign body removal were performed.

INTRODUCTION This paper describes adverse events (AEs) temporally associated to the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine observed in a reference center in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, during a 2010 mass vaccination campaign. METHODS A retrospective study involving persons who sought medical care for AEs following influenza vaccination. Data were retrieved from medical records, vaccine AE notification forms, and a computerized system for immunobiological registration. RESULTS Sixty-six vaccinees sought medical care for AEs after immunization. The most frequent AEs were fever, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. No serious AEs were reported. CONCLUSIONS Few vaccinees spontaneously reported AEs to influenza A (H1N1) vaccine at this center.

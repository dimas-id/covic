A rapid, accurate, specific, repeatable and robust HPTLC method for the determination of lycorine in different Amaryllidaceae plant extracts is presented in this work. No article related to the HPTLC determination of lycorine in plant extracts has been reported in literature. Lycorine, a common alkaloid of family Amaryllidaceae, moreover, there have been some recent reports which reveal the interaction of lycorine with DNA and tRNA. It has, therefore, been to the interest of phytochemists to determine the content of this alkaloid in Amaryllidaceaous plants.

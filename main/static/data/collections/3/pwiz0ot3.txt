In April 2009 the first pandemic of the 21st century developed within a few weeks starting from Mexico. Its first wave reached Germany in autumn 2009 and was responsible for 1.8–3.5 million additional medical consultations. For the public health sector, this pandemic was one of the largest challenges of the last few decades. As a contribution to broader evaluations on national and international level, the Robert Koch Institute invited representatives from different professions involved in the pandemic response to participate in a workshop on 22–23 March 2010. This workshop was structured in short presentations, group work, and plenary discussions. Main experiences were that (a) pandemic preparedness was helpful, (b) the early warning systems were reliable, (c) vaccines were available within a few months, however, in limited amounts. Need for improvement was discussed for (a) effectiveness of vaccination logistics, (b) mechanisms for the reimbursement of the cost of vaccination, (c) availability of surveillance and monitoring systems, (d) integration of physicians in decision-making processes and health education, and (e) proactive communication strategies. Investments in the above mentioned areas can help to improve public health protection in the future.

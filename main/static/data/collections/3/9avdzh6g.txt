Infodemiology is the process of mining unstructured and textual data so as to provide public health officials and policymakers with valuable information regarding public health. The appearance of this new data source, which was previously unimaginable, has opened up a new way in which to improve public health systems, resulting in better communication policies and better detection systems. However, the unstructured nature of the Internet, along with the complexity of the infectious disease domain, prevents the information extracted from being easily understood. Moreover, when dealing with languages other than English, for which some of the most common Natural Language Processing resources are not available, the correct exploitation of this data becomes even more difficult. We intend to fill these gaps proposing an ontology-driven aspect-based sentiment analysis with which to measure the general publicâ€™s opinions as regards infectious diseases when expressed in Spanish by employing a case study of tweets concerning the Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in Latin America. Our proposal is based on two technologies. We first use ontologies in order to model the infectious disease domain with concepts such as risks, symptoms, transmission methods or drugs, among other concepts. We then measure the relationship between these concepts in order to determine the degree to which one concept influences other concepts. This new information is subsequently applied in order to build an aspect-based sentiment analysis model based on statistical and linguistic features. This is done by applying deep-learning models. Our proposal is available on a web platform, where users can see the sentiment for each concept at a glance and analyse how each concept influences the sentiment of the others.

BACKGROUND The purpose of this paper is to introduce a robotic assisted approach to extralevator abdominoperineal excision in the modified Lloyd-Davis position with reconstruction of the perineum using pedicled gracilis flaps, and to discuss outcomes in a cohort of six patients. METHODS Data was collected by chart review on six patients who underwent extralevator excision with gracilis flap reconstruction from 10/2013 to 06/2015. Technical details, operative data, oncologic outcomes, and wound healing complications were evaluated. RESULTS There were no instances of intraoperative perforation or positive circumferential resection margin, and one case of locoregional recurrence. Two patients experienced flap venous congestion and one patient developed a perineal abscess. All patients went on to complete healing. CONCLUSIONS The combination of a minimally invasive robotic assisted extralevator abdominoperineal excision performed in the modified Lloyd-Davis position with reconstruction of the perineum with pedicled gracilis flaps has excellent oncologic outcomes and acceptable wound healing complications.

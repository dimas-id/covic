In this article, we develop a mathematical model considering susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptotic, quarantine/isolation and recovered classes as in case of COVID-19 disease. The facility of quarantine/isolation have been provided to both exposed and infected classes. Asymptotic individuals either recovered without undergo treatment or moved to infected class after some duration. We have formulated the reproduction number for the proposed model. Elasticity and sensitivity analysis indicates that model is more sensitive towards the transmission rate from exposed to infected classes rather than transmission rate from susceptible to exposed class. Analysis of global stability for the proposed model is studied through Lyapunovâ€™s function.

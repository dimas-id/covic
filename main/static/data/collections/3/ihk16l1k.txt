AIMS To prove the efficacy and safety of renal sympathetic denervation as a new treatment option for patients suffering from resistant hypertension in a real-world setting. METHODS AND RESULTS This single-centre real-world registry included 93 patients who underwent renal denervation employing the Symplicity system. Patients were followed for six months. The patient cohort was divided into early responders with a reduction of office systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg three months after the procedure (n=53, 57%), late responders (six months after the procedure, n=16, 17%) and non-responders (n=24, 26%). After six months, systolic blood pressure was lowered by 46±2.9 mmHg (mean±SEM, p<0.001), 31±3.4 mmHg (p<0.001) and 7.1±3.3 mmHg (p=0.79, ns), respectively. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring also showed a significant reduction in the early responder group (20±5.7 mmHg, p=0.002). We subjected eight patients to a re-do procedure which led to a significant reduction of blood pressure in another five patients after six months (63%). One patient in this cohort developed a one-sided renal artery stenosis associated with an increase in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS This real-world analysis of renal sympathetic denervation confirms the procedure to be safe and efficient in the majority of patients. Non-responders may profit from a second ablation, arguing in favour of the hypothesis that the procedure did not destroy sufficient amounts of sympathetic innervation in these patients. However, repeated denervations may also increase side effects.

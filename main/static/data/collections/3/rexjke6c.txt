In summary, this chapter reviews the principles of how the current and routine tests detect adventitious agents, and reviews how novel and emerging methods differ in their detection principles. These facets may permit novel methods to emerge to supplement, refine, or replace the routine methods. We have suggested a framework for risk assessment to assure biosafety in vaccines and suggested quantitative modeling to help crystallize thinking about the place of testing, either routine or novel, in this assurance. We assert that testing for adventitious agents should not be the sole basis on which product biosafety is assured. Appropriate sourcing and quality control of raw and starting materials, adherence to principles of Good Manufacturing Practices, including environmental and personnel monitoring and process validation, and finally, testing as verification are the package needed for maximal assurance of biosafety. Thus, a pathway forward to a new paradigm for adventitious agent testing exists in which detection of a broader array of potential adventitious agents might be included in the testing, with adequate sensitivity to provide the needed assurance of verification that there has been no catastrophic breach, in the context of the overall process, design, and adherence to cGMP. Furthermore, it is our hope that we may be able to implement the 3 Rs policy to reduce, replace, and/or refine the use of animals in product safety testing, at the same time that we provide greater assurance of the biosafety of vaccines.

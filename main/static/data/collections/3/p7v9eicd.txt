Abstract Smart campus is an emerging trend that allows educational institutions to combine smart technologies with physical infrastructure for improved services, decision making, campus sustainability etc. Under the umbrella of smart campus, various solutions have been implemented on campus levels such as smart microgrid, smart classrooms, controlling visual and thermal properties of the buildings, taking students attendance through face recognition/smart cards and so forth. Though these small-scale solutions contribute in parts to the realization of a smart campus, a generic model for smart campus is yet to be established. In this work, we study existing literature and propose a sketch of smart campus based on the smart city concepts. We create a list of smart campus initiatives that can be prioritized as per a university needs and geographical location. The work aims at propagating and providing an insight to the administration of higher educational institutions in evaluating and positioning their existing infrastructure against the smart campus concept. Whilst the vision, available resources and strategic goals of a university may emphasis on a different set of initiatives, in most of the cases, the generic model established in this work for a smart campus remains valid.

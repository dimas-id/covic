Swyer-James syndrome was first described in 1953 as unilateral pulmonary emphysema in a 6-year-old boy. The characteristic feature of this syndrome is unilateral pulmonary hyperlucency on a chest X-ray film. Typical symptoms include recurrent chest infections, chronic cough, wheezing, and exertional dyspnea. Although there have been a few reports of pneumothorax in patients with Swyer-James syndrome, there have been no reports about an association with giant bullae. Here, we report a case of Swyer-James syndrome associated with a giant bulla and asthma, in which surgery achieved marked improvement of dyspnea.

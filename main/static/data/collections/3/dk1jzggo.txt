BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM Cannulation of the native papilla in surgically altered anatomy is difficult in endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). There are limited data regarding the success of single-balloon enteroscopy-assisted ERC (SBE-ERC) in patients with a native papilla and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Use of a plastic cap may assist cannulation in these cases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the use of SBE-ERC with a cap (Cap-SBE-ERC) in patients with surgically altered anatomy referred for ERC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with surgically altered anatomy (hepaticojejunostomy, gastric bypass surgery, and Whipple's surgery) who underwent Cap-SBE-ERC were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Outcomes were diagnostic and procedural success. Patients with a native papilla were compared with those with a biliary-enteric anastomosis. RESULTS Among 56 patients with surgically altered anatomy, high rates of diagnostic and procedural success were observed (78.6 % and 71.4 %, respectively). High diagnostic and procedural success rates of 72.7 % and 65.9 %, respectively, were also observed for patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy with a native papilla (n = 44). CONCLUSION High rates of diagnostic and procedural success were reported for SBE-ERC with the use of a cap, including a large subgroup of patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and a native papilla.

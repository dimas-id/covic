To meet with the increasing demand for food, the scale of world food production is increasing, as is the transport of animals and food products. At the same time, the contact of animals with the environment remains unchanged or, in the case of free-ranging animals, is even increasing. A number of microorganisms have established themselves in farmed animals, which although relatively harmless to animals are pathogenic to man. In this article, the options for reducing the risk of transferring zoonotic agents from animals (particularly farm animals) to man using veterinary vaccines against viral and bacterial diseases are described.

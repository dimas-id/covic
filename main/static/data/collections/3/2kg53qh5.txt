Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) isoforms, including Cav-1α and Cav-1β, were identified as integral membrane proteins and the major components of caveolae. Cav-1 proteins are highly conserved during evolution from {itCaenorhabditis elegans} to human and are capable of interacting with many signaling molecules through their caveolin scaffolding domains to regulate the activities of multiple signaling pathways. Thus, Cav-1 plays crucial roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a cell-specific and contextual manner. In addition, Cav-1 is essential for embryonic development of vertebrates owing to its regulation of BMP, Wnt, TGF-β and other key signaling molecules. Moreover, Cav-1 is mainly expressed in terminally differentiated cells and its abnormal expression is often associated with human diseases, such as tumor progression, cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, lung regeneration, and diseases related to virus. In this review, we will further discuss the potential of Cav-1 as a target for disease therapy and multiple drug resistance.

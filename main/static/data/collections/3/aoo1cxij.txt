The current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is known to cause severe infection (COVID-19) in patients with comorbidities, particularly cancer or an immunosuppressed state. Most healthcare systems in the country are likely to be overwhelmed soon if the pandemic moves to a stage of community transmission. Currently, limited evidence is available for managing patients with hematological disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current review summarises the possible challenges clinicians are likely to face, key considerations to guide decision making, and possible solutions to the anticipated challenges. Disease specific recommendations and possible guidance for decision making have been suggested for most hematologic diseases that are feasible in our health setup. It is not meant to replace individual clinical judgment, but to provide a template to formulate local policies.

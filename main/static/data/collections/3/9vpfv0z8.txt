We read with interest the classification of cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) by C. Galván Casas et al.(1) In particular, vesicular eruptions are characterized as monomorphic vesicles, involving the trunk, happening early in the course of the disease, and occasionally preceding other symptoms(1‐3). However, investigations to exclude other causes of widespread vesicular eruption, in particular, varicella, were absent. In our clinical experience to date, we have had four patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection presenting with vesicular eruptions, which were subsequently confirmed to be true varicella with microbiological and serological investigations.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are viruses widely known to cause severe respiratory distress due to the prominent clinical symptoms presented. These symptoms, which include fever and dry cough, are frequently found in individuals with CoV infection. Neurological manifestations of CoV have often been neglected; however, recent studies have reported neurological consequences of CoV infection. Here, we review these literatures and discuss the neurologic impact of CoV while highlighting potential implications of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system. We also discuss the possible routes by which these viruses invade the nervous system and the mechanism by which they may induce neurological damage.

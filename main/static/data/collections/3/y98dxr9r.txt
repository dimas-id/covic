Background Postsurgical clipping aneurysm recurrences or residuals can be difficult to manage with either traditional open microsurgical approaches or endosaccular coiling. Endoluminal parent vessel reconstruction with flow diversion may be an ideal method for treating these recurrences by avoiding reoperative surgery or intraprocedural aneurysm rupture with aneurysm access. Method We retrospectively reviewed a single-center aneurysm database identifying all anterior communicating artery (ACom) region aneurysms with recurrences after microsurgical clipping. Cases subsequently treated with Pipeline embolization device (PED) were identified for analysis. Results Nine PED neurointerventions were performed for the treatment of 6 ACom region recurrent aneurysms after surgical clipping (ACom, n = 4 and A1-A2 junction, n = 2). Of the 6 aneurysms treated, 4 were previously ruptured. Mean patient age was 59.5 ± 6.9 years (range 50-67 years). Mean aneurysm size was 5.1 ± 2.2 mm (range 3-9 mm). Mean fluoroscopy time was 44.1 ± 12.4 min. A single PED, deployed from ipsilateral A2 to ipsilateral A1, was used in 6 cases. No instances of periprocedural complications were encountered. Angiographic follow-up was available in all aneurysms; 5 of these 6 (83%) demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion. Conclusion Flow diversion with PED can be a safe and efficacious treatment approach for recurrent ACom region aneurysms after surgical clipping.

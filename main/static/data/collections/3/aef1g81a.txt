A growing body of evidence indicates that patients with cardiovascular complications are at a higher risk for developing severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) (1).

Antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPL), that are essential markers for antiphospholipid syndrome, are considered as a cardiovascular risk factor.

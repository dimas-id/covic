This chapter focuses on the second viroid family, whose members are also referred to as hammerhead viroids, taking into account their most outstanding feature. If the word “small” is the first to come to mind when considering viroids, perhaps the second word is “hammerhead,” because this class of ribozymes, which because of its structural simplicity has an enormous biotechnological potential, is described in avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) as well as in a viroid-like satellite RNA. The most outstanding feature of the Avsunviroidae members is their potential to adopt hammerhead structures in both polarity strands and to self-cleave in vitro accordingly. Viroids differ from viruses not only in their genome size but also in other fundamental aspects, prominent among which is the lack of messenger activity of both viroid RNAs and their complementary strands.

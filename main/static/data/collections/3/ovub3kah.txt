Increased testing for Covid-19 is seen as one of the most important steps to re-open the economy. The current paper considers Tennessee's"open-testing"policy where the state substantially increased testing while removing symptom requirements for individuals to be tested. To understand the effect of the policy, we combine standard identifying assumptions with additional weak assumptions to deal with non-random testing that lead to bounds on policy effects of interest. Our results suggest that Tennessee's open-testing policy has reduced total cases (which are not fully observed), confirmed cases, and trips to work among counties with a fast-growing number of confirmed cases.

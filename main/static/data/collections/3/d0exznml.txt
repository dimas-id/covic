A prepared airway practitioner performs safe airway management, displaying skill, knowledge, and a full awareness of human factors, within a culture of safety. The education of prepared practitioners should include deliberate practice and distributed learning and should aim for expertise rather than mere competence. Translational outcomes from improved education and training can significantly decrease patient morbidity and mortality.

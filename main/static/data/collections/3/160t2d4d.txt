BACKGROUND We previously developed a novel non-trans thoracic esophagectomy, the single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for the radical esophagectomy of esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study was to report its therapeutic efficacy and safety. METHODS From May 2016 to August 2017, we have completed 80 cases of radical resection of esophageal carcinoma using this novel surgical technique. The intraoperative findings and postoperative complications were reported. RESULTS The operation was successfully performed in all patients except for one patient switched from laparoscopic-assisted operation to open surgery. The mean operation duration was 191.4 ± 27 min, and the mean intraoperative blood loss was 147.3 ± 28.9 mL. The mean number of removed lymph node was 21.9 ± 4.1. Five patients (6.4%) who had preoperative type I respiratory failure needed to stay in the intensive care unit for 24 h postoperatively. Postoperative complications included anastomotic leakage (8.9%), anastomotic stricture (21.25%), pleural effusion (9%), and hoarseness postoperative hoarseness (18.8%). The incidence of hoarseness at 3 months postoperation was reduced to 3.8%. All the complications were Clavien-Dindo grades I-III. There were no perioperative death and postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. CONCLUSION These results showed that the single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy is feasible for radical esophagectomy and possesses good therapeutic efficacy and safety.

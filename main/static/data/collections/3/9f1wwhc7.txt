Serum samples from 58 mountain lions (Felis concolor) in California (USA) were collected between April 1987 and February 1990. Nineteen serum samples were used for serum biochemistry determinations; the ranges were similar to reference values in domestic cats, captive exotic felidae and free-ranging mountain lions. A serological survey was conducted to determine whether antibodies were present against selected infectious agents. Fifty-four (93%) of 58 sera had antibodies against feline panleukopenia virus. Fifteen (68%) of 22, 16 (28%) of 58, 11 (19%) of 58, and 10 (17%) of 58 had serum antibodies against feline reovirus, feline coronavirus, feline herpes virus, and feline calicivirus, respectively. Twenty-three (40%) of 58 and 21 (58%) of 36 had serum antibodies against Yersinia pestis and Toxoplasma gondii, respectively. Only one of 22 sera had antibodies against the somatic antigen of Dirofilaria immitis. Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus antigens were not detected in any mountain lion's sera. All 58 sera samples were negative for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus and Chlamydia psittaci.

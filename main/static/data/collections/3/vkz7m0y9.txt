OBJECTIVE To compare the surgical outcomes of stapled and handsewn closures in loop ileostomies. METHODS The data of 225 patients requiring loop ileostomies from 2002 to 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients underwent partial small-bowel resections and either handsewn or stapled anastomoses for the ileostomy closures. They were followed up postoperatively with routine surgical examinations. RESULTS The study group consisted of 124 men and 101 women with a mean age of 49.12 years. The ileostomy closure was performed with handsewn in 129 patients and with stapled in 96 patients. The mean time to the first postoperative flatus was 2.426 days in the handsewn group and 2.052 days in the stapled group (p <0.05). The mean time to the first postoperative defecation was 3.202 days in the handsewn group and 2.667 days in the stapled group (p <0.05). The mean duration of patient hospital stay was 8.581 days for the handsewn group and 6.063 days for the stapled group (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent ileostomy closure with stapled recovered faster in the postoperative period and required shorter hospital stays than those whose closures were performed with handsewn. In our opinion, stapled should be considered the gold standard for loop ileostomy closures.

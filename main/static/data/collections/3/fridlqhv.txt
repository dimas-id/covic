The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory disease that is spreading worldwide necessitating to have an accurate diagnosis system that accurately predicts infections. As data mining classifiers can greatly assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of diseases in general. In this paper, classifier model performance for two classification types: (1) binary and (2) multi-class were tested on a MERS-CoV dataset that consists of all reported cases in Saudi Arabia between 2013 and 2017. A cross-validation model was applied to measure the accuracy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that SVM and Decision Tree classifiers achieved the highest accuracy of 86.44% for binary classification based on healthcare personnel class. On the other hand, for multiclass classification based on city class, the decision tree classifier had the highest accuracy among the remaining classifiers; although it did not reach a satisfactory accuracy level (42.80%). This work is intended to be a part of a MERS-CoV prediction system to enhance the diagnosis of MERS-CoV disease.

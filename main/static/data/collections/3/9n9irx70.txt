A variety of predisposing factors have been associated with serious illness and death from COVID-19. Understanding the distribution of risks associated with these factors by local communities can provide important opportunities for targeting interventions. We characterize the distribution of risk for COVID-19 mortality for populations at large across 442 US cities, by utilizing recently published estimates of risk associated with age, gender, ethnicity, social deprivation and 12 health conditions from a very large UK-based study, combined with the information available on prevalence and co-occurrence of these factors in the US through a variety of population-based public databases. We estimate that across all the cities, an underlying weighted risk-score can identify a total of approximately 12.65 million, 4.09 million and 1.34 million individuals who are at 2-, 5- and 10-fold higher risk, respectively, compared to the average risk for the US population. The percentage of population which exceed the respective risk thresholds varies across the cities in the range (1st-99th percentile), 3.6%-20.1%, 0.7%-8.0% and 0.1%-3.2%, respectively. The percentage of deaths within a city that are expected to occur above these risk-thresholds varies in the range of 20.1%-53.5%, 8.5%-38.2% and 2.9%-25.4%, respectively. Our analysis can provide guidance to national and local policy makers regarding resources needed to protect the most vulnerable populations in these communities, and how much utility such interventions may have in reducing the total population burden of death.

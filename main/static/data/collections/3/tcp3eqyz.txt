A 78-year-old man underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer (pT3N0M0). Multiple port sites were used, including a 10 mm port for a videoscope at the umbilical point and three other working ports. During the six-month follow-up evaluation, a 2 cm enhancing mass confined to the muscle layer was found 12 mm from the right lower quadrant port site, suggesting a metastatic or desmoid tumor. Follow-up computed tomography imaging two months later showed that the mass had increased in size to 3.5 cm. We confirmed that there was no intra-abdominal metastasis by diagnostic laparoscopy and then performed a wide resection of the recurrent mass. The histologic findings revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, suggesting a metastatic mass from the stomach cancer. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient completed adjuvant chemotherapy with TS-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium). There was no evidence of tumor recurrence during the 50-month follow-up period.

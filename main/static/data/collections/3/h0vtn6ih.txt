OBJECTIVE In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of sacrocolpopexy and retropubic midurethral sling, or transvaginal tape (TVT) procedure, on overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. Our null hypothesis was that concomitant sacrocolpopexy and TVT exacerbate OAB symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective cohort study. All subjects had apical/anterior prolapse and underwent robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy and TVT, with or without concomitant hysterectomy. All subjects completed a standardized one-year follow-up between 2009 and 2014. To assess for OAB symptoms, we used the Urogenital Distress Inventory subscale questions #15 and/or question #16. Reponses to these questions are based on a five-point 0 to 4 Likert scale (0 represents a negative response or no symptoms, and 4 represents the most problems). Any patient who answered 1 or higher on the Likert scale, either on the frequency or urge incontinence question, was defined as having OAB symptoms. RESULTS Sixty-six subjects completed 12 months of visits. Preoperatively, 54 patients (83%) had OAB symptoms, and postoperatively 29 patients (45%) had OAB symptoms (p<0.001). Patients with postoperative OAB had a lower patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I) scores, PGI-I 5.8 with OAB, and PGI-I 6.6 without OAB (p<0.003). CONCLUSION We found that sacrocolpopexy and concomitant retropubic midurethral sling does not contribute to additive OAB symptoms, and symptoms actually resolved in 38% of women in our cohort. The presence of postoperative OAB contributes to lower global impression of improvement.

A new tool of the classification of DNA sequences is introduced. The method is based on 2D-dynamic graphs and their descriptors. Using the descriptors created by centers of masses, moments of inertia, angles between the x axis and the principal axis of inertia of the 2D-dynamic graphs one can obtain classification diagrams in which similar sequences are clustered in separated areas.

We estimated the fraction and timing of presymptomatic transmissions of COVID19 with mathematical models combining the available data of the incubation period and serial interval. We found that up to 79.7% transmissions could be presymptomatic among the imported cases in China outside Wuhan. The average timing of presymptomatic transmissions is 3.8 days (SD = 6.1) before the symptom onset, which is much earlier than previously assumed.

Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Several case series from Italy and China have highlighted the lung ultrasound findings of this disease process and may demonstrate its clinical utility during the current pandemic Case Report: We present a case of a COVID-19 patient who presented to the emergency department twice within a 24-hour period with rapidly progressing illness A multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) evaluation was used on the return visit and assisted clinical decision-making Discussion: A multi-organ POCUS exam allows for quick assessment of acute dyspnea in the emergency department As the lung involvement of COVID-19 is primarily a peripheral process it is readily identifiable via lung ultrasound We believe that when applied efficiently and safely a POCUS exam can reduce clinical uncertainty and potentially limit the use of other imaging modalities when treating patients with COVID-19 Conclusion: This case highlights the utility of an early multiorgan point-of-care assessment for patients presenting with moderate respiratory distress during the severe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

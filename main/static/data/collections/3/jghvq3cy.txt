Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). After its first occurrence in Wuhan of China from December 2019, COVID‐19 rapidly spread around the world. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is one of the important reason causing death of COVID‐19 patients and appeared in many patients. However, cases of COVID‐19 with immune thrombocytopenic purpura were very rare. Here, a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura in Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was reported, whose laboratory data, clinical treatment and hospital outcome was described in this study. Fortunately, immune thrombocytopenic purpura with COVID‐19 of the patient was diagnosed and treated in time and cured eventually. This case illustrates the need to be vigilant for complications associated with COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

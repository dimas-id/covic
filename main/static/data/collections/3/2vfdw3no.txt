BACKGROUND: Lung recruitment at birth has been advocated as an effective method of improving the respiratory transition at birth. Sustained inflations (SI) and dynamic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were assessed in clinical and animal studies to define the optimal level. Our working hypothesis was that very low gestational age infants (VLGAI) < 32 weeks’ gestation require an individualized lung recruitment based on combining both manoeuvers. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2016, 91 and 72 inborn VLGAI, requiring a respiratory support beyond a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) = 5 cmH2O, were enrolled before and after introducing these manoeuvers based on progressive increase in SI up to 15 s, with simultaneous gradual increase in PEEP up to 15 cmH2O, according to the cardiorespiratory response. Retrospective comparisons of the incidence of mechanical ventilation (MV) < 72 h of life, short-term and before discharge morbidity were then performed. RESULTS: Among extremely low gestational age infants (ELGAI) < 29 weeks’ gestation, the following outcomes decreased significantly: intubation (90 to 55%) and surfactant administration (54 to 12%) in the delivery room, MV (92 to 71%) and its mean duration < 72 h of life (45 h to 13 h), administration of a 2nd dose of surfactant (35 to 12%) and postnatal corticosteroids (52 to 19%), and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (23 to 5%). Among VLGAI, all of these results were also significant. Neonatal mortality and morbidity were not different. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, combining two individualized lung recruitment maneuvers at birth was feasible and may be beneficial on short-term and before discharge pulmonary outcomes. A randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these results.

Background Despite a lack of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected COVID-19. Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods and Results We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett's) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc ≥500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc ≥550 ms (if QRS ≥120 ms) and b) increased QTc of ≥60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62±17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448±29 ms and increased to 459±36 ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18±43 ms vs -0.2±28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination vs. azithromycin (17±39 vs. 0.5±40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions Overall 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients should be carefully assessed.

India is one of the worst affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic at present. We studied publicly available data of the Covid-19 patients in India and analyzed possible impacts of quarantine and social distancing within the stochastic framework of the SEQIR model to illustrate the controlling strategy of the pandemic. Our simulation results clearly show that proper quarantine and social distancing should be maintained from an early time just at the start of the pandemic and should be continued till its end to effectively control the pandemic. This calls for a more socially disciplined lifestyle in this perspective in future. The demographic stochasticity, which is quite visible in the system dynamics, has a critical role in regulating and controlling the pandemic.

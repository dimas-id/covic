Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an important demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, the aetiology of which is thought to have a possible viral component. In this study we investigated the possible involvement in MS of two herpes viruses: the neurotropic human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) and the related human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Utilising fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) techniques, we examined human post mortem tissues for the presence of immediate early and late viral gene or protein expression in MS patient normal appearing white matter (NAWM), lesional tissue and normal control brain samples. HHV-7 and/or HHV-8 mRNA or protein was detected in some individuals in all three sample categories and was restricted to oligodendrocytes, as determined by double mRNA FISH analysis or immuno fluorescence (IF). No samples showed evidence of viral mRNA when subjected to RT-PCR on extracted ribonucleic acid. We therefore conclude that there is little evidence in our particular sample cohort to suggest involvement of either HHV-7 or HHV-8 in MS.

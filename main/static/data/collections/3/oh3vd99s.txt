The initial lung lesions in two calves intrabronchially inoculated with Haemophilus somnus are described. The animals were euthanized within 7 h after challenge. The in situ location of H. somnus and accompanying lesions were examined by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Inoculation with H. somnus resulted in the development of acute pulmonary lesions within 3.5 h. H. somnus antigen was demonstrated only within the luminal spaces of the airways and in one area of bronchio‚Äêassociated lymphoid tissue (BALT). As observed by TEM, the bacteria were phagocytized by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Antigen was never demonstrated in the pulmonary intravascular macrophages.

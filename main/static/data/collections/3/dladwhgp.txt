The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is causing a pandemic and potentially fatal disease, actually of global public health concern. Viral infections are known to be associated with coagulation impairment thus thrombosis, hemorrhage, or both, may occur. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of coagulation disorders during viral infection is essential for the development of therapeutic strategies. Coagulopathy in COVID-19 infection is emerging as a precipitant factor for severe respiratory complications and death. An increase in coagulation markers such as fibrinogen and D-Dimer has been found in severe COVID-19 cases. Heparin, clinically used as an anticoagulant, has also anti-inflammatory properties including binding of inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, protection of endothelial cells and a potential antiviral effect. We hypothesized that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may attenuate cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients therefore LMWH could be a valid adjunctive therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumopathy. In this paper we review potential mechanisms involved in coagulation impairment following viral infection and the possible role of heparin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

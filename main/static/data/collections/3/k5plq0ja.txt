A key requirement for topical and transdermal active delivery is the effective delivery of an active to a desired target site, to achieve both safe and efficacious outcomes. This chapter seeks to explore the importance of the pharmacological, toxicological and therapeutic properties of actives and excipients, as well as the site of action as complementary components in percutaneous absorption. This is crucial for optimized topical and transdermal product design.

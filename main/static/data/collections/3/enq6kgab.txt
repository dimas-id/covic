Abstract Introduction Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat upper respiratory tract infections/common colds (URTIs) in Asian countries for over 2000 years. However, Chinese medicine doctors (CMDs) follow the traditional treatment rules to select or administer these diverse Chinese medicine formulae. The main purpose of our study was to explore data on the frequency of medication and medication habits by CMDs for the treatment of URTIs with Chinese herbs and Chinese medicine formulae. Methods The TCM treatments for patients consulting with an URTIs were analyzed from the National Health Insurance Research Database using the appropriate codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses for Taiwan in 2009. A data mining and association rules, were used to analyze co-prescriptions of TCM for patients with URTIs. Results For 472,005 patients who sought the treatment of URTIs, a total of 46,805 patients with URTIs received TCM treatments, of these 29,052 patients sought both TCM and Western medication treatments. Of the URTIs patients who had received a TCM treatment, 79% presented with an acute common cold, 9% had influenza, and 9% had acute upper respiratory infections. Furthermore, 53.89% of the sample were aged between 20 and 49 years, and 62.84% were women, 3.56% of the patients used Yin-Qiao-San and 2.76% used Jie-Geng. Yin-Qiao-San and Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang were the most commonly combinations of prescriptions for patients with URTIs. Conclusions The patients experiencing URTIs were more likely to request TCM treatment if their symptoms were mild and they were women. The Chinese medicine doctors treating URTIs generally followed TCM theory. A coding system for TCM diagnostic classifications could improve evaluations of TCM treatments.

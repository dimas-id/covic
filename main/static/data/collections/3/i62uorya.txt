Sulfur (S(VI)) based moieties, especially, the sulfonyl or sulfonamide based analogues have showed a variety of pharmacological properties, and its derivatives propose a high degree of structural diversity that has established useful for the finding of new therapeutic agents. The developments of new less toxic, low cost and highly active sulfonamides containing analogues are hot research topics in medicinal chemistry. Currently, more than 150 FDA approved Sulfur (S(VI))-based drugs are available in the market, and they are widely used to treat various types of diseases with therapeutic power. This comprehensive review highlights the recent developments of sulfonyl or sulfonamides based compounds in huge range of therapeutic applications such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anticonvulsant, antitubercular, antidiabetic, antileishmanial, carbonic anhydrase, antimalarial, anticancer and other medicinal agents. We believe that, this review article is useful to inspire new ideas for structural design and developments of less toxic and powerful Sulfur (S(VI)) based drugs against the numerous death-causing diseases.

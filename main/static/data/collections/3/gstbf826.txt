Drago et al. are right to point out that our paper did not provide data on enanthems.1,2 As the data collection form did not include the description of mucous membranes, they might not have been explored in many patients. We have reported and included in the supplementary material a few cases that were noticed by their doctors and were the first descriptions of enanthem in COVID-19. Given the low number of cases and their nonsystematic acquisition, we avoided any analysis of these data.

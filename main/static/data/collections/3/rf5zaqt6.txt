We previously reported that cells with persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection were established after apoptotic events. In the present study, we investigated the cytopathic effects of dual infection with SARS-CoV and Mycoplasma fermentans on Vero E6 cells. Dual infection completely killed cells and prevented the establishment of persistent SARS-CoV infection. M. fermentans induced inhibition of cell proliferation, but the cells remained alive. Apoptosis was induced easily in M. fermentans-infected cells, indicating that they were primed for apoptosis. These results indicated that M. fermentans enhances apoptosis in surviving cells that have escaped from SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis.

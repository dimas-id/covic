The Neuroform EZ Stent System is a fourth generation intracranial aneurysm stent that utilizes an integrated navigation guidewire. While designed to facilitate stent delivery, the guidewire can rarely impede proper positioning of the stent. In this technical case report, severing the guidewire from the stent delivery system with surgical scissors was required for successful stent implantation.

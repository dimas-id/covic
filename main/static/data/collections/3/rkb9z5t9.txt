Ischemic stroke is devastating and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, only clot retrieval devices and/or intravenous tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) have been approved by the US‐FDA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective treatment for stroke that can have limited shortcomings and broad spectrum of applications. Interferon‐beta (IFN‐β), an endogenous cytokine and a key anti‐inflammatory agent, contributes toward obviating deleterious stroke outcomes. Therefore, exploring the role of IFN‐β may be a promising alternative approach for stroke intervention in the future. In the present review, we have discussed about IFN‐β along with its different mechanistic roles in ischemic stroke. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches targeting the inflammatory cascade with IFN‐β therapy that may be helpful in improving stroke outcome are also discussed.

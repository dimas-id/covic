Point‐of‐care (POC) tests are becoming more available, although the way in which they should be used is currently undecided. Any ‘laboratory’‐based diagnosis of respiratory infections has three components: the specimen taken, the test used, and the interpretation of the results. Each of these components needs to be carefully addressed when using POC tests for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. Given the enthusiasm with which POC tests are being developed, it is likely that they will be used more and more widely. If so, the advantages and limitations of their use should be fully discussed and the implications recognised.

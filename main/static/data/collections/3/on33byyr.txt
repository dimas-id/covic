Abstract A proteomic analysis was performed to screen the potential latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) biomarkers. A training set of spectra was used to generate diagnostic models, and a blind testing set was used to determine the accuracy of the models. Candidate peptides were identified using nano-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionizationâ€“tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the training set results, 3 diagnostic models recognized LTBI subjects with good cross-validation accuracy. In the blind testing set, LTBI subjects could be identified with sensitivities and specificities of 85.20% to 88.90% and 85.7% to 100%, respectively. Additionally, 14 potential LTBI biomarkers were identified, and all proteins were identified for the first time through proteomics in the plasma of healthy, latently infected individuals. In all, proteomic pattern analyses can increase the accuracy of LTBI diagnosis, and the data presented here provide novel insights into potential mechanisms involved in LTBI.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov, COVID) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 quickly escalated into a global health emergency. This study seeks to investigate the attitudinal and behavioral patterns of university students in Wuhan, the epicenter. Conducted in late January 2020, an online survey collected data from more than 8000 students of four elite national universities located in Wuhan. The students sampled included both Wuhan natives and non-locals who returned home in the early stages of the outbreak. The study notes widespread psychological stress among students but positive behavioral compliance with personal hygiene practices. Official announcements were the chief source of information for the respondents, who also demonstrated high demand for transparency of information disclosure. Some highly tight anti-epidemic measures were found at the local level. Albeit aggressive to certain extent, they may be necessary under such critical circumstances. The respondents offered varying evaluations of the performance of central government, local governments, civil society, and the health system in this public health crisis. The article concludes with policy implications and caveats.

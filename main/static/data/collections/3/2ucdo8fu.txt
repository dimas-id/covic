The processes by which the canonical protein synthesis machinery is modified by environmental stresses to allow healthy cells to respond to external conditions to maintain homeostasis, are frequently hijacked by tumour cells to enhance their survival. Two major stress response pathways that play a major role in this regard are the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the DNA damage response (DDR). Recent data have shown that key proteins which coordinate post-transcriptional control, and which are regulated by signalling through the UPR and DDR, are upregulated in cancers and that targeting these proteins/pathways will provide new therapeutic avenues for cancer treatments.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES This study's main aim was to observe the effects of a fibre-enriched nutrition solution on requisite feeding volume, which is directly proportional to energy intake in mechanically ventilated patients with enteral nutrition. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN Some 120 patients who required mechanical ventilation and enteral nutrition with a nasogastric tube were studied. Upon ICU admission, the patient's age, gender, weight, height, comorbidities, diagnosis and APACHE II score were recorded. We assigned two diets to the patients randomly. The control group received the fibre-free nutrition solution. The study group, received the fibreenriched nutrition solution. Prescribed feeding volume and administered feeding volume, gastric residual volume (GRV), volume ratio (VR), diarrhoea score and gastrointestinal complications (GIC) were recorded, along with daily biochemistry. RESULTS The two groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, weight, BMI, APACHE II score, target caloric intake or GRV (p>0.05). On days four and five, the study group had higher VR values (p<0.05). Seventy-one (59%) patients had at least one gastrointestinal complication; 44 (73%) of them were controls and 27 (45%) of them study patients. The most commonly observed GIC was diarrhoea. Thirty-eight patients had diarrhoea in control group, and twenty-two patients had diarrhoea in study group, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups about vomiting and regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that ICU staff initiate enteral nutrition with fibre-enriched formulas rather than fibre-free formulas to avoid frequent feeding interruptions that cause protein energy malnutrition in ICU patients.

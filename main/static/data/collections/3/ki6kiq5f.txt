In this work, we develop an adaptive, near-optimal, 3-Dimensional (3D) to 1D ordering methodology for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, using a space-filling curve (SFC) trajectory, which is adaptive to brainâ€™s shape as captured by MRI. We present the pseudocode of the heuristics for developing the SFC trajectory. We apply this trajectory to functional MRI brain activation maps from a schizophrenia study, compress the data, obtain features, and perform classification of schizophrenia patients vs. normal controls. We compare the classification results with those of a linear ordering trajectory, which has been the traditional method for ordering 3D MRI data to 1D. We report that the adaptive SFC trajectory-based classification performance is superior than the linear ordering trajectory-based classification.

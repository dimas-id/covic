The multimerization/self-interaction of viral proteins is an important step in the process of viral assembly and maturation. Our previous study indicated that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein forms self-multimers through a serine-arginine (SR)-rich motif (SSRSSSRSRGNSR) by using a mammalian two-hybrid system. To determine the biological relevance of this motif, we constructed a SARS-CoV reverse genetic construct by using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based vector controlled by a T7 promoter; and subsequently deleted the SR-rich motif from the N gene. The mutated infectious clone showed reduced level of genome transcription and significantly reduced levels of the infectious virions. These results strongly suggest that the SR-rich motif is critical for effective virus replication.

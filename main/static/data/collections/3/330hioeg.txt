This current volume is, in many ways, a 2020 update to the important 1999–2000 compendium by Sir Fed Hoyle and Professor N. Chandra Wickramasinghe's “Astronomical Origins of life: Steps towards Panspermia.” The emerging new paradigm of biology that connects life on Earth with the wider cosmos is covered in considerable depth showing that terrestrial biological evolution is best understood as a cosmically derived habitat and an interconnected genetic system. The various chapters here discuss all aspects of this interconnectedness, particularly relevant now in this time of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) as the human race reacts to the many microbes and viral pathogens that arrive regularly from space.

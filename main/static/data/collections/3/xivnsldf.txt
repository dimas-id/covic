The organized and characteristic elements of the Golgi complex (GC) are the stacked smooth-surfaced cisternae, which are found in the centrosphere of all eukaryotic cells. These cisternae, in conjunction with other associated smooth-surfaced membranes, are responsible for executing net unidirectional intracellular transport (ICT) from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) toward more distally located structures. This chapter focuses on the broad range of accessory activities that occur during transport, the family of “posttranslational modifications.” These events are, in all likelihood, not essential for the “primary” function of the GC yet they are crucial in allowing the cell to tailor its biosynthetic products for its own needs and the needs of the organism as a whole. In addition to modifying products of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the GC may be involved in processing events because of its participation in other routes of vesicular traffic—for example, centripetal traffic from the cell surface. Various nonequivalent criteria have been used to ascribe processing events to the GC-autoradiography, preparative or analytic subcellular fractionation, interruption by ICT inhibitors, and delay in the impact of cycloheximide.

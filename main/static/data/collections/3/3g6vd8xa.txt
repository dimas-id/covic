An epidemiologic survey was performed to determine the incidence of torovirus infections in 2 disease entities of cattle: diarrhea of replacement calves up to 2 months old, and winter dysentery of adult cattle. Samples were obtained from 187 diarrheal and 115 healthy calves from 15 farms, as well as 149 diarrheal and 67 healthy cows from 27 farms with or without winter dysentery. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for detection of torovirus, rotavirus, and coronavirus antigen in feces, and of torovirus and coronavirus antibodies in serum were used to monitor infections in these groups. Torovirus was detected in 9 of the 15 farms in the study, and in 6% of calves with diarrhea, which was significantly higher than in healthy calves (2%). Seroconversion to torovirus was found significantly more often after winter dysentery episodes than on farms without a disease history; coronavirus seroconversion was less common.

With the entry into force of the Infection Protection Act (IfSG) in 2001, the reporting obligations for infectious diseases and infectious agents were placed on a new foundation. For the first time, a distinction was made between an obligation for the notification of infectious diseases by physicians and a notification obligation for infectious agents by laboratories. The aim was to reduce the notification burden on physicians and thus to improve the quality of the notifications. Since then, numerous new obligations for notifications have been added. The aim of this work is to describe and discuss the mandatory notification of infectious diseases in Germany on the basis of their development – compared to previous regulations in Germany (Federal Communicable Diseases Act) as well as international and Europe-wide recommendations (IHR; decisions of the EU Commission 1999, 2018) – and to submit suggestions for improvement. Regarding the considerable increase in reporting requirements and reports in recent years, and the fact that the IfSG provides other surveillance systems in addition to mandatory reporting, the mandatory reporting system should be focused on the necessary reporting requirements. In a first step, the proposed abolition of the mandatory reporting of noroviruses and rotaviruses could relieve both the notifiers and the health authorities, thus enabling more efficient reporting and more intensive and better investigation by the health authorities.

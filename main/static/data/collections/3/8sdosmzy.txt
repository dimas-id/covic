The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee recommend that all U.S. health-care personnel (HCP) be vaccinated annually against influenza. Nonetheless, influenza vaccination coverage among HCP in the United States has increased slowly over the past decade; during the 2009-10 influenza season, 61.9% of HCP received seasonal influenza vaccination. To update data with estimates from the 2010-11 influenza season, CDC conducted an Internet-based survey of 1,931 HCP who participated in three online survey panels. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which indicated that overall influenza vaccination coverage among HCP was 63.5% during the 2010--11 influenza season, similar to coverage for the 2009-10 season. Among HCP who reported working at a facility where vaccination was required by their employer, 98.1% were vaccinated. Among HCP without such an employer requirement but who were offered vaccination onsite, greater coverage was associated with a personal reminder from the employer to get vaccinated (69.9%), vaccination availability at no cost (67.9%), and vaccination availability for >1 day (68.8%). Influenza vaccination of HCP is needed to protect patients from HCP-transmitted disease. Maximizing influenza vaccination for all HCP is an important part of any comprehensive infection-control program.

Patients presenting with epidemiological risk factors for Ebola virus disease (EVD) and symptoms consistent with the disease require screening with a molecular assay. If the initial test is negative, but the patient has been symptomatic for less than 3 days, a follow-up test is required to reliably exclude the disease. During this time, persons under investigation (PUI) for EVD may have illnesses other than EVD that require further evaluation and management and well-defined processes are essential to the delivery of consistent, high-quality care for these patients while preserving the safety of healthcare providers.

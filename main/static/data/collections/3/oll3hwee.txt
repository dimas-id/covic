BACKGROUND Esophagogastric junction contractile integral (EGJ-CI) assesses EGJ barrier function on esophageal high resolution manometry (HRM). We assessed EGJ-CI values in achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) to determine if postoperative EGJ-CI changes reflected surgical intervention. METHODS Twenty-one achalasia patients (42.8 ± 3.2 years, 62% F) with HRM before and after Heller myotomy (HM) and 68 GERD patients (53.9 ± 1.8 years, 66% F) undergoing antireflux surgery (ARS) were compared to 21 healthy controls (27.6 ± 0.6 years, 52% F). Esophagogastric junction contractile integral (mmHg.cm) was calculated using the distal contractile integral measurement across the EGJ, measured above the gastric baseline and corrected for respiration. Pre and postsurgical EGJ-CI and conventional lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) metrics were compared within and between these groups using non-parametric tests. Correlation between EGJ-CI and conventional LESP metrics was assessed. KEY RESULTS Baseline EGJ-CI was higher in achalasia compared to GERD (p < 0.001) or controls (p = 0.03). Esophagogastric junction contractile integral declined by 59.2% after HM in achalasia (p = 0.001), and increased by 26.3% after ARS in GERD (p = 0.005). End-expiratory and basal LESP decreased by 74.5% and 64.5% with HM, but increased by only 17.8% and 4.3% with ARS. Differences were noted between Dor vs Toupet fundoplication in achalasia (p = 0.007), and partial vs complete ARS in GERD (p = 0.03). Esophagogastric junction contractile integral correlated modestly with both end-expiratory and basal LESP (Pearson's r of 0.8 for all), but was less robust in GERD (0.7). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Esophagogastric junction contractile integral has clinical utility in assessing EGJ barrier function at baseline and after surgical intervention to the EGJ, and could complement conventional EGJ metrics.

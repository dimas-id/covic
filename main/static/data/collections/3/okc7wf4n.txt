BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) regulates the differentiation of Th1, Th2, Th17 cells and Treg cells, which play a critical role in airway inflammation of asthma. Here we investigated the role of ACC in the pathogenesis of asthma. METHODS: Chicken Ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged mice were divided into three groups, PBS group, DMSO (solvent of TOFA) group and ACC inhibitor 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA) + DMSO group. Airway inflammation was assessed with histology, percentages of CD4(+)T cell subsets in lung and spleen was assessed with flow cytometry, and airway responsiveness was assessed with FinePointe RC system. The expression of characteristic transcription factors of CD4(+)T cell subsets was evaluated with real-time PCR. Cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum was determined with ELISA. RESULTS: In asthma mice, the expression of ACC increased, while the expression of phosphorylated ACC (pACC) decreased. TOFA had no significant effect on pACC expression. TOFA reduced serum IgE, airway inflammatory cells infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia, but dramatically increased airway responsiveness. TOFA significantly reduced the percentages of Th1, Th2, Th17 cells in lung and spleen, the expression of GATA3 and RORγt in lung, and IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17A levels in BALF and serum. TOFA had no significant effect on the percentage of Treg cells, IL-10 level and the expression of T-bet and Foxp3. CONCLUSION: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor TOFA might have a distinct effect on asthmatic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness.

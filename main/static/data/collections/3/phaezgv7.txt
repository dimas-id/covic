War metaphors are consistently utilized during times of adversity in popular culture, with the current global pandemic being no exception. This paper discusses use of war analogies to conjure images of bravery and sacrifice, while noting that these images tend to focus exclusively on the negative aspects of war. Taking analogies of war further, this paper expands on how the use of other military strategies and experiences, such as a mission-focused approach, clear leadership, and building resilience may indeed positively impact our global effort to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2.

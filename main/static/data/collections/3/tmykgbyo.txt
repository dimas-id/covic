Covid‐19 pandemic is deeply affecting transplant activity worldwide. It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March‐April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid‐related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid‐19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid‐19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs.

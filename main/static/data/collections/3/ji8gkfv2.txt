BACKGROUND We examine how changes in a surrogate marker of tumour vessel density correlate with response and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. METHODS In metastatic renal cancer patients treated with anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, arterial phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used to simultaneously measure changes in: (a) tumour size, and (b) tumour enhancement (a surrogate marker of tumour vessel density) within individual lesions. RESULTS No correlation between baseline tumour enhancement and lesion shrinkage was observed, but a reduction in tumour enhancement on treatment was strongly correlated with reduction in lesion size (r=0.654, P<0.0001). However, close examination of individual metastases revealed different types of response: (1) good vascular response with significant tumour shrinkage, (2) good vascular response with stabilisation of disease, (3) poor vascular response with stabilisation of disease and (4) poor vascular response with progression. Moreover, contrasting responses between different lesions within the same patient were observed. We also assessed rebound vascularisation in tumours that acquired resistance to treatment. The amplitude of rebound vascularisation was greater in lesions that had a better initial response to therapy (P=0.008). INTERPRETATION Changes in a surrogate marker of tumour vessel density correlate with response and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. The data provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie response and resistance to this class of agent.

Persistent meningeal puncture headache (MPH) is a known complication following both intentional and unintentional puncture of the dura mater. We present a case of persistent MPH following implantation of an intrathecal drug delivery system (IDDS). Two separate epidural blood patches (EBP) were performed under radiographic guidance with contrast visualization of the epidural space on postoperative days 16 and 28, respectively. The case was complicated by the development of a symptomatic lumbar subarachnoid hematoma diagnosed on postoperative day 35. The patient subsequently underwent a laminectomy, evacuation of the hematoma, and explanation of the IDDS. This case illustrates a potential unique morbidity associated with the EBP in a patient with an IDDS. The report concludes with a brief review of MPH followed by a discussion of possible mechanisms underlying this complication.

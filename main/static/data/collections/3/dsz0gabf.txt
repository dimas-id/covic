BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells were treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC), a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog, and the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA and protein were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Poly IC enhanced the expression of MCP-1 and release of mononuclear cell chemotactic activity, which were inhibited by dexamethasone pre-treatment. The poly IC-induced up-regulation of MCP-1 was blocked by 2-aminopurine, a specific inhibitor of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, but not by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitor SN50.

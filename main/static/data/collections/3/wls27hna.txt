A free-ranging adult Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx) captured in Switzerland presented with a severe purulent unilateral conjunctivitis. Chlamydia felis was detected in conjunctival swabs by real-time quantitative PCR. Systemic treatment with oxytetracycline and ketoprofen led to complete recovery. Infection with C. felis has not been previously reported in Eurasian lynx.

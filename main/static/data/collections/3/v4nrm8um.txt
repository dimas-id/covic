Human rhinovirus (HRV) is a nonenveloped, single stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Picornaviridae. HRV infections can cause both upper and lower respiratory illnesses in children and adults. Lower respiratory illnesses are more likely to occur in specific high risk groups, including infants, and children and adults with asthma. The relationships between rates of infection and the risk of clinical illness and exacerbation are not completely understood. Recent studies employing polymerase chain reaction and other molecular techniques indicate that there are new branches on the HRV family tree, and one characteristic of recently detected viruses is that they cannot be detected by standard tissue culture. Here we review the current literature and discuss new advances in understanding the link between HRV and asthma.

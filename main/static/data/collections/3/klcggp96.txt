OBJECTIVE To compare a consecutive prospective cohort of patients who underwent robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) with near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging with indocyanine green dye (ICG) with a previous consecutive patient cohort. METHODS A total of 47 consecutive patients with renal masses suspicious for malignancy undergoing RPN were given 5-7.5 mg of ICG before hilar clamping or tumor excision. This cohort of patients was compared with 47 immediate previous consecutive patients who had undergone RPN without NIRF real-time imaging using ICG. The intraoperative, perioperative, and postoperative parameters were collected in an institutional review board-approved prospective database. RESULTS The preoperative demographics and tumor complexity according to the nephrometry or preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomic (PADUA) scores were similar. The mean warm ischemia time was significantly decreased in the ICG group (15 vs 17 minutes, P = .01). The median hospital stay was 2 days in both groups. No significant difference was seen in the positive margin rate (ICG, 6% vs control, 8.5%; P = .69) or observed Clavien grade III-IV complications in these 2 cohorts (ICG, 4% vs control, 15%; P = .07). No adverse events were associated with ICG dye administration. Differential ICG uptake was observed with selective clamping or in patients with cystic tumors, hypofluorescent tumors with exophytic components, and angiomyelolipomas, but these benefits could not be quantified. NIRF-ICG was transiently helpful to identify the vascular anatomy and not helpful at all for endophytic tumors. CONCLUSION RPN using NIRF-ICG can be performed safely and effectively. A decreased warm ischemia time in the ICG cohort was observed without specific measured advantages. Differential ICG uptake by different tumors did not lead to significant differences in the positive margin rate.

A focused nucleoside library was constructed around a 3â€²-C-ethynyl-d-ribofuranose sugar scaffold, which was coupled to variously modified purine nucleobases. The resulting nucleosides were probed for their ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, as well as for their activity against a panel of relevant human viruses. While C6-aryl substituted purine nucleosides were found to be weakly active, several C7-substituted 7-deazapurine nucleosides elicited potent antiproliferative activity. Their activity spectrum was evaluated in the NCI-60 tumor cell line panel indicating activity against several solid tumor derived cell lines. Analog 32, equipped with a 7-deaza 7-chloro-6-amino-purin-9-yl base was evaluated in a metastatic breast tumor (MDA-MB-231-LM2) xenograft model. It inhibited both tumor growth and reduced the formation of lung metastases as revealed by BLI analysis. The dideazanucleoside analog 66 showed interesting activity against hCMV. These results highlight the potential advantages of recombining known sugar and nucleobase motifs as a library design strategy to discover novel antiviral or antitumor agents.

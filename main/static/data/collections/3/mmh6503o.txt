In biomedical research recombinant poxviruses are investigated as important candidate medicines to derive advanced options for prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases or cancer. Genetically engineered viruses can readily synthesize biologically active heterologous proteins, serve to determine relevant targets of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and identify types of immune responses needed for protection against a multitude of different specific diseases. Substantial progress in vaccine development is based on the availability of exceptionally safe but efficient carrier viruses, on increasingly versatile vector technologies and on the feasibility of large scale manufacturing. Moreover, advances in deciphering the molecular pathways regulating poxvirus-host interactions will provide additional means to potently activate innate immune stimulation upon vaccination and to derive vectors with specifically targeted replicative capacity for experimental tumor therapy.

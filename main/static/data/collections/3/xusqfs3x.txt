Although renal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is an uncommon condition, it may lead to high cardiac output heart failure and renal insufficiency. Recently, percutaneous transcatheter embolization has replaced traditional surgery as the first line of treatment. We report a case of a 68-year-old male who presented with a renal AVF and was treated by percutaneous transcatheter embolization using the Amplatzer Vascular Plug 2 (AVP 2; St Jude Medical, Plymouth, Minnesota) through an arterial access. To our knowledge, the use of AVP 2 device in the treatment of renal AVF as a single embolotherapy device through the transarterial route has not been previously reported in the literature. Our technique demonstrates the feasibility and safety of AVP 2 device in the treatment of renal AVF.

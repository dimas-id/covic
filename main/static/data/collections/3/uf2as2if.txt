Abstract The enigma that is factor VIII immunogenicity remains ever pertinent in the treatment of hemophilia A. Development of neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic protein in 25â€“30% of patients likely depends on the appropriate activation of the innate immune response shortly following antigen encounter. Our understanding of this important immunological synapse remains ill-defined. In this review, we examine the three distinct factors contributing to the fate of factor VIII almost immediately after infusion: the characteristics of the protein, the cell, and the microenvironment. We propose a continuum between clearance and antigen presentation that facilitates removal of FVIII from circulation leading to either tolerance or immunity.

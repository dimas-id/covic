SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel Coronavirus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the virus has spread in almost the entire world. Tracing and tracking virus international and local transmission has been an enormous challenge. Chains of infections starting from various countries worldwide seeded the outbreak of COVID-19 in Athens, capital city of Greece. Full-genome analysis of isolates from Athens' Hospitals and other healthcare providers revealed the variety of SARS-CoV-2 that initiated the pandemic before lock-down and passenger flight restrictions. The present work may serve as reference for resolving future lines of infection in the area and Europe especially after resumption of passenger flight connections to Athens and Greece during summer of 2020.

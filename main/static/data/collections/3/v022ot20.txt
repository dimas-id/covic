We reassess the trajectory tracking errors inherent to the Lagrangian deformation estimates with a new propagation of uncertainty derivation and show that previous formulations applied to deformation estimates from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS) were either too low due to a simplistic formulation, or too high due to incorrect assumptions in the derivation. We show that when the resulting signal-to-noise ratios are used to discriminate the deformation estimates based on their quality, as done for buoy records, the spatio-temporal scaling exponents for the mean total deformation rate increase, especially at smaller scale, such that a space-time coupling of the scaling $-$ which is otherwise absent $-$ emerges from the RGPS deformation data set, in accord with previous analyses performed with buoy observations. We also show that the pre-processing method used to reduce the effects of irregular sampling of the Lagrangian deformation fields can significantly impact the value of the deformation statistics and could possibly explain part of previous discrepancies between deformation statistics obtained with buoy records and large-scale SAR imagery. Specifically, we show that spurious lines of deformation appear when interpolating RGPS trajectories presenting temporal sampling inconsistencies. In the context of using observed sea-ice deformation statistics to constrain and improve the performance of sea-ice models, high confidence in the observed deformation field statistics is necessary. Using appropriate, well-documented, methods to derive the set of statistics to be reproduced by models therefore becomes crucial.

An ongoing theme of the COVID-19 pandemic is the need for widespread availability of accurate and eﬃcient diagnostic testing for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and antiviral antibodies in infected individuals. This report describes various assay techniques and tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. Most tests for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA rely on the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but isothermal nucleic acid ampliﬁcation assays, including transcription-mediated ampliﬁcation and CRISPR-based methodologies, are promising alternatives. Identiﬁcation of individuals who have developed antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral ﬂow immunoassay. This report also provides an overview of current development in COVID-19 diagnostic techniques and products to facilitate future improvement and innovation.

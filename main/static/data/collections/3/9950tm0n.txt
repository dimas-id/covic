Messaging around COVID-19 has focused on individual behavior while event cancellations are decided on a case-by-case basis with limited information. Unfortunately, most models assume random mixing patterns instead of the higher-order structures necessary to describe large events. We present a higher-order description of epidemics in networks and find mesoscopic localization where spreading can concentrate around key substructures. We discuss the implications of this result and model the impact of a blanket cancellation of events larger than a critical size. We find that epidemics in a localized phase can suddenly collapse when interventions operate over structures rather than individuals.

OBJECTIVE This study evaluates the correlation between closed, semi-closed and open-cell stent design and the association between stent type and clinical outcome as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. DESIGN A total of 194 patients who underwent unprotected carotid artery stenting (CAS) as well as diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) before and after intervention were retrospectively reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three stent designs were studied: closed cell, semi-closed cell and open cell. Spearman's Rho test was performed between the stent free cell area and the number and area of ischaemic lesions found after intervention. Adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the three stent groups (Zilver, Cook Europe, Denmark; Smart, Codman, MA; and Wallstent, Stryker, MN, USA). A significant correlation was found between the stent free cell area and the number and area of new ischaemic lesions on DW-MRI (P = 0.023). There were significantly fewer new lesions with an open-cell design (Zilver; 12.76 mm(2) free cell area) than with a closed-cell design (Wallstent; 1.08 mm(2) free cell area). CONCLUSIONS Open-cell stent was related to a lower number and area of silent cerebral ischaemic lesions after unprotected CAS. However, clinical outcome, measured by incidence of adverse events and clinical neurologic assessment, was not significantly different between patients with different stent designs.

PURPOSE The aim of this prospective study was to assess the influence of morphological characteristics of anastomotic doughnuts on the risk of anastomotic leakage (AL) after double-stapled colorectal anastomosis. METHODS This single-center prospective study enrolled all patients undergoing double-stapled colorectal anastomosis between December 2012 and December 2015. Maximal diameter and minimal and maximal heights and widths of both colonic and rectal doughnuts were measured by surgeons in the operating room. Their influence on the risk of AL was analyzed on uni- and multivariate models. RESULTS One hundred fifty-four patients were included; 92 (59.7%) were operated on for malignancy. Colorectal anastomoses > and <10 cm above the anal verge were performed in 96 (62.3%) and 58 (37.7%) patients, respectively. AL occurred in 17 (11.0%). The minimal height of the colonic doughnut (CD) was the only measurement significantly associated with an increased risk of AL (p = 0.026). A cutoff value of 4.5 mm for the CD determined on the ROC curve (AUC 0.685, p = 0.013) yielded the best sensitivity (61.4%) and specificity (82.4%) to predict AL. On multivariate analysis, a height of the CD <4.5 mm (OR 5.743, 95% IC 1.476-22.346, p = 0.012), malignant disease (OR 8.821, 95% IC 1.051-74.006, p = 0.045), and American Society of Anesthesiologists score >2 (OR 3.408, 95% IC 1.017-11.418, p = 0.047) were the only independent risk factors of AL. CONCLUSION The CD's minimal height influences the risk of AL. Its routine measurement during operation, along with other risk factors, could help to decide which patients could benefit from a diverting stoma or the creation of a new anastomosis.

The existence of pathogenic viruses was inferred by experiments at the turn of the twentieth century. Key developments in detection of viruses, including electron microscopy and monolayer cell culture, were made in the middle of that century. However, in terms of patient care, the results from the virology laboratory often arrived the patient was 'better or dead'. The advent of molecular techniques, particularly polymerase chain reaction and more recently whole genome sequencing made timely and accurate diagnosis of viral infections feasible. A range of approaches have been taken to identify and characterise new viruses. Vaccines against viruses have made it possible to eliminate two pathogenic mammalian viruses altogether, with several others close to eradication. The role of biomedical scientists working in diagnostic virology is more relevant to patient care than ever.

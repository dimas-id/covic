Since the initial reports surfaced of a novel Coronavirus causing illness and loss of life in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the globe infecting millions and leaving hundreds of thousands dead. As hospitals cope with the influx of COVID-19 patients, new challenges have arisen as healthcare systems care for COVID-19 patients while still providing essential emergency care for patients with acute strokes and acute myocardial infarction. Adding to this complex scenario are new reports that COVID-19 patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic complications including strokes. In this paper, we detail our experience caring for acute stroke patients, and provide some insight into neurointerventional workflow modifications that have helped us adapt to the COVID-19 era.

Abstract A study of broiler litter re-utilization potential was conducted with the goal of determining if storage of litter significantly reduced potential pathogens to levels safe for re-utilization. Litter from four broiler houses was separated into a fine fraction for fertilizer use and a coarse fraction for use as a supplement to wood shavings in growing subsequent flocks of birds. Fractions and whole litter were stored in indoor piles for four months with periodic analysis for culturable pathogenic and indicator bacteria. Significant reductions in microbial concentrations occurred in a majority of samples tested during four months of storage (in most cases to below detection limits of approximately 30 CFU/g dry weight). Poultry feed was found to be one possible source of litter contamination.

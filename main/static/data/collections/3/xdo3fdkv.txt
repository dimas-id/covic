Abstract The modifiable areal unit problem, MAUP, is ever-present although not always appreciated. Through real examples, this article outlines the basic causes of MAUP, namely changes in the size, shape, and/or orientation of spatial categories/polygons used to map areal data. The visual effects of changes to mapped data are obvious even though the impacts on our understanding of the world are profound. The article concludes with a discussion of technical and broader strategic approaches for confronting the effects of MAUP on our treatment and interpretation of areal data.

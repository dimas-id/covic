The role of multidisciplinary treatment including surgery for liver metastases from gastric cancer (LMGC) is controversial. Studies to answer this clinical question are increasing in number, but all published data thus far are based on retrospective analyses with limited sample sizes. Thus, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer Group (GITCG) and the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) Stomach Cancer Study Group (SCSG) initiated a collaboration to develop an optimal treatment strategy for LMGC. Before planning a prospective study, a questionnaire was sent out to the network members of both groups in June 2016 to clarify current common practice in each region. Sixty-seven sites from 17 countries in the EORTC network and 55 sites from Japan responded. According to the survey, for patients with resectable LMGC without extrahepatic metastases, preoperative chemotherapy followed by resection of both primary (if still in place) and liver lesions was the preferred option for both the synchronous and the metachronous setting. For patients with unresectable LMGC, most of the sites recommended chemotherapy only. In this article, the detailed results of this survey are reported, shedding light on current community practice, and a joint EORTC-JCOG strategy of investigation is delineated.

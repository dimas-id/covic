OBJECTIVE To compare laparoscopic gastropexy using 2 self-anchoring barbed sutures to gastropexy using laparoscopically tied intracorporeal knots. STUDY DESIGN Prospective, randomized controlled, clinical trial. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 30) weighing >16 kg. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 laparoscopic gastropexy groups: group 1 (controls), intracorporeal 2-0 polydioxanone sutures (PDSII, Ethicon); group 2, barbed suture (0 Quill™ PDO; Angiotech); and group 3, barbed suture (2-0 V-Loc™ 180; Covidien). Gastropexy suturing time (GST) and total surgery time (TST) were recorded for each dog. Complications were recorded. Each dog was examined by ultrasound (1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively) to ensure persistence of the gastropexy. One dog each in group 2 and group 3 had 2nd look laparoscopy to evaluate the gastropexy. RESULTS All gastropexies were intact at 6 months. Mean GST was significantly longer for group 1 (36 minutes; range, 25-46 minutes) than for groups 2 (20 minutes; range, 16-37 minutes) and 3 (19 minutes; range, 15-30 minutes; P < .05), which were not significantly different from each other. Likewise TSTs for groups 2 and 3 were significantly shorter than for group 1 (P < .05). CONCLUSION Barbed sutures (Quill™ and V-Loc™) allowed for effective intracorporeal laparoscopic suturing of an incisional gastropexy without tying intracorporeal knots.

Neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into cells using surface-expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We developed a surrogate neutralization test (sVNT) to assess at what degree serum antibodies interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD to ACE2. The sVNT revealed neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies in the sera of 90% of mildly and 100% of severely affected coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) convalescent patients. Importantly, sVNT results correlated strongly to the results from pseudotyped-vesicular stomatitis virus-vector-based neutralization assay and to levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies. Moreover, levels of neutralizing antibodies also correlated to duration and severity of clinical symptoms, but not patient age or gender. These findings together with the sVNT will not only be important for evaluating the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in a population but also for identifying promising plasma donors for successful passive antibody therapy.

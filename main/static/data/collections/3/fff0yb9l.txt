The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human populations sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). According to preliminary data, about 14% of cases are considered severe and 5% of cases result in critical illness and, reported case fatality rates vary from 1% to more than 7%. However, the symptoms of the disease and the clinical outcome are very different in infected people. In view of these differences, it is clearly apparent that to gain insight into the biology of the SARS-CoV-2, it is important to study not just the infectious particle in itself but also to investigate the virus-host cell interactions that occur during infection. This review seeks to consider the various aspects of genetic factors in determining the susceptibility and host resistance to SARS-CoV-2 throughout the recently published literature.

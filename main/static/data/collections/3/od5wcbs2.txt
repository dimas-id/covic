We propose an index to prioritize preventive maintenance for medical equipment. Our index considers seven variables: type of equipment, equipment function, maintenance requirements, calibration, equipment age, equipment location, and equipment hazards. We developed a mathematical model using these variables, and its result is interpreted as an index of equipment maintenance priority. The numerical output of the index was classified into three categories: high, medium, and low priority. We proposed our index model to technical staff at the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico as a protocol for scheduling appropriate preventive maintenance for medical equipment during the year. The index was tested in a sample of 16 different medical equipment. Our model provides a guide to define the priority and the number of preventive maintenance routines required for medical equipment per year.

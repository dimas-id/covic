PURPOSE Intracorporeal anastomosis is the most difficult procedure during pure single-incision distal gastrectomy (SIDG) that affects its generalization. We introduced unaided delta-shaped anastomosis (uDelta), a novel anastomosis technique, for gastroduodenostomy after pure SIDG, and compared the results with those of previously reported Roux-en-Y anastomosis (RY). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2014 and March 2015, SIDG with D1+ lymph node dissection was performed for early gastric cancer through a 2.5-cm transumbilical incision without any additional port. uDelta was performed by the operator alone, without any intracorporeal assistance. RESULTS uDelta was performed on 11 patents, and uncut RY was performed on 5-patients without open or multiport conversion. R0 resection was performed in all cases. No significant differences were observed in mean age and body mass index between patients who underwent uDelta or RY. Mean operation times were 214.5±36.2 minutes for uDelta and 240.8±65.9 minutes for RY, which was not significantly different. Reconstruction time for uDelta was shorter than that for RY, with marginal statistical significance (26.1±8.3 minutes vs. 38.0±9.1 minutes, P=0.05). There were no intraoperative transfusions, 30-day mortality, or anastomosis-related complications in either group. Average length of hospital stay was 8.2±1.9 days in the uDelta group and 7.2±0.8 days in the RY group (P=0.320). CONCLUSIONS After carefully considering indications, uDelta can be a feasible and can be a reproducible reconstruction method after SIDG in early gastric cancer.

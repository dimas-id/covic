While, given the expansion of the world population, it cannot be guaranteed that it will always be so, currently one accepts as a temporary discomfort short periods of crowding, as in a crowded elevator or subway train. However, if, like most intracellular macromolecules, one were both blind and deaf, the need to communicate by touch might make crowding an option of choice. It seems likely that the first cells to evolve soon discovered the advantage of intracellular crowding, which persists to this day [2]. Indeed, the physiological environment of enzymes is very different from the environment we can normally create in the test-tube.

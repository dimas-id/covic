Abstract Functionalized transistors provide effective sensors for a variety of viruses (Zika, severe acute respiratory syndrome), toxins (botulinum), cancers (breast and prostate), and disease or injury biomarkers (troponin, cerebrospinal fluid). A hallmark of this approach is high specificity, rapid response (<5minutes), and ability to be integrated with wireless data transmission capabilities. The ultimate goal is hand-held point-of-care detection that can streamline patient diagnosis.

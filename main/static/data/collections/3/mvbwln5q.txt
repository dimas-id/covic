PURPOSE To evaluate the usefulness of hydrogel-coated coils for preventing recanalization after coil embolization of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-seven consecutive patients with 57 untreated PAVMs underwent coil embolization with hydrogel-coated coils between January 2013 and Jun 2017. The mean age was 49 years (range 9-83 years), and there were seven male patients and 30 female patients. The median size of the feeding artery was 3.7 mm (range 1.5-6.1 mm), and the median size of the venous sac was 9.3 mm (range 2.6-36.6 mm). For all PAVM, embolization was attempted using 0.018-in. hydrogel-coated coils with or without other coils (0.0135-0.018-in. bare platinum coils and fibered platinum coils). Technical success rate, recanalization rate, and complications were evaluated. Technical success was defined as completion of embolization using hydrogel-coated coils. Recanalization was evaluated with time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography and/or pulmonary angiography. RESULTS In 56 of 57 PAVMs, embolization was successfully performed with hydrogel-coated coils. Therefore, the technical success rate was 98% (56/57). The number of PAVMs at risk was 56, 42, 18, and 12 at 0, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. There was no recanalization with a mean follow-up period of 19 months (range 2-47 months) in 56 PAVMs embolized with hydrogel-coated coils. There were no major complications. As a minor complication, local pain was observed in 8 of 43 sessions (19%) after embolization. CONCLUSIONS Hydrogel-coated coils may be useful for preventing recanalization after the embolization of PAVMs.

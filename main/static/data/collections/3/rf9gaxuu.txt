BACKGROUND Primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) in the cavalier King Charles spaniel (CKCS) is similar to otitis media with effusion (OME) in humans. A proposed aetiology of OME is inflammation of the middle ear mucosa, usually due to bacterial infection, leading to auditory tube dysfunction. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES Our objective was to characterize the microbiological and cytological findings of otic exudates from the external ear canal (EEC) (n = 68) and middle ear (ME) (n = 69) from 41 CKCSs with PSOM. METHODS AND MATERIALS Swab samples from the EEC and mucus aspirated from the ME after performing a myringotomy were obtained for bacterial culture and cytological analysis. RESULTS Fifty-five of 68 (81%) EEC and 46 of 69 (67%) ME yielded no bacterial growth. Thirty-eight of the 68 (56%) ears had no microbial growth from neither the EEC nor ME; seven (10%) had bacteria isolated from the EEC only; 17 (25%) had bacteria isolated from the ME only, and six (8%) had bacteria isolated from both EEC and ME. Thirty-four total bacterial isolates were cultured from ME. The most common bacterial species isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Otic cytology identified coccoid organisms in only three of 68 EEC and four of 69 ME. CONCLUSIONS The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of PSOM in CKCS is unclear. The majority of the EEC and ME of the CKCS with PSOM were negative by conventional bacterial culture and the cytological presence of bacteria was not correlated with culture positives. The potential role of noncultivable microbiota in PSOM requires exploration using molecular methods.

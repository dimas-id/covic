In order to determine if canine coronavirus (CCV) could be transmitted to pigs, two dogs were inoculated orally with virulent CCV. After 24 h, the dogs were moved to an isolation room that contained three three-day-old pigs. A wire mesh fence, allowing close contact between the animals, separated the dogs from the pigs. The dogs and pigs were observed for 14 days for clinical signs of disease. Samples of blood were obtained from dogs and pigs immediately before the dogs were inoculated with virus and 14 and 28 days later. The dogs developed mild clinical signs of an infection, but the pigs remained normal throughout the observation period. The dogs shed CCV for eight days after exposure. All three pigs developed neutralizing antibodies against CCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus by 14 days after they were exposed to the dogs.

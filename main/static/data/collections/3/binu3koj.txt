We assessed the impact of pain, dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia on the quality of life among Turkish fertile women with severe endometriosis. A total of 33 patients with histopathologically diagnosed severe endometriosis (Stage IV, revised criteria of the American Fertility Society (rAFS score) were enrolled into the study. Patients reported chronic pelvic pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and severity of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and pelvic tenderness using the verbal rating scale (VRS). Quality of life (physical, psychological, social, environmental domains) was evaluated using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). There were no correlations between quality of life and VRS and VAS scores of chronic pelvic pain in patients with dyspareunia (p > 0.05). VRS in patients with dysmenorrhoea negatively correlated with physical, social and environmental dimensions of quality of life (r = -0.382, r = -0.221, r = -0.373 and p = 0.028, p = 0.013, p = 0.033, respectively). Although the severity of dysmenorrhoea seems to be related with lower quality of life, chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia due to endometriosis may not have any deleterious effects on the quality of life.

OBJECTIVES Although the technique of distal pancreatectomy with or without en bloc splenectomy has been well described, the execution of this procedure may be technically challenging when performed laparoscopically. In this technical report, we aimed to describe the technique of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with or without splenic preservation. DISCUSSION Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy is a safe and effective surgical approach for the correction of various conditions. It has been proven to be a feasible solution for the treatment of benign inflammatory conditions as well as neoplasms. Splenic preservation requires careful and meticulous dissection, but may be done safely.

BACKGROUND Nucleic acid amplification tests are increasingly being used to diagnose viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections. The high sensitivity of these tests affects our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory tract infections. We have assessed the detection rate of a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, with emphasis on epidemiology and seasonal distribution of the most common respiratory tract infections. METHODS Seven thousand eight hundred and fifty-three nasopharyngeal samples from 7220 patients (age range 0-98 y, median 22 y) obtained during 36 consecutive months (November 2006-October 2009), were analyzed with a multiplex PCR panel including influenza A (IfA) and B (IfB) virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronavirus (CoV) OC43, NL63, and 229E, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV), and 2 bacteria--Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. RESULTS Of the total samples, 44.5% (n = 3496) were positive for at least 1 agent, with HRV being the most common (n = 1482, 38.0%), followed by RSV (n = 526, 13.5%) and IfA (n = 403, 10.3%). The diagnostic yield was significantly higher during the winter and early spring compared to the summer (n = 2439 of 4458 samples, 54.7% and n = 1057 of 3395 samples, 31.1%, respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic yield was highly dependent on the month of sampling and the age of the patient. However, the overall detection rate per month was above 30%, apart for August and September. Our findings support the use of similar tests in routine clinical care all year round. HRV was the most common finding in the respiratory tract, independent of season.

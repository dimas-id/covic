The aim of this study was to determine the level of antibodies against hemagglutinin of influenza viruses in the sera of people in different age groups in the epidemic season 2013/2014 in Poland. The level of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies was determined by hemagglutination inhibition test (HAI). A total number of 1,050 randomly selected sera was tested in seven age groups. The level of antibodies against influenza viruses was very low, which indicates that the people have not been vaccinated against influenza in the epidemic season 2013/2014. The value of protection rate against influenza in the Polish population is very low. These results are worrying, because complications of influenza may be harmful to health and even life-threatening to persons who are not vaccinated. Furthermore, these results confirm the circulation of three antigenically different influenza virus strains, two subtypes of influenza A virus â€“ A/California/7/2009/(H1N1)pdm09 and A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) - and B/Massachusetts/2/2012.

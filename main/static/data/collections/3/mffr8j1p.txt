OBJECTIVES To identify and characterize the siRNA duplexes that are effective for inhibition of SARS-CoV infection and replication in the non-human primate cells. This in vitro study will serve as the foundation for development of novel anti-SARS therapeutics. METHODS 48 siRNA sequences were designed for targeting regions throughout entire SARS-CoV genome RNA including open-reading frames for several key proteins. Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes were transfected into foetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cells prior to or after SARS-CoV infection. The inhibitory effects of the siRNAs were evaluated for reductions of intracellular viral genome copy number and viral titres in the cell culture medium measured by Q-RT-PCR and CPE-based titration, respectively. Four siRNA duplexes were found to achieve potent inhibition of SARS-CoV infection and replication. A prolonged prophylactic effect of siRNA duplexes with up to 90% inhibition that lasted for at least 72 h was observed. Combination of active siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of the viral genome resulted in therapeutic activity of up to 80% inhibition. CONCLUSION Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes targeting SARS-CoV genomic RNA are potent agents for inhibition of the viral infection and replication. The location effects of siRNAs were revealed at both genome sequence and open-reading frame levels. The rapid development of siRNA-based SARS-CoV inhibitors marked a novel approach for combating newly emergent infectious diseases.

The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is poorly understood and cytokine dysregulation has been suggested as one relevant mechanism to be explored. We compared the cytokine profile in Caco2 cells after infection of SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) with other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (FluAV), and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2). Interferon (IFN) system (production and response) was not suppressed by SARS‐CoV infection. Therefore, SARS‐CoV replication was suppressed by pretreatment with IFN. SARS‐CoV and RSV induced high levels of IL‐6 and RANTES compared with FluAV and hPIV2. Induction level of suppressor of cytokine signaling‐3 (SOCS3) by SARS‐CoV was significantly lower than that by RSV in spite of the significant production of IL‐6. Toll‐like receptors 4 and 9, which correlate with the induction of inflammatory response, were upregulated by SARS‐CoV infection. Collectively, overinduction of inflammatory cytokine and dysregulation of cytokine signaling may contribute to the immunopathology associated with “severe” inflammation in SARS. J. Med.

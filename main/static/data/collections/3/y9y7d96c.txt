Abstract N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification heavily impacting protein functions. Some alterations of glycosylation, such as sialic acid hydrolysis, are related to protein dysfunction. Because of their high flexibility and the many reactive groups of the glycan chains, studying glycans with in vitro methods is a challenging task. Molecular dynamics is a useful tool and probably the only one in biology able to overcome this problem and gives access to conformational information through exhaustive sampling. To better decipher the impact of N-glycans, the analysis and visualization of their influence over time on protein structure is a prerequisite. We developed the Umbrella Visualization, a graphical method that assigns the glycan intrinsic flexibility during a molecular dynamics trajectory. The density plot generated by this method brought relevant informations regarding glycans dynamics and flexibility, but needs further development in order to integrate an accurate description of the protein topology and its interactions. We propose here to transform this analysis method into a visualization mode in UnityMol. UnityMol is a molecular editor, viewer and prototyping platform, coded in C#. The new representation of glycan chains presented in this study takes into account both the main positions adopted by each antenna of a glycan and their statistical relevance. By displaying the collected data on the protein surface, one is then able to investigate the protein/glycan interactions.

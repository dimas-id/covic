We analyzed the trends in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Tokyo and Osaka from January 25 to May 06, 2020. To analyze the trends and to identify significant changes in trends we performed a joinpoint regression analysis. Since the last of March, COVID-19 cases soared up in Tokyo (ß = 103.51) and Osaka (ß = 28.07). During the 2nd and 3rd weeks of April, both Tokyo (ß = 157.53) and Osaka (ß = 60.96) experienced the peak growth in COVID-19 cases. Since then, with some hope, almost after 14 days of the state of emergency declaration, the cases showed a containment trend but still increasing at a concerning rate in Tokyo (ß = 90.66).

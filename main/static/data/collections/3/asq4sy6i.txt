As the 21st century unfolds, strategies to prevent and control infectious diseases remain an area of vital interest and concern. The burden of disease, disability, and death caused by infectious diseases is felt around the world in both developed and developing nations. Moreover, the ability of infectious agents to destabilize populations, economies, and governments is strikingly apparent. To an unprecedented degree, infectious disease-related issues are high on the agendas of world leaders, philanthropists, policymakers, and the public. This enhanced focus, combined with recent scientific and technological advances, creates new opportunities and challenges for infectious disease research and practice. This paper examines these issues in the context of three countries: China, India, and the United States.

This study investigated a method using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the rapid detection of cnm-positive Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) associated with cerebral microhemorrhage. LAMP amplified the cnm gene plasmid vector, but not human or microbial genomic DNA. The cnm DNA of the cnm-positive S. mutans strain was detected in saliva without DNA extraction after 1 day of culture. This method resulted in a cnm-positive rate of 26.4% in 102 samples, which was higher than that obtained with conventional PCR. In conclusion, LAMP may be used for the detection of cnm-positive S. mutans in a large number of samples.

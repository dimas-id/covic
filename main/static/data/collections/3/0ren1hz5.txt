Holder pasteurization (62.5ºC, 30 min) of human milk (HM) is thought to reduce the risk of transmitting viruses to an infant. Some viruses may be secreted into milk - others may be contaminants. The effect of thermal pasteurization on viruses in HM has yet to be rigorously reviewed. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of common pasteurization techniques on viruses in HM and non-HM matrices. Databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) were searched from inception to April 20th, 2020 for primary research articles assessing the impact of pasteurization on viral load or detection of live virus. Reviews were excluded, as were studies lacking quantitative measurements or those assessing pasteurization as a component of a larger process. Overall, of 65,131 reports identified, 109 studies were included. Pasteurization of HM at a minimum temperature of 56ºC-60ºC is effective at reducing detectable live virus. In cell culture media or plasma, coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) are highly susceptible to heating at ≥56ºC. Although pasteurization parameters and matrices reported vary, all viruses studied, except parvoviruses, were susceptible to thermal killing. Future research important for the study of novel viruses should standardize pasteurization protocols and should test inactivation in human milk. Novelty bullets •In all matrices, including human milk, pasteurization at 62.5ºC was generally sufficient to reduce surviving viral load by several logs or to below the limit of detection. •Holder pasteurization (62.5ºC, 30 min) of human milk should be sufficient to inactivate non-heat resistant viruses, including coronaviruses, if present.

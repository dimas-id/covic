In Saudi Arabia, a novel coronavirus named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated in 2012 from patients with severe respiratory symptoms. Up to now, more than 1600 MERS cases have been registered mainly in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS is usually accompanied with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In many cases, pneumonia is observed. However, clinical features of MERS range from mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. To date, about one in three people died as a result of MERS. In Europe, MERS cases have only been registered in isolated travelers entering from the Middle East.

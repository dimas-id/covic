• As the requirement of personal protective equipment (PPE) has increased rapidly in a short time due to COVID-19, the compliance of the manufactured respirators with the standards seems to have been placed in the second plan. • Frequent use of PPE such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) causes carbon dioxide re-breathing in healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak. • Even when resting, both expiratory and inspiratory carbon dioxide levels increase significantly with the use of PPE. • It should be kept in mind that healthcare workers may experience symptoms related to hypercapnia during their use of PPE.

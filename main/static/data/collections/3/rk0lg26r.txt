Peritoneal malignancies may result in a widespread disease process, peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), which has significant morbidity and mortality for patients afflicted by this disease. Dissemination into the peritoneum and throughout the abdomen can be due to a primary peritoneal cancer or other primary malignancies that have metastasized, including (but not limited to) colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, appendiceal cancer, ovarian cancer, and mesothelioma. Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) or gynecologic malignancies with peritoneal carcinomatosis may have dismal survival due to a high disease burden within the abdominal cavity. Some studies suggest the average survival for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin is 18–48 months, for high-grade appendiceal adenocarcinoma 12–36 months, and for low-grade appendiceal neoplasms >60 months. As the understanding of peritoneal malignancies and peritoneal carcinomatosis evolved, it may now be acceptable to treat this as locoregional disease.

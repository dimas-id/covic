Intestinal tissues obtained from coronavirus-infected embryos and turkeys were examined by fluorescent antibody tissue section technique (FAT). Evidence of viral antigen was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of the intestinal epithelial cells covering the villi. Embryo intestines that were examined from 24 to 96 hours after inoculation were positive for immunofluorescence (IF), whereas bursa of Fabricius was negative. Poults hatched from infected embryos were examined at 2 days of age and were positive for IF. Coronaviral antigen was detected by FAT in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells of the jejunum, ileum, duodenum, and cecum in all turkeys that were examined from 24 hours to 28 days.

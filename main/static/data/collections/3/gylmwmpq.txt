Abstract Background A previously unidentified species of human rhinovirus, HRV-C, was described in 2006 in association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Features of infection in immunosuppressed adults are poorly characterised. Objectives This study aims to determine the epidemiology of HRV-C in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients in a single centre. Study design A prospective cohort study of all HSCT recipients admitted to Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia from 1 July 2005 to 30 September 2007 was undertaken. Nose/throat samples were collected from all patients at the time of admission and patients developing pre-defined symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection during the admission. Samples were processed and tested for rhinoviruses and 14 other respiratory viruses using nucleic acid-based methods, immunofluorescence and culture. HRV genotyping was performed by sequencing a region of the rhinovirus 5â€² untranslated region (UTR). Clinical data on each episode were collected prospectively. Results HRVs were identified in 24 episodes: 8% of 299 episodes of clinically- defined respiratory infections and 39% of 61 episodes in which respiratory viruses were detected. HRV-C was most frequent (HRV-C: nine, HRV-A: eight and HRV-B: two). Seven episodes of HRV-C, five with pneumonia, occurred within 100 days of HSCT. Co-pathogens were frequent. Conclusions The newly described HRV-C was the most common rhinovirus group detected in HSCT recipients with respiratory infection, with co-pathogens being frequent. Further research is required to understand the activity and pathogenicity of this virus in HSCT recipients.

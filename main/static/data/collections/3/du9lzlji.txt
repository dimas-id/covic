Since the COVID‐19 pandemic stormed into the healthcare systems worldwide, protected stroke pathways have been suggested, in order not to spread the viral infection and ensure hyper‐acute treatment. Noteworthy, patients with acute ischemic stroke are at high‐risk for contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, particularly the severe form, because COVID‐19 and cerebrovascular diseases share common risk factors. Conversely, among patients hospitalized with SARS‐CoV‐2 respiratory distress, about 5% might suffer a stroke. During the acute stages of the pandemic, thousands of healthcare professionals have already contracted COVID‐19 infection, although the actual number is likely to be higher because healthcare workers are not always tested and protection measures at hospitals are not always readily available. This is the setting in which neurovascular ultrasound providers (physicians, sonographers) should expect to be involved in the care of stroke patients.

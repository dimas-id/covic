Standard measures such as quarantining suspects and contact tracing could not contain the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike for other recent epidemics where such instruments were successful, in the present case a large fraction of the infected have only mild unspecific symptoms. By employing network models we here show that even for near perfect contact tracing and unlimited suspect testing, containment starts to fail when more than approximately half of the carriers fall into the weak-symptom category. The situation becomes considerably more severe if the number of daily available tests is limited. In this case the epidemic transition becomes discontinuous and a much larger percentage of the population becomes infected. While moderate levels of social distancing can bring the situation back under control, the limited number of daily tests introduces a finite time horizon: If social distancing is implemented after the cut off date, containment catastrophically breaks down resulting in an exponential disease spread.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent data available on advances in development of novel medical treatments for hypertension and related comorbidities. RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately half of all hypertensive patients have not achieved goal blood pressure with current available antihypertensive medications. Recent landmark studies and new hypertension guidelines have called for stricter blood pressure control, creating a need for better strategies for lowering blood pressure. This has led to a shift in focus, in recent years, to the development of combination pills as a means of achieving improved blood pressure control by increasing adherence to prescribed medications along with further research and development of promising novel drugs based on discovery of new molecular targets such as the counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin system. SUMMARY: Fixed-dose combination pills and novel treatments based on recently discovered pathogenic mechanisms of hypertension that have demonstrated promising results as treatments for hypertension and related comorbidities will be discussed in this review.

The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on emerging stock markets over the period March 10 â€“ April 30, 2020. Findings reveal that the negative impact of pandemic on emerging stock markets has gradually fallen and begun to taper off by mid-April. In terms of regional classification, the impact of the outbreak is the highest in Asian emerging markets whereas it is the lowest in the European emerging markets. We also find that response time and the size of stimulus package by the governments matter in offsetting the effects of the pandemic.

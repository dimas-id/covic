For biophysical investigations on viral proteins, in particular for structure determination by X-ray crystallography, relatively large quantities of purified protein are necessary. However, expression of cDNAs coding for viral proteins in prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems is often not straightforward, and frequently the amount and/or the solubility of the protein obtained are not sufficient. Here, we describe a number of protocols for production of nonstructural proteins of coronaviruses that have proven to be efficient in increasing expression yields or solubilities.

The use of chemicals around the globe in different industries has increased tremendously, affecting the health of people. The modern world intends to replace these noxious chemicals with environmental friendly products for the betterment of life on the planet. Establishing enzymatic processes in spite of chemical processes has been a prime objective of scientists. Various enzymes, specifically microbial proteases, are the most essentially used in different corporate sectors, such as textile, detergent, leather, feed, waste, and others. Proteases with respect to physiological and commercial roles hold a pivotal position. As they are performing synthetic and degradative functions, proteases are found ubiquitously, such as in plants, animals, and microbes. Among different producers of proteases, Bacillus sp. are mostly commercially exploited microbes for proteases. Proteases are successfully considered as an alternative to chemicals and an eco-friendly indicator for nature or the surroundings. The evolutionary relationship among acidic, neutral, and alkaline proteases has been analyzed based on their protein sequences, but there remains a lack of information that regulates the diversity in their specificity. Researchers are looking for microbial proteases as they can tolerate harsh conditions, ways to prevent autoproteolytic activity, stability in optimum pH, and substrate specificity. The current review focuses on the comparison among different proteases and the current problems faced during production and application at the industrial level. Deciphering these issues would enable us to promote microbial proteases economically and commercially around the world.

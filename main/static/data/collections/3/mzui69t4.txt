BACKGROUND The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine had lower uptake compared to seasonal influenza vaccine, and most studies examining uptake of H1N1 vaccine focused on hospital-based healthcare personnel (HCP). Determinants of H1N1 vaccine uptake among HCP in all work settings need to be identified so that interventions can be developed for use in encouraging uptake of future pandemic or emerging infectious disease vaccines. OBJECTIVE To identify factors influencing nonhospital HCP H1N1 influenza vaccine compliance. DESIGN AND SETTING An H1N1 influenza vaccine compliance questionnaire was administered to HCP working in myriad healthcare settings in March-June 2011. METHODS Surveys were used to assess H1N1 influenza vaccine compliance and examine factors that predicted H1N1 influenza vaccine uptake. RESULTS In all, 3,188 HCP completed the survey. Hospital-based HCP had higher compliance than did non-hospital-based personnel (Î§2 = 142.2, P < .001). In logistic regression stratified by hospital setting versus nonhospital setting, determinants of H1N1 vaccination among non-hospital-based HCP included extent to which H1N1 vaccination was mandated or encouraged, perceived importance of vaccination, access to no-cost vaccine provided on-site, no fear of vaccine side effects, and trust in public health officials when they say that the influenza vaccine is safe. Determinants of hospital-based HCP H1N1 vaccine compliance included having a mandatory vaccination policy, perceived importance of vaccination, no fear of vaccine side effects, free vaccine, perceived seriousness of H1N1 influenza, and trust in public health officials. CONCLUSIONS Non-hospital-based HCP versus hospital-based HCP reasons for H1N1 vaccine uptake differed. Targeted interventions are needed to increase compliance with pandemic-related vaccines.

Background Shearing of an intrathecal catheter during implantation of a drug delivery system is an underreported complication that can be challenging to manage. Case Description A 53-year-old man with refractory cancer pain had an intrathecal pump system implanted. The procedure was complicated with catheter shear and retention in the intrathecal space. A second catheter was successfully placed but formation of a painful pseudomeningocele and ineffective pain relief complicated the outcome. A minimally invasive approach through a tubular retractor was employed to access the spinal canal via a laminotomy, the sheared catheter was removed and the dural defect repaired. Complete resolution of the pseudomeningocele and efficient pain control were observed at follow-up. Conclusion Minimally invasive approach to the spine is demonstrated as a safe and effective alternative in this case of retained catheter induced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.

Drug-induced alveolitis/pneumonitis and lung fibrosis are comparatively frequent manifestations of drug-induced damage to the respiratory system. These side effects rarely have pathognomonic features. Therefore, they are relevant differential diagnoses of naturally occurring pulmonary diseases. Side effects of drug therapy may mimic much of the clinical-radiological-pathological pattern of interstitial lung diseases; however, precise figures on the frequency of medicamentous induction of interstitial lung disorders are lacking. The diagnostics are based mainly on verifying a compatible disease pattern, excluding differential diagnoses, and assessing the temporal relationship and the consequences of drug abstention. Reexposure is rarely indicated. Strict elimination of the responsible drugs is the most important therapeutic measure. Additional drug therapy, mostly with glucocorticosteroids, may be indicated. This article summarizes the spectrum of drug-induced disorders of the lung parenchyma.

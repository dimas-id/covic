Borna disease virus, a negative-strand RNA virus, infects a wide variety of warm-blooded animals. Depending on the age of the host and the integrity of its immune response, infection may be asymptomatic or cause a broad spectrum of behavioral disorders. Unusual features of Borna disease virus biology include nuclear localization of replication and transcription; diverse strategies for regulation of gene expression; and interaction with signaling pathways resulting in subtle neuropathology. Although the question of human infection remains unresolved, burgeoning interest in this unique pathogen has provided tools for exploring the pharmacology and neurochemistry of neuropsychiatric disorders potentially linked to infection. Analysis of rodent models of infection has yielded insights into mechanisms by which neurotropic agents and/or immune factors may impact developing or mature central nervous system circuitry to effect complex disturbances in movement and behavior.

PURPOSE: To compare the routine vs. selective use of computed tomography (CT) in patients presenting with non-traumatic acute abdominal pain (AAP) to a surgical service. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis of outcomes according to PRISMA statement standards to compare the routine vs. selective use of CT in adult patients presenting with non-traumatic AAP. RESULTS: Analysis of 722 patients from 4 randomised controlled trials showed no difference between the routine CT and selective CT groups in terms of proportion of correct diagnoses (OR 1.36,95% CI 0.89, 2.07, P = 0.15), mortality (RD 0.03, 95% CI - 0.08, 0.02, P = 0.27] and length of hospital stay (LOS) [MD - 0.26, 95% CI - 2.07, 1.55, P = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of CT does not improve the proportion of correct diagnoses and mortality compared to selective use of CT in adult patients with non-traumatic AAP. The available evidence regarding the influence of routine CT on LOS may be subject to type 2 error. These findings, however, may not apply to the elderly patient with AAP and further studies are required.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) are widely used for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, these drugs may have side effects such as hearing loss. This study aimed to describe the hearing function in SLE patients using antimalarials. Secondarily, this study aimed to investigate whether SLE causes hearing loss and if there are any serological or clinical aspects of this diseases associated with inner ear damage. STUDY DESIGN: Cross‐sectional study. METHODS: This study included 84 individuals (43 SLE patients and 41 controls) with audiometry and tympanometry tests. Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and treatment profiles of SLE patients were extracted from the charts. RESULTS: SLE patients had more sensorineural hearing loss than controls (23.2% vs. 0; P = .001). Pure‐tone averages in SLE patients using antimalarials and not using antimalarials were similar (8.75 vs. 8.75; P = .63). At 8,000 Hz, antimalarial dug nonusers performed worse than users (10.00 vs. 22.50; P = .03). Tympanometry was normal in all participants. SLE serological and clinical profiles in patients with and without hearing loss were the same (all P = nonsignificant). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of hearing loss in SLE that is not affected by antimalarial drug use. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3b Laryngoscope, 2020

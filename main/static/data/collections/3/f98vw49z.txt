Patients with dysphagia do not always present with subjective symptoms. However, asymptomatic dysphagia can also cause clinical issues, especially in those with respiratory conditions. Therefore, adequate screening is an essential beginning to their care. The repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST) is one of the safest screening methods for dysphagia; it can be easily performed by nonprofessionals in any setting. There is evidence of its predictive values in aspiration pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), artificial ventilation, and other conditions. Additionaly, it has recently been found to be a strong predictor of the risk of future COPD exacerbation. The cost-effectiveness, harmlessness, and simplicity make it an optimal screening method for the large population of patients with respiratory conditions, although different cutoff values may be useful in different populations. It also takes into account multiple aspects of the swallowing ability, such as respiration, musculature, cognition, and general well-being.

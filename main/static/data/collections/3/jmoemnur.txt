Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is currently regarded as the next major advance in the progress of minimally invasive techniques in colorectal surgery. We describe our initial experience using SILS for the management of colorectal disease and present preliminary short-term results. Between February 2010 and April 2011, 7 patients (4 females and 3 males, mean age 55 years, range 32–74) underwent SILS for either benign or malignant colorectal disease. Preoperative diagnosis was diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon in two patients, malignant polyps of the sigmoid colon in two other patients and large villous tumor of the right colon in three patients. Surgical procedures, 4 anterior resections of the rectum and 3 right hemicolectomies, were performed through a 3 cm single umbilical incision using a SILS multi port device with conventional or articulated laparoscopic instruments. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions in the standard laparoscopic procedure. The mean operative time for anterior resections was 160.0 ± 10.6 min, whereas it was 160.6 ± 20 for right hemicolectomies. Blood loss was minimal. No postoperative complications were reported in any of the patients. The overall mean hospital stay was 4.8 ± 0.2 days (range 4–5). For the subset of patients with malignant or pre-malignant disease, the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 15.6 ± 4.4 (range 6–31). Cosmetic results were considered excellent by all the patients after 15 days. In conclusion, our preliminary experience shows that SILS for colorectal disease is feasible and safe with potential reproducible oncologic results.

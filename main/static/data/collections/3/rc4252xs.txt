Preoperative embolization of meningiomas can be safely performed using a variety of embolic agents. Most commonly, the vascular supply from branches of the external carotid artery is the target of embolization. In our report, we detail the treatment of a patient with a parafalcine meningioma that received its supply via branches of the anterior cerebral artery. One of the feeder vessels appeared to contain a dysplastic aneurysmal dilatation of the vessel. Due to patient circumstances, embolization was performed using standard microcatheterization techniques to minimize intraoperative blood loss. We report a rare instance of endovascular treatment of a pial vessel to treat an intracranial meningioma using Onyx.

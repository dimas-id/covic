OBJECTIVE This study presented outcomes of classical hysterotomy with modified antiprostaglandin therapy for intrauterine repair of foetal myelomeningocele (fMMC) performed in a single perinatal centre. STUDY DESIGN Forty-nine pregnant women diagnosed with fMMC underwent classic hysterotomy with anti-prostaglandin management, complete amniotic fluid replacement and high dose indomethacin application. RESULTS The average gestational age (GA) at delivery was 34.4 Â± 3.4 weeks, with no births before 30 weeks GA. There were 2 foetal deaths. Complete reversal of hindbrain herniation (HH), assessed in magnetic resonance imaging at 30-31 weeks GA was found in 72% of foetuses (mostly with HH grade I prior to fMMC repair). Our protocol resulted in rare use of magnesium sulphate (6%), low incidence of chorioamniotic membrane separation - chorioamniotic membrane separation (6%), preterm premature rupture of membranes - preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM; 15%) and preterm labour - preterm labour (PTL; 17%). The postoperative wound continuity of the uterus was usually stable (in 72% of patients), with low frequency of scar thinning (23%). CONCLUSION Our protocol results in rare use of tocolytics, and the low occurrences of CMS, pPROM and PTL in relation to other study cohorts: Management of Myelomeningocele Study, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Vanderbilt University Medical Centre.

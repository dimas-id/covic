After having read your recent Editorial "COVID 19 and the Patient with Obesity - The Editors Speak Out"1 , I wish to share my own personal experience. I am an anesthesiologist working on the frontline of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic at an academic and teaching establishment, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, in New York City. As Director of the Bariatric Anesthesia division, and an airway expert, I was assigned to our COVID Airway Team, in March 2020.

According to WHO 2018 report, 10 million people developed tuberculosis and 1.3 million died from it making it 1 of 10 deadliest diseases worldwide. Tuberculosis is caused by infection with the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). WHO recommends using a specific diagnostic kit Xpert MTB/RIF developed by Cepheid (California, United States). An alarming number of new cases (ca. 558,000) of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis was diagnosticated in 2017. In recent years, new diagnosis tools targeting the Mtb DNA biomarkers have emerged using a plethora of nanomaterials capable of delivering new technological approaches for the rapid diagnostics of TB and rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB). In this chapter, we summarized the state-of-the-art of the current available DNA biomarkers and the potential applications for the development of new diagnosis nanotechnology-based devices. The latter use carbonaceous nanomaterials (graphene and carbon nanotubes), noble metals (silver and gold), semi-conducting (metal oxides, magnetic beads, and quantum dots) in order to reveal and/or to amplify the signal after the recognition of target DNA biomarker. The readout techniques such as colorimetry, fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance, and electrochemical methods were also reviewed. Future is bright for point-of-care diagnostics with a sample-in answer-out approach that hampers user-error through miniaturization of biochip technology to the nanoscale range, which will enable their use by nonspecialized personnel.

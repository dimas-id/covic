The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created major challenges for all countries around the globe. Retrospective studies have identified hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and older age as risk factors for high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. There is a general concern that patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases, namely those on immunosuppressive therapies and/or those with more advanced kidney failure, could particularly be at risk for adverse outcomes due to a compromised antiviral immunity. Uncertainties exist on how management routines should be reorganized to minimize the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and what measures are necessary for infected patients. The aim of the present review of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Associationâ€“European Dialysis and Transplant Association is to provide recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases based on the available evidence, similar circumstances with other infectious organisms and expert opinions from across Europe. Such recommendations may help to minimize the risk of encountering COVID-19 or developing complications during COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated kidney disease.

Several case reports and small case series have been published on COVID-19 infection after solid organ transplantation, however, thus far there are limited data on COVID-19 infections in lung transplant patients. In the present single center case series we discuss 10 lung transplant patients with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, diagnosed with nasophanryngeal swab in 8 and broncho-alveolar lavage in 2. Eight /10 patients needed hospital admission, of whom 1 in the intensive care unit. He died after 2 weeks from multiple organ failure. The remaining 9 patients recovered. Cell cycle inhibitors were withheld in all patients, whereas the calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids were continued at the same dose, with an acceptable outcome.

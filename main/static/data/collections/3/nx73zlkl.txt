The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), as the global leadership body for pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists and pharmaceutical educators, coordinated and produced as of January 2020 an international response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FIP's response included professional guidance, a programme of digital events and other resources, as well as advocacy and policy tools to support national pharmacists' associations and academic institutions, as well as individual practitioners, in their response at country level. This article describes the strategy adopted by FIP in collaboration with an international group of experts to support the valuable service that pharmacists and their teams provide to communities throughout the pandemic, and their important contribution to easing the huge strain being placed on health systems around the world.

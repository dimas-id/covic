The COVID-19 global pandemic is an unprecedented health emergency. Insufficient access to testing has hampered effective public health interventions and patient care management in a number of countries. Furthermore, the availability of regulatory-cleared reagents has challenged widespread implementation of testing. We rapidly developed a qRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection assay using a 384-well format and tested its analytic performance across multiple nucleic acid extraction kits. Our data shows robust analytic accuracy on residual clinical biospecimens. Limit of detection sensitivity and specificity was confirmed with currently available commercial reagents. Our methods and results provide valuable information for other high-complexity laboratories seeking to develop effective, local, laboratory-developed procedures with high-throughput capability to detect SARS-CoV-2.

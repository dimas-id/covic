SUMMARY Coil displacement during endovascular coiling procedures may require coil retrieval in the context of flow limitation or thromboembolic risk. No standard recommended method of coil retrieval exists. We present a consecutive series of 14 patients with displaced coil during aneurysm coiling in whom the complication was effectively managed with the use of a stent retriever system. Two illustrative cases from the 14 are described, and technical notes are detailed regarding use of the technique. The use of stent retrievers presents a simple, safe, and effective choice for removal of prolapsed coils during aneurysm coiling.

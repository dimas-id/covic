Background and Aims Long-term outcomes of early combined immunosuppression [top-down] compared to conventional management [step-up] in recently diagnosed Crohn's disease [CD] are unknown. We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of participants of the Step-up/Top-down-trial. Methods Trial participants' medical records were reviewed retrospectively. For 16 semesters following the 2-year trial, we recorded: clinical activity, medication use, flares, hospitalization, surgery and fistulas. Colonoscopy reports were scored as: endoscopic remission, aphthous/small ulcers or large ulcers. The primary endpoint was the proportion of semesters in remission. Results Data were available from 119/133 patients [step-up n = 60]. During a median follow-up of 8 years, clinical remission rates were similar (70% vs 73% [p = 0.85] in step-up and top-down patients, respectively). A shorter time to flare was observed in step-up patients [median five vs nine semesters, p = 0.01]. Cumulatively, 62% of step-up patients used corticosteroids compared to 41% of top-down patients [p = 0.02]. Anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] use was higher in the step-up group [73% vs 54%, p = 0.04]. No differences were found in to time to CD hospitalization [respectively 13 vs 14 semesters, p = 0.30], new fistula [14 vs 15 semesters, p = 0.20] or CD surgery [14 vs 15 semesters, p = 0.25]. Mucosal healing 2 years after treatment was associated with a reduced anti-TNF use, but not with differences in other long-term outcomes. Endoscopic remission occurred at similar rates between groups. Conclusions Top-down treatment did not result in increased clinical remission during long-term follow-up, compared to step-up treatment. However, lower relapse rates and a reduced use of anti-TNF agents and corticosteroids were observed. No difference was found in rates of endoscopic remission, hospitalization, surgery or new fistulas.

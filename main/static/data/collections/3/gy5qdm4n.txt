Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystemic, autoimmune, inflammatory disorder predominantly affecting young females. Its onset may be abrupt or insidious, presenting with a broad range of clinical and immunological features. We report an unusual case of elderly-onset systemic lupus erythematosus in a woman initially diagnosed with discoid lupus, and subsequently admitted to hospital due to a progressive psycho-motor deficit. Electrophysiological measurements suggested a diagnosis of acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy. Unusual clinical features and negative serology led to diagnostic uncertainty. This case report offers information on the course of the disease through the entire chain of the health care delivery (from primary to tertiary). Despite the efforts of the hospital staff, it was not possible to save the life of the woman.

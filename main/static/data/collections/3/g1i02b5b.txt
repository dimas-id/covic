To help accelerate the development of antiviral therapies against COVID-19, CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society, has curated a data set of nearly 50,000 chemical substances with known or potential antiviral activity that could serve as potential leads The data set, which CAS has made publicly available through open access, was curated from the CAS Registry of more than 160 million chemical substances “We have this wealth of knowledge that we’re sitting on—these databases in science that we’ve built for the last 113 years—and we want to open up key parts of it to help accelerate treatments and/or vaccines to COVID-19,” says Michael Dennis, vice president for innovation at CAS Dennis says the idea for this data set came out of two tables in a recent publication by CAS in ACS Central Science that included antiviral and small molecules with potential therapeutic applications against COVID-19 (DOI: 10 1021/acscentsci 0c00272) The article has already received more than 200,000 views, and CAS wanted to expand this resource

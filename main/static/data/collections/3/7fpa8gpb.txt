BACKGROUND Percutaneous access for mitral interventions is currently limited to transapical and transseptal routes, both of which have shortcomings. We hypothesized that the left atrium could be accessed directly through the posterior chest wall under imaging guidance. METHODS AND RESULTS We tested percutaneous transthoracic left atrial access in 12 animals (10 pigs and 2 sheep) under real-time magnetic resonance imaging or x-ray fluoroscopy plus C-arm computed tomographic guidance. The pleural space was insufflated with CO2 to displace the lung, an 18F sheath was delivered to the left atrium, and the left atrial port was closed using an off-the-shelf nitinol cardiac occluder. Animals were survived for a minimum of 7 days. The left atrial was accessed, and the port was closed successfully in 12/12 animals. There was no procedural mortality and only 1 hemodynamically insignificant pericardial effusion was observed at follow-up. We also successfully performed the procedure on 3 human cadavers. A simulated trajectory to the left atrium was present in all of 10 human cardiac computed tomographic angiograms analyzed. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous transthoracic left atrial access is feasible without instrumenting the left ventricular myocardium. In our experience, magnetic resonance imaging offers superb visualization of anatomic structures with the ability to monitor and address complications in real-time, although x-ray guidance seems feasible. Clinical translation seems realistic based on human cardiac computed tomographic analysis and cadaver testing. This technique could provide a direct nonsurgical access route for future transcatheter mitral implantation.

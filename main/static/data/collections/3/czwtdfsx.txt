To assess the homology and phylogenetic relationship between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Anhui strains and other PEDV strains, molecular homology and phylogenetic analyses of Anhui PEDV field strains were compared with those of reference strains. The results revealed that the M and N genes of PEDV were 681 and 1326 bp long, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of the N genes of Anhui PEDV strains were 95.9-99.9% homologous with each other, and the deduced amino acid sequences were 92.5-99.8% homologous. Compared with the PEDV reference strains, the Anhui PEDV field strains had 94.1-99.5% nucleotide sequence homology in the N gene and 91.2-97.5% amino acid mutation homology in the N protein. The nucleotide sequences of the M genes of Anhui PEDV were 98.3-100% homologous, and the deduced amino acid sequences were 96.5-99.6% homologous. Compared with the PEDV reference strains, the Anhui PEDV field strains had 96.9-100% nucleotide sequence homology in the M gene and 96.5-99.6% amino acid homology in the M protein. The Anhui strains were genetically similar to USA strains (USA/Iowa/16465/2013 and USA/Indiana/17846/2013) but different from European (CV777;Br1/7), Korean (Chinju99), and Japanese (83p-5) strains.

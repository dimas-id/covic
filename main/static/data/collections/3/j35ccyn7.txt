MALDI MS profiling, using easily available body fluids such as blood serum, has attracted considerable interest for its potential in clinical applications. Despite the numerous reports on MALDI MS profiling of human serum, there is only scarce information on the identity of the species making up these profiles, particularly in the mass range of larger peptides. Here, we provide a list of more than 90 entries of MALDI MS profile peak identities up to 10 kDa obtained from human blood serum. Various modifications such as phosphorylation were detected among the peptide identifications. The overlap with the few other MALDI MS peak lists published so far was found to be limited and hence our list significantly extends the number of identified peaks commonly found in MALDI MS profiling of human blood serum.

Stress granules (SGs) are aggregates of translationally silenced messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes induced by oxidative, osmotic, hypoxic, thermal, viral, and genotoxic stresses. Over the past decade, extensive research has identified key components of SGs, their molecular interactions, and impact on stress‐induced reprogramming of protein expression and cell survival. However, studies defining the signaling pathways that modulate SG assembly have only been launched recently. These studies reveal that posttranslational modifications of selected SG proteins play important roles in the regulation of SG assembly and function. Here we provide an overview of the signaling pathways and posttranslational protein modifications that regulate the assembly and function of SGs. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 1..

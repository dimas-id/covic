Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the prototype of the coronavirus family, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 27Â·6 kilobase. Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease of chickens which results in significant economic losses in commercial broilers, layers and breeders. A rapid, highly sensitive and specific method is needed in the differential diagnosis of infections of different serotypes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark) serotypes of IBV. One common primer and two serotype specific primers were chosen from the S1 gene sequences of IBV and used in one PCR reaction. Under optimized PCR conditions, two serotype specific PCR products, 1026 bp for Mass and 896 bp for Ark, respectively, were amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoreses. The specificity of the technique was verified by using 20 different strains and isolates of IBV, and other avian bacterial and viral pathogens. Using a serial 10-fold dilution of the artificial mixture of both Mass and Ark samples, the detection limit was found to be 5 pg RNA after 35 cycles of PCR. The multiplex PCR was able to detect and differentiate both serotypes in embryonated eggs that were co-infected with different EID50virus titers of Mass 41 and Ark 99. The multiplex PCR developed in this study will be valuable for rapid identification, differential diagnosis, and epidemiological studies of these two serotypes of IBV infections.

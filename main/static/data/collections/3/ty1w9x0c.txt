The exopolymer (EPSp) produced by the strain B. licheniformis IDN-EC was isolated and characterized using different techniques (MALDI-TOF, NMR, ATR-FTIR, TGA, DSC, SEM). The results showed that the low molecular weight EPSp contained a long polyglutamic acid and an extracellular teichoic acid polysaccharide. The latter was composed of poly(glycerol phosphate) and was substituted at the 2-position of the glycerol residues with a αGal and αGlcNH(2). The αGal O-6 position was also found to be substituted by a phosphate group. The antiviral capability of this EPSp was also tested on both enveloped (herpesviruses HSV, PRV and vesicular stomatitis VSV) and non-enveloped (MVM) viruses. The EPSp was efficient at inhibiting viral entry for the herpesviruses and VSV but was not effective against non-enveloped viruses. The in vivo assay of the EPSp in mice showed no signs of toxicity which could allow for its application in the healthcare sector.

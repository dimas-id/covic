Over the past two decades, alongside the production of vaccines against many viruses, effective drugs have been developed for many other common viral infections. Initially, many of these drugs were available only for topical application because of their toxicity. However, advances in our knowledge of viral replication and of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of antiviral action have identified virus-specific targets for chemotherapeutic intervention with fewer side effects.

Every three months when I sit down to write this column, I always try to choose a contemporary topic that, even though I am writing a few months ahead of publication, will still be relevant when readers see it. But as I pen this piece, I have never felt more confident that, when this column publishes, COVID‚Äê19 will still be on everyone's mind.

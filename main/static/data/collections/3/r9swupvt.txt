Two pairs of PCR primers were designed to perform nested PCR targetting of a 540 bp fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene (N gene) of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The N gene of PEDV was amplified with 4 PEDV strains and 11 small intestines of PEDV-infected piglets collected from 2 farms in Kagoshima prefecture, Japan. Nucleotide sequences of the PCR products from a Korean and two Japanese strains (KKN96-1 and S1) of PEDV isolated in 1993 and 1996, respectively, were almost identical. These results suggest that the PCR is an available tool for detection of PEDV from pigs in the field, and that the two Japanese strains (KKN96-1 and S1) were genetically similar to the Korean strain.

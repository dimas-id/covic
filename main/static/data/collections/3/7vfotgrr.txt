Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS‐CoV‐2) has become a global health care crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immunocompromised patients, including those requiring immunosuppression following renal transplantation, as high risk for severe disease from SARS‐CoV‐2. Treatment for other viral infections in renal transplant recipients often includes a reduction in immunosuppression; however, no current guidelines are available recommending the optimal approach to managing immunosuppression in the patients who are infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. It is currently advised to avoid corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 outside of critically ill patients. Recently published cases describing inpatient care of COVID‐19 in renal transplant recipients differ widely in disease severity, time from transplantation, baseline immunosuppressive therapy, and the modifications made to immunosuppression during COVID‐19 treatment. This review summarizes and compares inpatient immunosuppressant management strategies of recently published reports in the renal transplant population infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and discusses the limitations of corticosteroids in managing immunosuppression in this patient population.

Time-sync comment (TSC) is a new form of user-interaction review associated with real-time video contents, which contains a user's preferences for videos and therefore well suited as the data source for video recommendations. However, existing review-based recommendation methods ignore the context-dependent (generated by user-interaction), real-time, and time-sensitive properties of TSC data. To bridge the above gaps, in this paper, we use video images and users' TSCs to design an Image-Text Fusion model with a novel Herding Effect Attention mechanism (called ITF-HEA), which can predict users' favorite videos with model-based collaborative filtering. Specifically, in the HEA mechanism, we weight the context information based on the semantic similarities and time intervals between each TSC and its context, thereby considering influences of the herding effect in the model. Experiments show that ITF-HEA is on average 3.78\% higher than the state-of-the-art method upon F1-score in baselines.

With the methods of molecular biotechnology it is possible today to produce therapeutical effectiv proteins in plants. So called edible vaccines can be used for active immunization as well as for passive immunization. For an efficient production of recombinant proteins a procedure was developed, in which only the leaves are treated with genetically modified bacteria instead of the time consuming regeneration of transgenic plants. With an orally applicated vaccine a complete systematic immune response can be induced, but in comparison to a parenteral injection, a 100 times higher dosis of the antigen is necessary. The immunogenity of antigens produced in plants was confirmed in several animal experiments. Clinical studies with recombinant antibodies of transgenic plants against the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans were successful. Future studies will focus on improved production rates, the search for suitable plant species and the phenomenon of oral tolerance.

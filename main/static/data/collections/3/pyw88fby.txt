Bats are reservoir hosts for several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens causing morbidity and mortality in wildlife, animal stocks and humans. Various viruses within the family Phenuiviridae have been detected in bats, including the highly pathogenic Rift Valley fever virus and Malsoor virus, a novel Banyangvirus with close genetic relation to Huaiyangshan banyangvirus (BHAV)(former known as Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, SFTSV) and Heartland virus (HRTV), both of which have caused severe disease with fatal casualties in humans. In this study we present the whole genome of a novel Banyangvirus, named Zwiesel bat banyangvirus, revealed through deep sequencing of the Eptesicus nilssonii bat virome. The detection of the novel bat banyangvirus, which is in close phylogenetic relationship with the pathogenic HRTV and BHAV, underlines the possible impact of emerging phenuiviruses on public health.

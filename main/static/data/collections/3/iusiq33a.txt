The pandemic of COVID-19 in early 2020 is a big challenge to the mechanism of major epidemic prevention and control, the national public health management system, as well as medical and health resources in China. Going through the COVID-19 crisis, we should fully understand the problems and vulnerabilities of the current public health system in China, and it is imperative to deepen and strengthen the public health system which should be throughout whole life cycle and whole process. Oral cavity is the first portal of human body, while illness finds its way in by the mouth. Oral health is highly related to general health and quality of life. The outbreak has drawn the public's attention to the public health system. The establishment and improvement of the oral public health system with the concept of "public health with Chinese characteristics" should also attract people's attentions and thoughts. Furthermore it is urgent to recognize the importance of oral public health.

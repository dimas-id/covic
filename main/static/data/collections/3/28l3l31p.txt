Respiratory syncytial virus causes significant disease in infants, the elderly and select groups of immunocompromised patients. Healthy individuals are also naturally infected with respiratory syncytial virus repeatedly throughout life. Therefore, safe and effective vaccines and therapies are needed. However, a number of factors have prevented development of such antiviral interventions to date. These include a failed vaccine trial, the very young age of the primary target population (neonates), the inability of natural infection to induce long-term protective immunity, and an incomplete understanding of virus-host interactions. The identification of pattern recognition receptors has led to significant increases in our understanding of induction and regulation of innate immune responses. This review will address the impact of these findings on respiratory syncytial virus research.

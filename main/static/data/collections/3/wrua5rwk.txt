Probestin is a potent aminopeptidase N (APN) inhibitor originally isolated from the bacterial culture broth. Here, we report probestin synthesis by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) method and evaluated its activity to inhibit angiogenesis using a chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and a CAM tumor xenograft model. Results from these studies demonstrate that probestin inhibits the angiogenic activity and tumor growth.

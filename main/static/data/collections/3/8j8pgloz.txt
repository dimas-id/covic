Since 2007, various urological procedures have been performed with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS surgery), including nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, simple prostatectomy and, with the refinement of laparoscopic instrumentation, radical prostatectomy. This paper reports our initial experience in radical prostatectomy using the SILS Port from Covidiem and two lateral 5-mm trocars for triangulation. The SILS Port allows for accurate, simple insertion through a Hadson incision. The flexible port accommodates three 5-mm cannulas or two 5-mm cannulas and a 12-mm port for easier instrument exchange through a single incision. This approach decreases morbidity from bleeding, hernia and/or internal organ damage and improves cosmetic. One-port single-incision laparoscopy is part of the natural development of minimally invasive surgery. Future research is required to assess the intraoperative and postoperative benefits of LESS surgery as compared to standard laparoscopy.

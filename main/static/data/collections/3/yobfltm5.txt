[Image: see text] The human innate immune system has evolved the means to reduce the bioavailability of first-row late d-block transition metal ions to invading microbial pathogens in a process termed “nutritional immunity”. Transition metals from Mn(II) to Zn(II) function as metalloenzyme cofactors in all living cells, and the successful pathogen is capable of mounting an adaptive response to mitigate the effects of host control of transition metal bioavailability. Emerging evidence suggests that Mn, Fe, and Zn are withheld from the pathogen in classically defined nutritional immunity, while Cu is used to kill invading microorganisms. This Account summarizes new molecular-level insights into copper trafficking across cell membranes from studies of a number of important bacterial pathogens and model organisms, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, to illustrate general principles of cellular copper resistance. Recent highlights of copper chemistry at the host–microbial pathogen interface include the first high resolution structures and functional characterization of a Cu(I)-effluxing P(1B)-ATPase, a new class of bacterial copper chaperone, a fungal Cu-only superoxide dismutase SOD5, and the discovery of a small molecule Cu-bound SOD mimetic. Successful harnessing by the pathogen of host-derived bactericidal Cu to reduce the bacterial load of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an emerging theme; in addition, recent studies continue to emphasize the importance of short lifetime protein–protein interactions that orchestrate the channeling of Cu(I) from donor to target without dissociation into bulk solution; this, in turn, mitigates the off-pathway effects of Cu(I) toxicity in both the periplasm in Gram negative organisms and in the bacterial cytoplasm. It is unclear as yet, outside of the photosynthetic bacteria, whether Cu(I) is trafficked to other cellular destinations, for example, to cuproenzymes or other intracellular storage sites, or the general degree to which copper chaperones vs copper efflux transporters are essential for bacterial pathogenesis in the vertebrate host. Future studies will be directed toward the identification and structural characterization of other cellular targets of Cu(I) trafficking and resistance, the physical and mechanistic characterization of Cu(I)-transfer intermediates, and elucidation of the mutual dependence of Cu(I) trafficking and cellular redox status on thiol chemistry in the cytoplasm. Crippling bacterial control of Cu(I) sensing, trafficking, and efflux may represent a viable strategy for the development of new antibiotics.

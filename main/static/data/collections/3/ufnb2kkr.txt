Flow diverters, the specially designed low porosity stents, have been used to redirect blood flow from entering aneurysm, which induces flow stasis in aneurysm and promote thrombosis for repairing aneurysm. However, it is not clear how thrombus develops following flow-diversion treatment. Our objective was to develop a computation model for the prediction of stasis-induced thrombosis following flow-diversion treatment in cerebral aneurysms. We proposed a hypothesis to initiate coagulation following flow-diversion treatment. An experimental model was used by ligating rat's right common carotid artery (RCCA) to create flow-stasis environment. Thrombus formed in RCCA as a result of flow stasis. The fibrin distributions in different sections along the axial length of RCCA were measured. The fibrin distribution predicted by our computational model displayed a trend of increase from the proximal neck to the distal tip, consistent with the experimental results on rats. The model was applied on a saccular aneurysm treated with flow diverter to investigate thrombus development following flow diversion. Thrombus was predicted to form inside the sac, and the aneurysm was occluded with only a small remnant neck remained. Our model can serve as a tool to evaluate flow-diversion treatment outcome and optimize the design of flow diverters.

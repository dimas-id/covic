In April 2020, a nationally representative sample of 4, 240 Canadians age 18 years and older were polled about COVID experience in March, early in the epidemic. We examined determinants of COVID symptoms, defined as fever plus difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, dry cough so severe that it disrupts sleep, and/or loss of sense of smell; and testing for SARS-CoV-2 by respondents and/or household members. About 8% of Canadians reported that they and/or one or more household members experienced COVID symptoms. Symptoms were more common in younger than older adults, and among visible minorities. Overall, 3% of respondents and/or household members had been tested for SARS-CoV-2. Being tested was associated with having COVID symptoms, being of Indigenous identity, and living in Quebec. Periodic nationally representative surveys, including high-risk older populations, of symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, are needed to understand the course of the Canadian epidemic and prepare for the future.

As the 2019 coronavirus pandemic has unfolded, an increasing number of atypical presentations of COVID-19 have been reported. As patients with COVID-19 often present to emergency departments for initial care, it is important that emergency clinicians are familiar with these atypical presentations in order to prevent disease transmission. We present a case of a 21-year-old woman diagnosed in our ED with COVID-19 associated parotitis and review the epidemiology and management of parotitis. We discuss the importance of considering COVID-19 in the differential of parotitis and other viral-associated syndromes and emphasize the importance of donning personal protective equipment during the initial evaluation.

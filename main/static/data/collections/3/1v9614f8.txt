The outbreak of unknown viral pneumonia in Wuhan China in December 2019 led to a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which attracted worldwide attention, with the related COVID-19 disease quickly becoming a global pandemic. In about 5 months, this disease has led to ~ 4 million cases and claimed more than 200 k deaths as a result of its highly contagious nature. The present understanding is that SARS-CoV-2 is a type of influenza virus that can be transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols; Lewis (Nature 580:175, 2020). The primary methodology to prevent the spreading of this disease has been “social distancing” and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the front lines of healthcare and other critical operations. The scale of the disease has led to unprecedented demand for PPEs and increased functionality of the same. This paper focuses on improving PPE functionality in a scalable manner by surface treatment and coating with appropriate materials and other functional enhancements, such as exposure to UV rays or other sterilizing agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide).

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a devastating demyelinating disease with a very high prevalence in North-East Scotland and in the Orkney and Shetland Islands. MS appears to be a multifactorial disorder with environmental and genetic elements and it has been proposed that these, in tandem, provoke an autoimmune response giving rise to the disease. Although there is no direct evidence of a specific virus being involved in MS, there are nevertheless grounds for suspecting a viral association. This review discusses these aspects of MS and suggests that a more aggressive approach to unravelling the role of viruses is needed.

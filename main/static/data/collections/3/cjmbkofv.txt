BACKGROUND: Apps have become part of our daily lives. Apps for pruritus could also play a role in the management of symptoms. AIM: The aim of this article is to review existing apps for pruritus. In addition, we will discuss whether these apps have been validated and how and which offers might still be lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The two largest app stores as well as PubMed and Google were searched for apps regarding pruritus. Relevant medical apps were documented and categorized with respect to their functions. PubMed was searched to identify validation studies. RESULTS: In total 21 apps for pruritus were identified. Of those 12 explicitly focused on pruritus, while 8 included pruritus as a symptom of an underlying disease (especially eczema and urticaria). The following app categories were derived: medical history of chronic pruritus, assessment of pruritus in clinical trials, assessment of nocturnal pruritus, information about pruritus, and diseases with pruritus as a symptom. Three of the apps with explicit focus on pruritus have been scientifically validated. DISCUSSION: There are different apps for pruritus available. Most apps which explicitly focus on pruritus are aimed at physicians and scientists, while apps for diseases with pruritus as a symptom are more patient-centered. Due to technological advances, apps and wearables could improve management of pruritus in the future.

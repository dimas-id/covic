Systematic testing for Bordetella pertussis in young infants with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) has been suggested, because the early clinical characteristics are difficult to recognise and distinguish from viral infections (1). Chlamydia trachomatis, a sexually transmitted disease passed on during birth, is also important (2-3). Recently, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels that include other respiratory bacteria have been implemented in clinical practice. Several studies have indicated that the atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae can cause community-acquired LRTIs in older children (4-5), but their role in young infants remains largely unknown.

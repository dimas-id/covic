BACKGROUND Initial weight loss after bariatric surgery has been associated with improvements in reproductive hormones and sexual functioning in women. Few studies have investigated the durability of these changes. OBJECTIVES The objective of this paper is to investigate changes in sex hormones, sexual functioning, and relevant psychosocial constructs over 4 years in women who underwent bariatric surgery. SETTING The setting is a prospective cohort of 106 women from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery consortium. METHODS Changes in sex hormones were assessed by blood assay. Sexual functioning, quality of life (QOL), body image, depressive symptoms, and marital adjustment were assessed by psychometric measures. RESULTS Women lost on average (95% confidence interval) 32.3% (30.4%, 34.3%) at postoperative year 3 and 30.6% (28.5%, 32.8%) at postoperative year 4. Compared to baseline, women experienced significant changes at 4 years in all hormones assessed, except estradiol. Women reported significant improvements in sexual functioning (i.e., arousal, desire, and satisfaction) through year 3, but these changes were not maintained through year 4. Changes in relationship quality followed a similar pattern. Improvements in physical aspects of QOL, body image, and depressive symptoms were maintained through 4 years. CONCLUSIONS Improvements in reproductive hormones and physical aspects of QOL, body image, and depressive symptoms were maintained 4 years after bariatric surgery. Improvements in sexual functioning, relationship satisfaction, and mental components of QOL eroded over time.

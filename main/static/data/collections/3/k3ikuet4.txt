OBJECTIVE To conduct a comprehensive literature review to develop recommendations for managing obesity among workers to improve health outcomes and to explore the impact of obesity on health costs to determine whether a case can be made for surgical interventions and insurance coverage. METHODS We searched PubMed from 2011 to 2016, and CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Registry of Clinical Trials for interventions addressing obesity in the workplace. RESULTS A total of 1419 articles were screened, resulting in 275 articles being included. Several areas were identified that require more research and investigation. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the use of both lifestyle modification and bariatric surgery to assist appropriate patients in losing weight.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) without resection of the distal stomach is largely performed over the world for morbid obesity. Potential risk of gastric remnant carcinoma development has been suggested. PURPOSE To present the results obtained after LRYGB with resection of distal stomach. METHOD This prospective study includes 400 consecutive patients. The mean body weight was 105.9 ± 16.8 Kg (range 83-145 kg), and body mass index (BMI) was 38.5 ± 4.4 kg/m2 (32.9-50.3). Postoperative morbid-mortality and follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS Operative time was 128.5 ± 18.7 min, hospital discharge occurred at 3rd postoperative day, postoperative complications occurred in 9.25%, early surgical complications were observed in 3% and medical complications 4%, late surgical complications occurred 2.25%, no mortality was observed. At 1 year follow-up, BMI was 25.3 ± 2.7 kg/m2 with % of weight loss (%WL) of 84.6 + 19.1%. At five years follow-up very similar values were observed. CONCLUSION The results obtained after LRYGB with resection of distal stomach are similar to results published after non resection LRYGB regarding early and late results and can be indicated in high risk areas of gastric carcinoma.

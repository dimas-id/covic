Abstract To comprehensively understand the endocytosis of Sapelovirus A (PSV) entry into PK-15 cells, we studied PSV infection in the context of cell perturbations through drug inhibition, siRNA silencing and overexpression of dominant negative (DN) mutants. We showed here that PSV infection of PK-15 cells was unaffected by pretreated with chlorpromazine, EIPA, knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain or overexpression of Eps15 DN mutant. Conversely, PSV infection was sensitive to NH4Cl, chloroquine, dynasore, nystatin, MÎ²CD and wortmannin with reduced PSV VP1 expression levels and virus titer. Additionally, PSV invasion leaded to rapid actin rearrangement and disruption of the cellular actin network enhanced PSV infection. After internalization the virus was transported to late endosomes and/or cycling endosomes that requires the participation of Rab7 and Rab11. Our findings demonstrate that PSV uses caveolae-dependent endocytosis as the predominant entry portal into PK-15 cells which requires low pH, dynamin, Rab7 and Rab11.

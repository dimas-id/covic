Budd‐Chiari‐like syndrome (BCLS) is a rare clinical entity characterised by portal hypertension and ascites. This report describes a case of BCLS in a cat due to obstruction at the level of the hepatic veins. The diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and a histopathological assessment of the liver demonstrating perivenular fibrosis around the central and sublobular veins. Although these lesions are similar to those observed in man with BCLS, the aetiology in this case remains unknown.

BACKGROUND Data concerning laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in mild obesity are under investigation. AIM/OBJECTIVE May 2010 to May 2012, 122 consecutive patients with preoperative body mass index (BMI) of 33 ± 2.5 kg/m² (range 30-34.9) undergoing LSG were studied. Mean age was 33 ± 10 years (range 15-60), and 105 (86%) were women. Mean preoperative weight was 91 ± 9.7 kg (range 66-121), and preoperative excess weight was 30 ± 6.7 kg (range 19-43). Comorbidities were detected in 44 (36%) patients. RESULTS Mean operative time was 58 ± 15 min (range 40-95), and postoperative stay was 1.8 ± 0.19 days (range 1.5-3). There were no admissions to intensive care unit and no deaths within 30 days of surgery. The rates of leaks and strictures were 0%, and of hemorrhage 1.6%. At 12 months, BMI decreased to 24.7 ± 2, and the percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) reached 76.5%. None of the patients had a BMI below 20 kg/m². Comorbidities resolved in 70.5% or improved in 29.5%. Patient satisfaction scoring (1-5) at least 1 year after was 4.6 ± 0.8 for body image and 4.4 ± 0.6 for food tolerance. CONCLUSION LSG for mildly obese patients has proved to be technically relatively easy, safe, and benefic in the short term.

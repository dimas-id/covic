Since the novel Coronavirus 2019, also known as COVID-19 or SARS CoV-2, crossed the Chinese borders and became pandemic, Italy has rapidly become the country with the highest number of patient deaths as well as confirmed and/or hospitalized patients, after China [1-2]. On March 12th Italy was declared a red-zone and special protocols were enacted to limit the spread of the virus. Although COVID-19 does not have epidermotropism, cutaneous manifestations in Cov-19 positive patients have been reported [3] and departments of dermatology are considered at high risk [4] and were ordered to admit only patients needing urgent treatments or undergoing chronic immunosuppressive therapy in order to minimize nosocomial virus spread.

There is growing evidence that mini-gastric bypass (MGB) is a safe and effective procedure. Operative outcome and long-term follow-up of a consecutive cohort of patients who underwent MGB are reported. The data on 1,000 patients who underwent MGB from November 2005 to January 2011 at an academic institution were reviewed. Mean age was 33.15 ± 10.17 years (range, 14-72), preoperative BMI was 42.5 ± 6.3 kg/m(2) (range, 26-75), mean preoperative weight was 121.6 ± 23.8 kg (range, 71-240), and 663 were women. Operative time and length of stay for primary vs. revisional MGB were 89 ± 12.8 min vs. 144 ± 15 min (p < 0.01) and l.85 ± 0.8 day vs. 2.35 ± 1.89 day (p < 0.01). No deaths occurred within 30 days of surgery. Short-term complications occurred in 2.7% for primary vs. 11.6% for revisionnal MGB (p < 0.01). Five (0.5%) patients presented with leakage from the gastric tube but none had anastomotic leakage. Four (0.4%) patients, all with revisional MGB, presented with severe bile reflux and were cured by stapling the afferent loop and by a latero-lateral jejunojejunostomy. Excessive weight loss occurred in four patients; two were reversed and two were converted to sleeve gastrectomy. Maximal percent excess weight loss (EWL) of 72.5% occurred at 18 months. Weight regain subsequently occurred with a mean variation of -3.9% EWL at 60 months. The 50% EWL was achieved for 95% of patients at 18 months and for 89.8% at 60 months. MGB is an effective, relatively low-risk, and low-failure bariatric procedure. In addition, it can be easily revised, converted, or reversed.

Asthma exacerbation can be a major life threatening event. Viruses have been pinned as the cause behind the vast majority of these exacerbations. The purpose of this short review is to explore the mechanisms behind these exacerbations, focusing mostly on viral infections as triggers. We will also be discussing the phenotypes prone to asthma exacerbation, the pathophysiology of viral induced asthma and ventilation patterns of asthmatic lungs. This manuscript will assist primary care physicians in delineating the proper pathophysiology of the disease as well as the management.

The newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is closely related to SARS-CoV which emerged in 2002. Studies on coronaviruses in general, and SARS in particular, have identified the virus spike protein (S) as being central to virus tropism, to the generation of a protective antibody response and to the unambiguous detection of past infections. As a result of this centrality SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a role in many aspects of research from vaccines to diagnostic tests. We describe a number of recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 S expressed in commonly available expression systems and their preliminary use in diagnostics and epitope mapping. These sources may find use in the current and future analysis of the virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes.

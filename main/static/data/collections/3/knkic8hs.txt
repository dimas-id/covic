The chemokine response of eight children with serologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was longitudinally monitored. All had raised plasma interferon gamma inducible protein (IP-10) concentrations, which suggested an active type 1 T-helper lymphocyte mediated immune response. High circulating IP-10 levels could facilitate viral clearance and might play a role in assisting the recovery of the patients.

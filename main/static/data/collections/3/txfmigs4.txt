The COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed health services in France during March 2020 and to cope service delivery was reduced in most disciplines. However as this was impossible for Obstetrics, COVID-19 infection had to be added to existing clinical care pathways in Necker Children's Hospital. This was further complicated by increasing number pregnancies affected by infection in addition to scientific uncertainty about the virus. Procedures based on scientific recommendations from French and international authorities were adapted to maternity care and regularly updated as the situation progressed. Weekly medical manager team meetings discussed the evolving clinical situation and initial evaluation found our procedures worked well. However, it was necessary to adapt the policy as the epidemic progressed rapidly. Shortly after the 16th March, traffic control bundling was implemented in anticipation of a dramatic increase in pregnant women affected by infection and to better protect staff. By the 18th April, with the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic receding, protocols were again readjusted to meet new service delivery requirements. Although a full debrief is yet to occur, from an operational level perspective, staff response was more than satisfactory. While preventing another epidemic maybe impossible, this experience will improve our resilience in the future.

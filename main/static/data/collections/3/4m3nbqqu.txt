The problem of fake news has become one of the most challenging issues having an impact on societies. Nowadays, false information may spread quickly through social media. In that regard, fake news needs to be detected as fast as possible to avoid negative influence on people who may rely on such information while making important decisions (e.g., presidential elections). In this paper, we present an innovative solution for fake news detection that utilizes deep learning methods. Our experiments prove that the proposed approach allows us to achieve promising results.

BACKGROUND The recovery of neurophysiological parameters at various time intervals following fatiguing exercise has been investigated previously. However, the repetition of neuromuscular assessments during the recovery period may have interfered with the true corticomotor excitability responses. In this experiment, fatiguing contractions were combined with a single post-fatigue assessment at varying time points. Ten participants undertook 5 bouts of 60-s maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the elbow flexors, separated by 20 min. Before and after each 60-s fatiguing exercise (FAT), participants performed a series of 6-s contractions at 100, 75 and 50% of their MVC during which transcranial magnetic, transmastoid electrical and brachial plexus electrical stimuli were used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEP), cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEP) and compound muscle action potentials (Mmax) in the biceps brachii muscle, respectively. Post-FAT measurements were randomly performed 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 s after each FAT. RESULTS MVC force declined to 65.1 ± 13.1% of baseline following FAT and then recovered to 82.7 ± 10.2% after 60 s. The MEP·Mmax-1 ratio recorded at MVC increased to 151.1 ± 45.8% and then returned to baseline within 60 s. The supraspinal excitability (MEP·CMEP-1) measured at MVC increased to 198.2 ± 47.2% and fully recovered after 30 s. The duration of post-MEP silent period recorded at MVC elongated by 23.4 ± 10.6% during FAT (all P < 0.05) but fully recovered after 15 s. CONCLUSIONS The current study represents the first accurate description of the time course and pattern of recovery for supraspinal and spinal excitability and inhibition following a short maximal fatiguing exercise in upper limb.

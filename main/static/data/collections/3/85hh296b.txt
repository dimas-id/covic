BACKGROUND Surgical site infection (SSI) is an important cause of morbidity and occasionally death after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. These infections also are associated with higher costs and poorer surgical outcomes. We used a retrospective observational database to examine and quantify the effects of the topical skin adhesive 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, used as the final layer of site closure in patients undergoing CABG surgery, on the incidence of post-operative SSI. METHODS All patients in the Premier Perspectiveâ„¢ Comparative Database of inpatient hospitalizations who underwent CABG surgery in 2005 and 2006 were identified. Qualifying patients were classified into four groups according to the method of surgical site closure on the basis of detailed hospital billing charges: Sutures only; sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate; sutures and staples; and sutures, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, and staples. Site infections were identified by a combination of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes, patterns of post-operative use of antibiotics, and All Patient Refined Diagnostic Related Group (APR-DRG) and Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) codes indicating post-operative infections at hospital re-admission. RESULTS A total of 59,006 patients qualified for the study: 38,799 who had sutures only; 10,262 having sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate; 8,180 having sutures and staples; and 1,765 having sutures, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, and staples. The lowest unadjusted rate of post-CABG SSI was found in the sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate group (4.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-4.7), followed by sutures only (5.3%; 95% CI 5.1-5.5); sutures and staples (6.2%; 95% CI 5.7-6.8); and sutures, staples, and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (7.1%; 95% CI 6.0%-8.4%). A logistic regression model that controlled for selected baseline patient, hospital, and surgical characteristics showed significantly lower rates of post-CABG SSI (odds ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.68-0.85) in patients closed with sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate relative to patients who had only sutures. CONCLUSIONS The observed rates of post-CABG SSI were consistent with the rates observed in the literature. The SSI rate for patients who had sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate used as the final layer of site closure was significantly lower than the rates for patients having other types of closure.

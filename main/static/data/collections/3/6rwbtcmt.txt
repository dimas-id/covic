PURPOSE To identify the concepts contained within health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcome measures used in concussion-specific research using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) as a reference. METHODS Eight electronic databases were searched from January 1, 1992 to March 12, 2017. Gray literature was searched, reference lists scanned, and relevant journals hand-searched. Agreement for inclusion was reached by consensus by two reviewers. A standardized data extraction tool was used to document study design, population, and key findings. Questionnaire items were linked as concepts to the corresponding second-level category of the ICF. Quality of studies was not assessed, as review was exploratory. RESULTS Five outcome measures met the inclusion criteria, including the Perceived Quality of Life Scale, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, Quality of Life after Brain Injury, WHOQOL-100, and WHOQOL-BREF. A total of 373 concepts were extracted. 34 questions were linked to activities and participation (50.7%), 16 questions (23.9%) referred to body functions, and 17 questions (25.4%) were related to the environment. CONCLUSIONS The wide range of concepts covered by different outcome measures demonstrates the complexity of recovery post-concussion and a lack of universal agreement in terms of what should be measured in this population. A working conceptual model of HRQOL post-concussion is proposed. Registration Prospero #CRD42017068241 (June 15, 2017).

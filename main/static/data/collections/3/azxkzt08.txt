Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is widely used to induce chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in animal models. Rodents are most commonly used to model COPD, but their substantial anatomic and physiological differences from humans present a challenge in the research of COPD pathogenesis. The authors induced COPD in miniature pigs by intratracheal administration of LPS solution. They carried out bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and collected the fluid for analyses of white blood cells, cytokines and proteases and obtained lung tissues for histological assessment. Intratracheal administration of LPS caused bronchitis, obstruction of distal bronchi and damage of pulmonary alveoli, as well as increases in white blood cell counts and expression levels of cytokines and proteases. These results are consistent with the presentation of COPD in humans, making LPS administration in miniature pigs a valuable animal model for the research of pathogenesis and treatment of COPD.

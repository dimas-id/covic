INTRODUCTION Cerebral oxygenation (rcSO2) monitoring in preterm infants may identify periods of cerebral hypoxia or hyperoxia. We hypothesised that there was a relationship between rcSO2 values and short term outcome in infants of GA < 32weeks. METHODS RcSO2 values were recorded for the first 48 h of life using an INVOS monitor with a neonatal sensor. The association between cranial ultrasound scan measured brain injury and rcSO2 was assessed. RESULTS 120 infants were included. Sixty-nine percent (83) of infants had a normal outcome (no IVH, no PVL, and survival at 1 month); less than one-quarter, 22% (26), had low grade IVH 1 or 2 (moderate outcome); and 9% (11) of infants had a severe outcome (IVH â‰¥ 3, PVL or died before 1 month age). rcSO2 values were lower for infants GA < 28weeks when compared with those GA 28-32, p < 0.001. There was no difference in absolute rcSO2 values between the three outcome groups but a greater degree of cerebral hypoxia was associated with preterm infants who had low grade 1 or 2 IVH. CONCLUSION Infants of GA < 28 weeks have lower cerebral oxygenation in the first 2 days of life. A greater degree of hypoxia was seen in infants with grade 1 or 2 haemorrhage. Normative ranges need to be gestation specific.

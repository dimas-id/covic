Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) has been indicated in patients with severe refractory respiratory failure from various causes for more than 30 years, even for the small infant.(1) Improved outcome from using ECMO for respiratory failure has been reported worldwide, ranging from 15% to over 50% in recent reviews.(1,2) The rationale of this therapy is to allow time for the lungs to heal, minimizing further lung injury from positive pressure ventilation.(3,4) We describe a case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with extensive barotrauma supported by VV-ECMO for 96 days in a resource-limited center. This is likely the longest ECMO support ever reported in a child.

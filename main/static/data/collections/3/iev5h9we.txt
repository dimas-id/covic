INTRODUCTION Since their introduction to the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) staging system in 2009, the role of Image-Defined Risk Factors (IDRFs) in predicting outcomes has been studied in heterogeneous populations with varying results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to determine quantitative measures of precisely how well pre-treatment IDRFs predict surgical outcomes and survival. METHODS A systematic review was performed for studies between January 1990 and July 2019 that compared surgical outcomes and/or survival in pediatric neuroblastoma patients with one or more IDRFs to patients without IDRFs. Summary risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS 19 retrospective cohort studies were included, representing data from 1132 patients. The risk ratio (RR) of incomplete surgical resection in IDRF-positive patients compared to IDRF-negative patients was 2.45 (95% CI 1.51-3.97). The RR of surgical complications was 2.30 (95% CI 1.46-3.61). The hazard ratio (HR) for 5-year EFS was 2.08 (95% CI 2.93-4.13) while the 5-year HR for OS was 2.44 (95% CI 1.46-4.08). CONCLUSION IDRF-positive neuroblastoma patients have a higher risk of incomplete surgical resection, surgical complications, and 5-year mortality and/or relapse. Our results affirm that IDRFs remain a useful prognostic tool for neuroblastoma patients both for short and long-term outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE II.

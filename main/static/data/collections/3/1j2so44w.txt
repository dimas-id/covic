We propose a time-fractional compartmental model (SEI$_A$I$_S$HRD) comprising of the susceptible, exposed, infected (asymptomatic and symptomatic), hospitalized, recovered and dead population for the Covid-19 pandemic. We study the properties and dynamics of the proposed model. The conditions under which the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable are discussed. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of the parameters and use the data from Tennessee state (as a case study) to discuss identifiability of the parameters of the model. The non-negative parameters in the model are obtained by solving inverse problems with empirical data from California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The basic reproduction number is seen to be slightly above the critical value of one suggesting that stricter measures such as the use of face-masks, social distancing, contact tracing, and even longer stay-at-home orders need to be enforced in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. As stay-at-home orders are rescinded in some of these states, we see that the number of cases began to increase almost immediately and may continue to rise until the end of the year 2020 unless stricter measures are taken.

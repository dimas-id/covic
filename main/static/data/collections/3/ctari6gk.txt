INTRODUCTION Tumor treating fields (TTF) is a unique treatment modality that utilizes alternating electric fields to deliver therapy. Treatment effects have been assessed in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma in clinical trials and retrospective studies. While the results of these studies led to FDA approval for both populations, a portion of the neuro-oncology and neurosurgery community remains skeptical of TTF. Thus, this review aims to systematically summarize and evaluate prior studies investigating the efficacy and safety of TTF in patients with high-grade gliomas. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines from database inception through February 2019. To be included, studies must have investigated the efficacy of TTF in adult high-grade glioma patients. RESULTS In total, 852 studies were initially identified, 9 of which met final inclusion criteria. In total, 1191 patients were identified who received TTF. Included studies consisted of two pilot clinical trials, two randomized clinical trials, and five retrospective studies. In randomized clinical trials, TTF improved survival for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients but not for recurrent glioblastoma patients. Adverse skin reactions were the primary adverse effect associated with TTF. CONCLUSION While TTF has been evaluated for safety and efficacy in a number of studies, concerns remain regarding study design, quality of life, and cost of therapy. Further investigation is needed regarding the therapy, and ongoing trials are already underway to provide more data regarding therapy outcomes and interactions in combination regimens.

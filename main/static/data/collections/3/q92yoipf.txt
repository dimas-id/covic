Emerging evidence shows that severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) can be complicated with coagulopathy, namely disseminated intravascular coagulation, which has a rather prothrombotic character with high risk of venous thromboembolism. The incidence of venous thromboembolism among COVID‐19 patients in intensive care units appears to be somewhat higher compared to that reported in other studies including such patients with other disease conditions. D‐dimer might help in early recognition of these high‐risk patients and also predict outcome. Preliminary data show that in patients with severe COVID‐19, anticoagulant therapy appears to be associated with lower mortality in the subpopulation meeting sepsis‐induced coagulopathy criteria or with markedly elevated d‐dimer. Recent recommendations suggest that all hospitalized COVID‐19 patients should receive thromboprophylaxis, or full therapeutic‐intensity anticoagulation if such an indication is present.

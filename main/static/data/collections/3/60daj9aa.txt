OBJECTIVES A series of 3(benzylideneamino)-2-phenyl quinazoline-4(3H)-ones was synthesized by reaction of 3-amino-2-phenyl-3H-quinazoline-4-one with various carbonyl compounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, 1H-NMR and mass spectral analysis. Title compounds were investigated for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS), herpes simplex virus-2 (G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus-1 TK-KOS ACVr, para influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, feline corona virus (FIPV), feline herpes virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A H1 N1 subtype, influenza A H3N2 subtype, influenza B and vesicular stomatitis virus. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Compound 3d was found inhibit viral replication of para influenza-3virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus in Vero cell cultures.

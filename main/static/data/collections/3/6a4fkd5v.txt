Pediatric patients with malignancies and transplant recipients are at high risk of infection-related morbidity and mortality. Children at the highest risk for infections are those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (HSCT). These patients are at high risk for life-threatening bacterial, viral, and fungal infections which are associated with prolonged hospital stay, poor quality of life, and increased healthcare cost and death. Recognition of risk factors which predisposes them to infections, early identification of signs and symptoms of infections, prompt diagnosis, and empiric/definitive treatment are the mainstay in reducing infection-related morbidity and mortality. Infection control and prevention programs also play a crucial role in preventing hospital-acquired infections in these immunosuppressed hosts.

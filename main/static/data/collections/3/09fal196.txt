BACKGROUND The need for cosmetic results in our society and the necessity of an early recovery have promoted the development of minimally invasive techniques, including single-port approach. Some studies have tried to demonstrate the advantages of this access compared with conventional laparoscopic approach. This type of approach requires a high-cost multi-port device, so that some surgeons have tried to create a low-cost homemade device. MATERIALS AND METHODS With this video we intend to show how to build a glove port, a low-cost alternative for the approach by a single port. CONCLUSIONS A glove port is a cost effective approach that could be use instead of multi-port device.

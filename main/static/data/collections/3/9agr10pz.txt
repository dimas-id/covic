Low and high passaged cell culture strains of TGE coronavirus were examined for stability in gastric and small intestine juices collected in 3-6 month-old pigs killed at different times after last feeding. Results revealed high fragility of the TGE virus in these digestive liquids. Differences in stability were observed between strains of TGE virus. But no correlation could be made between the level of stability and cell passage status of the virus strain. We conclude that the stability of TGE coronavirus in gastric and small intestine juices could not be considered as a genetic marker of virulence. In future, it will be necessary to take into account these data concerning fragility of TGE coronavirus for improvement of oral vaccination methods in pregnant sows using a live virus vaccine.

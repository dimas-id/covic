Radiofrequency ablation is the most commonly used percutaneous ablation technique and well-documented in the literature on focal therapies. It has become the image-guided ablation method of choice because of its efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Radiofrequency ablation has shown promise in treating selected solid tumors, particularly those involving the liver, kidneys, lungs, and the musculoskeletal system. It is a minimally invasive technique often used in inoperable patients with other comorbidities. Radiofrequency ablation requires a minimal hospital stay or can be performed on an outpatient basis. The aim of this article is to review radiofrequency ablation techniques and their clinical applications.

Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a serious complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, the criteria for prompting drainage have not been clarified yet. We evaluated 80 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between 2011 and 2016. Clinically relevant POPF (International Study Group of Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula grade B or C) was evaluated on the basis of the following parameters: changes in pancreatic thickness between preoperation and postoperative day (POD) 4 identified via enhanced CT, drain amylase level, laboratory data, and operative factors. POPF occurred in 21 patients (26.3%). The median change in pancreatic thickness before and after operation was 8.33 mm in the POPF-positive group, which was significantly larger than that in the POPF-negative group (3.79 mm, P <0.001). In addition, operation time, pancreatic texture, main pancreatic duct diameter, WBC count, C-reactive protein level, and drain amylase level demonstrated significant differences between the groups. In the multivariate analysis, operation time, C-reactive protein level on POD 3, drain amylase level on POD 1, and the change in pancreatic thickness before and after operation were independent risk factors of POPF. The drastic change in pancreatic thickness before and after operation predicted POPF in this study. This might be one of the factors that determine the requirement for drainage.

A host of bacteria and viruses are dependent on O-linked and N-linked glycosylation to perform vital biological functions. Pathogens often have integral proteins that participate in host-cell interactions such as receptor binding and fusion with host membrane. Fusion proteins from a broad range of disparate viruses, such as paramyxovirus, HIV, ebola, and the influenza viruses share a variety of common features that are augmented by glycosylation. Each of these viruses contain multiple glycosylation sites that must be processed and modified by the host post-translational machinery to be fusogenically active. In most viruses, glycosylation plays a role in biogenesis, stability, antigenicity and infectivity. In bacteria, glycosylation events play an important role in the formation of flagellin and pili and are vitally important to adherence, attachment, infectivity and immune evasion. With the importance of glycosylation to pathogen survival, it is clear that a better understanding of the processes is needed to understand the pathogen requirement for glycosylation and to capitalize on this requirement for the development of novel therapeutics.

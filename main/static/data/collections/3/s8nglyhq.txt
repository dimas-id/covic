This article describes Australia's broad disaster recovery planning and management approach, adopting a social and community recovery perspective. The role of social work in Australian disaster recovery management is discussed, and its increasing assertion and maturation of practice. Theoretical underpinnings include trauma, grief, and crisis intervention. Strengths-based, solution-focused approaches to intervention, and a sound understanding of community development principles, are essential to facilitating community recovery. Two examples (flood and bushfire) illustrate the full spectrum of planning, immediate psychosocial response, and longer term community and individual recovery. Issues such as effective multiagency practice, individual case management, and consideration of vulnerable groups are highlighted.

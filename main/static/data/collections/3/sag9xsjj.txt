Abstract: The Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a rapid molecular diagnostic test particularly designed for on-site, rapid turnaround point of care (POC) testing. The utilization of rapid diagnostic tests is integral to optimizing workflow within the hospital and/or procedural-based clinics. The capability to provide both rapid disposition and correct patient classification during this COVID-19 pandemic is critically important with broad infection control implications for both patients and healthcare staff. A tightly controlled, extended laboratory validation was performed at our medical center to determine the negative test agreement of the Abbott ID NOW compared with the BD MAX analyzer, a laboratory-based, two target, molecular analyzer with a sensitive cycle threshold (Ct) positive cutoff value of 42. There was strict adoption of the procedures listed in the Abbott ID NOW Instruction for Use (IFU)1 insert delineating preferred practices for optimal test performance. Under these conditions, our institution demonstrated a significant negative percent agreement with 116 out of 117 patients correlating, which equates to a 99.1% concordance similar to a recently reported correlation study2.

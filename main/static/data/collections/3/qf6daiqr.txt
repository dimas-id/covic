Respiratory viruses are well‐known causes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE‐COPD) and also important pathogens for concomitant pneumonia in COPD (CP‐COPD). However, the differences in a viral infection pattern and clinical impacts of respiratory viruses between the two groups have not been well investigated. The clinical and microbiological data from COPD patients admitted with AE‐COPD (n = 281) or CP‐COPD (n = 284) between January 2010 and December 2012 were reviewed. After excluding 88 patients (40 with AE‐COPD and 48 with CP‐COPD) who did not undergo a multiplex RT‐PCR test for respiratory viruses, the demographic characteristics, identified viruses, and clinical outcomes of the AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD groups were compared. Respiratory viruses were identified in 41.9% of AE‐COPD group and 33.5% of the CP‐COPD groups. The most common virus was influenza virus in the AE‐COPD group (33.7%) versus human coronavirus (24.1%) in the CP‐COPD group. Influenza virus was significantly more common in the AE‐ACOPD group than in the CP‐COPD group (P < 0.01). In‐hospital mortality of AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD were 1.2% and 12.3%, respectively (P < 0.01). Among CP‐COPD patients, in‐hospital mortality of patients with only viral infection group, only bacterial infection group, and viral‐bacterial co‐infection were 2.6%, 25.8%, and 17.5%, respectively (P = 0.01). Respiratory viruses were commonly identified in both AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD, influenza virus and human coronavirus were the most common viruses identified in AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD patients, respectively. The mortality rates of only viral infection group was significantly lower than only bacterial infection or viral‐bacterial co‐infection group in CP‐COPD patients. J. Med.

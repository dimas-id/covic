The challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic become amplified in the setting of non-intubated patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Unlike the closed system that characterizes an intubated patient attached to a respiratory circuit, non-invasive ventilatory support threatens an increased risk of permeating the clinical workspace with airborne viral particles. Patients with sleep apnea may mandatorily require non-invasive ventilation strategies to see them through a respiratory illness. In this infographic, the considerations and general principles of managing non-invasive ventilation in such a scenario are outlined. The reader is encouraged to review the article in its entirety for a full depth of understanding.

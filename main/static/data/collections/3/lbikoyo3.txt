OBJECTIVES: The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonize the transcriptional activation of antiviral response elements. METHODS: HCoV-OC43 structural (membrane M and nucleocapsid N) and accessory proteins (ns2a and ns5a) were expressed individually in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells. The transcriptional activation of antiviral response elements was assessed by measuring the levels of firefly luciferase expressed under the control of interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE), IFN-β promoter, or nuclear factor kappa B response element (NF-κB-RE). The antiviral gene expression profile in HEK-293 cells was determined by PCR array. RESULTS: The transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-β promoter, and NF-κB-RE was significantly reduced in the presence of HCoV-OC43 ns2a, ns5a, M, or N protein, following the challenge of cells with Sendai virus, IFN-α or tumor necrosis factor-α. The expression of antiviral genes involved in the type I IFN and NF-κB signaling pathways was also downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 structural or accessory proteins. CONCLUSION: Both structural and accessory HCoV-OC43 proteins are able to inhibit antiviral response elements in HEK-293 cells, and to block the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.

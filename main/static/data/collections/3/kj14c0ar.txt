PURPOSE To report our short-term and long-term experience with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) using a bioabsorbable plug. METHODS Patients who underwent LIHR from 2009 to 2011 using a bioabsorbable plug and synthetic mesh patch were reviewed retrospectively. Short-term follow-up information was obtained within 30 days of surgery, whereas long-term follow-up was obtained in 2014. Quality of life was assessed using the Carolinas Comfort Scale. RESULTS Forty-four patients (43 male), including 6 (13.6%) with recurrent disease, underwent 52 LIHR with a bioabsorbable plug. Mean age and body mass index were 60.9 ± 10.5 years and 27.9 ± 4.7 kg/m, respectively. Among 39 (88.6%) patients available for short-term follow-up, early postoperative complications were seen in 10 (25.6%) patients, all of which resolved spontaneously. Mean long-term follow-up duration was 41.6 ± 4.1 months, among 30 (68.2%) patients (40 hernia repairs). There were 2 (5%) hernia recurrences, with 1 requiring a reoperation 12 months after initial repair. Only 2 (6.7%) patients reported moderate or bothersome chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS Bioabsorbable plug combined with a synthetic mesh is safe and effective for use during LIHR. The technique offers an acceptable incidence of chronic pain and recurrence.

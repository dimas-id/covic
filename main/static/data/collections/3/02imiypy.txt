Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Confederation has referred to « vulnerable populations » over the age of 65 and/or with co-morbidities as potentially at risk. This group should not overshadow other highly vulnerable populations such as forced migrants, people deprived of their liberty, and the homeless. In the context of the current pandemic, there is a risk of increasing inequities in care among these populations. In this practical article, we list the marginalized and disadvantaged left behind populations in the canton of Vaud and the issues of inequities in care in the context of the pandemic; we also present the implementation of procedures sometimes original, always inter-professional and interdisciplinary, specifying who the partners are and what the resources are for front-line caregivers.

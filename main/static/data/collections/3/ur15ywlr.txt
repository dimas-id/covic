Development of the functionalization of triterpenoids to A-secoamidoximes, A-secomethylenamines, and branched 3-(3-aminopropylamino)-3-(3-aminopropoxy)amidoximes is illustrated by the betulonic acid ketoxime. An effective way to get of the derivatives of 20,29-dihydrolupanes using diborane is suggested. The antiviral and antituberculosis activity data of some compounds are presented.

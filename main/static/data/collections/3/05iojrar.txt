When studying mathematics, it is important to solve exercises of an appropriate level. Recently, web-based assessment systems with a computer algebra system (CAS), e.g., Moodle with Stack and the Möbius platform with Maple, have become popular. Such web-based systems are convenient; however, they have some problems relative to inputting and evaluating mathematical formulas. In addition, when considering and solving mathematical problems, handwriting mathematics is important. We want management system of paper-oriented exercises. Auto multiple choice (AMC), which was developed by Alexis Bienvenüe, is open source software for creating and managing multiple choice questionnaires with automated marking. [Image: see text] is the native AMC language for questionnaire descriptions. We propose to combine AMC and CAS using Lua [Image: see text] , which is a [Image: see text] -based computer typesetting system with an embedded Lua scripting engine. We can embed CAS scripts into Lua [Image: see text] source, and, by creating exercises with CAS, we can generate various problems with random coefficients or terms. By providing various patterns of practice problems and facilitating discussions with each student, we expect sufficient educational benefits of providing opportunities to communicate about mathematical concepts and algorithms among students.

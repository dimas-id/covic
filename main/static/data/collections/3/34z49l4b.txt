Contact tracing is paramount to fighting the pandemic but it comes with legitimate privacy concerns. This paper proposes a system enabling both, contact tracing and data privacy. We propose the use of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment to build a privacy-preserving contact tracing backend. While the concept of a confidential computing backend proposed in this paper can be combined with any existing contact tracing smartphone application, we describe a full contact tracing system for demonstration purposes. A prototype of a privacy-preserving contact tracing system based on SGX has been implemented by the authors in a hackathon.

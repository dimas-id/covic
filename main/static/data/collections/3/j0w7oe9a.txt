BACKGROUND The Silastic ring vertical gastroplasty (SRVG), a newer modification of Mason's vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), was the restrictive procedure of choice for many bariatric surgeons before the advent of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. However, a high rate of reoperations for failure and severe complications was reported in long-term studies. Around 50% of the patients underwent conversion to other bariatric procedures. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to report our experience in laparoscopic conversion of failed VBG and SRVG to biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). SETTINGS The setting of the study was at the University hospital. METHODS Between March 2010 and July 2013, 12 patients underwent laparoscopic conversion of VBG and SRVG to BPD. Using a prospectively collected database, we analyzed their data and outcomes. RESULTS Eighty-six percent of the conversions were successfully completed laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 220 min. There was no mortality. Perioperative complications occurred in four patients (33%). One (9%) late complication, an adhesional small bowel obstruction, was encountered later than 30 days postoperatively. The follow-up rate was 100%, but only three patients reached 3 years at the time of this writing. At a mean follow-up of 19 (3-40) months, the mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 45.3 to 27.8 kg/m2. Percent excess weight loss (EWL) was 65.7, and 86.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic conversion of failed VBG to BPD is feasible and effective in further reducing weight in morbidly obese patients. Weight loss continues beyond the first postoperative year. However, the complication rate is much higher than in the primary procedure.

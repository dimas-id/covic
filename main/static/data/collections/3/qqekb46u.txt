OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of homemade proximal scalloped stent grafts for thoracic endovascular aortic repair of zone 2 acute aortic syndrome. METHODS Between May 2015 and December 2015, 10 patients with unremitting symptoms or rupture secondary to an acute aortic syndrome involving zone 2 underwent urgent or emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Among them, 8 were treated using homemade proximal scalloped stent grafts to preserve the patency of the left subclavian artery. Indications included traumatic transection (n = 3) and acute (n = 4) and subacute (n = 1) complicated type B aortic dissection. Follow-up computed tomography scans were performed at 1 week and 3 and 6 months. RESULTS The median duration for stent graft modification was 15 minutes (range, 14-17 minutes). The technical success rate was 100%; sealing was achieved in all cases with no type I endoleaks. All left subclavian arteries were patent, although 1 case was associated with a 50% stenosis. No deaths occurred as a consequence of the aortic repair, but 1 patient died of a traumatic renal hematoma on postoperative day 5. During a mean follow-up of 7.2 Â± 2 months, there were no conversions to open surgical repair, aortic ruptures, paraplegia, retrograde dissection, or other aortic complications. CONCLUSIONS The use of the homemade proximal scalloped stent graft is both feasible and effective for left subclavian artery revascularization during thoracic endovascular aortic repair involving a spectrum of acute thoracic aortic pathology. This approach provides a rapid, reproducible method of scalloping the endograft. Durability concerns will need to be assessed in additional studies with long-term follow-up.

Background Right anterior mini-thoracotomy (MIAVR) is a promising technique for aortic valve replacement. We aimed at comparing its outcomes with those obtained in a propensity-matched group of patients undergoing sternotomy at our two high-volume centers. Methods Main clinical and operative data of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement between January 2010 and May 2016 were retrospectively collected. A total of 678 patients were treated with a standard full sternotomy approach, while MIAVR was performed in 502. Propensity score matching identified 363 patients per each group. Results In-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the propensity-matched groups (1.7% in MIAVR patients vs. 2.2% in conventional sternotomy patients; P=0.79). No significant difference in the incidence of major post-operative complications was observed. Post-operative ventilation times (median 7, range 5-12 hours in MIAVR patients vs. median 7, range 5-12 in conventional sternotomy patients; P=0.72) were not significantly different between the two groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass time (61.0±21.0 vs. 65.9±24.7 min in conventional sternotomy group; P<0.01) and aortic cross-clamping time (48.3±16.7 vs. 53.2±19.6 min in full sternotomy group; P<0.01) were shorter in MIAVR group. EuroSCORE (OR 1.52, 95% CI, 1.12-2.06; P<0.01) was found to be the only independent predictor of intra-hospital mortality in the whole propensity-matched population. Conclusions Our experience shows that mini-access isolated aortic valve surgery is a reproducible, safe and effective procedure with similar outcomes and no longer operative times compared to conventional sternotomy.

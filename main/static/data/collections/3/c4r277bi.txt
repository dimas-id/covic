We report a case of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in a pregnant woman in the third trimester with good maternal and infant outcomes. The patient was admitted to the Second People&apos;s Hospital of Hefei on February 11, 2020, because of a "positive novel coronavirus nucleic acid test result for one day" at 38 weeks of gestation. No abnormality was observed during her previous regular prenatal examinations. A throat swab sample was obtained from the patient four days before admission due to the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in her husband and sister on the 14th and 7th day before her admission, and the new coronavirus nucleic acid test showed positive. The patient reported no discomfort before admission. Chest CT on the 3rd after admission showed a small amount of bilateral pleural effusion. Irregular contractions occurred three days after admission and labor was considered to be imminent. An emergency cesarean section was performed and the patient delivered a live baby girl. No tests were performed on amniotic fluid, cord blood or placenta for new coronavirus nuclei acid. The patient was isolated from the infant without breastfeeding after surgery. All medical staff involved in the cesarean section were isolated after surgery. Neonatal peripheral blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for the new coronavirus nucleic acid tests on the day of birth and one day of age respectively, and nasopharyngeal swabs and anal suabs were taken at nine days after birth.

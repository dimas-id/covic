Communicable diseases that are endemic (always present in a population ) cause many deaths). For example, in 2011 tuberculosis caused an estimated 1,400,000 deaths and HIV/AIDS caused an estimated 1,200,000 deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization there were 627,000 deaths caused by malaria, but other estimates put the number of malaria deaths at 1,2000,000. Measles, which is easily treated in the developed world, caused 160,000 deaths in 2011, but in 1980 there were 2,600,000 measles deaths. The striking reduction in measles deaths is due to the availability of a measles vaccine. Other diseases such as typhus, cholera, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness are endemic in many parts of the world. The effects of high disease mortality on mean life span and of disease debilitation and mortality on the economy in afflicted countries are considerable. Most of these disease deaths are in less developed countries, especially in Africa, where endemic diseases are a huge barrier to development.

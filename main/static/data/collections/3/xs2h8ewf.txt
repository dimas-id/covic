BACKGROUND Gynandroblastoma is an extremely rare ovarian sex cord tumor with malignant potential. CASE An 18-year-old adolescent experienced intermittent vaginal bleeding. A year later, a right adnexal mass with a heterogeneous imaging appearance was identified. Laparoendoscopic single-site ovarian tumorectomy was performed. A histopathological examination showed gynandroblastoma composed of juvenile granulosa and Sertoli-Leydig cells. Because the tumor was upstaged to stage Ic because of cyst rupture during surgery, three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel were added. Three years after surgery, no signs of recurrence have been noted. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The present findings can help clinicians make an accurate preoperative imaging diagnosis of gynandroblastoma with a juvenile granulosa cell component and plan an adequate treatment strategy for this rare, potentially malignant neoplasm.

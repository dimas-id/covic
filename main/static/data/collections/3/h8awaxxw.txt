Summary In late 2019, the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus emerged from the animal world and crossed to humans. The COVID-19 epidemic broke out in China and was declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. In France, hospitals in three regions experienced a massive influx of people with severe forms. COVID-specific units appeared. Within the hospital, the SARS-Cov-2 diagnostic announcement and palliative support (when indicated) required a specific approach to be developed. In an acute COVID geriatric unit, how should the diagnosis of this disease be disclosed in the setting of such intense hospital activity? What are the challenges to be met in order to offer appropriate support for these elderly people suffering from this new disease? This question is even more pressing in the setting of generalised lockdown.

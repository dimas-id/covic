Coil migration during endovascular procedures is not an unusual complication, but there is no standard management strategy for bailout. Here, we describe a technique for removal of a migrated coil using a snare. During embolization of type II endoleak from the inferior mesenteric artery in a post-endovascular aneurysm repair patient, the coil migrated to the sigmoidal artery causing an occlusion. We used a microsnare loop and successfully retrieved the migrated coil. This is the first case in Korea that uses a loop snare for the removal of a migrated coil during visceral endovascular treatment to our knowledge. This technique of using a microsnare for removal of displaced coils can be a good resort in selected cases.

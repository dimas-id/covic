BACKGROUND An inguinoscrotal hernia is defined as "giant" if descending below the midpoint of the inner thigh of a patient in upright position. In developed countries this is a rare entity. In the literature different surgical techniques have been reported so far to achieve a successful treatment. CASE PRESENTATION We present the case of a 63 year-old man suffering from a giant inguinoscrotal hernia, whom we treated using a combined open transabdominal and inguinal approach following an unsuccessful laparoscopic attempt. Meshes were placed in a premuscular position (Lichtenstein's procedure) and in a preperitoneal position. In addition, a reconstruction of the abdominal wall by modified components separation technique was performed. During the early postoperative period no complications were registered. Intensive care treatment was not necessary. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8 in an excellent condition. Six months after surgery a scrotal hematocele was diagnosed and operatively removed. After a follow-up of 1.5 years neither hernia recurrence, nor chronic groin pain were recorded. The patient reported to be sexually active. His quality of life improved notably. Additionally, a Medline and PubMed database research was performed to create an overall picture of the existing surgical treatment strategies. Included were patients with diagnosis of primary giant inguinoscrotal hernia according to the given definition. Emergency interventions and cases without details of the surgical approach were excluded. CONCLUSIONS Firstly, this report describes a novel, successful surgical treatment of a giant inguinoscrotal hernia without administering preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum therapy or visceral resection. Secondly, we summarize cases previously reported as a practical guide for possible surgical therapy approaches.

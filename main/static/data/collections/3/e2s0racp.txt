OBJECTIVE: Tumour necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2) has strong anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is unknown whether increased TIPE2 is protective against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether increased TIPE2 can exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by LPS. METHODS: We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Three weeks later, ALI was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS into BALB/c mice. Twenty-four hours later, lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was acquired to analyse cells and protein, arterial blood was collected for arterial blood gas analysis and the determination of pro-inflammatory factor levels, and lung issues were collected for histologic examination, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TUNEL staining, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis and blot analysis of protein expression. RESULTS: We found that TIPE2 overexpression markedly mitigated LPS-induced lung injury, which was evaluated by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio, and total protein expression in the BALF. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression markedly attenuated lung inflammation, as evidenced by the downregulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the BALF, lung MPO activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression not only dramatically prevented LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice but also blocked LPS-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the increased expression of AAV-mediated TIPE2 in the lungs of mice inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis and suppresses the activation of NF-κB and JNK in a murine model of ALI.

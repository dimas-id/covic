OBJECTIVES The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was specifically created to assessdepression in cancer patients. However, to date, the CES-D has not been validated in Farsi. Therefore, this study aimed toassess the psychometric properties of the CES-D in Iranian cancer patients. METHODS During a three-month period(October to December, 2015), a total of 380 cancer patients completed a Farsi version of the CES-D. The constructvalidity of the scale was evaluated by exploratory factor analysis. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alphaand McDonald Omega. All of the statistical procedure were run by SPSS 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS The construct validity of the CES-D determined three factors (somatic affect, negative affect, and positive affect),which explained 65.60% of the total variance. The internal consistency was greater than 0.70. CONCLUSION Findingsrevealed that the Farsi version of the CES-D has acceptable validity and reliability, which can be used to measuredepression in Iranian cancer patients.

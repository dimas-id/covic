The common cold is an important illness both as a result of the economic impact of this common disease and because of the morbidity associated with the complications of the illness. Recent attempts to develop antiviral treatments for the common cold represent a substantial advance over previous efforts. Formidable barriers remain to be overcome, however, before any of these new products will be proven to be clinically useful. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of common cold symptoms have provided insights into potential new targets for the treatment of this illness.

Wild mice trapped near Lake Casitas (LC) in southern California showed a high prevalence of infectious type C virus in the liver, spleen, and thymus within the first few weeks of life. By young adulthood about 80% of LC mice (including their genital tissues) were infected. Virus isolates from these mice cause lymphoma and lower limb paralysis under both natural and experimental conditions. Mice destined to develop paralysis showed higher levels of serum gs antigen early in life, whereas mice destined to develop lymphoma or remain free of these diseases could not be distinguished by this test. The individual variation in virus expression suggested that differences in virus type or in the immune or other host defense mechanisms greatly influenced susceptibility or resistance to indigenous type C virus-caused disease in LC wild mice.

INTRODUCTION Unruptured brain aneurysms (UIAs) present a challenge due to the lack of definitive understanding of their natural history and treatment outcomes. As the treatment of UIAs is aimed at preventing the possibility of rupture, the immediate risk of treatment must be weighed against the risk of rupture in the future. As such, treatment for a large proportion of UIAs is currently individualized. AREAS COVERED In this article, we discuss the important natural history studies of UIAs and discuss the existing scientific evidence and recent advances that help identify the rupture risk guide management of UIAs. We also address the recent advances in pharmacological therapy of UIAs. Expert commentary: In the recent years, there have been great advances in understanding the pathophysiology of UIAs and determining the rupture risk going beyond the traditional parameter of aneurysm size. Aneurysm morphology and hemodynamics play a pivotal role in growth and rupture. A true randomized trial for the management of UIAs is the need of the hour.

Analysis of the sequence of a number of proteins of the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was used to theoretically predict antigenic epitopes. Nine sequences, encoding for the predicted epitopes in spike, nucleocapside, and membranous SARS CoV proteins, were synthesized by polymyrase chain reaction and cloned into the pGEX 4-T2 vector. The resultant plasmids were expressed in the E. coil cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography.

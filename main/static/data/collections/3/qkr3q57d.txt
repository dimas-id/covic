Abstract Background The use of chest CT in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic raises concern regarding the transmission risks to patients and staff caused by CT room contamination. Meanwhile the CDC guidance for air exchange in between patients may heavily impact workflows. Purpose To design a portable custom isolation device to reduce imaging equipment contamination during a pandemic. Methods CDC air exchange guidelines and requirements were reviewed. Device functional requirements were outlined and designed. Engineering requirements were reviewed. Methods of practice and risk mitigation plans were outlined including donning and doffing procedures and failure modes. Cost impact was assessed in terms of CT patient throughput. Results CT air exchange solutions and alternatives were reviewed. Multiple isolation bag device designs were considered. Several designs were custom fabricated, prototyped and reduced to practice. A final design was tested on volunteers for comfort, test-fit, air seal and breathability. >14 times enhanced patient throughput was estimated, in an ideal setting, which could more than counterbalance the cost of the device itself. Conclusion A novel isolation bag device is feasible for use in CT and might facilitate containment and reduce contamination in radiology departments during the COVID Pandemic.

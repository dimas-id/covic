A 10‐year‐old, castrated male domestic short‐haired cat was presented with an acute history of seizures, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, and dyspnea. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multifocal areas of gray matter T2‐weighted hyperintensity. The lesions did not enhance with intravenous contrast. The cat was diagnosed at necropsy with feline systemic reactive angioendotheliomatosis, a rare vascular proliferative disorder for which a treatment has not yet been identified. This report is the first to describe associated magnetic resonance imaging changes for this disease.

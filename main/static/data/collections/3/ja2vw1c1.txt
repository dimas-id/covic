Abstract To detect the outbreak or epidemic earlier and ensure the public health security during Olympic Games in Beijing, Beijing Olympic Games Infectious Disease Surveillance System (BOG-IDSS) was established based on a series of routine surveillance systems. Early warning algorithms were applied to early detect aberrations. Results showed that BOG-IDSS, especially the newly established Syndromic Surveillance System for Beijing Olympic Games could effectively protect the security of public health during mass gatherings.

In March 2013, the first cases of avian influenza virus infections in humans were reported by the authorities of the PR of China to the World Health Organization. This influenza A(H7N9) virus comprises genes of at least four different avian influenza viruses, some segments mimicking human-like influenza-signatures. Until 11 August, 2013 135 humans were infected, 44 (33%) died. The clinical course is characterized by fever, cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, lympho- and thrombopenia as well by the rapid onset of an acute respiratory distress syndrome in nearly 25% of the cases. Although human to human transmission may have occurred only in the context of three clusters, strict hygiene measures should be instituted and any suspect case should be reported to the local health authorities immediately. The detection of influenza A(H7N9) is based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antiviral treatment should be initiated as early as possible for suspect, probable or confirmed cases, even when 48 hours have passed after symptom onset. At present the future development of this epidemic cannot be predicted.

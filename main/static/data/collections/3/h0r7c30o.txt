In response to Coronavirus 19 pandemic, countries are struggling to contain its spread and save precious human lives. Like others, India is also trying to enhance testing capacity to identify every case and break the chain of transmission. Due to several constrains like geographic distribution of the laboratories, social stigma, prevailing lockdown, people are not being able to seek medical help every time they need. In addition, the states are not doing laboratory tests in similar frequency. In future, doing extensive tests would emerge as a major strategy for stopping the progression of the pandemic.

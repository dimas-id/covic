Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most enigmatic of immunoglobulins. It is by far the most abundant of human Igs, being present in the blood plasma at concentrations approximating 2–3mg/mL, as well as the dominant isotype in most secretions where its output amounts to some 5–8g/day in adults. Furthermore, its evolutionary origins appear to precede the synapsid– diapsid divergence in tetrapod phylogeny (>300 million years ago) because it is present in both mammals and birds and therefore possibly also in reptiles (reviewed in Peppard et al., 2005); an IgA-like molecule has now been identified in a lizard (Deza et al., 2007).

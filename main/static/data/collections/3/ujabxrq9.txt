The paper develops a robotic manipulation system to treat the pressing needs for handling a large number of test tubes in clinical examination and replace or reduce human labor. It presents the technical details of the system, which separates and arranges test tubes in racks with the help of 3D vision and artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning/planning. The developed system only requires a person to put a rack with mixed and non-arranged tubes in front of a robot. The robot autonomously performs recognition, reasoning, planning, manipulation, etc., and returns a rack with separated and arranged tubes. The system is simple-to-use, and there are no requests for expert knowledge in robotics. We expect such a system to play an important role in helping managing public health and hope similar systems could be extended to other clinical manipulation like handling mixers and pipettes in the future.

BACKGROUND: Although recently published randomised controlled trials did not confirm significant positive effect of ART-123 or polymyxin B‑immobilised haemoperfusion (PMX-HP) on survival outcome, previous studies using a dataset of 3195 patients with sepsis registered at 42 intensive care units throughout Japan revealed significantly reduced mortality following these treatments. A study has suggested the efficacy of combination therapy with ART-123 and PMX-HP; however, it did not evaluate the effect modification between them. We hypothesised that coadministration of ART-123 and PMX-HP has a significant positive effect modification on survival outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect modification between ART-123 and PMX-HP treatment on the survival outcome of sepsis using post hoc analysis of the dataset of the Japan Septic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation registry. RESULTS: Of the 3195 patients recorded in the registry, 2350 were analysed. The product term between ART-123 and PMX-HP was analysed by the Cox regression model to evaluate significance. The primary outcome of this study was hospital mortality. Although the administration of ART-123 was independently positively associated with survival outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.834, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.695–0.999; P = 0.049) in the model prior to the introduction of the product term, a significant effect modification on survival outcome was observed between the administration of ART-123 and PMX-HP treatment (adjusted HR: 0.667, 95% CI 0.462–0.961; P = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: The main effect of the administration of ART-123 may be beneficial for survival outcome in patients with sepsis. In addition, a significant beneficial effect modification on survival outcome was observed between the administration of ART-123 and PMX-HP treatment.

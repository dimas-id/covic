Lobectomy with mediastinal node dissection has been standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nowadays, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is gaining acceptance as an alternative treatment option, given the quality-of-life benefits that it confers. For the VATS procedure, most surgeons create two or three ports with a utility incision of 3 to 5 cm. However, with acquired skill and instrumentation advances, single-incision thoracoscopic surgery has emerged over time. Here, we report the case of an 86-year-old female with NSCLC treated by single-incision segmentectomy.

Activatable cell-penetrating peptides are of great interest in drug delivery because of their enhanced selectivity which can be controlled by the external stimuli that trigger their activation. The use of a specific enzymatic reaction to trigger uptake of an inert peptide offers a relevant targeting strategy because the activation process takes place in a short time and only in areas where the specific cell surface enzyme is present. To this aim, the lysine side chain of Tat peptides was modified with an enzyme-cleavable domain of minimal size. This yielded blocked Tat-peptides which were inactive but that could be activated by coincubation with the selected enzymes.

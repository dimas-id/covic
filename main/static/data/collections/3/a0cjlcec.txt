Bats in Myanmar, Gabon, and Panama have been found to harbor diverse hepadnaviruses. Here, we report a novel hepadnavirus in 4 of 20 pomona roundleaf bats from Yunnan province, China. This virus contains 3,278 nucleotides (nt) in the full circularized genome, with four predicted open frames (ORFs) reading in the same direction. Full genomic sequence comparisons and evolutionary analysis indicate that this virus is a member of a new species within the genus Orthohepadnavirus

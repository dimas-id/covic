We report the case of a positive COVID-19 patient who presented to our hospital for a maculopapular skin rash which appeared 7 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. He was 34 years old and nothing relevant was recorded at his previous anamnesis. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days and received systemic therapy with steroid, antihistamines, tocilizumab, and hydroxicloroquine. On the third day of the hospitalization the cutaneous rash had almost completely disappeared.

In 1994, the most recent year for which published data are available, an estimated 4.7 million dog bites occurred in the United States, and approximately 799,700 persons required medical care. Of an estimated 333,700 patients treated for dog bites in emergency departments (EDs) in 1994, approximately 6,000 (1.8%) were hospitalized. To estimate the number of nonfatal dog bite-related injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs, CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP). This report summarizes the results of the analysis, which indicate that in 2001, an estimated 368,245 persons were treated in U.S. hospital EDs for nonfatal dog bite-related injuries. Injury rates were highest among children aged 5-9 years. To reduce the number of dog bite-related injuries, adults and children should be educated about bite prevention, and persons with canine pets should practice responsible pet ownership.

We developed a novel approach to perform a perfect 11p lymph node dissection (LND), the so-called 'midpancreas mobilization' (MPM) method. Briefly, in pure single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (SIDG), after the completion of 7, 8a/12a, and 9 LND in the suprapancreatic portion, we started 11p LND after midpancreas mobilization. After mobilization of the entire midpancreas from the white line of Toldt, two gauzes were inserted behind the pancreas. This maneuver facilitated exposure of the splenic vein and complete detachment of soft tissue, including 11p lymph nodes, from the white line of Toldt, which was possible because of the tilting of the pancreas. The dissection plane along the splenic artery and vein for 11p LND could be visualized just through control of the operator's grasper without the need of an assistant. Fourteen patients underwent the procedure without intraoperative events, conversion to conventional laparoscopy, or surgery-related complications, including postoperative pancreatic fistula. All patients underwent D2 LND by exposure of the splenic vein. The mean numbers of retrieved lymph node and 11p lymph node were 61.3 ± 9.0 (range, 49-70), and 4.00 ± 3.38 (range, 1-10). Thus, we concluded that MPM for 11p LND in pure SIDG appears feasible and embryologically ideal; this method can be used in conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy.

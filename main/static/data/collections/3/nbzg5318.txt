Lung cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. The advent of next-generation sequencing techniques has significantly advanced our understanding of the complex molecular underpinnings of lung cancer. Furthermore, the development of targeted therapies has significantly altered the landscape of lung cancer therapy over the past decade. There is hence an increasing interest in developing a classification system that guides clinical management and also incorporates relevant genomic information. Here, we highlight the molecular features of lung adenocarcinoma as highlighted by several independent groups, and more recently The Cancer Genome Atlas and discuss their potential clinical significance.

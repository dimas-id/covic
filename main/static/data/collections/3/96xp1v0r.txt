There have been recent, significant advances about the role of mRNA turnover in controlling gene expression in immune cells. Post‚Äêtranscriptional regulation of gene expression contributes to the characteristics of many of the processes underlying the immune response by ensuring early, rapid, and transient action. The emphasis of this review is on current work that deals with the regulation of mRNA decay during innate immunity against microbes and T cell activation as a model of the adaptive response.

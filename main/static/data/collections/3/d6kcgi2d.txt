Abstract Throughout this pandemic, neurology resident education and service has, and will continue to be, affected during this unprecedented time. Balancing the safety of our residents as well as the anticipated inpatient service demands, we have, and continue to, make changes to meet the needs of our community. Education certainly has been affected but we have made great effort to maintain normalcy. We are leveraging web-based technologies to continue formal didactics. The American Academy of Neurology has provided program directors with various tools to share to provide high-yield academic education. AAN Synapse, distance learning modules, and podcasts are a few examples. Each residency training program will likely face different challenges depending on location and community structure. We have an obligation to help all of our colleagues in the hospital in providing quality and compassionate care during this time of need. Our training and education will only benefit from this experience teaching us lessons on adaptability, the importance of teamwork, and self-sacrifice.

AIM: A worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) which emerged in China in December 2019 affects the world very seriously. We aimed to evaluate the benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients who were admitted and treated to our hospital due to COVID‐19. METHODS: Between March 18, 2020 and April 5, 2020, 18 patients admitted with COVID‐19 who has BPH and are using medication for this were included in the study and analyzed retrospectively. Diagnosis was confirmed by COVID‐19 nucleic acid test by sampling sputum or nasopharyngeal swab. Standard COVID‐19 treatment protocol determined by our Ministry of Health was applied to all patients according to their risk groups. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological features, additional diseases, laboratory tests, complications and outcome data of all patients were recorded. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 59.6 (range: 56‐73). As the mode of transmission, 10 (55.5%) of patients were infected in hospital, 5 (27.7%) patients had a relative with COVID‐19 and 3 (16,6%) was unknown. During follow‐up, 2 (11.1%) patients were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU). One of these patients dramatically progressed and died. Patients who survived and were not transferred to ICU had lesser comorbidities and were relatively young. Mean duration of hospitalization was 14.2 days (range 12‐19). CONCLUSION: We think that COVID‐19 patients with BPH had a low mortality rate and did not have a poor prognosis in this patient group. It is crucial to take comprehensive preventive measures to control COVID‐19 transmission via hospital route.

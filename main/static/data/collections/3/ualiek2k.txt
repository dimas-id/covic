OBJECTIVES To systematically review Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for the management of menopause-related vasomotor symptoms (VMS) to 1) identify those that include Natural Health Products (NHPs); 2) identify which NHPs were included and the evidence supporting the recommendation for the place in therapy; and 3) compare methodological quality of the CPGs. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, BMJ Best Practice, DynaMed Plus and websites of gynecological and menopausal societies were searched (Jan 2000-Nov 2018). Records were screened to identify CPGs that were published in English, since 2000 and were for use in North America. CPGs were reviewed for inclusion of NHPs. Data regarding NHPs (evidence, recommendation) were extracted and analyzed. CPGs were critically appraised using the AGREE II tool. RESULTS Five of six CPGs that met general inclusion criteria included NHPs. Black cohosh, isoflavones, soy food/extracts and phytoestrogens were included in all five CPGs. Comparative analysis of recommendations and level of supporting evidence revealed differences. All CPGs included recommendations regarding the use of NHPs in general, although recommendations differed. Four of five CPGs made recommendations for unique NHPs, however, recommendations differed. Using the AGREE II tool, CPGs scored well on domains for purpose and clarity. Lack of detailed description of methodology and author expertise affected scores in other domains. CONCLUSION Five CPGs included general recommendations for the role of NHPs in treating VMS, with recommendations ranging from use with caution to not recommended. There were inconsistencies among CPGs regarding NHPs included and what evidence was used in making recommendations.

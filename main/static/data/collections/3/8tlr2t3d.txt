Objective. Considering the demerits of a high-definition 2-dimensional (HD-2D) system, with its lack of stereopsis, and a conventional 3-dimensional (C-3D) system, which results in a dimmed image, we have recently developed a glasses-free 3-dimensional (GF-3D) display system for reconstruction surgeries such as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for tracheal reconstruction. Methods. Thoracic surgeons were invited to complete thoracoscopic continuous suture of a transected porcine trachea using the HD-2D, C-3D, and GF-3D systems on separate mornings in randomized order. The duration, numbers of stitches, and distance between every 2 stitches were recorded for every procedure. The surgeons' spontaneous eye blink rate was recorded for 5 minutes before the procedure and the last 5 minutes of the procedure. Results. Fifteen volunteers successfully completed the tracheal reconstruction procedures in this study. Both C-3D (0.403 ± 0.064 stitch/min, P < .001) and GF-3D (0.427 ± 0.079 stitch/min, P < .001) showed significant advantages in speed compared with HD-2D (0.289 ± 0.065 stitch/min). Both C-3D (2.536 ± 2.223 mm, P < .001) and GF-3D (2.603 ± 2.159 mm, P < .001) showed significant advantages in accuracy compared with HD-2D (3.473 ± 3.403 mm). Both HD-2D (1.240 ± 0.642, P < .001) and GF-3D (1.307 ± 0.894, P < .001) showed significant advantages in eye fatigue compared with C-3D (3.333 ± 1.44). Conclusions. All 3 available display systems are efficient for complex VATS. With the help of stereopsis, surgeons can achieve faster operation using C-3D and GF-3D systems in a thoracoscopic simulated setting. GF-3D may be a more effective display system for VATS reconstruction in terms of speed, accuracy, and eye fatigue during operations.

Objective: To study the epidemiological characteristics and mixed infection of adenovirus in acute respiratory tract infections in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019, and to provide scientific basis for the prevention and control of adenovirus. Methods: Acute respiratory tract infections were collected from 3 hospitals in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019. Relevant information was registered and respiratory specimens were sampled for detection of respiratory pathogens by multiplex PCR. Results: A total of 1 543 cases of acute respiratory tract infection were included. The positive rate of adenovirus was 2.92%(45/1 543), the positive rates of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were 2.74%(29/1 058) and 3.30%(16/485), respectively. The positive rate of ILI during January-May 2019 was 5.43%(7/129), higher than that in the same period of 2015- 2018 (0.52%-4.48%) (Fisher's exact test value=8.92, P=0.036). The incidence of adenovirus-positive cases was mainly distributed in the first and second quarters, accounting for 62.22% (28/45). The difference of the incidence of adenovirus-positive cases in each quarter was significant (χ(2)= 12.52, P=0.006). The positive rate in the second quarter was highest (6.03%), which was higher than that in other quarters (1.89%-2.93%). There were significant differences among different age groups (χ(2)=16.94, P=0.001), and the positive rate decreased with age (χ(2)=10.16, P=0.001). The positive rate of 13-19 years old group (9.43%) was higher than that of other age groups (1.48%-4.81%). The positive rate of student group (12.07%) was higher than that of other occupations (2.61%). The difference was systematic (χ(2)=11.53, P=0.001). Mixed infection accounted for 31.11% (14/45) of 45 adenovirus positive cases. The mixed infection rates of ILI and SARI were 34.48% (10/29) and 25.00% (4/16), respectively. Among 14 cases of mixed infection, the main mixed infection pathogens of adenovirus were influenza A virus and coronavirus. Conclusion: Adenovirus surveillance should be further strengthened in adolescents with a focus on students and other key groups in the second quarter.

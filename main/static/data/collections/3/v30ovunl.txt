The utility of diagnostic studies to determine the etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia has been controversial in part because of the lack of rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective methods. Advancements in molecular testing methods and biological markers are becoming available with marked expansion of diagnostic capability for infectious diseases. Subsequent studies and clinical experience will clarify their real clinical value.

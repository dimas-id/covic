In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China was attributed to a novel coronavirus that was eventually recognized as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization given its rapid global transmission. Various cardiovascular complications have been reported, including heart failure, myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome and arrhythmias, both atrial and ventricular. Regarding arrhythmias, onset from time of infection is variable but usually ranges from several days to a week.

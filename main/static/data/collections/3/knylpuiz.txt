Tuberculosis (TB) is a global disease with high prevalence in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet 2009, more than 2 billion (equal to one third of worldâ€™s population) people are infected with TB bacilli. Of the cases detected, 5 % were cases of multi-drug resistant TB. Admission to a critical care unit is not required in the majority of cases. However, TB sepsis is a rapidly fatal disease that requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission and management and represents a big diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

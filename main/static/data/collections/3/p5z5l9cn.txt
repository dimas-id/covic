BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays an important role in the innate immune response. In addition to activating the complement, MBL can induce cytokine production and contribute to a deleterious inflammatory response with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Our aim was to determine if serum MBL levels correlate with the risk of mortality in intensive care units (ICU) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. METHODS: Prospective observational study was performed in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Demographic characteristics and severity indices were recorded at ICU admission. MBL was assayed from blood drawn at influenza diagnosis within 24–48 h following the ICU admission. Outcomes were compared according to MBL levels. Results are expressed as median and interquartile range. RESULTS: Serum MBL levels were studied in 27 patients (age: 56 [IQR 29] years) with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and in 70 healthy controls. Median admission SAPSII and SOFA scores were 49 [IQR 26] and 12 [IQR 5], respectively. Mortality rate after a 30-day was 37%. MBL was significantly higher in non-survivors (3741 [IQR 2336] ng/ml) vs survivors (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml), p = 0.006, as well as control group (1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml), p = 0.01. In contrast, MBL levels in survivors group were significantly lower than the controls group (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml vs. 1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml, p = 0.005). MBL cut-off > 1870 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88.2% for mortality [AUC = 0.82 (95% CI 0.63–0.94)]. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated a strong association between MBL levels and mortality (log-rank 7.8, p = 0.005). MBL > 1870 ng/ml was independently associated with mortality (HR = 8.7, 95% CI 1.2–29.1, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that baseline MBL > 1870 ng/ml is associated with higher mortality in ICU patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

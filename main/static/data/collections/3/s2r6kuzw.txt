We describe successful usage of low dose Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (30–50 mg) in three COVID19 critically ill patients, who were in worsening respiratory failure in-spite of being on therapeutic anticoagulation. All patients had respiratory rate > 40; FiO(2) > 0.7(on NIV); PiO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 100 and D-dimer>1000 ng/ml. C.T. Pulmonary Angiography could not be done in these patients due to poor general condition, but 2D echo was normal and none of the patients was in shock. So there was no conventional indication of thrombolysis in these patients, yet after thrombolysis, we saw dramatic changes in oxygenation. All patients became off oxygen within 3–7 days and were discharged within 2 weeks. The whole idea was to prevent intubation, since mortality rates are very high in intubated COVID19 patients. tPA is associated with <1% risk of fatal bleed. In this unprecedented pandemic with high mortality rates, thrombolysis could be an effective and safe option in carefully selected critically ill patients of COVID19.

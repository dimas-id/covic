Respiratory infections remain a significant and formidable threat to the health and well being of the neonate despite potent antibiotics, increasingly sophisticated laboratory detection methods and technologically advanced neonatal intensive care nurseries. Although the clinical and radiological definitions of pneumonia are variable throughout medical and governmental literature, quoted incidence rates for neonatal pneumonia range between 1.5â€“5.0 per 1,000 live births (Keyserling 1997; Webber et el 1990).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is generally a relatively mild illness in children. An emerging disease entity coined as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 (PIMS‐TS) has been reported recently, but is very rare and only affects a very small minority of children.

Although their initial presentations were very similar, their COVID‐19‐related disease varied in severity.

Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a clinically important complication of IPF that carries a high morbidity and mortality. In the last decade, we have learned much about this event, but there are many remaining questions: What is it? Why does it happen? How can we prevent it? How can we treat it? This chapter attempts to summarize our current understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, and management of acute exacerbation of IPF and point out areas where additional data are sorely needed.

This is a description of transhiatal laparoscopic approach for mid-esophageal diverticulum. Traditionally mid-esophageal diverticula are approached by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy, with the laparoscopic technique being reserved for epiphrenic diverticula. A 78-year-old Caucasian female with a secondary dilatative ischemic cardiomyopathy presented with dysphagia, tenderness in the epigastrium and a considerable weight loss. A large mid-esophageal diverticulum was found on barium swallow and confirmed by CT scan. Underlying achalasia was recorded on manometry. The patient underwent diverticulectomy via transhiatal approach, followed by Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication. Throughout the procedure auxiliary, esophagoscopic image was provided by interventional gastroenterologist due to a very narrow operating field and lack of orientation points. Based on our experience with this case, we propose transhiatal approach as a feasible alternative to thoracoscopy, in particular with patients who suffer from cardiac or pulmonary co-morbidities which make traditional techniques of high risk.

The relationship between malnutrition and malaria is controversial. On one hand, malaria may cause malnutrition, while on the other, malnutrition itself may modulate susceptibility to the disease. We investigated the association between Plasmodium falciparum malaria and malnutrition in a cohort of children living on the coast of Kenya. The study involved longitudinal follow‐up for clinical malaria episodes and anthropometric measurements at four cross‐sectional surveys. We used Poisson regression analysis to investigate the association between malaria and nutritional status. Compared to baseline (children with a WAZ or HAZ score of ≥−2), the crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for malaria in children with low HAZ or WAZ scores (<−2) during the period prior to assessment were 1.17 (95% CI 0.91–1.50; 0 = 0.21) and 0.94 (0.71–1.25; 0.67), respectively, suggesting no association between malaria and the subsequent development of PEM. However, we found that age was acting as an effect modifier in the association between malaria and malnutrition. The IRR for malaria in children 0–2 years old who were subsequently characterized as wasted was 1.65 (1.10–2.20; P = 0.01), and a significant overall relationship between malaria and low‐HAZ was found on regression analysis when adjusting for the interaction with age (IRR 1.89; 1.01–3.53; P < 0.05). Although children living on the coast of Kenya continue to suffer clinical episodes of uncomplicated malaria throughout their first decade, the association between malaria and malnutrition appears to be limited to the first 2 years of life.

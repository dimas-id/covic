INTRODUCTION Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety are on the rise, but access to care remains a challenge. Immigrants and racialized communities including Chinese Canadians experience high level of access barriers including communication with clinicians. With the aim to facilitate mental health communications, we tested an Interactive Computer-assisted Client Assessment Survey (iCCAS) in Cantonese/Mandarin and English at a nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic in Toronto. The iCCAS offers a touch-screen, pre-consultation survey with questions on depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol abuse, and social context. The program generates point-of-care reports for the clinician and patient. METHODS A pilot randomized controlled trial examined the intervention impact on mental health discussion and symptom detection, compared with the usual care, followed by clinicians' qualitative interviews. RESULTS Fifty self-identified Chinese adult patients participated (iCCAS = 26, Usual Care = 24), response rate 79.4%. Participant mean age was 44.8 years and 92% were immigrants. There was an increase of 19% and 15% in the mental health discussion and detection of symptoms in the iCCAS group compared with the usual care. More participants in the iCCAS group were referred to a social worker or psychiatrist. Patients found the use of iCCAS easy and clinicians identified its benefits for themselves (eg, early identification and comfort) and patients (eg, self-awareness and anonymity) and proposed practice-integration. DISCUSSION The studied tool holds promise for enhancing clinician-patient mental health communications in primary care settings for overseas Chinese. Implications are discussed for in-person and virtual healthcare which could also inform responses to mental health crisis related to COVID-19.

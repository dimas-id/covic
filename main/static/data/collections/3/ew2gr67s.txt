Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are characterised by a neutrophilic mucosal infiltration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the time course of release of the cytokines/chemokines interleukins (IL) IL-1β, IL-1ra, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and bradykinin in nasal secretions of patients with a naturally acquired URTI. A total of 117 healthy adult volunteers were recruited for baseline nasal lavages, 39 of whom developed URTI symptoms within 6 months and returned to our centre within 48 h. Lavages were performed daily during the symptomatic period and 3 weeks thereafter, with symptoms no longer present. Compared to baseline, significantly elevated concentrations of total protein, bradykinin, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IFN-γ, MPO and sICAM-1 were detected in nasal lavage fluids of symptomatic patients, whereas IL-1ra remained unaltered. All studied variables reached baseline 3 weeks after the URTI. Naturally acquired URTI represent a limited, neutrophilic inflammatory reaction, orchestrated by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Background and Objectives The number of robotic colorectal procedures performed has rapidly increased, but there are only sparse data available about the robotic learning curve of expert laparoscopic colorectal surgeons. Methods In this retrospective study, we reviewed 101 minimally invasive right colectomies consecutively performed by a single surgeon with 20 years of clinical practice fully dedicated to laparoscopic surgery. Thus, the last 59 laparoscopic resections were compared with the first 42 robotic resections. Results The duration of the procedure was longer in the robotic group, but the conversion rate was the same in both groups. There was no difference between groups in rates of overall and severe postoperative complications, reoperation, hospital length of stay, and readmission. Number of harvested lymph nodes and oncological quality of resection defined by the pathologist were the same. Conclusions This study suggests that the transition from the right laparoscopic colectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis to the robot-assisted right colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis when performed by a surgeon with experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery may not entail any increase on the morbidity rate or reduce the oncologic quality of the resection.

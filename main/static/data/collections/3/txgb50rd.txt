INTRODUCTION Robotic single-port hysterectomy is a rather new technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the till-now evidence regarding the use of robotic single-port hysterectomy technique as a method of management in gynecological pathologies. RESULTS The till-now used port systems are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of such a technique, as well as the indications and contraindications of it are also presented. Such a technically challenging operation seems to have similar results regarding blood loss and surgical time while the cosmetic outcome is better compared to the classic robotic hysterectomy. The technical difficulties include loss of instrumental triangulation, reduced operative working place, reduced visualization, instrumental crowding and clashing. The ways to overcome such difficulties are also described. CONCLUSION The need of technique standardization is the future aim.

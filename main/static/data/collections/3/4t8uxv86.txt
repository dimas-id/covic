Canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), and canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) are pathogens that are typically associated with canids but may cause serious disease in a wide range of other carnivores. From 1998 to 2002, serum samples from 64 wolverines (Gulo gulo) from the Brooks Range, Alaska, were tested for antibodies to CDV, CPV-2, and canine adenovirus (CAV). Four animals tested positive for antibodies to CDV (7%), one for antibodies to CPV-2 (2%), and none for antibodies to CAV. These are similar to antibody prevalence estimates for other large and medium carnivores in North America.

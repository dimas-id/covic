The challenges of identifying and controlling emerging diseases impact individual health, as well as political, social and economic situations. In this review we discuss the role of proteomics for investigation of pathogen discovery, outbreak investigation, bio-defense, disease control, host-pathogen dynamics and vaccine development of emerging and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). In the future the discipline of proteomics may help define multiple aspects of emerging and NTDs with respect to personalized medicine and public health.

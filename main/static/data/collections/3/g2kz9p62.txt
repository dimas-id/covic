COVID-19 causes consolidations or ground glass opacities that are predominantly peripheral, basal, and bilateral on chest x-ray (CXR). There are no published case reports that present over ten serial CXRs on the same patient. We present a case report of a 68-year-old patient with confirmed COVID-19 and a prolonged course of admission, receiving nasal and humidified oxygen, non-invasive and then mechanical ventilation. She self-extubated, but remained stable on nasal oxygen only and was transferred for rehabilitation. We present 12 of her serial CXRs over six weeks, showing progression from subtle changes to overt widespread pneumonitis to slow resolution. She is also an example of a rare case of COVID-19 pneumonitis causing persistent hypoxia for over six weeks.

Antibody phage display has been pivotal in the quest to generate human monoclonal antibodies for biomedical and research applications. Target antigen preparation is a main bottleneck associated with the panning process. This includes production complexity, downstream purification, quality and yield. In many instances, purified antigens are preferred for panning but this may not be possible for certain difficult target antigens. Here, we describe an improved procedure of affinity selection against crude or non-purified antigen by saturation of non-binders with blocking agents to promote positive binder enrichment termed as Yin-Yang panning. A na√Øve human scFv library with kappa light chain repertoire with a library size of 10(9) was developed. The improved Yin-Yang biopanning process was able to enrich monoclonal antibodies specific to the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein. Three unique monoclonal antibodies were isolated in the process. The Yin-Yang biopanning method highlights the possibility of utilizing crude antigens for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies by phage display.

Abstract The AnyplexTM II RV16 detection kit (RV16; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) is a multiplex real-time PCR assay based on tagging oligonucleotide cleavage extension. In this prospective study, we evaluated the RV16 assay by comparing with the Seeplex® RV12 ACE detection kit (RV12; Seegene), a multiplex end-point PCR kit. A total of 365 consecutive respiratory specimens were tested with both RV16 and RV12 assays in parallel and detected 140 (38.4%) and 89 (24.4%) positive cases, respectively. The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and kappa values for the 2 assays were 95.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.4–98.3%), 80.4% (95% CI, 75.3–84.6%), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56–0.72), respectively. The monoplex PCR and sequencing for the samples with discrepant results revealed that majority of the results were concordant with the results from RV16 assays. In conclusion, the RV16 assay produces results comparable to the RV12 assay.

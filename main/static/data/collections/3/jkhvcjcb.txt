RCAS/tv-a is a system for postnatal cell-type-specific gene transfer. It is used for the modeling of gliomas and medulloblastomas. This system provides a combination of lineage tracing from the cell origin with oncogenesis induced by mis-expression of specific genes. The genes that are most potent at inducing tumors are those that encode components of signal transduction and undifferentiated cells are most capable of serving as the cell of origin. The system effectively generates tumors with the histologic characteristics of human disease. Mice bearing RCAS/tv-a-induced brain tumors are currently being used for preclinical trials to understand the biology of therapeutic response in the various cell types that make up gliomas and medulloblastomas.

BACKGROUND In order to seek natural and cheap sources of odor-active compounds, the aromatic potential of mango by-products was evaluated. A chemical characterization of volatile compounds of mango peel and seed were performed in comparison with mango pulp by HS-SPME/GC-MS. RESULTS More than 60 volatile compounds were detected in mango by-products whose aromatic activity was estimated by means of odorant activity values (OAVs). Results pointed out mango peel as a valuable matrix on odor-active compounds which were found even in larger quantities than in edible mango fraction. 3-Carene was the predominant compound although other compounds such as decanal, 1-octen-3-one, nonanal, limonene, Î²-damascenone and 2-nonenal were the most odor-active compounds in mango peel. The greatest aromatic impact with sensorial features described as fresh/herbaceous, fruity, floral and resinous was found in peel mango. CONCLUSION The exceptional flavoring potential of mango peel by-product opens a door for its use and revalorization as natural flavoring ingredient in food and cosmetic industries.

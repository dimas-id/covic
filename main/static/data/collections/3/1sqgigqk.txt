Abstract This work describes a clinical case in which we used telemedicine to monitor at-home ketamine treatment in TRD. Ketamine has been shown to be a promising and safe treatment for TRD in elderly patients. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly impacting the world and this disease is recognized as being particularly dangerous for the elderly and vulnerable patients. To limit the transmission of the disease, geriatric mental health specialists must be creative and ensure the safety of their patients by limiting human to human contact. This problem might be averted by massive deployment of outreach services and telemedicine strategies.

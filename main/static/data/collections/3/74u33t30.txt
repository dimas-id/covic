Modern intelligent software systems are rapidly growing in complexity and scale, and many real usage scenarios might be impossible to reproduce and validate at design-time. As envisioned by the Models@run.time research community, the use of formal models at runtime are fundamental to address this challenge. In this paper, we explore the concept of ASM@run.time and put this definition into the context of the runtime enforcement technique to address the runtime assurance of software systems. This is a work-in-progress research line.

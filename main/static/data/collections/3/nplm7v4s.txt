Vaccination of cattle against viral respiratory pathogens to minimize losses associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common practice among producers and veterinarians. Three different calf populations in which BRD is most prevalent (recently weaned beef calves, preweaning beef calves, and young dairy calves) are the principal focus of morbidity and mortality prevention through vaccination; however, the evidence of vaccination efficacy is inconsistent in the literature. This review addresses the evidence of efficacy of vaccination in the prevention or reduction of naturally occurring and experimentally induced BRD in each calf group.

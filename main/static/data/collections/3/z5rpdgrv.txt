This article describes several emerging molecular assays that have potential applications in the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory viral infections. These techniques include direct nucleic acid detection by quantum dots, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, amplification using arbitrary primers, target-enriched multiplexing amplification, pyrosequencing, padlock probes, solid and suspension microarrays, and mass spectrometry. Several of these systems already are commercially available to provide multiplex amplification and high-throughput detection and identification of a panel of respiratory viral pathogens. Further validation and implementation of such emerging molecular assays in routine clinical virology services will enhance the rapid diagnosis of respiratory viral infections and improve patient care.

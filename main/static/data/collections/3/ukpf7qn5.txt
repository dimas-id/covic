OBJECTIVE To describe in dogs, a technique for single port access gastropexy and ovariectomy (SPAGO) using a commercially available multitrocar port and to evaluate short-term outcome. DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 18). PROCEDURES A commercially available multitrocar port was inserted into the abdomen lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle and 2-5 cm caudal to the right rib. Dogs were tilted 45° in both left and right recumbency and bilateral ovariectomy performed using articulating graspers, a bipolar vessel sealing device and a 30° telescope. The laparoscopic assisted incisional gastropexy was performed after ovariectomy at the multitrocar port insertion site by grasping the antral portion of the stomach with a 10 mm DuVall forceps and suturing the seromuscular layer of the antral region of the stomach to the transversus abdominis muscle. RESULTS Eighteen dogs (median weight, 34.5 kg; range, 14.7-59.2 kg) met the inclusion criteria. Median surgical time for SPAGO was 65 minutes (range, 50-225 minutes). Intra-operative complications included, incorrect multitrocar port placement location (n = 3) and mild hemorrhage from a splenic laceration (1) All dogs recovered from surgery and were discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS Single port access gastropexy and ovariectomy is a feasible procedure to provide prophylaxis against gastric dilation-volvulus and a simultaneous means of sterilization in female dogs. Careful and accurate initial multitrocar port insertion is necessary to have optimal operative viewing as well as to reduce the chances of inadvertent splenic laceration.

BACKGROUND Conventional lymphangiography cannot detect leakage sites of hepatic lymphatic vessels. Percutaneous transhepatic lymphangiography can be used to visualize leakage sites, and once the leakage site has been confirmed, effective sclerotherapy can be performed. CASE PRESENTATION A rare case of intractable hepatic lymphorrhea due to injury of the hepatoduodenal ligament following pancreaticoduodenectomy is reported. Drainage of massive ascites from the drainage tube continued after surgery. Percutaneous transhepatic lymphangiography visualized the intrahepatic lymphatic vessels and the leakage site at the hepatic hilum. An 8-Fr drainage catheter was inserted adjacent to the leakage point under fluoroscopic computed tomography guidance. Repeated sclerotherapy using intraperitoneal administration of OK-432 (picibanil) through the catheter was performed, which exposed the leakage site, and control of the ascites was finally achieved. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful case of detection of a leakage site using intrahepatic lymphangiography, followed by sclerotherapy using OK-432.

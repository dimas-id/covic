Although advances in antineoplastic therapy have considerably improved the survival of patients with hematological malignancies, current treatment modalities increase the risk of late complications. Several forms of chronic pulmonary dysfunction due to infectious or noninfectious causes commonly occur in the months to years after chemo-radiotherapy and can be fatal or result in long-term morbidity. The judicious use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents has tipped the balance toward noninfectious etiologies. Hence, while opportunistic infections still contribute to chronic lung disease, late sequelae resulting from antineoplastic therapy have been identified and reported. Patients who proceed to receive hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) are particularly prone to developing lung complications. Pulmonary dysfunction occurring after HSCT may manifest with obstructive or restrictive pulmonary mechanics and may range in severity from subtle, subclinical functional changes to frank respiratory failure. Insights generated using animal models suggest that the immunologic mechanisms contributing to lung inflammation after HSCT may be similar to those responsible for graft-versus host disease. In sum, chronic fibrotic pulmonary dysfunction is a frequent and significant complication facing survivors of hematologic malignancies and their practitioners. The high incidence and suboptimal response to current support care and immunosuppressive therapy underscore the need for heightened awareness and continued research in this area.

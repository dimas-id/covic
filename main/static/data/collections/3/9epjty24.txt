There is increasing concern about the emerging global non-communicable diseases (NCDs) burden. The focus has mainly been on NCDs in adults but it is important that MSK morbidity in both children and adults is included in strategic planning. There have been considerable advances in the understanding and treatment options for children and young people (CYP) and clinical outcomes are improving for those who can access such high quality care. However vast inequity exists and there are many CYP who live in areas of the world with high burden of health care challenges, compounded by paucity of specialist care and limited access to treatments. The Paediatric Global Musculoskeletal Task Force aims to raise awareness about unmet needs for CYP with MSK conditions, promotion of MSK health through lifestyle and the avoidance of injury. We aim to leverage change through ‘working together better’.

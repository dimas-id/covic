Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells occurs predominantly via binding of the viral surface spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease are risk factors for morbidity from COVID-19, and it remains uncertain whether the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) impacts infection and disease. Here, we aim to shed light on this question by assessing ACE2 expression in normal and diseased human myocardial samples profiled by bulk and single nucleus RNA-seq.

Active learning becomes a strategical approach for an educational principle. The student engagement become a wider concern. Many researches have been proposed to support the approach. However, one of issues is how to effectively evaluate the performance and progress of students’ learning. Although, having student engagement in a classroom is vital, the evaluation of students’ performance is more important. However, keeping up the details or records of students’ progress is a difficult task. We therefore propose a support for instructors to evaluate the performance of their students. In particular, a prototype tool is designed and developed in order to facilitate the evaluation of activities based on an active learning class. The tool also encompasses the web service for a function of face feature recognition. Two scenarios of active learning classrooms are created in order to evaluate the prototype tool. We also plan to create a larger number of scenarios which involve different class objectives. The results show that the tool can detect and determine students with high precision values. However, the prototype tool takes a long time to be processed depending on the size and number of photos.

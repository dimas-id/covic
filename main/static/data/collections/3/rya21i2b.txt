Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory in human with high mortality and it has been a challenge to determine optimum treatment for MERS-CoV-induced respiratory infection. Here, we observed the distribution of MERS-CoV receptors using human respiratory mucosa and also evaluated the contribution of interferon-lambdas (IFN-λs) in response to MERS-CoV infection using in vitro normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) and bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. We found that the gene and protein expression of DPPIV, MERS-CoV receptor, were more dominantly located in nasal and bronchial epithelium although human nasal mucosa exhibited relatively lower DPPIV expression than lung parenchymal tissues. The quantitative mRNA level of the MERS-CoV envelope (upE) gene was significantly induced in MERS-CoV-infected cultured NHNE and NHBE cells until 3 days after infection. The induction of IFNs was identified in in NHNE and NHBE cells after MERS-CoV infection and IFN-λs were predominantly increased in MERS-CoV-infected respiratory epithelial cells. Inoculation of IFN-λs to NHNE and NHBE cells suppressed MERS-CoV replication and in particular, IFN-λ(4) showed a strong therapeutic effect in reducing MERS-CoV infection with higher induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Thus, IFN-λ has a decisive function in the respiratory epithelium that greatly limits MERS-CoV replication, and may be a key cytokine for better therapeutic outcomes against MERS-CoV infection in respiratory tract.

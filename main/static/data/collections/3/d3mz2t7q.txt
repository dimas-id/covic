PURPOSE With the development of new devices, our ligation technique of the inferior mesenteric artery changed from mechanical ligature (ML) to energized vessel sealing systems (EVSS) ligature. The aim of this study was to determine if EVSS could be considered as safe and effective as the more convention ML of the inferior mesenteric vessels division during elective laparoscopic left colectomy. METHODS Between 2001 and 2014, 200 consecutive patients (111 males) of mean age 54.1 years were operated laparoscopically for a symptomatic sigmoid diverticulitis. Vascular interruptions were performed using mechanical ligatures including double clipping, staples or surgical thread (100 patients) or, starting from 2006, with EVSS thereafter (100 patients). Section of the inferior mesenteric artery is performed systematically at its origin in our institution for teaching purposes. Technical results were prospectively collected perioperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS There was no mortality. Mean operating time was 253.7 and 200.7 min in the ML and EVSS groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Mean hospital stay was 10.4 and 8.1 days (p < 0.001). Thirty-day complications occurred in 31 versus 25 % of patients (p = 0.26). Leakage with peritonitis occurred in 3 patients in the ML group. Hemorrhagic events occurred in both groups (2 in ML group versus 1 in EVSS group). Limitations of the study are its retrospective design and the bias due to the comparison of two historical cohorts. CONCLUSIONS EVSS for the inferior mesenteric artery are as safe and effective as ML in elective sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease with lower operative time and hospital stay.

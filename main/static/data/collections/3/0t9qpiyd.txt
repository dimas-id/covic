Coronavirus-infected cells were cytophotometrically measured and analyze during a replication cycle. Distinct cytoplasmic differences were observed in images scanned at 260 and 280 nm; these differences could be attributed to specific virologic changes using virologic tests. The application of computer-aided cytophotometry may prove to be a valuable approach in the analysis of infected cells.

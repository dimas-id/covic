BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is performed as an acceptable life-saving bridging procedure in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).To patients with avian influenza A (H7N9)-associated ARDS, ECMO could be adopted as a feasible therapeutic solution. We present our successful experience with ECMO utilized in a respiratory failure patient with H7N9 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44 years-old female with H7N9-induced ARDS was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and was treated with veno-venous ECMO for six days, antiviral therapy, prolonged corticosteroid infusion and other therapies. She suffered significant hemorrhage requiring transfusion of platelets and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii infection during ECMO support. Bleeding and infection almost killed the patient's life. Fortunately, she was alive at last and completly recovered after 38 days of ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO was effective in this H7N9 patient with a fatal respiratory failure. Mechanical circulatory support was the only chance for our patient with H7N9-associated ARDS to survive until respiratory function recovery. Early detection and rapid response are essential to these serious ECMO-associated complications such as hemorrhage, thrombosis and infection.

BACKGROUND The morbidly obese (MO) patient presents a unique challenge to pain control in the postoperative period due to associated comorbidities and the amplified impact of opiates. In order to reduce potential complications associated with narcotic use in the MO patient, multimodal analgesia has been advocated. In this study, we examined the effect of laparoscopic-guided transversus abdominis plane block (LG TAP) for further optimizing multimodal pain control. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of 140 consecutive patients undergoing LSG without TAP block (pre-TAP group) compared to 131 patients undergoing LSG with LGTAP (TAP group). All operations were performed laparoscopically utilizing uniform clinical pathways. Baseline characteristics for both groups were comparable. Both groups received standardized anesthesia. Outcomes included time to postoperative ambulation, pain scores, PCA volume, length of hospital stay, utilization of oral opiate medications, and return to activity (RTA). RESULTS Pre-TAP versus TAP groups were comparable, mean age 42 years (p = 0.99), women 81.4% versus 87.8% (p = 0.148), mean BMI (kg/m2) 46 versus 45 (p = 0.394). Most patients ambulated within 2 h after arrival to the floor (87.9% vs. 76.3%, p = 0.013). On postoperative day (POD) 1, mean reported pain score (0-10) was 4.50 vs. 5.06 (p = 0.063) and a mean PCA morphine used for 24 h was 26.3 mL versus 26 mL, p = 0.35. Mean days of postoperative opiate medication were 2.19 versus 1.24 (p < 0.001). Return to activity was 2.81 versus 2.08 days (p < 0.001). When controlled for age, BMI, OR time, PCA volume used, and average pain score, TAP block was an independent predictor of earlier return to activities (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS LGTAP block following LSG is an additional valuable modality of pain control in the perioperative period. Our study shows that TAP block is associated with an earlier RTA and decreased opiate use in patients undergoing LSG.

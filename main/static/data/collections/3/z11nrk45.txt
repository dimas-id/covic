The results of several pulmonary resections using a uniportal approach have been published. However, there are no reports of uniportal thoracoscopic anatomic segmentectomy in Japan. We have a fundamental belief in "reduced-port surgery" and therefore routinely perform uniportal thoracoscopic surgery for patients with pneumothorax. This report describes a successful case of uniportal thoracoscopic anatomic segmentectomy through a 3.5-cm incision in a 76-year-old woman with primary lung cancer. The patient was pathologically diagnosed with multiple primary adenocarcinomas stage IA (T1aN0M0). Postoperatively, no analgesics were needed. The operative procedure is described in detail and includes technical tips such as the pulley method, extra-vessel exposure, the shaft-on-shaft technique, one-hand encircling, and one-hand exposure. The selection criteria for uniportal thoracoscopic segmentectomy limit its use.

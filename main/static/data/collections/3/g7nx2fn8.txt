We describe migration of bilateral carotid stents in a 63-year-old man shortly after stenting. Carotid stent migration was found four days post-procedure on the right side and one day post-procedure on the left side on angiography and duplex ultrasound, respectively. This is the first reported case of bilateral carotid artery stenting complicated by bilateral proximal migration of open-cell design stents in the early post-procedure period.

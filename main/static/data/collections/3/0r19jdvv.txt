PURPOSE: There have not been well-designed survey studies investigating the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on orthopaedic resident education. METHODS: A 58-question, web-based survey was administered to orthopaedic residents in South Korea. A total of 229 orthopaedic residents from 43 hospitals completed the survey questionnaire. RESULTS: The average working time of 72.7 hours/week before the pandemic was decreased to 65.6 hours/week during the pandemic (p < 0.001). The time working in the operating room was significantly decreased during the pandemic, but not in the emergency centre and outpatient clinic. The education times for lecture and clinical case discussion were decreased during the pandemic (both, p < 0.001), respectively. While the use of traditional teaching methods was decreased, the use of online-based teaching methods was increased (p < 0.001). However, satisfaction level with online-based teaching methods was significantly lower compared with that of traditional teaching methods. The average working time exposed to the patients with COVID-19 was 9.7 hours/week. About 47.6% of orthopaedic residents experienced isolation or quarantine. The average score for quality of life, which was 68.9 out of 100 scores before the pandemic, decreased to 61.7 during the pandemic (p < 0.001). The most stressful factor for orthopaedic residents during the pandemic was family/relative health, followed by their own health and residency program. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on orthopaedic resident education in South Korea. Therefore, flexible and sustainable strategies are necessary to prepare for the future as well as the current pandemic situation.

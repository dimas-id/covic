BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) stent is a new device recently introduced for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. This single-center study presents the authors' preliminary experience using the LVIS stent to treat saccular aneurysms with parent arteries smaller than 2.5 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms with a LVIS stent used in a small parent vessel (<2.5 mm in diameter) between October 2014 and April 2016 were included. Procedure-related complications, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and midterm follow-up data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 22 patients was studied, including 5 ruptured and 17 unruptured aneurysms. Most of the aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (90.9%). Stent placement in the parent arteries measuring 1.7-2.4 mm in diameter (mean, 2.1 mm) was successful in 100% of cases. Procedure-related complication developed in 1 patient (4.5%) who presented with aneurysm rupture. No permanent morbidity and mortality occurred. Immediate angiographic outcome showed complete occlusion in 8 aneurysms (36.4%), neck residual in 8 (36.4%), and residual aneurysm in 6 (27.3%). All patients underwent angiographic follow-up at a mean of 8.3 months, which revealed complete occlusion in 18 (81.8%) patients, neck remnant in 3 (13.6%), and residual sac in 1 (4.5%). No recanalization of the target aneurysm was observed. There was 1 case with asymptomatic in-stent stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results show that the deployment of LVIS stents in small vessels is feasible, safe, and effective in the midterm. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate our promising results.

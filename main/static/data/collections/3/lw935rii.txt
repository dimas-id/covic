Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were firstly appeared in China. They have certain similarities in biological, epidemiological and pathological. To data, the researches have shown that their gene exhibit 79% of identical sequence and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There have been extensive research performed on SARS, however, the understanding of pathophysiology impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) is still limited. In the review, we draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS in the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis for further understand the features of COVID-19. By comparing these two diseases, we found, COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases were emerged in COVID-19. Children started with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe condition and newborn whose mother was infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed, the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, otherwise the number of CD4+ and CD8+T cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases. Based on these early observations, as pediatrician, we put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and give some recommendations to contain the disease.

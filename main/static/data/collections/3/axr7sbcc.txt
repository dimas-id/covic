Bats are a major “viral reservoir” in nature and there is a great interest in not only the cell biology of their innate and adaptive immune systems, but also in the expression patterns of receptors used for cellular entry by viruses with potential cross-species transmission. To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon β and tumor necrosis factor-α compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis. This compendium of transcriptome data provides a molecular foundation for understanding the cell identities, functions and cellular receptor characteristics for viral reservoirs and zoonotic transmission.

BACKGROUND Pediatric anatomy is more restricted, and the propagation of endonasal endoscopic approaches in the pediatric population has been limited. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of the endonasal endoscopic approach in a variety of age groups and to perform measurements of the corridors and spaces available for surgery as a guide for case selection. METHODS Only patients <18 years were included. The choice of operative corridor/approach is described in relation to pathological entity and location. Preoperative/postoperative visual fields and endocrine panels, extent of resection, as well as postoperative long-term complications are described. Prospective magnetic resonance image-based anatomic measurements of key distances were performed to determine age-dependent surgical indications and limitations. RESULTS Forty purely endoscopic procedures were performed in 33 pediatric patients (5-18 years of age) harboring a variety of skull base lesions, from benign tumors to congenital malformations. For the 20 patients in whom gross total resection was the intended goal of surgery, gross total resection was attained in 15 (75%). There were 2 infections (5%) and no cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Significant improvement was shown in 58.3% of patients with visual deficits. Hormone overproduction resolved in 75% of patients, while preoperative hormone insufficiency only improved in 29.2%. Wider intercarotid distance at the superior clivus (P = .01) and shorter nare-dens working distance (P = .001) predicted improved outcomes and fewer postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Endonasal endoscopic skull base approaches are viable in the pediatric population, they are not impeded by sphenoid sinus aeration, and they have minimal risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak and meningitis. Outcomes and complications can be predicted based on specific radio anatomical skull base measurements rather than age.

Over the past 30 years, Africa has achieved significant health gains. Life expectancy has risen while infant, child, and maternal mortality have declined. Despite these improvements, the continent still faces serious challenges from infectious diseases. The chapter covers HIV and AIDS and other epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses the origins, evolution, mortality, morbidity, and socio-economic impacts of the epidemics, as well as the policies and programs put in place to combat them. The chapter concludes with a review of the funding and the sustainability of such financial efforts.

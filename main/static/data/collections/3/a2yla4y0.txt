Objective Intraarterial thrombolysis (IA-Tx) with stent retriever is accepted as an additional treatment for selected patients and the clinical benefit is well reported. Each intravenous tissue plasminogen activator administration (IV-tPA) and perfusion diffusion mismatching (P/D-mismatching) is well known the beneficial effects for recanalization and clinical outcomes. In this report, authors analyzed the clinical outcomes of additional IA-Tx with retrieval stent device, according to the combined IV-tPA and P/D-mismatching or not. Methods Eighty-one treated IA-Tx with the Solitaire stent retriever device, diagnosed as anterior circulation larger vessel occlusion were included in this study. Computed tomography-angiography (CTA) was done as an initial diagnostic image and acute stroke magnetic resonance image (MRI) followed after the IV-tPA. Forty-two patients were in the tPA group and 39 patients were in the non-tPA group. Recanalization rate, clinically significant hemorrhagic (sICH) and clinical outcomes were recorded according to the IV-tPA and P/D-mismatching. Results Recanalization rate was 81.0% in IV-tPA group, and it was 69.2% in non-tPA group (p = 0.017). While sICH were 19.9% and 25.6%, respectively (p = 0.328). Neurologic outcomes did not influence by IV-tPA administration or not. But according to the P/D-mismatching, the recanalization rate and sICH were 91.9% and 16.7% in the mismatched group and 46.7% and 46.7% in the matched group (p = 0.008 and p = 0.019, respectively). Conclusion For patients treated with IA-Tx with retrieval stent, IV-tPA infusion does not influence on the sICH, recanalization rate and neurologic outcomes. But P/D-mismatching was correlated well with sICH, recanalization rate and clinical outcomes.

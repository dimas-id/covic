Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) G protein deletion mutants replicate effectively in vitro but have not been detected in nature. Subtyping of RSV strains in hospitalized children in South Africa identified G protein PCR amplicons significantly reduced in size in 2 out of 209 clinical specimens screened over 4 years. Sequence analysis revealed subtype B strains lacking nearly the entire G protein ectodomain in one HIV-positive and one HIV-exposed child hospitalized with pneumonia. The association of clinical strains lacking most of the G protein with lower respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised children may have implications for RSV vaccine development.

Background Flow-diverting stents (FDS) have revolutionized the endovascular management of unruptured, complex, wide-necked, and giant aneurysms. There is no consensus on management of complications associated with the placement of these devices. This review focuses on the management of complications of FDS for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Summary We performed a systematic, qualitative review using electronic databases MEDLINE and Google Scholar. Complications of FDS placement generally occur during the perioperative period. Key Message Complications associated with FDS may be divided into periprocedural complications, immediate postprocedural complications, and delayed complications. We sought to review these complications and novel management strategies that have been reported in the literature.

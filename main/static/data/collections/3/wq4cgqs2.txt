“Acute liver failure” (ALF) and “fulminant liver failure” are terms used interchangeably to describe severe and sudden onset of liver cell dysfunction leading on to synthetic and detoxification failure across all age groups. Considerable variations exist between ALF in children and adults, in terms of aetiology and prognosis. Encephalopathy is not essential to make a diagnosis of ALF in children but when present has a bad prognosis. Early recognition of ALF and initiation of supportive management improve the outcome. Liver transplantation remains the only definitive treatment when supportive medical management fails.

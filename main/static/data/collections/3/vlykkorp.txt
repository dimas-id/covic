COVID-19 is viral respiratory infection with frequently fatal lung complications in the elderly or in people with serious comorbidities. Lung destruction appears to be associated with a cytokine storm related to an increased level of interleukin-6 (IL6). Therapeutic targeting of the interleukin-6 signaling pathway can attenuate such a cytokine storm and can be beneficial for patients with COVID-19 in danger of pulmonary failure. This article demonstrates the importance of IL6 in progression of disease and the possibility of inhibition of IL6 signaling in COVID-19 therapy.

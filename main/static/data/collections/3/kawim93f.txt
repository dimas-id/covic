BACKGROUND: Several qPCR kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, mostly lacking of evaluation due to covid19 emergency. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated nCoV-QS (MiCo BioMed) kit using CDC kit as gold standard. RESULTS: We found limitations for nCoV-QS: 1) lower sensitivity 2) lack of RNA quality control probe. CONCLUSIONS: Validation studies should be implemented for any SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR commercial kit to prevent unreliable diagnosis.

The nervous system is an «immune-privileged» site and can provide a reservoir to harbor as persistent or latent infections certain microbes that find their way to the brain. From an evolutionary standpoint, such infections are characterized at most times by low levels of the infectious agent in the systemic domain, except when multiplication has just taken place. Hence the ability for transmission of the pathogens from animals to Man will be determined by the availability of microbes to be transferred by a vector (e.g. in trypanosomiasis), or the amount of infective forms of the microbes shed into an environment (e.g. in toxoplasmosis). Using African trypanosomes, toxoplasma,Listeria and influenza A virus as examples, mechanisms by which microbes can spread and be targeted to and within the brain to cause various types of nervous system dysfunctions is reviewed. Newly revealed potentials of certain cytokines to stimulate neurons to control the growth, and even kill, microbes in their cell bodies is also described.

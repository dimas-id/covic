PURPOSE The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility, tolerance and performance of virtual enteroscopy (VE) using carbon dioxide for small-bowel distension in patients with suspected small-bowel tumours (SBTs). PATIENTS AND METHODS After IRB approval, 17 patients with suspected SBTs were prospectively included. Radiation dose was compared to 34 matched patients (2 for 1) for age, gender and body weight, who had undergone CT-enteroclysis with neutral contrast (CTE). Performance of VE was evaluated through comparison with the current standard of reference, including surgery and/or enteroscopy and/or follow-up. RESULTS Tolerance was excellent in 16/17 patients (94%). The radiation dose was lower for VE than for CTE (533 ± 282 vs. 974 ± 505 mGy.cm; p = 0.002). With VE, a total of 25 polyps >5 mm in size were depicted in 12/17 patients. On a per-lesion analysis, sensitivity and positive predictive value of VE were 92.0% and 92.0%, respectively. On a per-segment analysis VE had a sensitivity and specificity of 95.0% and 87.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION Our preliminary study suggests that VE is a feasible and well-tolerated technique with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SBT. KEY POINTS • Virtual enteroscopy is feasible and well tolerated. • Virtual enteroscopy appears to be accurate for detection of small-bowel tumours. • Sensitivity and PPV of virtual enteroscopy is 92.0% and 92.0%. • Radiation dose is lower with virtual enteroscopy compared to MDCT-enteroclysis.

BACKGROUND A small, but significant, number of patients undergoing bariatric surgery refuse blood transfusion for religious or other personal reasons. Jehovah's Witnesses number more than 1 million members in the United States alone. The reported rates of hemorrhage vary from .5% to 4% after bariatric surgery, with transfusion required in one half of these cases. Pharmacologic prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism could further increase the perioperative bleeding risk. Our objective was to report the perioperative outcomes of bariatric surgery who refuse blood transfusion at a bariatric center of excellence, private practice in the United States. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients who refused blood transfusion when undergoing bariatric surgery during a 10-year period was conducted. Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database by the bloodless surgery program at Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital. Data were collected on demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory values, medication use, blood loss, and 30-day complications. RESULTS Thirty-five bloodless surgery patients underwent bariatric surgery from 2000 to 2009. Of these 35 patients, 21 underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and 14 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Before 2006, only pneumatic compression devices were applied for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (n = 6). Subsequently, combination venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was performed with fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg for RYGB or enoxaparin 40 mg for LAGB (n = 29). One RYGB patient developed postoperative hemorrhage requiring reoperation. No venous thromboembolisms or deaths occurred. CONCLUSION Bariatric surgery can be performed in patients who refuse blood transfusion with acceptable postoperative morbidity. Larger studies are necessary to confirm the safety of this approach and to examine the effect of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in this patient group.

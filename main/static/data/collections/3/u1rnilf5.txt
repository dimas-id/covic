D‐lactate, produced by gastrointestinal fermentation, is a major contributor to metabolic acidosis in diarrheic calves. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG survives gastrointestinal transit in the neonatal calf and does not produce D‐lactate. To determine whether this probiotic reduces gastrointestinal D‐lactate production or severity of diarrhea or both, 48 calves (mean, 11 days old; range, 2–30 days) admitted to the clinic for treatment of diarrhea were randomly allocated to 2 groups. The experimental group was given Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (1×10(11) cfu/d) PO, dissolved in milk or oral electrolyte solution, in addition to clinic treatment protocols; the other group served as a control. Serum and fecal samples were obtained at admission and at 24 and 48 hours after initial administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. All samples were analyzed for D‐and L‐lactate by using high‐pressure liquid chromatography. Feces were also analyzed for pathogens, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG recovery, and dry matter. D‐lactic acidemia (>3 mmol/L) was present in 37/48 calves at admission. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was recovered in the feces of 13 experimental calves and 0 control calves 24 hours after administration. No difference in serum or fecal D‐ or L‐lactate between the groups was detected at any time point. After therapy, D‐lactic acidosis was absent at 48 hours in all but 1 calf. No relation between fecal pathogen (viral, bacterial, or protozoal) and degree of D‐lactic acidosis was observed. The reduction in mortality and greater fecal dry matter in Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG‐treated calves was not statistically significant.

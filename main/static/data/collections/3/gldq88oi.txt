Nature has created innumerable life forms with miraculous hierarchical structures and morphologies that are optimized for different life events through evolution over billions of years. Bicontinuous cubic structures, which are often described by triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) and their constant mean curvature (CMC)/parallel surface companions, are of special interest to various research fields because of their complex form with unique physical functionalities. This has prompted the scientific community to fully understand the formation, structure, and properties of these materials. In this review, we summarize and discuss the formation mechanism and relationships of the relevant biological structures and the artificial self-assembly systems. These structures can be formed through biological processes with amazing regulation across a great length scales; nevertheless, artificial construction normally produces the structure corresponding to the molecular size and shape. Notably, the block copolymeric system is considered to be an applicable and attractive model system for the study of biological systems due to their versatile design and rich phase behavior. Some of the phenomena found in these two systems are compared and discussed, and this information may provide new ideas for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between molecular shape and resulting interface curvature and the self-assembly process in living organisms. We argue that the co-polymeric system may serve as a model to understand these biological systems and could encourage additional studies of artificial self-assembly and the creation of new functional materials.

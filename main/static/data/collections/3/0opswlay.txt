BACKGROUND Synthetic tissue adhesives (TA) are sometimes used in hernia repair surgery. This study compares the use of a new, noncommercial, long-chain cyanoacrylate (n-octyl) TA and Ifabond for mesh fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS In two implant models in the rabbit, expanded polytetrafluorethylene meshes were fixed to the parietal peritoneum using a TA or tacks (intraperitoneal model), or polypropylene meshes used to repair partial abdominal wall defects were fixed with a TA or sutures (extraperitoneal model). Animals were euthanized 14 or 90 d postsurgery and implant specimens were processed for microscopy (labeling of macrophages and apoptotic cells), peritoneal fluid and biomechanical strength testing. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were determinated in peritoneal fluid. RESULTS Mesothelial cell deposition on the intraperitoneal implants fixed using the new TA and Ifabond was adequate and similar IL-6 and TNF-α levels were detected in these implants. Intraperitoneal meshes fixed with tacks showed IL-6 overexpression. Three months after surgery, macrophage and apoptotic cell rates were higher for the intraperitoneal implants fixed with Ifabond versus the new TA or tacks. In the extraperitoneal model, reduced macrophage and cell damage responses were observed in the meshes fixed with sutures versus both TA. Tensile strengths were greater for the tacks versus TA in the intraperitoneal implants and similar for the sutures and TA in the extraperitoneal implants (90 d). CONCLUSIONS Both TA showed a good cell response in both models. Their use in an intraperitoneal location resulted in reduced tensile strength compared with the tacks. However, strengths were comparable when extraperitoneal implants were fixed with these adhesives or sutures.

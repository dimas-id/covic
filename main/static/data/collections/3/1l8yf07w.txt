The conventional management of acute respiratory failure (ARF) consists of endotracheal intubation; this carries potential risks, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and laryngeal-tracheal damage [1,2]. Noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) is an alternative form of respiratory treatment which incorporates various techniques aimed at improving alveolar ventilation, oxygenation, and unloading of the respiratory muscles without the need for an invasive tracheal device. Because of its safety and effectiveness, the use of NRS has been adopted throughout the world. During the last 25 years, NRS techniques have increasingly been used in the treatment of both chronic respiratory failure and ARF in adult patients in several pathological conditions. NRS applied to adults in the acute setting has been found to improve outcome, reduce the rate of intubation, and decrease the rate of complications [3].

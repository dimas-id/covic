Ongoing pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major challenge for healthcare. Beside the proven involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID-19, increased healthcare system resources are redirected towards handling infected patients and thus induce major changes in access to services and priorities in the management of patients with unrelated chronic cardiovascular disease. This document, created by task force involving Working Groups on Valvular Heart Disease and Cardiac Surgery as well as Association of Cardiovascular Intervention, Polish Cardiac Society proposes modifications of diagnostic pathways, principles of healthcare professionals protection and guidelines for treatment according to triage and prioritization. Valvular heart teams should continue working with utilization of telemedicine and digital technology. Diagnostic tests must be simplified or deferred to minimize potentially dangerous aerosol generating procedures such as transesophageal echocardiography or exercise imaging. Treatments for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation have to be offered especially in urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis. Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists. In any case, appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infections and preserving specialized manpower to supply for the continuing need of handling chronic serious cardiovascular disease. Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to rebuild standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder-based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding stat-of-the-art cardiovascular services.

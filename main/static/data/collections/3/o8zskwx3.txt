High-quality clinical study on traditional Chinese medicine is of great significance to effectively control new public health emergencies represented by outbreaks of infectious diseases and ensure people's health and safety, but it still faces a series of ethical issues. Based on the seven core values of equity, good deeds, effectiveness, respect for individuals, freedom, reciprocity, and solida-rity proposed in the Guidelines for Management of Ethical Issues in Outbreaks of Infectious Diseases, this article emphasizes the characteristics and laws of clinical studies on traditional Chinese medicine. Main points of ethical review of traditional Chinese medicine were summarized in the aspects of overall concept, syndrome differentiation and treatment, prevention before disease onset, cultural value, and clinical basis. Based on the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), we collected relevant registered Chinese medicine clinical studies, summarized the core issues of the ethics review for COVID-19, and further improved the traditional Chinese medicine ethics review system and resources, so as to better serve ethical review and scientific studies in public health emergencies.

Wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms (WNBAs) make up 26-36% of all brain aneurysms. Treatments for WNBAs pose unique challenges due to the need to preserve major bifurcation vessels while achieving a durable occlusion of the aneurysm. Intrasaccular flow disruption is an innovative technique for the treatment of WNBAs. The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is the only United States Food and Drug Administration approved intrasaccular flow disruption device. In this review article we discuss various aspects of treating WNBAs with the WEB device, including indications for use, aneurysm/device selection strategies, antiplatelet therapy requirement, procedural technique, potential complications and bailouts, and management strategies for residual/recurrent aneurysms after initial WEB treatment.

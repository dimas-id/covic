Viral entry mechanisms for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an important aspect of virulence. Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2). The distribution of expression of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has been recently demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remain unclear. Here we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes are modulated in target organs of select disease states. In tissues such as heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities vs healthy individuals. Additionally, we found increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer or smoking across target organ systems. Our results demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and suggest new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.

Background Since the emergence of the COVID-19, health officials have struggled to devise strategies to counteract the speed of the pandemic's spread across the globe. It became imperative to implement accurate diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on respiratory samples. In many places, however, besides the limited availability of test reagents, laboratory personnel face the challenge of adapting their working routines to manipulate highly infective clinical samples. Here, we proposed the use of a virus-inactivating solution as part of a sample collection kit to decrease the infectious potential of the collected material without affecting the integrity of RNA samples used in diagnostic tests based on RT-qPCR. Methods Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and from laboratory personnel using a commercially available viral transport solution (VTM) and the denaturing solution (DS) described here. RNA extracted from all samples was tested by RT-qPCR using probes for viral and human genes. Exposure of laboratory personnel to infective viruses was also accessed using ELISA tests. Findings The use of the DS did not interfere with the detection of viral genome or the endogenous human mRNA, since similar results were obtained from samples collected with VTM or DS. In addition, all tests of laboratory personnel for the presence of viral RNA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Interpretation The methodology described here provides a strategy that allow high diagnostic accuracy as well as safe manipulation of clinical samples by those involved with diagnostic procedures.

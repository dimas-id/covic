We breathe to live, but the air we breathe carries many potentially harmful agents. To protect us against these constant challenges, our lungs have defenses that are remarkably effective, biologically complex, and scientifically fascinating. It is not hyperbole to say that the pathogenesis of most lung disease begins with a breach of these defenses. This chapter surveys these normal lung defense systems. Just as this text assumes familiarity with general pathology, we also assume knowledge of basic immunology. This chapter emphasizes the lungâ€™s variations on themes of innate and adaptive immunity, and discusses the special role of granulomatous inflammation in lung defenses.

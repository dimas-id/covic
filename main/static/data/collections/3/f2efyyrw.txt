INTRODUCTION Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities (AVCA) may complicate transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate AVCA after TAVI and SAVR. METHODS AND RESULTS Among 50 patients undergoing TAVI and 25 patients undergoing SAVR a continuous 7-day Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded after the procedure. ECGs during TAVI and 12-lead ECGs before and 1 and 7 days after TAVI and SAVR were analyzed. At baseline, TAVI patients were older (mean 82.1 vs 75.4, P < 0.001), had a longer PR interval (median 200 milliseconds vs 175 milliseconds, P = 0.004) and broader QRS width (median 100 milliseconds vs 80 milliseconds, P = 0.007) than SAVR patients. New AVCA were observed among 29 TAVI patients (58%), mostly new left bundle branch block (76%). Predilatation induced new AVCA in 14 TAVI patients (28%). New AVCA resolved within 24 hours in 15 TAVI patients (30%), and persisted in 14 TAVI (28%) and 3 SAVR patients (12%, P = 0.12). Among patients with persistent QRS width <120 milliseconds during the first 24 hours after TAVI, QRS width remained stable during the remainder of the observation period. During Holter monitoring complete AV block was observed in 4 TAVI patients (8%) and 3 SAVR patients (12%; P = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS Almost half of AVCA during TAVI are induced by predilatation, but half of them resolve within 24 hours. Persistent AVCA are more frequently observed after TAVI than SAVR. If QRS width is below 120 milliseconds the first day after TAVI, the risk of late AVCA seems low.

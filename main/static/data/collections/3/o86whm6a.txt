COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) pandemic was recently declared by the WHO as a global health emergency. A group of interventional radiology senior experts developed a consensus document for infection control and management of patients with COVID-19 in interventional radiology (IR) departments. This consensus statement has been brought together at short notice with the help of different protocols developed by governmental entities and scientific societies to be adapted to the current reality and needs of IR Departments. Recommendations are the specific strategies to follow in IR departments, preventive measures and regulations, step by step for donning and doffing personal protective equipment, specific IR procedures which can not be delayed, and aerosol-generating procedures in IR with COVID-19 patients. It is advisable with this document to be adapted to local workplace policies.

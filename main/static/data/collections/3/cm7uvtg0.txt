Sera collected from 90 multiple sclerosis patients and 148 age-matched normal subjects were examined for the presence of antibodies against human coronaviruses (HCV) 229E and OC43 by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The results demonstrated no significant difference between the MS patients and the normal subjects in their antibody titer to HCV 229E and HCV OC43. Further analysis of these 238 sera indicated that a stronger EIA reaction was generally observed against HCV OC43 (mean EIA value at an optical density of 492 nm = 0.896) than against HCV 229E (mean EIA value at an optical density of 492 nm = 0.346).

INTRODUCTION: Descriptions of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have focused on the non-pregnant adult population. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnancy. METHODS: We searched databases from December 2019 to April 30(th), 2020. Eligible studies reported clinical characteristics, radiological findings and/or laboratory testing of pregnant women during infection. Data were pooled across studies using random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies (136 women) were included. Most common symptoms were fever (62.9%) and cough (36.8%). Laboratory findings included elevated C-Reactive Protein (57%) and lymphocytopenia (50%). Ground-glass opacity was the most common radiological finding (81.7%). Preterm birth rate was 37.7% and cesarean delivery rate was 76%. There was one maternal death. There were two fetal COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: The clinical picture in pregnant women with COVID-19 did not differ from the non-pregnant population, however, the rate of preterm birth and cesarean delivery are considerably higher than international averages.

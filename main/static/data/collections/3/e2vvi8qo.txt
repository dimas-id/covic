Availability of the human genome data has enabled the exploration of a huge amount of biological information encoded in it. There are extensive ongoing experimental efforts to understand the biological functions of the gene products encoded in the human genome. However, computational analysis can aid immensely in the interpretation of biological function by associating known functional/structural domains to the human proteins. In this article we have discussed the implications of such associations. The association of structural domains to human proteins could help in prioritizing the targets for structure determination in the structural genomics initiatives. The protein kinase family is one of the most frequently occurring protein domain families in the human proteome while P‐loop hydrolase, which comprises many GTPases and ATPases, is a highly represented superfamily. Using the superfamily relationships between families of unknown and known structures we could increase structural information content of the human genome by about 5%. We could also make new associations of domain families to 33 human proteins that are potentially linked to genetically inherited diseases. IUBMB Life, 56: 317‐331, 2004

This study investigates the effects of various drying methods applied to leaves of Cistus creticus L. on the contents of polyphenols and the composition of the volatile fraction. The following four drying methods were used: convection drying at a temperature of 40 °C (CD 40 °C), 50 °C (CD 50 °C), and 60 °C (CD 60 °C); vacuum-microwave (VMD 240 W); combined drying, involving convection pre-drying (50 °C) and vacuum-microwave (240 W) finish drying (CPD-VMFD) as well as freeze-drying (FD). Polyphenols in the dried leaves were determined using chromatography-photodiode detector-quadrupole/time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-Q/TOF-MS). The contents of odoriferous substances in the dry material were determined by means of head space-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with the use of a gas chromatograph (GC). Thirty-seven polyphenol components including 21 flavonols, eight flavan-3-ols, and eight hydrolyzed tannins in dry Pink Rock Rose material were found for the first time. The highest contents of polyphenols, totaling 2.8 g 100 g(−1) dry matter (d.m.), were found in the samples subjected to the CPD/VMFD drying method. Pink Rock Rose subjected to this drying method was characterized by large quantities of odoriferous compounds, mainly eugenol, thymol, and carvacrol, which contribute to its antiseptic properties. By using CPD/VMFD methods, it is possible to obtain fine quality dry material from the leaves of C. creticus.

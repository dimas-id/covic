Severe COVID-19 causes cytokine release syndrome and is associated with high mortality. In this retrospective case series, all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi quantitative RT-PCR and hyperinflammatory markers were treated with tocilizumab. The use of tocilizumab was associated with rapid apyrexia, improvement of respiratory, biological parameters and short length of hospitalization (11 days). Moreover, no adverse effect attributed to the treatment was noticed. Tocilizumab seems to be a promising and safe therapy in severe patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that genetic variations may play an important role in the development of acute lung injury (ALI). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI models has been widely applied for pathophysiological and pharmacological research. In order to understand the variation of acute pulmonary reactions between mouse strains and find the optimal strain for target-oriented study, the present study investigated the alterations of acute lung hyperinflation, inflammation and injury in C57BL/6J, Balb/cJ, DBA/1J, CD-1, NMRI, DBA/2J, A/J and C3H/HeN mice after the intra-tracheal challenge with LPS. We found that LPS-induced ALI varied between measured variables, durations and strains. General score of LPS-induced acute lung hyperinflation, inflammation and edema followed the order CD-1, A/J, Balb/c, DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, DBA/1J, NMRI, C3H/HeN mice at 4h, and CD-1, C57BL/6J, Balb/c, C3H/HeN, NMRI, A/J, DBA/2J, DBA/1 mice at 24h. Thus, these data provide useful information to select sensitive or resistant strain mouse for understanding genetic variation of pathogenesis and screening of target-oriented drugs.

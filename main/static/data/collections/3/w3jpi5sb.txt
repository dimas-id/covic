The ongoing COVID‚Äê19 pandemic is an exceptional challenge for the health systems throughout the world. So far, no causative therapy nor protective vaccines are available. In several countries, the capacities for intensive care and for support in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are overstretched, and the mortality is considerable. In this situation, useful prognostic parameters and targeted supportive treatment are urgently needed.

PURPOSES The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of straight laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy (sLRP) with ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS Twenty patients underwent sLRP or open restorative proctocolectomy. The 2 groups were retrospectively well matched with respect to sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists' score. RESULTS The median operative time was longer in the sLRP group (P=0.0003). The median operative blood loss was significantly less in the sLRP group (P=0.0054). The median analgesic drug usage during the first 7 days after surgery was lower in the sLRP group (P=0.038). There were no differences in morbidity rates and long-term functional outcome measures between the groups. CONCLUSIONS An sLRP for UC has the advantage over an open restorative proctocolectomy of better short-term outcomes, and both groups have similar long-term outcomes. This procedure is acceptable for minimally invasive surgery in patients with UC.

Frequent air travelers and airplane pilots may develop various types of illnesses. The environmental risk factors associated with air travel syndromes (ATS) or air travel-related adverse health outcomes raised concerns and need to be assessed in the context of risk management and public health. Accordingly, the aim of the present review was to determine ATS, risk factors, and mechanisms underlying ATS using scientific data and information obtained from Medline, Toxline, and regulatory agencies. Additional information was also extracted from websites of organizations, such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (IAMAT), and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Air travelers are known to be exposed to environmental risk factors, including circadian rhythm disruption, poor cabin air quality, mental stress, high altitude conditions, hormonal dysregulation, physical inactivity, fatigue, biological infections, and alcoholic beverage consumption. Consequences of ATS attributed to air travel include sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia), mental/physical stress, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory diseases, circulatory-related dysfunction, such as cardiac arrest and thrombosis and, at worst, mechanical and terrorism-related airplane crashes. Thus safety measures in the cabin before or after takeoff are undertaken to prevent illnesses or accidents related to flight. In addition, airport quarantine systems are strongly recommended to prepare for any ultimate adverse circumstances. Routine monitoring of environmental risk factors also needs to be considered. Frequently, the mechanisms underlying these adverse manifestations involve free radical generation. Therefore, antioxidant supplementation may help to reduce or prevent adverse outcomes by mitigating health risk factors associated with free radical generation.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes a significant proportion of the global burden of respiratory disease. Here we summarize the conclusions of a series of chapters written by investigators describing and interpreting what is known about the virology, clinical manifestations, immunity, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of RSV relevant to vaccine development. Several technological and conceptual advances have recently occurred that make RSV vaccine development more feasible, and this collected knowledge is intended to help inform and organize the future contributions of funding agencies, scientists, regulatory agencies, and policy makers that will be needed to achieve the goal of a safe, effective, and accessible vaccine to prevent RSV-associated disease.

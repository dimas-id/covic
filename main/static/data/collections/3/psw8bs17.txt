As the point of care diagnosis devices are becoming ever more popular, this paper suggest a miniaturized testing device from a drop of blood to diagnosis of disease for the global healthcare. The minimal requirements for the POC blood-testing device are blood microsampling, blood separation, immunoassay, and detection and communication of the signals. The microsampling of the blood can be achieved by specialized needle, which can be connected to the microchip or analytical devices. The sampled blood is then separated using either a filter (weir or pillar type), or by the phenomena unique to microfluidic system. The separated blood should then go through sandwich, homogeneous non-competitive, or competitive immunoassay, which can effectively diagnose diverse diseases. Lastly, the device should detect and translate the immune-signals to readable, and clinically significant signals. The development of such device will play a great role for improving healthcare technology.

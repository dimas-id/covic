The S1 gene hypervariable region I (HVR I) of 22 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains isolated in Guangxi during the period of 1985-2007 were sequenced and compared to that of the other IBV reference strains and the pigeon coronavirus isolates. A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of HVR I of all the IBV showed that they were classified into 5 distinct Clusters. 16 out of 22 IBV isolates were grouped into Cluster I, and had higher homology with pigeon coronavirus isolates but lower homology with the Massachusetts (Mass) type vaccine strains. There were 4 and 3 amino-acid residues inserted at the sites of 33-34 and 34-35 respectively within HVR I in 15 isolates, except in isolate GX-NN6 there had 4 amino-acid residues inserted at the both sites; isolates GX-YL1 and GX-NN2 had close relationship with Mass type vaccine strains, and they shared Cluster II; isolates GX-G and GX-XD of Cluster III had close relationship with the Japanese strain JP Miyazaki 89 which was isolated at the same period; isolates GX-YL6 and GX-NN7 of Cluster V had close relationship with the European strain 4/91. The results showed that there were high phylogenetic diversity among the IBVs prevailed in the field in Guangxi resulting from the commonly occurred mutation or insertion within the S1 gene HVR I of the viruses, and majority of the isolates had lower homology with the commonly used Mass type vaccine strains. There was much higher homology among viruses isolated in the same period of time, but without distinct difference in geographical origins.

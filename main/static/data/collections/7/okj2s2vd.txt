Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) require terminal differentiation of the host cell to produce infectious virions. The process of viral maturation involves a variety of changes in the expression/activity of host proteins that lead to high-level replication of the viral genome and expression of the late viral genes. Although the late promoter regions of HPV type 16 (HPV-16) are still not fully characterized, differentiation-dependent regulation of viral genes is thought to involve changes in the binding of host cell transcription factors to the viral promoter and regulatory regions. Currently, very little is known about specific cellular transcription factors involved in this process. We used the Panomics TransSignal protein/DNA array to identify changes in the levels of cellular transcription factors during methylcellulose-induced differentiation of W12 (20863) cells containing HPV-16. We then identified the differentially expressed transcription factors that specifically bind to HPV-16 DNA, including the known promoter and regulatory regions. We have validated the results obtained from the Panomics array by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have shown that many of the transcription factors identified in the above screen bind to the HPV-16 promoter/regulatory sequences in vivo and that the level of this binding is increased during differentiation. This approach identified approximately 30 transcription factors that specifically bind to HPV-16 sequences and may be involved in regulating HPV-16 transcription during differentiation. Although some of these transcription factors have previously been suggested to be involved in HPV-16 transcription, a number of them represent novel viral DNA-host protein interactions.

Integrated culture is a widespread culture mode in South China, in which resistance genes (RGs) also spread in the circulation system with nutrients. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the spread of RGs in a fish-duck pond and the RGs and bacterial community of fish intestines. Five fish tanks, including a control tank and four experimental tanks (duck manure, duck manure + cefotaxime, duck manure + As, and duck manure + cefotaxime + As), were tested for 100 days. The results showed that duck manure increased both the diversity and relative abundance of RGs in fish intestines, and the addition of stress factors (cefotaxime, As) increased the relative abundance of RGs by one to two orders of magnitude. The stress-inducing effect of cefotaxime was greater than that of As. Tetracycline resistance genes were more sensitive to stress factors and were the predominant RGs in fish intestines. RGs in duck manure preferentially spread from the water to biofilm and then to fish intestines, whereas co-stress of cefotaxime and As obviously promoted the spread of RGs to fish intestines. In comparison to the control tank, duck manure and stress factors significantly changed the bacterial community of fish intestines. Correlation analysis also revealed that arsB, MOX, tetA and sul1 were significantly correlated with intI1 (P < 0.01), which hinted a potentially dissemination risk of RGs in fish intestines. These findings provide a theoretical basis for further investigating the dissemination of RGs in integrated culture systems and for evaluating the ecological risk of antibiotic and As use in aquaculture.

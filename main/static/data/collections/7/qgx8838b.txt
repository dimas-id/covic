PURPOSE OF REVIEW The selection and application of outcome measures are fundamental steps in the research process because they inform decisions around intervention efficacy. We aimed to describe the outcomes used in trials of supportive interventions for adult caregivers of people with three exemplar life-limiting conditions: heart failure, dementia or stroke. RECENT FINDINGS We performed a focussed review of 134 published trials that included interventions designed to improve caregivers' health and wellbeing and/or ability to function in their caring role. We extracted and categorized all caregiver outcomes described in the studies. We identified inconsistency in the outcomes measured; frequent use of bespoke and adapted tools (29% of outcomes were bespoke), and a lack of clarity in outcome priorities (the mean number of outcomes per trial was four [range: 1-11]). Outcome scales that purport to measure the psychological impact of the caring role were the most popular tools in all three caregiver groups. SUMMARY Outcomes used in trials related to adult caregivers are characterized by inconsistencies in outcome measure selection and assessment. This heterogeneity complicates comparisons of treatments and attempts to pool data.

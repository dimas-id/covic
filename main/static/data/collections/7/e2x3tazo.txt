Abstract Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infection by several viruses, such as influenza A virus, West Nile virus and dengue virus. It has not been determined whether porcine IFITMs (pIFITMs) inhibit infection by pseudorabies virus (PRV), an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus, which is the etiological agent of Aujeszkyâ€™s disease in pigs. Here, we report that PRV infection elicited pIFITM1 expression in PK15 porcine kidney epithelial cells and 3D4/21 alveolar macrophages. pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 expression was only elevated in PK15 cells during PRV infection. Depletion of pIFITM1 using RNA interference, either in PK15 or in 3D4/21 cells, enhanced PRV infection while overexpression of pIFITM1 had the opposite effect. Knockdown of pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 did not influence PRV infection, suggesting that pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 are independent of PRV infection. PRV-induced pIFITM1 expression was dependent on the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate immune pathway and interferon-alpha receptor-1, suggesting that pIFITM1 is up-regulated by the type I interferon signaling pathway. The anti-PRV role of pIFITM1 was inhibited upon PRV entry. Our data demonstrate that pIFITM1 is a host restriction factor that inhibits PRV entry that may shed light on a strategy for prevention of PRV infection.

Background Fat grafting is commonly used when treating soft-tissue defects. However, much of the basic biology behind fat transfer is still uncovered. Adipocytes can be divided into energy storing white and energy burning brown adipose cells. It is now well known, that also adult humans have metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) within white adipose tissue (WAT). Previously our group showed that transfer of metabolically inactive WAT into a new environment increased the metabolic activity of the fat grafts to resemble the activity in the recipient site and that different WAT depots have variation in the metabolic activity. This led us to speculate, whether the metabolic increase of the graft is a result of "browning" of the transferred WAT toward beige adipose tissue. Methods We investigated the metabolic and histological characteristics and BAT marker Ucp1 gene expression in different types of WAT grafts placed either in subcutaneous or muscle tissue in mice. Metabolic activity of the grafts was investigated by FDG-PET/CT at 4- and 12-week time-points. Results The glucose uptake of all transferred fat types was increased when compared with respective control WAT regardless of transfer location. Ucp1 gene and protein expression was increased in 4 of 15 intramuscularly placed fat graft samples and showed histological resemblance to BAT with multilocular cells. Conclusions Grafting of metabolically inactive fat intramuscularly may induce browning of fat grafts toward more active beige adipose tissue. This opens up new research areas in exploiting fat grafting in metabolic diseases.

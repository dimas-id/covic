The emergence of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has brought significantly more attention to the single-incision transumbilical laparoscopic approach (SILS) for minimally invasive surgery. SILS combines the cosmetic advantage of NOTES with the technical familiarity of the conventional multiport laparoscopic approach. Additionally, SILS does not involve penetration of an organ, nor does it involve the steep learning curve and costly instruments associated with NOTES. Given these advantages, the authors believe that the single-incision transumbilical approach highlights the future direction of minimally invasive surgery. However, because of the associated technical challenges, the single-incision approach has not quite yet achieved the crossover to advanced surgical procedures that conventional multiport laparoscopy achieved in its early years. In this report, the authors present what is, to the best of their knowledge, the first reported case of a single-port access laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using the SILS Port placed through a single intraumbilical skin incision.

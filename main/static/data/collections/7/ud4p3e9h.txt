(+)-Linderaspirone A and (-)-linderaspirone A, a pair of natural windmill-shaped enantiomers, were isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine plant Lindera aggregate by HPLC using a chiral column, achieving over 98% ee. Their structures and absolute configurations were determined on the basis of extensive analysis of NMR spectra, crystal X-ray diffraction, and calculation of the optical rotations (OR). They have an unprecedented carbon skeleton and showed significant activity against glucosamine-induced insulin resistance.

PURPOSE The nursing literature has devoted little attention to the long-term influence of infectious diseases and the subsequent rehabilitation needs of the affected patients. This study was conducted to identify the factors associated with physical activity (PA) in older institutionalized adults with leprosy. METHOD A cross-sectional research design was used. RESULTS Data from 248 subjects (75.28 Â± 8.64 years old) were analyzed. We found that fewer subjects in PA compared to older adults in general. Amputation, fear of falling (FF), the ability to perform activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were the influencing factors of PA. Doing laundry, preparing a meal, taking medicines, and making telephone calls accounted for 23.4% of the PA variance. CONCLUSION We suggest incorporating FF in the psychosocial indicators of the mobility assessment. The importance of promoting or maintaining four specific IADL abilities and participating in PA for leprosy patients living in a sanatorium is emphasized.

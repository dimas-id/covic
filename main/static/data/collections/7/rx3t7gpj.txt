PURPOSE The aim of this study was to demonstrate that gastric volvulus can be prevented by omentopexy and sleeve gastrectomy without increasing other complication rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 1385 patients who underwent omentopexy and sleeve gastrectomy between April 2013 and September 2017 were included this study. Body mass index, age, sex, comorbidities, and postoperative complications of the patients were recorded as data. RESULTS A total of 1385 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy and omentopexy. There were 999 female and 386 male patients. The mean age of the patients was 36 years (14 to 71 y). The mean body mass index was 42.74 kg/m (35 to 73 kg/m). Twenty-one patients had previously undergone gastric banding and the other 80 patients had previous abdominal operation. The number of patients undergoing simultaneous cholecystectomy was 98. Three patients had hemorrhage due to hypertension and anticoagulant treatment in the postoperative period and the patients were treated medically. One staple-line leakage was observed. Twist, and stricture were not observed and no mortalities were noted. CONCLUSIONS Sleeve gastrectomy and omentopexy can prevent the gastric twist, which is a functional cause of gastric stenosis, by stabilizing the posterior stomach wall.

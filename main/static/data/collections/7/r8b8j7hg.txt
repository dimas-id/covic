OBJECTIVE To study the relationship of timing of hospitalization and the severity, course, fatality of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. METHOD 1291 hospital records of clinically diagnosed SARS patients with complete data gathered from "2003 Beijing SARS Clinical Database" were analyzed. RESULTS SARS cases were categorized into four groups, according to the time of hospitalization after onset of the disease: within 3 days, during day 4 to day 7, during day 8 to day 14 and after day 14. The numbers of cases for each group were 568, 496, 177 and 50 respectively. Data showed that from group 1 to 4, the prevalence rates of major symptoms on the first day of hospitalization were: (1) 9.7%, 16.5%, 23.1% and 24.0% for "feeling chest pain" (P < 0.001), (2) 7.4%, 13.7%, 19.2% and 22.0% for "suffering from breathing obstruction" (P < 0.001), (3) 32.8%, 44.8%, 59.9% and 48.0%, for "coughing" (P < 0.001) and (4) 14.1%, 22.4%, 27.1% and 18.0% for "coughing up phlegm" (P = 0.0002), respectively. The rates of high respiratory frequency (>or= 24 bits/min.) were 11.1%, 15.5%, 22.8% and 25.5% (P < 0.001). The rates of abnormal chest X-ray were 80.3%, 89.0%, 92.3% and 88.9%, respectively (P = 0.002). The average numbers of abnormal lung field (the lung were divided into 6 fields) were 1.7, 1.9, 2.5 and 2.6 (P < 0.001); The numbers of cases receiving continuous oxygen supply treatment were 33.6%, 50.0%, 53.7% and 74.0% (P < 0.001), and the numbers of cases receiving glucocorticosteroids treatment were 28.2%, 35.9%, 53.7% and 62.0% (P < 0.001), respectively. With cases having had chronic baseline diseases prior to SARS infection, the age-standardized fatality rates were 14.9%, 11.7%, 50.0% and 33.9% (P < 0.001), and the average courses of the disease were 30.3, 34.2, 42.9 and 47.5 days (P < 0.001), respectively. In cases without chronic baseline diseases, the age-standardized fatality rates were 5.3%, 9.8%, 9.2% and 8.3% (P = 0.101), and the average courses for each group were 32.4, 35.3, 40.9 and 47.6 days (P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION Delayed hospitalization would cause the situation of SARS patient to deteriorate, losing the best chance for treatment and increase case fatality. In terms of control program on SARS, emphasize should be paid on decreasing the panic of patients to the disease so as to get early hospitalization.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is putting our healthcare system under exceptional pressure, given the number of affected patients. In a context of limited human healthcare resources, senior medical students represent a valuable workforce that can quickly be mobilized for patient care. This is the approach followed in Switzerland and other countries, in several outpatient structures or inpatient services, including the Department of Internal Medicine, of the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). In this article, we first give the floor to students who responded to our call. We conclude with important considerations in terms of students' clinical supervision. It is reminded that the involvement of students in the care of COVID-19 patients should only occur on a vo luntary basis.

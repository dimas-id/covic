The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continues to spread and evolve across the planet. The crosscutting impacts of the virus, individual country responses to the virus, and the state of preparedness of local public health systems greatly vary across the world. The ostensibly late arrival of the virus in Africa has allowed learning, innovation, and adaptation of methods that have been successful in the early-hit countries. This article analyzes how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes that adaptations of the Singapore pandemic response model would bode well for Africa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that also take into account regional differences in health care infrastructures, socioeconomic resilience, poverty, and the vast population diversity in the African continent. As the pandemic evolves, the lessons learned in Asia, in particular, and the emerging new experiences in African countries should inform, ideally in real time, how best to steer the world populations into safety, including those in low-resource health care settings. Finally, we note that the current COVID-19 pandemic is also a test for our collective ability to scale and surge public health in response to future and likely equally challenging zoonosis infections that jump from animals to humans, not to mention climate change-related planetary health calamities in the 21st century. Hence, what we learn effectively from the current COVID-19 pandemic shall have broad, enduring, and intergenerational relevance for the future of planetary heath and society.

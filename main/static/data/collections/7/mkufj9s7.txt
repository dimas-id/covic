Persistent sciatic artery (PSA) is an anatomical variation which is rare and most frequently diagnosed secondary to its clinical complications. The sciatic artery walls have a tendency to aneurysmal degeneration and may evolve to thrombosis or thromboembolism. This article reports the case of a 13-year-old male patient with left superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after gunshot wound and complete PSA with in-line flow to the popliteal artery as incidental finding. The patient underwent coil embolization of the pseudoaneurysm with the sciatic artery left intact. The technical aspects are discussed and the literature on diagnosis and therapeutic approach of this anatomical variation is reviewed.

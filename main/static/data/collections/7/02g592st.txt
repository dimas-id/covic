A convenient and practical method for the synthesis of 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-aryl(alkyl)pyrimidines has been developed via a three-component, one-pot reaction from aldehydes, malononitrile and S-alkylisothiouronium salts in water at room temperature. A series of polysubstituted pyrimidines were prepared by this method in moderate to excellent yields. In addition, two kinds of pyrimidine-fused heterocyclic derivatives with potential pharmacological activity were constructed from our 2-alkylthio-4-amino-5-cyano-6-arylpyrimidines.

We have read with interest the recent review by Zbinden‐Foncea et.al., suggesting that high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness induced by prior exercise training may confer some innate immune‐protection against Covid‐19 by attenuating the “cytokine storm syndrome” by modulating angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) effects. However, it is important to highlight that the benefic effects of physical exercise also involves the Ang‐(1‐7)/Mas axis activation.

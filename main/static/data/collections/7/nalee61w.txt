The objective of this study was to determine if anti-embolism stockings are fitted and worn according to evidence-based guidelines in surgical patients. The methodology is that an observational study was undertaken during January and February, 2010. An audit tool was constructed for the recording of information on a variety of parameters relating to the correct fitting and wearing of anti-embolism stockings. The results show that eighty surgical patients were audited with a mean age of 66 years. Of these, 72.5% were ambulatory; 38.75% of patients had incorrect presentation of their stockings; 29% were fitted with the incorrect size for limb measurement and 70% of patients reported not receiving any information regarding the reason for anti-embolism stocking use. Written information was not received by 100% of participants. For 82.5% of participants deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk was not recorded. The garment size fitted (and/or limb measurement) was not recorded for 100% of patients. Daily routine skin inspection was noted for 29%. The findings of this study showed that anti-embolism stockings were not fitted and worn according to evidence-based guidelines. The author recommends a new recording tool be developed to ensure consistency of assessment and documentation regarding risk assessment, contraindications identification, and education and monitoring of patients wearing anti-embolism stockings.

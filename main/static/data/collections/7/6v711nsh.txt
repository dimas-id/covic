Academic otolaryngology has historically comprised a tripartite mission of research, education, and clinical care. This mission is greatly strained by the COVID-19 pandemic. Research laboratories are fallow, surgical cases are deferred, and clerkships are canceled. Otolaryngologists are adapting to new circumstances ranging from virtual patient care to urgent procedures in protective gear to deployment to provisional field hospitals. Amid these operational challenges, the specialty is demonstrating extraordinary resilience and grit, discovering new ways to serve learners, colleagues, and communities. Statements from leaders in otolaryngology reveal selfless acts and purposefulness. Necessity has spurred innovation in education, science, and novel models of care. Paragons strike notes of hope, inspiring us to persevere and serve. This commentary explores the present challenges and offers a vision for upholding the academic mission.

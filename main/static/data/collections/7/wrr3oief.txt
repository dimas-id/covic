To date, the impact, timeline and duration of COVID‐19 pandemic remains unknown and more than ever it is necessary to provide safe pathways for cancer patients. Multiple triage systems for nonemergent surgical procedures have been published, but potentially curative cancer procedures are essential surgery rather than elective surgery. In the present and future scenario of our country, thoracic oncology teams may have the difficult decision of weighing the utility of surgical intervention against the risk for inadvertent COVID‐19 exposure for patients and medical staff. In consequence, traditional pathways of surgical care must be adjusted to reduce the risk of infection and the use of resources. It is recommended that all thoracic cancer patients should be offered treatment according to the accepted standard of care until shortage of services require a progressive reduction in surgical cases. Here, we present a consensus of recommendations discussed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts on thoracic oncology and based on the best available evidence, and hope it will provide a modifiable framework of guidance for local strategy planners in thoracic cancer care services in Mexico. KEY POINTS: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: This article provides recommendations to guarantee the continuity of surgical care for thoracic oncology cases during COVID‐19 pandemic, whilst maintaining the safety of patients and medical staff. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This guideline is the result of an expert consensus on thoracic surgical oncology with recommendations adapted to medical, economic and social realities of Mexico.

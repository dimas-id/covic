Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) effectively replaces the lung in providing oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) removal. For some years, and in parallel to the H1N1 influenza pandemic, this technique has gained interest in relation to significant technological improvements, leading to new concepts of “awake and mobile ECMO” or rehabilitation with ECMO. Finally, the publication of randomized controlled trials giving encouraging results in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has helped to validate this technique and further studies are warranted. This general review aims to outline the definition, classification and principles of ECMO and to give some current information about the indications and possibilities of the technique to the pulmonologist and intensivist. Further possible uses for this technique include extra-corporeal removal of CO(2) during hypercapnic respiratory failure and assistance during lung transplantation from the preoperative to the early postoperative period.

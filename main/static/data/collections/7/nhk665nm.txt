The results of studies of a newly isolated Serratia species K-57 strain are presented. The strain is characterized by antiviral activity towards human influenza A/Aichi/2/68/H3N2, vaccinia, mouse smallpox, and herpes simplex-2 viruses. The detected characteristics of the strain, including the data on activities on nucleolytic enzymes, recommend it for the development of therapeutic and preventive antiviral drugs.

The smartphone as a ubiquitous mobile computer can be regarded as a ‘digital companion’, being with us 24/7 and supporting us in every aspect of modern life. This companionship might lead to a psychological attachment to the device comparable to the attachment to social (human) partners, and ultimately even compulsive usage. Here, a relevant construct is the fear of missing out (short: FoMO) leading to a constant checking of one’s phone. Furthermore, users can develop a fear called ‘nomophobia’ (no-mobile-phone phobia). Despite this fear, resolutions to reduce overuse also known as a ‘digital detox’ is an emerging trend. Our research aims at revealing predictors of nomophobia and the willingness to limit one’s smartphone usage, and which sub-factors of nomophobia are dominating. N = 220 participants filled out an online survey including factors like compulsive usage, FoMO, nomophobia, frequency of smartphone usage and willingness to separate from one’s smartphone. Multiple regression analyses revealed potential predictors for nomophobia and willingness for smartphone separation.

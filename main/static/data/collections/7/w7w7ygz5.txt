Most developing countries with weak economies and low GDPs strive to invest an optimal amount of budget to health sector. Compounding on this state of affairs is their inherent inefficiency to spend even that meager amount on the welfare of the patients, improving service delivery, motivating their workforce and making their health systems responsive to the needs of the people they serve. With weak fiscal base and inelasticity in budget spending, when these countries face a catastrophe like COVID‐19, there is a whole situation of havoc and lack of finances emerges as the biggest issue in such crises. Pakistan has been no exception to this kind of situation. Government funds allocated to other public sector development schemes are diverted to deal with the health emergency. Hence, the result is an overall socioeconomic shock that a country has to face. Amid such crises, other international commitments also face a state of uncertainty. With the changing disease patterns all over the world, the public financial management system for health sector needs to be revisited to devise a more sustainable and resilient mechanism not only to absorb shocks like COVID‐19 but also to meet the international health commitments.

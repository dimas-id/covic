Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a respiratory illness caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Clinical Blood Sciences Laboratory (CBSL) plays a key role in supporting the monitoring and management of patients with COVID-19 disease. Objective To provide a comprehensive CBSL testing protocol to support the medical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Description of the biochemical, haematological and immunological tests that have a role in the assessment and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 infection. Results We provide a test menu for clinical laboratories to ensure the effective monitoring, management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients in hospital. Conclusion Given the rapidity with which patients with COVID-19 disease can deteriorate, we recommend regular testing with vigilance paid to the rate and trajectory of change in each of these parameters.

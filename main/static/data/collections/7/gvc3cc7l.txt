The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a polyhexamethylene biguanide biocide-impregnated gauze (Kerlixâ„¢ AMD gauze dressing, Covidien d/b/a Tyco Healthcare Group LP) as an adjuvant to routine burn care and its impact on the incidence of hospital-associated infections in burn population. One hundred eight burn patients admitted to the Burn Treatment Center were prospectively enrolled from August 2008 to June 2009 and matched 1:2 with historic controls who were admitted from March 2006 to July 2008. Clinical care remained otherwise unchanged; however, several hospital initiatives (the national surgical improvement project, the surgical care improvement project, and a central venous line bundle) were initiated before and during the study. There were significantly less infections in the study population (18.52% of case patients vs 28.70% of control patients had infections, P = .047). Although there was a decrease in each infection subtype analyzed, a statistically significant reduction was only reached for pneumonias (1.85% in cases vs 5.86 in controls, P = .042). Implementation of polyhexamethylene biguanide biocide-impregnated gauze was temporally correlated with a significant decrease in healthcare-associated infections in burn population. As there was no corresponding decrease in wound infections, the impact of the gauze on healthcare-associated infections, if any, cannot be conclusively determined by this study. A larger prospective study powered to detect a decrease in wound-related infections is warranted.

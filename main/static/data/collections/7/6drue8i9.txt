Objectives: To evaluate prevalence of enteric viruses in healthy dogs and to compare it with prevalences in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Methods: Faecal samples were collected from 200 healthy dogs and examined by electron microscopy for presence of viral particles. Data were compared with viral prevalences that had been determined retrospectively by electron microscopy for 936 dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Results: There were significantly more negative faecal samples among the healthy dogs (82·0 per cent) compared with 55·8 per cent in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P<0·001). With a prevalence of 17·5 per cent, significantly more healthy dogs were shedding coronavirus compared with 11·6 per cent in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P=0·034). Parvovirus was only detected in one healthy dog (0·5 per cent), thus with a prevalence that was significantly lower than 16·0 per cent detected in the dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P<0·001). Paramyxovirus was not found in any of the healthy dogs but was found in 9·3 per cent of dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P<0·001). Clinical Significance: Results suggest that shedding of parvovirus and paramyxovirus is strongly associated with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea. However, coronavirus seems to be even more prevalent among healthy dogs, raising the need for further studies to investigate the strain‐associated pathogenicity of this virus.

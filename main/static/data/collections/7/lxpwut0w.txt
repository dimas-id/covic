UNLABELLED The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein forms a helical ribonucleoprotein with the viral positive-strand RNA genome and binds to the principal constituent of the virion envelope, the membrane (M) protein, to facilitate assembly and budding. Besides these structural roles, N protein associates with a component of the replicase-transcriptase complex, nonstructural protein 3, at a critical early stage of infection. N protein has also been proposed to participate in the replication and selective packaging of genomic RNA and the transcription and translation of subgenomic mRNA. Coronavirus N proteins contain two structurally distinct RNA-binding domains, an unusual characteristic among RNA viruses. To probe the functions of these domains in the N protein of the model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we constructed mutants in which each RNA-binding domain was replaced by its counterpart from the N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Mapping of revertants of the resulting chimeric viruses provided evidence for extensive intramolecular interactions between the two RNA-binding domains. Through analysis of viral RNA that was packaged into virions we identified the second of the two RNA-binding domains as a principal determinant of MHV packaging signal recognition. As expected, the interaction of N protein with M protein was not affected in either of the chimeric viruses. Moreover, the SARS-CoV N substitutions did not alter the fidelity of leader-body junction formation during subgenomic mRNA synthesis. These results more clearly delineate the functions of N protein and establish a basis for further exploration of the mechanism of genomic RNA packaging. IMPORTANCE This work describes the interactions of the two RNA-binding domains of the nucleocapsid protein of a model coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus. The main finding is that the second of the two domains plays an essential role in recognizing the RNA structure that allows the selective packaging of genomic RNA into assembled virions.

Background To examine the influence of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings on lung mechanics and oxygenation in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery. Methods One hundred patients aged >65 years were randomly allocated into either the PEEP5 or the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) group (PEEPEIT). Each group underwent volume-controlled ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg predicted body weight) with the PEEP either fixed at 5 cmH2O or set at an individualized EIT setting. The primary endpoint was the ratio of the arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). The secondary endpoints included the driving pressure, and dynamic respiratory system compliance (Cdyn). Other outcomes, such as the mean airway pressure (Pmean), mean arterial pressure (MAP), lung complications and the length of hospital stay were explored. Results The optimal PEEP set by EIT was significantly higher (range from 9-13 cmH2O) than the fixed PEEP. PaO2/FiO2 was 47 mmHg higher (95% CI: 7-86 mmHg; P=0.021), Cdyn was 4.3 mL/cmH2O higher (95% CI: 2.1-6.7 cmH2O; P<0.001), and the driving pressure was 3.7 cmH2O lower (95% CI: 2.2-5.1 mmH2O; P<0.001) at 0.5 h during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group. At 1 h during OLV, PaO2/FiO2 was 93 mmHg higher (95% CI: 58-128 mmHg; P<0.001), Cdyn was 4.4 mL/cmH2O higher (95% CI: 1.9-6.9 mL/cmH2O; P=0.001), and the driving pressure was 4.9 cmH2O lower (95% CI: 3.8-6.1 cmH2O; P<0.001) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group. PaO2/FiO2 was 107 mmHg higher (95% CI: 56-158 mmHg; P<0.001) in the PEEPEIT group than in the PEEP5 group during double-lung ventilation at the end of surgery. Conclusions PEEP values determined with EIT effectively improved oxygenation and lung mechanics during one lung ventilation in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery.

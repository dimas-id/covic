The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe at a rapid rate, affecting large numbers of individuals in different countries with varying health care systems and infrastructure. In the US, New York City has been the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the peak impact in this region has come earlier in this location than most other parts of the country. We report our experience preparing for this pandemic in a New York City academic medical center and its regional health care system, the issues confronted during the rise and peak of the number of cases, and the plans for the post-peak recovery and adjustment to the new reality of providing rehabilitation in an environment where COVID-19 remains prevalent.

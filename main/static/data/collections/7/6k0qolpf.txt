The COVID-19 pandemic is providing us with many painful lessons particularly the vulnerability of individuals living with chronic conditions and the need for preparedness, coordination, and monitoring. Long-term care facilities, including nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, and assisted living facilities, provide care for some of the most vulnerable populations in society, including older people and those with chronic medical conditions. In the United Kingdom, there are about 17,000 people living in nursing and residential care homes and 200,000 Australians live or stay in residential aged care on any given day.

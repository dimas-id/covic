To analyze the pathogenesis of the neurotropic murine coronavirus JHMV, we used monoclonal antibodies to the E2 viral glycoprotein to select antigenic variant viruses. Monoclonal antibodies J.7.2 and J.2.2 were shown to bind to topographically distinct regions of the E2 molecule, and the variants selected with the two antibodies demonstrated very different disease pictures in mice. Variants selected with J.7.2 were, like the parental virus, highly virulent and caused an acute encephalitic illness. By contrast, J.2.2-selected variants predominantly caused a subacute paralytic disease clinically and extensive demyelination histologically. Antigenic differences among the variants and parental virus were readily demonstrable with anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies. However, no differences between the viruses could be shown in binding studies with monoclonal antibodies directed against either E1 or N, the other two JHMV structural proteins. Since only J.2.2 selected demyelinating variants with reduced neurovirulence, it is likely that this monoclonal antibody recognizes a subregion of the E2 molecule that is particularly important in JHMV pathogenesis.

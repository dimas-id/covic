In Spain, with full confinement measures and coinciding with the pandemic, pediatricians and dermatologists have received, through teledermatology/teleconsultation and social networks, a barrage of diverse images, which have subsequently allowed us to approach some of them by direct physical examination of early and late skin manifestations associated with SARS-Cov-2 infection. We designed a retrospective, cross-sectional study to evaluate the dermatological care of all those patients under the age of 16 who consulted, in person or telematically, for acral lesions (chilblain-like or erythema multiforme-like) in the context of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, since 15 March 2020 to 24 April 2020, both included in the health area of the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio de Granada. Of all the patients collected, 18 (66%) were male and the overall mean age was 14.44 years. All lacked a personal history of interest and denied previous episodes of chilblains or Raynaud's phenomenon/disease. The clinic was limited to purpuric lesions located on acral regions distributed on hands and feet. Dermatologists and pediatricians should be aware of the lesions associated with COVID-19 infection and their possible complications. It remains to be identified if there are different dermatological patterns in the pediatric and adult population.

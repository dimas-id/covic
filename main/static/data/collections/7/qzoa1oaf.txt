INTRODUCTION Conventional cerebral angiography is a commonly performed procedure in medicine. Vascular closure devices have been developed as alternatives to manual compression at the arteriotomy site and prolonged bed rest. The risks of using these devices include arterial dissection, groin hematoma, and device failure. Herein, we describe our experience with the use of a novel device used for arterial access and closure, the AXERA 2 Access System. METHODS A total of 13 patients underwent vascular access and closure with the AXERA 2 Access System. RESULTS Arterial access using the AXERA 2 Access System was achieved in 11 of 13 patients. Amongst the patients with successful access, one patient experienced a groin hematoma requiring manual compression and two patients suffered occlusions of the common femoral artery due to dissections, with both patients requiring femoral artery thromboendarterectomies. CONCLUSIONS This small series highlights a heretofore underreported serious complication rate of the AXERA 2 Access System. Additional studies are warranted to provide further insight into risk factors for device failure and complication development.

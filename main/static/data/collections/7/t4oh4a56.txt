Few studies have examined the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in large tertiary centres over more than one season in the era of molecular diagnosis. Respiratory clinical specimens received between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 were analysed. Respiratory virus testing was performed using a large panel of real-time PCR or RT-PCR. Results were analysed according to sample type (upper versus lower respiratory tract) and age group. In all, 2996 (2469 (82.4%) upper; 527 (17.6%) lower) specimens were analysed. Overall positivity rate was 47.4% and 23.7% for upper and lower respiratory samples, respectively. The highest positivity rate was observed in patients under 18 years old (p <0.001); picornaviruses were the most frequent viruses detected over the year. Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses showed a seasonal peak during the winter season, while picornaviruses and adenoviruses were less frequently detected in these periods. Multiple viral infections were identified in 12% of positive cases and were significantly more frequent in children (p <0.001). In conclusion, we observed significant differences in viral infection rates and virus types among age groups, clinical sample types and seasons. Follow-up of viral detection over several seasons allows a better understanding of respiratory viral epidemiology.

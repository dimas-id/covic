Depression and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis are common diseases. The aim of this study was to determine whether the frequency of depression is elevated in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and normal thyroid function. A total of 201 subjects were included, of whom 107 and 94 participants were healthy or had euthyroid chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, respectively. Serum thyroid hormone levels and thyroid auto-antibodies were measured in all subjects. All participants were evaluated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). HDRS scores of patients with euthyroid chronic autoimmune thyroiditis were higher than in healthy participants. This study suggests a possible association between depression and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. The depression risk may be increased in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and normal thyroid function.

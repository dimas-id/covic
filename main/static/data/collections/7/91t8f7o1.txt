IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) plays important roles in host defense against viral infection as revealed by studies in humans and mice. However, little is known on porcine IFIT2 (pIFIT2). Here, we performed molecular cloning, expression profile, and transcriptional regulation analysis of pIFIT2. pIFIT2 gene, located on chromosome 14, is composed of two exons and have a complete coding sequence of 1407 bp. The encoded polypeptide, 468 aa in length, has three tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. pIFIT2 gene was unevenly distributed in all eleven tissues studied with the most abundance in spleen. Poly(I:C) treatment notably strongly upregulated the mRNA level and promoter activity of pIFIT2 gene. Upstream sequence of 1759 bp from the start codon which was assigned +1 here has promoter activity, and deltaEF1 acts as transcription repressor through binding to sequences at position − 1774 to − 1764. Minimal promoter region exists within nucleotide position − 162 and − 126. Two adjacent interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and two nuclear factor (NF)-κB binding sites were identified within position − 310 and − 126. The ISRE elements act alone and in synergy with the one closer to start codon having more strength, so do the NF-κB binding sites. Synergistic effect was also found between the ISRE and NF-κB binding sites. Additionally, a third ISRE element was identified within position − 1661 to − 1579. These findings will contribute to clarifying the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of pIFIT2.

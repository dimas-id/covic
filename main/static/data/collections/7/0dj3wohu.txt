The mechanistic understanding of signaling pathways that contributes to the kidney involvement by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an extremely critical point for improving therapeutic options. These pathways consist of the production of pro-inflammatory factors, the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells into the renal interstitium, the activation of C5b-9 complexes, and receptorangiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Cytopathogenic effects and invasion into renal tubular cells have been confirmed.

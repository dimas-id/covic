The proprotein convertases (PCs) are responsible for the endoproteolytic processing of various protein precursors (e.g., growth factors, receptors, adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteinases) implicated in several diseases such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. The potential clinical and pharmacological role of the PCs has fostered the development of various PC‐inhibitors. In this review we summarized the recent findings on PCs inhibitors, their mode of actions and potential use in the therapy of various diseases. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

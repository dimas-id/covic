We describe 3 cases of acute gastroenteritis in healthy infants after vaccination with RotaTeq, shedding a G1P[8] human-bovine double reassortant rotavirus in stools. Such a double reassortant virus appears stable in vitro and may explain diarrheal symptoms in a small percentage of RotaTeq recipients, and might also be transmitted to contacts in the environment.

BACKGROUND This study aims to compare post-operative pain, well-being, body image and cosmesis in SILS cholecystectomy and four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (FPLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-two consecutive patients (15 SILS, 27 FPLC) undergoing elective cholecystectomy were included in the study. Peri-operative pain, well-being, body image and cosmesis were evaluated using validated assessment tools. RESULTS Significantly lower pain scores were reported one week post-operatively in the SILS group (5.6 vs 8.3; p = 0.035). No significant difference was found in analgesic requirements, physical or mental well-being at any time interval. Significantly higher (favourable) body image questionnaire scores were reported in the SILS group at one week (5.4 v 4.5; p < 0.01), two weeks (5.6 vs 4.8; p < 0.01) and one month (5.7 vs 5.0; p < 0.01) post-operatively. CONCLUSION SILS patients have significantly reduced one-week pain scores and there was no significant difference in well-being between the two groups. Patients who underwent SILS had improved body image and cosmesis. If both techniques are found to be equivalent concerning safety, cost, learning curve and availability, SILS may play a key role in the new era of patient choice.

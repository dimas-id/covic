Kernel self-organizing map has been recently studied by Fyfe and his colleagues [1]. This paper investigates the use of a novel bio-kernel function for the kernel self-organizing map. For verification, the application of the proposed new kernel self-organizing map to HIV drug resistance classification using mutation patterns in protease sequences is presented. The original self-organizing map together with the distributed encoding method was compared. It has been found that the use of the kernel self-organizing map with the novel bio-kernel function leads to better classification and faster convergence rate ...

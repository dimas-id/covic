A herd of pigs infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was used in a double-blind randomised trial to assess the effectiveness of three control strategies against chronic respiratory disease in growing-finishing pigs. One group of 61 pigs received 220 ppm lincomycin hydrochloride in the feed from day 71 to day 91, a second group was vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae at four and 28 days of age, and a third group received both treatments; a fourth group was left untreated as a control. Throughout the nursery-finishing period (day 29 to slaughter) the average daily weight gain and feed conversion rate of all the treated groups were slightly better than in the controls, but there were no significant differences between them. There were no significant differences between the treated groups in terms of clinical signs, serology, pathology or mortality, which was very low throughout the trial.

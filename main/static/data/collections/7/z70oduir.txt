Nasal plugs were made from an N-95 respirator, surgical mask or a cotton ball and inserted into the nares of volunteer healthcare workers for 30 min. Initial and persistent respiratory resistance, choking sensation, and discomfort in the mouth and nose areas were recorded for the three different nasal plugs, the N-95 respirator and a surgical mask. Nasal plugs were more convenient and better tolerated than the masks. The ability of the nasal plug material to prevent infection by droplet transmission was also tested. A piece of each material was placed on a blood agar plate, the volunteer coughed onto the plate and the material was removed. Bacterial colonies only grew in the areas not previously covered by the nasal plug material. The cotton ball nasal plug is probably as effective as the N-95 respirator or surgical masks at preventing infection, and is much cheaper.

In an earlier article, Gordon Drummond summarized ongoing changes in how statistics are being used in experimental physiology (Drummond, 2020). He described the near ubiquitous use of the P value, cautioning against declaring an analysis “statistically significant”. He mentioned alternative approaches including Bayesian and likelihood approaches. This article focusses on the latter approach although we will first have another look at that P value. Then the likelihood approach will be introduced with a very artificial example that allows us to easily grasp the concept. A more realistic example is then described with associated calculations. A further example using real categorical data is explained, and how it relates to and is superior to the oft used χ(2) test. A final discussion reveals that the likelihood approach, although mathematically and statistically accurate, is poorly supported by literature and training. This article is protected by copyright.

A new family of IFNs called type III IFN or IFN-λ has been described, and shown to induce antiviral activity against several viruses in the cell culture. In this study, the molecular cloning, expression, and antiporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) activity of porcine IFN-λ3 (poIFN-λ3) were reported. The full-length poIFN-λ3 cDNA sequence encoded 196 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence alignments showed that poIFN-λ3 had an amino acid sequence similarity to Ovis aries (78.1 %), Bos taurus (76.0 %), Tupaia belangeri (71.3 %), Equus caballus (69.9 %), and Homo sapiens (69.9 %). The phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequences indicated that poIFN-λ3 is located in the same branch as B. taurus and O. aries IFN-λ3. The poIFN-λ3 without a signal anchor sequence was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant poIFN-λ3 exhibited significant antiviral effects against PEDV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of poIFN-λ3 on PEDV was observed under three different treatment conditions. The highest inhibition of PEDV was observed in Vero E6 cell cultures pretreated with poIFN-λ3 (prior to PEDV infection). In addition, poIFN-λ3 was able to induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1 in Vero E6 cells. These data demonstrate that poIFN-λ3 has antiviral activity against PEDV and may serve as a useful biotherapeutic candidate to inhibit PEDV or other viruses in swine.

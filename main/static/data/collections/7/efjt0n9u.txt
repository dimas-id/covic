The onset of a pulmonary infiltrate in a solid organ transplant (SOT) recipient is both a challenging diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We outline the potential aetiologies of a pulmonary infiltrate in a SOT recipient, with particular attention paid to fungal pathogens. A diagnostic and empirical therapy approach to a pulmonary infiltrate, especially invasive fungal disease (IFD) in SOT recipients, is provided.

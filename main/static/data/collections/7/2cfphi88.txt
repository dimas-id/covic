We report here the cloning and 3′ sequence determination of feline calicivirus strain F9. Subcloning the 3′ terminus enabled the production of strand specific probes for RNA synthesis. We extend the number of virus specific RNAs detected intracellularly to 8, and show that numbers 1–5 are represented as negative strands which may serve as templates in the synthesis of these RNAs.

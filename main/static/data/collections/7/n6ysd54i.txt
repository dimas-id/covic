PURPOSE We report our experience of minimally invasive partial nephrectomy without ischemia using a microwave tissue coagulator (MTC) for hand-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (HALPN), conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (CLPN), and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for partial nephrectomy (LESSPN). We retrospectively compared the results of these techniques to better define the individual role and the benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS From July 2005 to September 2012, 28 patients with small and exophytic renal tumors underwent HALPN (n = 12), CLPN (n = 10) and LESSPN (n = 6). In these procedures, the surgeon used an MTC for circumferential coagulation around the tumor. After coagulation, the tumor was resected without renal pedicle clamping. RESULTS The mean operative time was 259, 194 and 174 min for the HALPN, CLPN and LESSPN groups respectively. Two patients (one in HALPN group and one in LESSPN group) converted to laparotomy due to an inability to maintain hemostasis; however, there were no conversions to ischemic partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy. No differences between HALPN, CLPN and LESSPN were noted in terms of estimated blood loss, measured analgesic requirements, outcomes, or complications. CONCLUSION We believe that these techniques are feasible and that they minimize the risk of unexpected collateral thermal damage by appropriate MTC needle puncture. When deciding to use HALPN, CLPN or LESSPN, our findings suggest that the choice of surgical approach should depend on the patient's individual circumstance.

BACKGROUND Complications after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery may be related to the type of surgical technique employed. One technique, the placement of a Roux limb stabilization suture, presumably prevents kink at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. However, it can have an adverse effect and we studied a series of cases presenting with intestinal obstruction secondary to this stitch. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass cases who had reoperations for Roux limb volvulus was performed at a single bariatric center by a single surgeon. RESULTS Out of 199 patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass with placement of Roux limb stabilization suture, 4 patients (2.01%) presented with Roux limb volvulus postoperatively. BMI was 45.35 ± 2.95. The postoperative time to presentation was 11 ± 10.6 months. All four patients required surgical exploration to reduce the volvulus. In all cases, the Roux limb volvulus was directly attributable to the presence of the stabilization suture. In subsequent 250 cases where this suture was eliminated, there was no volvulus of Roux limb seen. CONCLUSIONS The use of a stabilization suture can result in volvulus of the Roux limb causing intestinal obstruction and this complication can be prevented by avoiding this suture.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to major organisational changes in health care settings, especially in psychiatric hospitals. We conducted a national online survey to assess the evolution of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the different centres practicing this treatment. 65 responses from all over France were analysed. More than 90 % of the centres practising ECT experienced a decrease in their activity. Half of the centres experienced a total cessation of activity and 25 % of the centres experienced a decrease of more than half of their usual activity. Post-pandemic COVID-19 psychiatric care is expected to be difficult. It is essential not to add to this difficulty the complications, often serious, that will be associated with delaying or stopping the practice of ECT. It will also be necessary to remain vigilant with regard to the specific neuropsychiatric consequences that will follow the pandemic.

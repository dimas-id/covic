Abstract Acyclic 2′-azanucleosides with a phosphonomethoxy function in the side chain were obtained by coupling of diethyl {2-[N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)-N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)amino]ethoxymethyl}phosphonate with the pyrimidine nucleobases via the Vorbrüggen-type protocol. The compounds were evaluated in vitro for activity against a broad variety of RNA and DNA viruses.

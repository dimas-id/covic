Abstract Recently, RNA viral infections caused by respiratory viruses, such as influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Zika virus, are a major public health threats in the world. Although myriads of diagnostic methods based on RNA amplification have been developed in the last decades, they continue to lack speed, sensitivity, and specificity for clinical use. A rapid and accurate diagnostic method is needed for appropriate control, including isolation and treatment of the patients. Here, we report an isothermal, label-free, one-step RNA amplification and detection system, termed as iROAD, for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. It couples a one-step isothermal RNA amplification method and a bio-optical sensor for simultaneous viral RNA amplification/detection in a label-free and real-time manner. The iROAD assay offers a one-step viral RNA amplification/detection example to rapid analysis (<20min). The detection limit of iROAD assay was found to be 10-times more sensitive than that of real-time reverse transcription-PCR method. We confirmed the clinical utility of the iROAD assay by detecting viral RNAs obtained from 63 human respiratory samples. We envision that the iROAD assay will be useful and potentially adaptable for better diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases including respiratory diseases.

Loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. Such wounds then become chronically infected. Topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Next Science wound gel technology (NxtSc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. In vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that NxtSc inhibited biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. The gel formulation NxtSc-G5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 CFU/disc or CFU/g. In vivo, NxtSc-G5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. Storage of NxtSc-G5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. These results establish that NxtSc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. This novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.

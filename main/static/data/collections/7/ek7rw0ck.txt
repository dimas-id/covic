Endoscopic bariatric and metabolic therapies (EBMT) are a new addition to the treatment arsenal for obesity. These include devices that are placed or removed via flexible endoscopy, and procedures that utilize instruments that require flexible endoscopy for the indications of weight loss or treatment of glucose intolerance (from pre-diabetes to diabetes). The EBMTs are generally divided into gastric and small bowel categories, and although individual EBMTs may have unique mechanisms of action, similar themes in proposed mechanism of action are seen in the gastric and small bowel EBMTs, respectively. In this review we will describe the therapies approved for use in the United States or currently in the process of obtaining approval for use in the United States. We will discuss potential mechanisms of action and examine safety and efficacy data.

In this paper, an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) finite element method in the monolithic approach is developed for a multi-domain blood flow–aortic wall interaction problem with multiple moving interfaces. An advanced fully discrete ALE-mixed finite element approximation is defined to solve the present fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problem in the cardiovascular environment, in which two fields of structures are involved with two fields of fluid flow, inducing three moving interfaces in between for the interactions. Numerical experiments are carried out for a realistic cardiovascular problem with the implantation of vascular stent graft to demonstrate the strength of our developed ALE-mixed finite element method.

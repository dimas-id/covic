PURPOSE To assess the feasibility, safety and clinical outcomes of image-guided percutaneous thermal ablation as salvage therapy for local recurrence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients initially treated surgically with curative intent. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of 11 consecutive patients (M/F = 8:3, mean age = 76 years) who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation for locally recurrent RCC after partial (72%, 8/11) or radical nephrectomy (28%, 3/11) with a mean time to recurrence of 48 months (range 2-156). Assessment of technical success, complication (peri- and post-procedural), oncological outcome and survival analysis were performed. Patient baseline and follow-up renal function surrogates including creatinine level (Cr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were statistically compared. RESULTS Eleven biopsy-proven recurrent RCC measuring 1.4-3.9 cm (mean = 2.8 cm) were treated with CT-guided thermal ablation. Technical success was achieved in 100% (11/11) of the cases. There were no major complications except for one (9%) asymptomatic hemorrhage (Clavien-Dindo grade I complication). Complete response, local progression-free and overall survival rate were 91, 91 and 82% during the mean follow-up time of 2.5 years (range 0.1-7.1). Renal function was overall stable without significant change at 1 month and last follow-up (p = 0.21; GFR, p = 0.10; creatinine). CONCLUSIONS Image-guided percutaneous thermal ablation is a feasible, safe and effective for local recurrence after nephrectomy, representing a non-surgical alternative for unresectable disease.

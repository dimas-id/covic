The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a significant risk to patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) or cellular therapy. The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical HCT or cellular therapy pharmacy services using telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient settings to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice while minimizing viral spread in a high-risk, immunocompromised population. In addition, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy recipients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 expand, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT recipients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc-prolonging agents. Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already caused stress on the usual supply chain. Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways, and specific patient population stock may be necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all members of the healthcare team, and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations while also remaining committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients undergoing HCT and cellular therapies.

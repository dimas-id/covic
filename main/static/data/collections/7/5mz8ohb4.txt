Abstract Our world is faced with a global pandemic that threatens to overwhelm many national health care systems for a prolonged period. Consequently, the elective long-term CIED management of millions of patients is potentially compromised raising the likelihood of patients experiencing major adverse events due to loss of CIED therapy. This review gives practical guidance to health care providers to help promptly recognize the requirement for expert consultation for urgent interrogation and/or surgery in CIED patients.

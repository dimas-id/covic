We read with great interest the report by Qiu and colleages reporting the first case of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on elevated transaminases, jaundice, and coagulopathy, the authors discuss hepatic virus entry and systemic inflammation as possible underlying mechanisms. As ACLF following hepatic versus extrahepatic insults may differ in presentation, course, and prognosis, we herein report the case of a patient with ACLF precipitated by extrahepatic complications of SARS-CoV-2.

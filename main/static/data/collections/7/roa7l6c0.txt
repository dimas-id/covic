The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; formally known as 2019-nCoV) has become a most challenging health emergency. Owing to rigorous quarantine and control measures taken in China, routine neonatal health surveillance and follow-up have become challenging. Without follow-up surveillance, some rapid and progressive newborn diseases, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, may be ignored. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, we developed an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of bilirubin level of newborns that is based on our practical experiences. The aim is to make our management strategies of neonatal jaundice tailored to the infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 epidemic.

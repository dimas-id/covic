Abstract Background Visceral leishmaniasis-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (VL-HLH) is a secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, which can be life-threatening, caused by leishmania and transmitted by infected sandflies. Rapid and accurate identification of leishmania is crucial for clinical strategies. Case report Here, we report an infantile infection in a non-epidemic area of China. The infant was a 9.5-month-old girl with fever, pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly, which meet the HLH-2004 standard, and the negative gene results exclude congenital HLH. However, chemotherapy is ineffective and is accompanied by severe infection. Fortunately, she is diagnosed with VL-HLH (visceral leishmaniasis-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), as leishmania is detected by next-generation meta-genome sequencing (mNGS) and quickly relieved after treatment with libosomal amphotericin B (L-AMB). Conclusion mNGS can detect leishmania in pediatric HLH, and should be performed as a new detection for VL-HLH, particularly for infants, who may not respond to HLH-2004 regimen.

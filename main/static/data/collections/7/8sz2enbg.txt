OBJECTIVE The Outreach distal access catheter (DAC; Concentric Medical, Mountain View, California, USA) has been designed to assist the Merci device (Concentric Medical) with clot retrieval in the setting of acute stroke. Its application for coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms was investigated. METHODS Between December 2008 and January 2010, 150 aneurysms were treated with endovascular methods. In 18 cases of small aneurysms and/or increased parent vessel tortuosity, the DAC was used for additional support. Merits and complications related to the use of this catheter are reviewed. RESULTS The mean aneurysm size was 7.1 mm (range 3.5-25). In each case, the DAC was used as an intracranial platform catheter in close proximity to the target aneurysm. This catheter (outer diameter 3.9 or 4.3 French) increased the stability and reduced the redundancy of the microcatheter. As a result, handling and control of the microcatheter were improved. In three cases, the coiling procedure could not be completed because of difficulties not related to the DAC. Aneurysms in the remaining patients were treated successfully with complete (n=12) or near complete (n=3) angiographic occlusion. CONCLUSION For smaller or distal intracranial aneurysms with difficult access, use of the DAC as an additional platform in close proximity to the target aneurysm subjectively enhanced microcatheter control and safety.

AIMS This study represents the first report on the distribution of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype among recurrent tonsillitis patients. We recruited 34 Lebanese pediatric patients diagnosed with recurrent tonsillitis and had their DNA typed using sequence-specific primer technique for the presence of 16 KIR loci. RESULTS We observed that 25 different KIR genotypes were present similar to the general control population with the same KIR gene content. There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of the activating and inhibitory KIR genes between the two categories. Like in the general control population, we noted a predominance of the AB genotype; however, the KIR genotypic distribution among the tonsillitis patients was much more heterogeneous with even new genotypes not reported in the control group. CONCLUSIONS Although the sample size is small, this first study observes an interesting heterogeneous KIR gene profile in recurrent tonsillitis that warrants larger and further research in the area for the true biological and clinical significance of this observation.

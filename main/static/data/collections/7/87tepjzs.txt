Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with immunocompromise have a high risk of developing complications related to viral infections. Western countries were the first to formulate vaccine guideline. Asian countries developed their national and international vaccine guidelines a little later in order to reduce the risk of mortality from viral infections. However, no studies to date have examined the differences in vaccinations that prevail among Asian countries. Summary This review summarizes the vaccination status and schedules in various Asian countries for immunocompromised IBD patients. Vaccination rates, regardless of the specific vaccine, were high in Japan, South Korea, and China and low in India and the Philippines. Vaccine schedules differed by country, and outbreaks of measles and rubella were seen due to low vaccination rates in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Live vaccines cannot be administered during immunosuppressive treatment. Infection with measles, mumps, and varicella during immunosuppressive therapy carries a high risk of mortality, and thus confirmation of immunization status is recommended as soon as IBD is diagnosed and, when possible, live vaccines should be administered before the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment. In patients seronegative for hepatitis B, administration of the hepatitis B vaccine is also recommended. Key Messages Physicians, while considering severity of outbreaks, should understand the differences in vaccination status that exist among the various Asian countries and regions.

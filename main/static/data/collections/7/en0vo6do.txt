An SIS model is analyzed to consider the contribution of community structure to the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease. We focus on the human day-to-day activity introduced by commuting to a central place for the social activity. We assume that the community is classified into two subpopulations: commuter and non-commuter, of which the commuter has two phases of the day-to-day activity: private and social. Further we take account of the combination of contact patterns in two phases, making use of mass-action and ratio-dependent types for the infection force. We investigate the dependence of the basic reproduction number on the commuter ratio and the daily expected duration at the social phase as essential factors characterizing the community structure, and show that the dependence is significantly affected by the combination of contact patterns, and that the difference in the commuter ratio could make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease significantly different.

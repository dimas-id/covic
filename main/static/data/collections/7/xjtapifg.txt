In a cross-sectional study of 140 homosexual men attending a sexually transmissible diseases clinic, the association between the presence of antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the presence of proctitis, as determined by histologic examination, as well as past or present exposure to other pathogens and details of sexual practices was analyzed. Significant associations with HIV seropositivity were found with the number of lifetime partners, positive treponemal serology, and evidence of previous infection with herpes simplex virus. However the major and unique finding was the strong and independent association between proctitis diagnosed by histologic criteria and seropositivity for HIV. Whether this is cause or effect awaits further elucidation.

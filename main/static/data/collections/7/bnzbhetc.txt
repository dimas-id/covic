This article gives key reasons for the UK's tardy and confused attempts to react to the COVID‐19 pandemic. It explains very poor outcomes in the UK (in terms of the spread of the virus and high mortality, already striking at the time of writing), in terms of an initial lack of political will to prioritise public health, itself a product of a strong Prime Minister who made the “wrong call”. It also highlights a failure to “follow the science”, except in so far as the “science” had already accepted some dubious political judgements and the lack of capacity to test as the starting‐point.

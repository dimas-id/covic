A 75-year-old hemodialysis patient with right critical limb ischemia received endovascular therapy for a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in a diffusely calcified superficial femoral artery (SFA). During a retrograde approach, a Brockenbrough needle (BN) was able to penetrate the calcified hard plaque formed in the middle segment of the CTO. Moreover, bougie dilatation with the BN allowed balloon crossing and stent deployment, even after failure to pass a 2.0-mm monorail balloon across the plaque. These results suggest that the BN offers a new therapeutic option in the penetration and modification of severely calcified CTO in SFA.

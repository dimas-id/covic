The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been of concern to health care workers (HCW's) in the emergency department (ED) due to potential exposure and transmission. This case report describes a man who was referred to the ED for abdominal and testicular pain who was subsequently found to test positive for COVID-19. Due to the lack of respiratory symptoms, proper protective equipment (PPE) was not donned, and it led to several patients and health care workers being exposed. Given recent new descriptions of patients who present atypically, full PPE for all patients may be considered as community spread increases.

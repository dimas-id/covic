Swine beta interferon (swIFN-beta) produced in HEK 293 cells infected with a recombinant, replication-defective human adenovirus 5 (Ad5) encoding the swIFN-beta gene was tested for antiviral activity against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). MARC-145 cells were incubated overnight with dilutions of supernatant fluids from HEK 293 cells infected with Ad5-swIFN-beta or with an Ad5 control virus (Ad5-Blue). Treated cells were infected with PRRSV; MARC-145 cells incubated with Ad5-Blue supernatants developed cytopathic effects (CPE), whereas those incubated with swIFN-beta showed no CPE. To confirm the antiviral activity of swIFN-beta, culture fluids from Ad5-swIFN-beta-infected cells were affinity-purified on a Sepharose-anti-swIFN-beta matrix, and the resulting fractions exhibited antiviral activity upon infection with PRRSV. The antiviral effects were specific, as they were blocked by mAbs against swIFN-beta. Additional cultures of MARC-145 cells treated with swIFN-beta-containing supernatants or affinity-purified swIFN-beta were infected with PRRSV and tested by real-time RT-PCR for viral RNA in culture supernatants at various times post-inoculation. These experiments confirmed the protective effects of swIFN-beta. swIFN-beta was also tested for antiviral activity on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from PRRSV-negative swine. PAMs were treated with dilutions of swIFN-beta or Ad5-Blue culture fluids, infected with PRRSV and tested for viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR. The viral load data showed a dose-dependent protection in swIFN-beta-treated PAMs, whereas no protection was evident from Ad5-Blue culture fluids. The data demonstrate that swIFN-beta protects both MARC-145 cells and PAMs from PRRSV infection.

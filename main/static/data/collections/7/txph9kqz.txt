OBJECTIVES: To study the rational use of the blood components in pediatric and neonatal wards. METHODS: It was a retrospective study conducted by department of pediatrics of a tertiary care centre in western part of India. The patients were included from the pediatric ward, pediatric surgery ward, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a period of three months. All the patients below 12 y of age receiving blood components, admitted in general pediatric wards, pediatric intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric surgery ward were included in the study. Each transfusion episode was assessed as per predetermined guidelines. RESULTS: Of the total 336 episodes of blood component transfusions, 244 episodes were appropriate and 92 episodes were inappropriate. Among these, platelets had highest inappropriate (36.84%) episodes followed by fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (28.95%) and packed red blood cell transfusions (PRBC) (21.21%). Majority inappropriate transfusions were seen in intensive care settings. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third of blood component transfusions (FFP, platelets and PRBC) were given without any definitive indication. Judicious use of various blood products by following recommended guidelines may help in decreasing the inappropriate use of blood components.

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated increased use of telemedicine for diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal disorders. We describe the initial virtual/telemedicine encounter and management of a patient with knee pain initially diagnosed as gonarthrosis but that actually resulted from an impending pathologic fracture of the femur. Definitive diagnosis and treatment occurred only after completion of the impending fracture. The multiple factors making telemedicine encounters challenging which contributed to this outcome are highlighted. Orthopedists need awareness of these challenges and must take steps to mitigate the risk of complications possible with continued increased utilization of telemedicine during this pandemic and beyond.

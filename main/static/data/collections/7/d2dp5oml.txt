OBJECTIVE The purpose of the study was to report the outcomes of our modified techniques of laparoscopic urachal resection, followed by novel umbilical-plasty using dermal regenerative grafts for symptomatic urachal remnants. METHODS Between March 2014 and December 2016, laparoscopic urachal resection was carried out on 45 patients with complaints of urachal remnants. After extraction of the specimen and closure of the fascia at the umbilical site, a 1-cm square section of dermal regeneration sheet (TERUDERMISÂ®, Olympus) was suture retained between the fascia and the skin. Patient satisfaction with cosmesis was scored prospectively using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Perioperative records were reviewed to assess surgical outcomes. RESULTS Laparoscopic urachal resection was successfully conducted via the transperitoneal approach. Postoperative bleeding was experienced in one patient (2.2%), which was subsequently controlled laparoscopically. Infection subsided with symptomatic relief in all patients. No symptomatic recurrences were encountered. Over 80% of patients (37/45) rated the cosmetic outcome of the plasty as good to excellent, with the median scores of 8 (range 5-10). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic urachal resection is safe and curative with reasonable risk of complications. Novel umbilicoplasty using dermal regenerative graft is very simple technique and offers satisfactory cosmetic outcomes. Further follow-up and cosmesis evaluation are required.

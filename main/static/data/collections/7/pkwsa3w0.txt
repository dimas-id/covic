An overview of the incidence of health care-associated infection (HAIs) is presented. It is shown that most often medical workers are infected with infections transmitted through the blood and other biomaterials of patients, such as viral hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV), HIV infection. The significant frequency of occupational injuries among medical workers is emphasized. It is established that at the present stage, relatively new infections require some attention, which can lead to infection of medical workers in the course of their professional activities. These infections include atypical pneumonia (TOPC or SARS-severe acute respiratory syndrome), middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (BRVS-Cov), African hemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Ebola, Lassa), Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCGL), and others. All these infections are quite severe, with a large number of deaths. Special attention is paid to the polyethyleneological nature of HAIs, which determines the need for a multi-modal approach to organizing preventive measures to protect medical workers from infection.

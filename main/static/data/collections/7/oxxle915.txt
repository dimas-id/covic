BACKGROUND: There is limited data regarding the electrophysiological abnormalities and arrhythmias in children with COVID-19, including those associated with treatment using potentially pro-arrhythmic Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZN). OBJECTIVES: To describe the electrophysiologic findings and arrhythmias associated with pediatric COVID-19 and its treatment. METHODS: A single center retrospective chart review was undertaken and included all patients with 1) symptoms of COVID-19, and 2) PCR (+) nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 who were placed on continuous telemetry for the duration of their hospitalization during March through May, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the study. Significant arrhythmias were found in 6 (non-sustained (ns) ventricular tachycardia in 5 and sustained atrial tachycardia in 1). All were self-resolving and half prompted prophylactic anti-arrhythmic therapy. Patients with significant arrhythmias were likely to have non-cardiac co-morbidities (4/6), but these were not more common than in patients without arrhythmias (20/30, p=1). The use of HCQ with or without AZN was associated with statistically significant QTc prolongation (411+19 msec vs 426+15 msec, p<0.0001). QTc was not statistically different in patients with and without arrhythmias (425+15 msec vs 425+15 msec, p=1). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with PCR positive active COVID-19 infection, significant arrhythmias are infrequent, but more common than expected in a general pediatric population. Comorbidities are not more common in patients with arrhythmias than in patients without arrhythmias. COVID-19 treatment using HCQ is associated with QTc prolongation, but was not associated with arrhythmias in pediatric patients.

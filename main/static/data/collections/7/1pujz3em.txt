In recent commentaries from Lancet Rheumatology and The Journal of Rhuematology (1-2) the authors eloquently illustrated the connection between COVID-19 infection, the subsequent cytokine storm (CS) that ensues in a number of patients and the potential efficacy of biologics that Rheumatologists routinely use in their practices. Moreover those biologics were originally investigated by Rheumatologists for the treatment of numerous rheumatic conditions, including macrophage activating syndrome (MAS), a similar form of storm that resembles the one occurring in COVID-19 patients (3).

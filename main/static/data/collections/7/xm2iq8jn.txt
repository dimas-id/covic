Management options for men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia have increased in recent years. Surgery is recommended for patients who have renal insufficiency secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), who have recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder stones or gross hematuria caused by BPH, and those who have lower urinary tract symptoms refractory to other therapies. Technology is improving, and the use of endoscopic techniques with lasers has gained popularity. The use of robotics overcomes the limitations of pure laparoscopy. Robotic assistance helps in quicker skills acquisition. This article describes techniques for robotic-assisted laparoscopic simple anatomic prostatectomy in a step-by-step manner.

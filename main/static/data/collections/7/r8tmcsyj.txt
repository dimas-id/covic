Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVIâ€™s) are the most common infectious disease in humans. With the appearance of molecular techniques the recovery of viruses has dramatically increased. Nowadays virologists can quickly discriminate virological families and related viruses from emerging viruses and consequently identify novel viruses. Many new respiratory viruses have been identified in children in the past 15 years. In this review we shortly discuss novel respiratory viruses and their pathogenic role in pediatric respiratory disease. Advantages and drawbacks of the technique and our current knowledge will be discussed. We will conclude this review with a general discussion on the future role of molecular diagnostic virology in the clinic.

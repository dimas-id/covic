ABSTRACT: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the leading causes of death in neonatal intensive care units. The underlying pathophysiology of NEC is poorly defined, although there is a suggestion that bacterial agents play an important role in the process. In this study, we evaluated bacterial isolates from 17 NEC cases and matched asymptomatic control infants. Isolates from NEC patients were no more likely than control isolates to be adherent to enterocytes, as assessed by a Caco-2 cell tissue culture model. Adherent Escherichia coli isolates, from both NEC cases and controls, were able to cause pathologic changes typical of NEC in a weanling rabbit ileal loop model. Adherence of E. coli strains to Caco-2 cells, and subsequent production of disease in weanling rabbits, could be blocked by coinfection with Gram-positive isolates from control children. In contrast, in three of four instances, adherent E. coli from NEC cases retained their adherence and caused illness in rabbits when coinfected with Gram-positive isolates from the homologous child. Our data suggest that patterns of intestinal adherence, as influenced by the underlying intestinal microbial ecology, play a role in the pathophysiology of NEC.

Cytokine storm in COVID-19 is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 that is caused by a dysregulated immune system of the host. We are proposing a new hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation of nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) may be responsible for the cytokine storm in COVID 19. The inflamed NTS may result in a dysregulated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

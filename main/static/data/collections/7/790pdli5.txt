BACKGROUND AND AIMS Although conventional laparoscopic surgery is less traumatic than open surgery, it does cause tissue trauma and multiple scar formation. The size and number of ports determine the extent of the trauma. Single-port laparoscopic surgery is assumed to minimize and perhaps eliminate the potential adverse effects of conventional laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to examine short-term outcomes of single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospectively collected data from 25 consecutive patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer between January 2010 and March 2012. Perioperative data, oncological resections, and short-term outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Male:female ratio was 10:15. Of the 25 patients, 44% had previously undergone abdominal surgery. Median body mass index was 24 kg/m(2) (range: 19-32 kg/m(2)). In all, four patients (16%) had neoadjuvant therapy. Median operating time was 260 min (range: 136-397 min). An additional port was needed in two patients, and one case was converted to hand-assisted approach. Median postoperative stay was 7 days (range: 4-39 days), and three patients (12%) were readmitted. Median lymph node harvest was 13 (range: 3-33). The surgical margins were clear in all patients. Complications were seen in six patients. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in selected patients with rectal cancer without compromising oncological safety and with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates.

Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with transcatheter-delivered devices is an evolving story of compelling randomized data and the potential to dramatically reduce the incidence of stroke and improve the quality of life among patients with atrial fibrillation. Oral anticoagulation is the standard of care for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation but falls short of providing an adequate solution to this common threat when considered from efficacy and safety perspectives. The robust series of Watchman device trials has demonstrated the Watchman device to provide stroke prevention efficacy similar to that of warfarin and by extension provides proof of concept of LAA closure.

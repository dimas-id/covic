The aging hand is characterized by skin changes and soft-tissue deflation, which leads to rhytides, dermal atrophy, and distinct anatomical structures. Soft-tissue deflation and prominent hand anatomy can be corrected with volume augmentation using dermal fillers or lipofilling. Fat transfer volumizes the hand with prolonged durability and efficacy, autologous tissue replacement, and possible dermal regeneration. The senior author's (R.J.R.) technique for hand rejuvenation is described, which uses minimal access and blunt dissection to effectively augment the soft-tissue compartments of the hand. This approach addresses the prominent aged anatomy of the hand, providing excellent contour and aesthetic outcomes.

Summary Vaccination of dams with modified-live canine distemper virus (CDV) vaccines will elicit high concentrations of colostral antibody, that although vital for protection of the pup during the first weeks of life, can interfere with active vaccination against the virus. In the present study, 12 pups, 7â€“9 weeks of age, with maternally derived immunity to CDV, were vaccinated with a canarypox-vectored CDV vaccine. These pups were protected against intravenous challenge with CDV. Three littermate pups that were unvaccinated all developed clinical signs of infection after challenge, and two of these control pups died.

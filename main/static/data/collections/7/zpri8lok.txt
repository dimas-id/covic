The coronavirus which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a virulent and highly contagious organism. Of the 1755 SARS patients in Hong Kong, over 400 were healthcare workers. Meticulous attention to infection control and teamwork are essential to minimize cross-contamination and prevent staff from contracting the illness. These points are especially pertinent when anaesthetizing SARS patients for high-risk procedures such as tracheostomy. We describe the management of such a case.

AIM: To investigate the factors associated with the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) RNA shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). METHODS: A retrospective cohort of COVID‐19 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Beijing was analyzed to study the factors affecting the duration of viral shedding. RESULTS: The median duration of viral shedding was 11 days (IQR, 8‐14.3 days) as measured from illness onset. Univariate regression analysis showed that disease severity, corticosteroid therapy, fever (temperature>38.5℃), and time from onset to hospitalization were associated with prolonged duration of viral shedding (p<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that fever (temperature>38.5℃) (OR 5.1, 95%CI: 1.5‐18.1), corticosteroid therapy (OR 6.3, 95%CI: 1.5‐27.8), and time from onset to hospitalization (OR 1.8, 95%CI: 1.19‐2.7) were associated with increased odds of prolonged duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid treatment, fever (temperature>38.5℃), and longer time from onset to hospitalization were associated with prolonged viral shedding in COVID‐19 patients.

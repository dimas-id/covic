BACKGROUND Intragastric surgery is a percutaneous endoluminal surgery in the stomach aimed at resection of tumors located at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). We developed needlescopic intragastric surgery performed via 2 mm, 2 mm, and 5 mm ports (PEIGS-225). MATERIAL AND METHODS In cooperation with Niti-On Co., Ltd. we developed a series of 2 mm instruments including grasping forceps, a cannula, a laparoscope, an electrocautery, scissors, and a needle holder. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE Two 2 mm trocars and a 5 mm one are inserted into the gastric lumen percutaneously. Intragastric procedures are performed by the instruments brought through those three ports. The specimen is extracted via the esophageal-oral route. The defect in the gastroesophageal wall is closed by hand-suture. After the intragastric procedure, the 5 mm stab wound on the gastric wall is closed by hand-suture, while the 2 mm wounds are left untreated. PATIENTS Between March and August 2015 PEIGS-225 was performed in five patients. RESULTS There was no operative conversion. The mean operation time was 96 minutes. There were no perioperative complications. Pathological findings indicated that the margin was negative in all cases. CONCLUSION Needlescopic intragasric surgery performed via the smallest access (2 mm, 2 mm, 5 mm) is enabled by the 2 mm instruments developed by us.

Coronavirus disease 2019 has become a worldwide pandemic that is seriously jeopardising people's health. The National Health Commission and regional health administrations have issued regulations on the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019. Dentistry involves many invasive treatments, which differentiates it from other forms of medical practice. The following guidelines were produced by experts from the Stomatological Healthcare Service branch of the Chinese Stomatological Association to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 in dental clinics. The guidelines are in accordance with the relevant laws and documents from the health administration and range from technical guidelines to advice on how dental treatment should be conducted. Dental institutions can take these suggestions as a reference, based on the current local epidemic situation. It is anticipated that the guidelines will help dental institutions of different sizes to prevent the spread of the epidemic.

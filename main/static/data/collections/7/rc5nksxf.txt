Abstract: A 29 year old man tested positive for COVID-19 and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While mechanically ventilated, his electrocardiogram (EKG) showed inferior ST segment elevations, with normal serial cardiac troponin I and transthoracic echocardiograms. He was treated conservatively, with complete clinical recovery and resolution of his EKG abnormalities.

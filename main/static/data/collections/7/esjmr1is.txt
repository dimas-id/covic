The outcome of kidney transplant patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is still unclear. Here we describe the clinical characteristics, disease outcome and risk factors for ARDS and death of a cohort of 53 kidney transplant patients with COVID‐19. 8/53 have been handled as outpatients due to mild disease, on average with immunosuppression reduction and the addiction of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; no patients required admission, developed ARDS or died. 45/53 required admission due to severe symptoms: this cohort has been managed with immunosuppression withdrawal, methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine and antiviral drugs. Dexamethasone and tocilizumab were considered in case of ARDS. 33% of the patients developed AKI, 60% ARDS and 33% died. In this group, thrombocytopenia was associated to ARDS while lymphopenia at the baseline, higher D‐dimer and lack of CRP reduction with risk of death. In the overall population, dyspnoea was associated with the risk of ARDS while age older than 60 years and dyspnoea with the risk of death with only a trend towards an increased risk of death for patients on tacrolimus. In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may have a variable outcome in renal transplant patients, with higher risk of ARDS and death in the ones requiring admission.

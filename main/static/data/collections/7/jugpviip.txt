This document aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to estimate the personal protective equipments (PPE), medical devices, and drugs commonly used in the Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic literature review and gray literature assessment was performed, and the evidence was categorized using the GRADE methodology. Then a predictive model was built to support the estimation of resources needed during 30 days of the pandemic. In the development of these recommendations, 33 publications were included, with variable quality of evidence (low to very low quality). They refer to the use of PPE according to the risk of exposure; management and reuse of PPE, and the stock of drugs and medical devices needed for the care of patients with COVID-19. It is important to remark the difficult in estimating and managing the number of essential supplies and equipment required during a pandemic. The model allowed us to predict the resources required to provide critical care during 30 days of pandemic activity. Given the constant evolution of COVID-19, these recommendations might change as evidence evolves.

BACKGROUND Brain vulnerability in the critically ill preterm newborn may be related to the burden of cerebral hypoxygenation and hypoperfusion during the immediate postnatal period. OBJECTIVE We determined the association between adverse outcomes [death or high grade intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)] and continuous cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2), superior vena cava flow (SVCf) and cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (CFOE) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants during the first 48 h of life. METHODS We studied a prospective cohort of 60 VLBW infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit within the first 6 h of life between March 2010 and June 2012. rSO2 (expressed as a number of summary measures) was continuously monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 5100 Somanetic) during the first 48 h of life, SCVf was measured at 4-6, 12, 24 and 48 h after birth, and CFOE was calculated. RESULTS The mean gestational age was 27.9 (SD 2.39); 8 infants died (13.3%) and 7 developed IVH grade III-IV: 1 in the alive group and 6 in the deceased group (p < 0.001). The odds ratio for death was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.015-1.15, p = 0.016) for each 10 periods of rSO2 values <40% in the first 48 h, and 4.2 (95% CI: 1.27-14.05, p = 0.019) for SVCf values <40 ml/kg/min. Among alive babies, mean CFOE decreased at 24, 36 and 48 h; among deceased babies it did not (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, these results retained significance. CONCLUSIONS Both rSO2 â‰¤40% and SVCf <40 ml/kg/min independently increase the risk of death. The trend in CFOE supports the ischemic-hypoperfusion hypothesis as a mechanism for cerebral damage.

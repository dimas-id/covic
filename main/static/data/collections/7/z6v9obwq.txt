OBJECTIVE To assess the perception of obstetricians and pediatricians about risks of COVID-19 on pregnant women and possible complications in newborns. METHODS A structured 27-item online survey was sent via social media messaging to obstetricians and pediatricians from public, academic, and private sectors in Jordan between March 23-30, 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to represent numbers and percentages of participants' responses to survey items. RESULTS A total of 147 physicians participated (107 obstetricians, 40 pediatricians). Participants were well informed about the symptoms, diagnosis, modes of transmission, and methods of prevention. Participants had variable perceptions about COVID-19 risk during pregnancy, including potential vertical transmission, preferred route of delivery, and safety of breastfeeding. Most participants felt that pregnant women should be prioritized for testing and medical care provision. CONCLUSION While evidence-based strategies to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborns are evolving, healthcare providers showed excellent knowledge of the infection and were vigilant regarding its complications for mothers and newborns. To ensure safe pregnancy, physicians must keep informed of developing guidance on best and safest prenatal and perinatal health services. Implementing local hospital policies and adequate training in infection control measures is strongly encouraged.

INTRODUCTION: Bedside nurse (RN) presence during family-centered rounds (FCR) enhances communication and collaboration for safer, higher-quality care.1â€“3 At our institution, RN participation in FCR was variable and lower than desired. The content discussed at each bedside during rounds was inconsistent, contributing to the irregular achievement of established FCR checklist items. METHODS: Using a scheduling tool with a prioritization algorithm and set time allotment/patient, we implemented schedule-based family-centered rounds (SBFCR) on a pediatric acute care unit. Primary outcome metrics included RN attendance and participation. We tracked rounding checklist compliance, parent presence on rounds, and adherence to the schedule. Surveys provided information on provider and family satisfaction. Perceived impact on teaching was the balancing measure because the structure discouraged spending extra time at the cost of team tardiness for the next patient. RESULTS: We created a schedule for 95% workweek days, with the rounding order kept for 93%. Mean RN attendance increased from 69% to 87% and participation increased from 48% to 80% with SBFCR (P < 0.001 for each). FCR checklist compliance increased from 60% to 94% (P < 0.001). Families felt more informed and able to attend; their presence at rounds rose from 66% to 85% (P < 0.001). Most faculty and trainees felt SBFCR was efficient and observed increased teaching with SBFCR. CONCLUSIONS: SBFCR provides an organizational framework for increased RN attendance and participation as well as greater family presence during rounds. The system elevated provider satisfaction with rounding without degrading the perceived educational experience.

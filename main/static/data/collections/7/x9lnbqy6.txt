OBJECTIVE: To explore the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 associated with SARS-Cov-2 in Guizhou province, and to compare the differences in epidemiology with other provinces. METHODS: The data were extracted from National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, Health Commission of Guizhou province, and Health Commission of Hubei province from January 20 to February 12, 2020. Information included such as general demographic indicators, population data and clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 135 cases were analyzed in the study. The average age was 39.46±18.95 years. The ratio of males to females was 0.985:1. Most of COVID-19 patients were 18-45 years old (52.27%). Close contact history was the most common (37.88%), followed by residence history in Hubei (34.85%). There was no difference between males and females in age (P=0.953) and exposure condition (P=0.186). Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the migration index and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.816, P=0.007). CONCLUSION: Among the cases, most patients were young adults. Most epidemiological characteristics were no difference between males and females. Family-based transmission should not be ignored, as a close contact history was the top reason of exposure. Moreover, population movements also had significant impact on outbreaks.

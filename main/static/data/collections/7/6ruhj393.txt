This article presents supplementary data for the research article by Yotsukura et al. entitled "Prognostic impact of cancer-associated active fibroblasts and invasive architectural patterns on early-stage lung adenocarcinoma" [1], which presented the postoperative prognosis for early-stage lung adenocarcinoma categorized according to histological findings. We included data of 1,032 resected cases of lung adenocarcinoma, which consisted of pathological stage IA invasive cancer and adenocarcinoma in situ resected at National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, between 2007 and 2012. A pathological review was performed to assess total tumor size, size of invasion, histological subtype, lymphovascular invasion, and presence of cancer-associated active fibroblast (CAF). Tumor recurrence and overall survival were retrospectively recorded. Of the included cases, 166 (16.1%), and 866 (83.9%) were adenocarcinoma in situ and pathological stage IA, respectively. Pathological stage IA adenocarcinoma was further classified based on the histologial subtype and the presence of CAF. This data set may be useful for analyzing the postoperative prognosis of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, in combination with detailed pathological findings including size of invasion, histological subtype, and presence of CAF.

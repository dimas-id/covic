Pancreatic cysts, a common complication of pancreatitis, often require invasive treatment. When possible, endoscopic technique tends to be the procedure of choice. Despite its advantages, most of its complications may require immediate surgical assistance. Experienced surgeons tend to choose a laparoscopic approach bearing in mind its advantages. We present a case of a 71-year-old patient with an idiopathic pancreatic cyst, causing chronic epigastric pain. The attempt of endoscopic drainage led to iatrogenic perforation, which was successfully managed by laparoscopic posterior gastrocystostomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. In our opinion, laparoscopy should always be considered to manage complications caused by endoscopic drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst.

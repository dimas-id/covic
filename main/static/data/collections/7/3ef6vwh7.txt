The detection of antigen-specific T cell responses by MHC multimer staining is rapidly becoming one of the core immunological techniques, and the technology to produce MHC multimers has been optimized substantially in recent years. Furthermore, recent work demonstrates the potential of high-throughput detection of T cell responses and suggests that manipulation of T cell responses through the use of multimeric MHC reagents is also feasible.

A 10-mer overlapping peptide library has been synthesized for screening and identification of linear B-cell epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which spanned the major structural proteins of SARS-CoV. One hundred and eleven candidate peptides were positive according to the result of PEPscan, which were assembled into 22 longer peptides. Five of these peptides showed high cross-immunoreactivities (approximately 66.7 to 90.5%) to SARS convalescent patients' sera from the severest epidemic regions of the China mainland. Most interestingly, S(471-503), a peptide located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, could specifically block the binding between the RBD and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV entrance into host cells in vitro. The study demonstrated that S(471-503) peptide was a potential immunoantigen for the development of peptide-based vaccine or a candidate for further drug evaluation against the SARS-CoV virus-cell fusion.

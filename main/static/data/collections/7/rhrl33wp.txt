INTRODUCTION Embolisation has long been used as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM). The most commonly used embolic material, n-butylcyanoacrylate glue, requires experience and skill to handle its quick and unpredictable flow and polymerisation. A new liquid embolic agent, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx), is less adhesive and polymerises slowly, which provides better control for radiologists performing embolisation. OBJECTIVE To report our experience in embolisation using Onyx alone or in combination with histoacryl for bAVM embolisation in our tertiary referral centre. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the anatomy, technical conditions, complications and clinical outcome of all bAVM patients embolised at our centre using Onyx alone or in combination with n-butylcyanoacrylate glue. RESULTS Between 2010 and 2013, 13 patients [6 (46.2%) male; 7 (53.8%) female; aged, 14-57 years] were included, and a total of 31 embolisations were performed. Clinical presentation included hemorrhage [9 (69.2%)], seizures [2 (15.4%)], and headache [2 (15.4%)]. Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres [12 (92.3%)] and measured <3 cm [7 (53.8%]. Complete occlusion of the AVM was obtained in 2 (15.4%) patients; 11 (84.6%) patients had partial occlusion [6 (54.5%) had <50% nidus occlusion]. Complications occurred in four procedures involving 3 patients (morbidity, 23.1%). This resulted in the death of 1 patient (mortality, 7.7%) and complete recovery with no disability in 2 patients. CONCLUSION The total nidal occlusion achieved herein is comparable to other similar studies. Our morbidity and mortality were higher compared to other studies which may be attributed to the small number of patients. More data is being collected which may better reflect on our experience.

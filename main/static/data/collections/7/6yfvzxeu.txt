PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, 13 patients (11 men and 2 women) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) with the use of a catheter placed into the inferior vena cava with percutaneous translumbar access were retrospectively evaluated. In the studied group, 16 procedures of percutaneous translumbar catheterization were performed. Complications connected with the presence of catheter, such as hematoma, thrombosis, infection, catheter movement or unsuccessful catheterization, were analyzed. Moreover, another aspect of our report was to evaluate the adequacy of HD treatment performed by lumbar catheter. RESULTS The total time of translumbar catheter observation was 4,169 days. Average time of their functioning was 261 days. The most frequent reason for termination of the use of translumbar HD catheters was spontaneous/idiopathic removal - 2 cases. Episodes of infection and thrombosis per 1,000 days of catheter observation were 2.2 and 1.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Based on our study, we can conclude that correctly performed percutaneous translumbar catheterization of the inferior vena cava, in order to produce a long-term vascular access for HD, is a valuable and safe method in patients after depletion of standard vascular accesses.

BACKGROUND Decrease of the nociceptive stimulation induced by laryngoscopy could be an advantage for patients without risk of difficult intubation. The present study aimed to compare the difference in nociceptive stimulation between the use of a conventional laryngoscope or of a videolaryngoscope. Amount of nociception was assessed indirectly using the peak remifentanil concentration determined by a closed-loop administration of propofol and remifentanil with bispectral index (BIS) as the input signal (target 50). METHODS A prospective single-center randomized study was performed including surgical patients without predictable risk of difficult mask ventilation or of difficult tracheal intubation. Forty consecutive surgery patients were randomly assigned to CL group (conventional laryngoscope) or VL group (McGrath Mac videolaryngoscope). Induction of anesthesia was performed automatically using the closed-loop system and myorelaxation with atracurium. The allocation was revealed just before tracheal intubation. The primary outcome was the peak plasma remifentanil concentration observed during the 5-minute period which followed intubation. RESULTS Sixteen patients in the CL group and 11 in the VL group were analyzed. Plasmatic remifentanil and propofol concentrations were similar in both groups either before tracheal intubation or during the 5 minutes following intubation. There was a nonsignificant between-group difference (P = .09) for the peak concentration of remifentanil. A comparable result was observed for other outcomes except for the heart rate which increased in the CL group. CONCLUSION Use of the videolaryngoscope McGrath Mac did not reduce the nociceptive stimulation induced during intubation as evaluated by the automatically administered remifentanil concentration.

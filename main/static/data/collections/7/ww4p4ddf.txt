We are being confronted with the most consequential pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1918­1920 to the extent that never before have 4 billion people quarantined simultaneously; to address this global challenge we bring to the forefront the options for medical treatment and summarize SARS­CoV2 structure and functions, immune responses and known treatments. Based on literature and our own experience we propose new interventions, including the use of amiodarone, simvastatin, pioglitazone and curcumin. In mild infections (sore throat, cough) we advocate prompt local treatment for the naso­pharynx (inhalations; aerosols; nebulizers); for moderate to severe infections we propose a tried­and­true treatment: the combination of arginine and ascorbate, administered orally or intravenously. The material is organized in three sections: i) Clinical aspects of COVID­19; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); known treatments; ii) Structure and functions of SARS­CoV2 and proposed antiviral drugs; iii) The combination of arginine­ascorbate.

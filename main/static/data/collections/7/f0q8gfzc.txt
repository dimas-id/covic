We report a rare case of adenoviral pneumonia in a previously healthy pregnant woman at 26(+4) weeks' gestation. She presented with persistent high fever, cough for 5 days, and developed progressive dyspnea with hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with pleural effusions. Aggressive supportive care and timely obstetrical management saved the mother and prevented preterm delivery and fetal anomaly.

COVID-19 lockdown induced severe changes in light exposure and social cues. Leone et al. show that sleep is later and longer on weekdays, with lower social jetlag during lockdown compared with a controlcondition, in the same subjects (n=1021). Sleep quality is not affected but chronotype is later, which might eventually lead to desynchronization.

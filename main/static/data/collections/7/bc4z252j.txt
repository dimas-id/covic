Hydrophilic poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (PVA-co-PE) copolymers with 27 mol %, 32 mol % and 44 mol % ethylene were functionalized by melt radical graft copolymerization with 2,4-diamino-6-diallylamino-1,3,5-triazine (NDAM) using reactive extrusion. This functionalization imparts antibacterial properties. The covalent attachments of the NDAM as side chains onto the PVA-co-PE polymer backbones were confirmed. The effects of initiator concentrations and ethylene contents in PVA-co-PE polymers on grafting of NDAM were studied. The chain scissions of PVA-co-PE polymers during reactive extrusion were investigated by monitoring changes in the melt torque and FTIR spectra. The NDAM grafted PVA-co-PE polymers were successfully fabricated into hydrophilic nanofibers and nanofibrous membranes with sufficient surface exposure of the grafted NDAM. The hydrophilicity of the PVA-co-PE polymers and the large specific surface area offered by the nanofiber membranes significantly facilitated the chlorine activation process, enhanced the active chlorine contents of the grafted PVA-co-PE nanofiber membranes, and therefore led to their superior antibacterial properties.

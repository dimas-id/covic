Mostly, mass of a macroscopic object is determined by comparing the gravitational forces experienced by the object and the body of known mass. Relative uncertainty in 1 kg is pretty small say one part in [Formula: see text]. However, gravitational force of an object of molecular scale is too feeble to detect. Hence, normal method of using a balance will not do for mass measurement on the microscopic scale. Measurement of mass at the microscopic scale is very vital as it serves powerful tool that can provide information about the molecular and atomic composition of an object, detection, prevention and treatment of various diseases.

This article examines the political and criminological history of anti-money controls, including the involvement of Asian countries and the varied motivations and interests engaged. It goes on to review where empirical evidence has been used and can be used in fighting the financial components of underlying crimes, examining the denotation of the problem(s) we are supposed to be fightingâ€”money laundering as an evil in itself and/or the underlying crimes which give rise to it; estimates of the size and harmfulness of the problems and identifies any improvements/emerging problems in the assessment of money laundering. It concludes with some reflections on assessing policy effectiveness and the need for greater engagement by criminologists and other social scientists in this process.

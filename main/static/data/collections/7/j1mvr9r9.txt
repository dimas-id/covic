OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of CT texture analysis (CTTA) for determining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. METHODS: The clinical and CT data of 81 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. The texture features were extracted using LK2.1. The two-sample t test or Mann–Whitney U test was used to find the significant features. Minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (MRMR) method was performed to find the features with maximum correlation and minimum redundancy. These features were then used to construct a radiomics texture model to discriminate the severe patients using multivariate logistic regression method. Besides, a clinical model was also built. ROC analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance of two models. The correlations of clinical features and textural features were analyzed using the Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: Of the total cases included, 60 were common and 21 were severe. (1) For textural features, 20 radiomics features selected by MRMR showed good performance in discriminating the two groups (AUC > 70%). (2) For clinical features, chi-square tests or Mann–Whitney U tests identified 16 clinical features as significant, and 12 were discriminative (p < 0.05) between two groups analyzed by univariate logistic analysis. Of these, 10 had an AUC > 70%. (3) Prediction models for textural features and clinical features were established, and both showed high predictive accuracy. The AUC values of textural features and clinical features were 0.93 (0.86–1.00) and 0.95 (0.95–0.99), respectively. (4) The Spearman correlation analysis showed that most textural and clinical features had above-moderate correlations with disease severity (> 0.4). CONCLUSION: Texture analysis can provide reliable and objective information for differential diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • CT texture analysis can well differentiate common and severe COVID-19 patients. • Some textural features showed above-moderate correlations with clinical factors. • CT texture analysis can provide useful information to judge the severity of COVID-19.

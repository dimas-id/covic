This letter amplifies the rising spate of human rights violations exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. It notes that while governments in the region have declared restrictions on social gathering, in a bid to curtail the deadly disease, violations of human rights of vulnerable groups by State security operatives are on the increase. It argues that the underlying rationale for such abuses emanates from the dearth of a rights-based approach to police-public relations combined with inadequate public health and social care infrastructures for large sections of the populace. Policy implications are drawn out while suggestions are offered to social work professionals given their longstanding commitment to national security and national development.

BACKGROUND Data on the timing, durability and occlusion rate of treating ruptured blister cerebral aneurysms using the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) are limited. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Three patients who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhages from ruptured blister aneurysms of the internal carotid arteries were treated with the PED. RESULTS Aneurysmal occlusion with reconstruction of the parent vessels occurred angiographically using the PED as a primary treatment modality. All three patients were treated successfully without immediate or delayed complications and remained neurologically intact during the 6-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Complete occlusion of a ruptured blister aneurysm can occur immediately after PED placement. In ruptured blister aneurysms with contrast stagnation after PED treatment, early angiographic occlusion was confirmed as early as 6 weeks and continued with medium-term durability.

This chapter describes the effect of antibody on virus-infected cells with special reference to the human system. The destruction by antibody of the infected cells through the mediation of complement is described in detail based in considerable part on the contributions of the authors. Activation of the alternative pathway by the various infected cells is of special interest. The interesting effect of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) system involving viral antigens in cell killing is also presented. Multiple additional topics are also covered, such as the effect of antibody on the expression of viral proteins both on the surface of the cell and intracellularly. Serum antibody, produced in response to virus infections, is of major importance in preventing the spread of infection by virtue of neutralizing free virus in extracellular fluids. Virus neutralization by antibody is enhanced by complement. Antibody binding to the surface of virus-infected cells can affect virus production and release in the absence of an effector system. Immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody can mediate the destruction of virus-infected cells in conjunction with complement or cytotoxic lymphocytes. In addition, at a conceptual level there is evidence to suggest that antibody may enhance and confer specificity on basic nonspecific humoral and cell-mediated defense mechanisms.

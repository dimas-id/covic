BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To provide evidence whether mechanical thrombectomy with stent-retrievers in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke causes intimal damage. METHODS This study analyzed thrombi retrieved by mechanical thrombectomy from cerebral arteries in 48 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke for the presence of endothelial cells using CD34 antibodies. RESULTS Of 48 thrombi analyzed, CD34-positive cells were absent in 20, present as isolated cells in 21, and found in clusters in 7 thrombi. We did not find any subendothelial vessel wall structures. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that mechanical thrombectomy with stent-retrievers does not cause relevant intimal damage in acute ischemic stroke treatment.

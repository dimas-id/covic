Abstract Demyelination following infection of mice with the neurotropic coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV) is immune-mediated. It has been demonstrated that MHV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are capable of causing demyelination independent of the other T cell subset. Recent work has also demonstrated that activated bystander CD8 T cells mediate significant demyelination. The ability of bystander CD4 T cells to mediate demyelination was investigated using CD4 T cell transgenic mice. The results indicated that bystander CD4 T cells were unable to cause demyelination in MHV-infected mice, despite being recruited into the central nervous system (CNS) and irrespective of activation status. These results suggest that CD4 T cells must recognize antigen in the CNS in order to cause demyelination.

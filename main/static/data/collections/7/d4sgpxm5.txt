The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many Veterans Healthcare Administration providers working with veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder to question the feasibility and appropriateness of continuing to provide trauma-focused treatment during this crisis. The Veterans Healthcare Administration is in a unique position to continue to provide trauma-informed care because of its capacity to offer telemental health services. Data from a Veterans Affairs medical center's posttraumatic stress disorder clinical team suggest that not only are veterans interested in continuing with treatment but also that the treatments can be modified to accommodate the current climate.

AIMS This study evaluated the safety, feasibility, and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic extralevator abdominoperineal excision (laparoscopic-ELAPE) with primary suturing for low rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing for low rectal cancer at our institution between September 2013 and January 2015 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained database. Short-term outcomes, including intraoperative complications, postoperative morbidity, and oncologic adequacy of surgical specimens, were evaluated. RESULTS Laparoscopic-ELAPE was successful in all 33 included patients, with no patient requiring conversion to an open approach. Mean operation time was 200 minutes, and mean intraoperative blood loss was 90 mL. Except for bowel perforation in 2 patients (6.1%), there were no intraoperative complications. Two patients (6.1%) had positive circumferential resection margins. Median length of hospital stay was 7 days. The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 15.2% and 0%, respectively. Postoperative complications within 30 postoperative days included perineal wound infection (2 patients, 6.1%), respiratory infection (2 patients, 6.1%), and chylous fistula (1 patient, 3.0%). Complications at a median follow-up time of 12 months (range, 3-19 months) included local tumor recurrence (1 patient, 3.0%), perineal dehiscence (2 patients, 6.1%), perineal seroma (1 patient, 3.0%), bowel obstruction (1 patient, 3.0%), urinary retention (2 patients, 6.1%), and chronic perineal pain (2 patients, 6.1%). There were no instances of perineal hernia, persistent sinus, or peristomal hernia. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing appears to be a feasible and safe treatment approach for low rectal cancer, with acceptable short-term outcomes.

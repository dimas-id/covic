In a study of 1152 healthcare workers surveyed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most disagreed that respiratory protective equipment use interferes with patient care but reported that it would affect respirator use compliance if it did. A patient's fear reaction variably influenced self-reported healthcare worker compliance with respirator use. Strategies to improve protective equipment design may remove potential barriers to respirator use and allow better healthcare worker-patient relationships.

The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic in March 2020. Given the severity of COVID-19, appropriate use criteria have been implemented for fetal echocardiography. Screening low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease has typically been a shared responsibility by pediatric cardiologists, obstetricians, and maternal fetal medicine (MFM). Currently, many of the fetal echocardiograms for low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease have been deferred or cancelled with the emphasis on suspected abnormalities by MFMs and obstetricians. In this review, we discuss the literature that has been the basis of screening of low risk pregnancies by pediatric cardiologists. A new approach to more widespread usage of fetal tele-echocardiography may play a large part during COVID-19 and may continue after the pandemic.

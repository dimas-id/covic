BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery (SILS) suggests a promising alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. In this report we describe our initial experience with SILS for both right hemicolectomies and anterior resections. METHODS Between June 2009 and May 2010, SILS was performed for 32 consecutive cases with benign and malignant pathology. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, postoperative data, and pathologic data were assessed. RESULTS Twenty-one SILS right hemicolectomies, ten ARs, and one abdominal perineal resection (APR) were performed. For SILS right hemicolectomies, one case required full "conversion" to a laparoscopic procedure. The median operating time was 85 min (range 45-150 min) and the median wound length was 5.0 cm (range 3.0-10.0 cm). Median number of lymph nodes extracted in malignant cases was 17(range 10-30) and the overall median length of stay was 6 days (range 5-11). For left-sided lesions, ten cases of ARs (7 high ARs, 2 low ARs, 1 ultralow AR) and one APR were performed. Three cases were completed successfully via the SILS procedure, four cases required one additional port, and four cases required full "conversion" to a laparoscopic procedure. The median operating time was 120 min (range 65-235 min) and the median wound length was 5.0 cm (range 3.0-7.0 cm). Overall median length of stay was also 6 days (range 5-21). There was one case of anastomotic leak and one case of postoperative bleeding. CONCLUSION In our experience, SILS for right hemicolectomies is safe and effective with reproducible oncologic results. SILS AR, however, requires greater modifications in current devices and techniques. SILS AR can be performed for both malignant and benign diseases but additional ports may be necessary for the safe completion of the procedure.

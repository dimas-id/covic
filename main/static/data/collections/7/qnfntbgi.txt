Purpose To assess the clinical characteristics and identify mortality predicting factors in intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted COVID-19 confirmed patients. Methods We recruited and analyzed COVID-19 infected adult patients (age[â‰¥] 18 years) who were admitted to the ICU at Jaber AlAhmad Al Sabah Hospital,Kuwait, between 1st March, 2020and 30th April 2020. The patients were followed up to 20th May, 2020. The risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality were assessed using multiple regression analysis. Results We recruited a total of 103 ICU patients in this retrospective cohort. The median age of the patients was 53 years (Interquartile Range (IQR): 44-63 years). The fatality rate was 43.7%. Among the patients, majority were males (85.5%) and 38% patients had more than two comorbidities. Pre-existing hypertension (OR:3.2,95%CI: 1.2-8.9), moderate/severe ARDS (OR: 3.4, 95%CI: 1.1-10.8),lymphocyte counts <0.5 (OR: 6.1, 95%CI: 1.2-29.8) albumin < 22 (OR: 7.5, 95%CI: 2.1-26.2), procalcitonin >0.2 (OR: 3.8, 95%CI: 1.3-7.8), D-Dimer >1200 (OR: 5.1, 95%CI: 1.2-21.6), and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (OR: 9.3, 95%CI: 2.4-36.2) were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion This study describes the clinical characteristics and predictors of mortality among ICU patients. Early identification of risk factors to mortality might help in their better outcome.

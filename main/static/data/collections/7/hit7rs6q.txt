AIM: To summarize what we know so far about coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) in children. METHOD: We searched PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. We selected randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, and research letters of children ages birth to 18 years with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. We conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses to calculate the weighted mean prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) or the weighted average means and 95% CI. RESULT: Forty‐six articles reporting 551 cases of COVID‐19 in children (aged 1 day‐17.5 years) were included. Eighty‐seven percent (95% CI: 77%‐95%) of patients had household exposure to COVID‐19. The most common symptoms and signs were fever (53%, 95% CI: 45%‐61%), cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%‐47%), and sore throat/pharyngeal erythema (14%, 95% CI: 4%‐28%); however, 18% (95% CI: 11%‐27%) of cases were asymptomatic. The most common radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings were patchy consolidations (33%, 95% CI: 23%‐43%) and ground glass opacities (28%, 95% CI: 18%‐39%), but 36% (95% CI: 28%‐45%) of patients had normal CT images. Antiviral agents were given to 74% of patients (95% CI: 52%‐92%). Six patients, all with major underlying medical conditions, needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and one of them died. CONCLUSION: Previously healthy children with COVID‐19 have mild symptoms. The diagnosis is generally suspected from history of household exposure to COVID‐19 case. Children with COVID‐19 and major underlying condition are more likely to have severe/critical disease and poor prognosis, even death.

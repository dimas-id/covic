Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a frequently fatal clinicopathologic syndrome in which an uncontrolled and ineffective immune response leads to severe hyperinflammation. It may occur as either a familial disorder or a sporadic condition in association with a variety of triggers: infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and acquired immune deficiencies. However, the most consistent association is with viral infections, especially Epsteinâ€“Barr virus. The main clinical features are fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities and pancytopenia. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reducing mortality, but the diagnosis is difficult because of the rarity of the syndrome and the lack of specificity of the clinical findings. Treatment should be directed toward treating the underlying disease and to suppressing the exaggerated inflammatory response through the use of immunosuppressive agents.

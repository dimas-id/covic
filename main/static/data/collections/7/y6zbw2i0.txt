Background: This systematic review had three aims: i) to determine the frequency of anosmia (or other smell disorders) and dysgeusia (or other taste disorders) in COVID-19 patients;ii) to determine whether anosmia or dysgeusia are independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis;and iii) to determine whether anosmia or dysgeusia are prognostic factors for impaired outcomes among COVID-19 patients Methods: On April 20 (th), 2020, we search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv We used terms related to COVID-19, smell and taste disorders We selected case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies We included studies with COVID-19 patients describing their symptoms;studies that compared smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 patients and otherwise healthy subjects;and studies comparing smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 severe and mild/moderate cases Because of methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of results, a qualitative synthesis is presented Results: From 31 reports, we selected six (n=2,757) Six studies reported the proportion of smell and taste disorders among COVID-19 patients Two reports studied whether smell and taste disorders were independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis No reports studied the association with impaired outcomes among COVID-19 patients The frequency of anosmia ranged between 22%-68% The definition of taste disorders varied greatly, with dysgeusia present in 33% and ageusia in 20% People who reported loss of smell and taste had six-fold higher odds of being COVID-19 positive;similarly, anosmia and ageusia were associated with 10-fold higher odds of COVID-19 diagnosis Conclusions: The frequency of smell and taste disorders is as high as other symptoms, thus, at least anosmia for which the definition was more consistent, could be included in lists of COVID-19 symptoms Although there is promising evidence, it is premature to conclude that smell and taste disorders are strongly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020181308

Abstract During pathogenesis, viruses come in contact with the microbiota that colonizes the mucosal sites they infect. The intestinal microbiota has emerged as a critical factor in intestinal viral susceptibility. While the interaction of virus-intestinal commensal bacteria can lead to enhanced or decreased viral infection capacity, several scientific studies support the use of probiotics as antiviral therapies. Thus, probiotics and the modulation of the intestinal microbiota are envisaged as therapeutic strategies in the prevention and treatment of viral infection.

Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it has spread rapidly worldwide and poses a great threat to public health. This is the third serious coronavirus outbreak in <20 years, following SARS in 2002â€“2003 and MERS in 2012. So far, there are almost no specific clinically effective drugs and vaccines available for COVID-19. Polysaccharides with good safety, immune regulation and antiviral activity have broad application prospects in anti-virus, especially in anti-coronavirus applications. Here, we reviewed the antiviral mechanisms of some polysaccharides, such as glycosaminoglycans, marine polysaccharides, traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides, and their application progress in anti-coronavirus. In particular, the application prospects of polysaccharide-based vaccine adjuvants, nanomaterials and drug delivery systems in the fight against novel coronavirus were also analyzed and summarized. Additionally, we speculate the possible mechanisms of polysaccharides anti-SARS-CoV-2, and propose the strategy of loading S or N protein from coronavirus onto polysaccharide capped gold nanoparticles vaccine for COVID-19 treatment. This review may provide a new approach for the development of COVID-19 therapeutic agents and vaccines.

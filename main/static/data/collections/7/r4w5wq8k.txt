[Image: see text] The implementation of cyanation chemistry at manufacturing scales using batch equipment can be challenging because of the hazardous nature of the reagents employed and the tight control of reaction parameters, including cryogenic temperatures, that help to afford acceptable selectivity and conversion for the desired reaction. Application of continuous flow chemistry offers a means to mitigate the risk associated with handling large amounts of hazardous reagents and to better control the reaction parameters. A case study describing the cyanation of a glycoside using continuous flow chemistry toward the synthesis of the drug candidate remdesivir is presented.

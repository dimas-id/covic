OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficiency of single-port laparoscopic intragastric surgery by using a single-port device. METHODS The single-port device was introduced into the anterior wall of the stomach through 2.5-cm long abdominal and gastric incisions. Gastric mucosa resection and suturing (group 1) and mucosa resection by using staplers (group 2) were performed with 3 pigs in each group. RESULTS The time for setting up the intragastric ports ranged from 8 to 40 minutes (average 16.2 Â± 12.2 minutes). The total surgery times for the 3 pigs in group 1 were 75, 45, and 38 minutes and for the other 3 pigs in group 2 were 80, 85, 70 minutes, respectively. CONCLUSION A simple and stable intragastric surgery platform can be set up by using the single-port device placed into the stomach. This seems to be safe and feasible and may be a suitable alternative for humans.

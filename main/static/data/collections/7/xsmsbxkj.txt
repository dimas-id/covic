A juvenile raccoon (Procyon lotor) was found moribund near Fort Collins, Colorado (USA). Upon examination, the raccoon was dehydrated, had a mucopurulent oculonasal discharge and diarrhea, and was euthanized. Postmortem examination revealed emaciation, severe fibrinous gastroenteritis and a small, firm liver. Histopathological findings included blunting of villi, infiltration of lamina propria with neutrophils and plasma cells, and mild bronchopneumonia. Cryptosporidium sp. was demonstrated on intestinal villi and coronavirus and parvovirus were identified in feces. Fluorescent antibody test for rabies was negative and no evidence of canine distemper was found.

PURPOSE To retrospectively compare the local tumour response and survival rates in patients with non-colorectal cancer lung metastases post-ablation therapy using laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 175 computed tomography (CT)-guided ablation sessions performed on 109 patients (43 males and 66 females, mean age: 56.6 years). Seventeen patients with 22 lesions underwent LITT treatment (tumour size: 1.2-4.8 cm), 29 patients with 49 lesions underwent RFA (tumour size: 0.8-4.5 cm) and 63 patients with 104 lesions underwent MWA treatment (tumour size: 0.6-5 cm). CT scans were performed 24-h post-therapy and on follow-up at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. RESULTS The overall-survival rates at 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year were 93.8, 56.3, 50.0 and 31.3% for patients treated with LITT; 81.5, 50.0, 45.5 and 24.2% for patients treated with RFA and 97.6, 79.9, 62.3 and 45.4% for patients treated with MWA, respectively. The mean survival time was 34.14 months for MWA, 34.79 months for RFA and 35.32 months for LITT. In paired comparison, a significant difference could be detected between MWA versus RFA (p = 0.032). The progression-free survival showed a median of 23.49 ± 0.62 months for MWA,19.88 ± 2.17 months for LITT and 16.66 ± 0.66 months for RFA (p = 0.048). The lowest recurrence rate was detected in lesions ablated with MWA (7.7%; 8 of 104 lesions) followed by RFA (20.4%; 10 of 49 lesions) and LITT (27.3%; 6 of 22 lesions) p value of 0.012. Pneumothorax was detected in 22.16% of MWA ablations, 22.73% of LITT ablations and 14.23% of RFA ablations. CONCLUSION LITT, RFA and MWA may provide an effective therapeutic option for non-colorectal cancer lung metastases with an advantage for MWA regarding local tumour control and progression-free survival rate.

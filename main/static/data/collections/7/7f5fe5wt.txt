Colonization of the gut by microbes depends on a number of factors including age, diet, genetic makeup, gender, geographic location, and health status of an individual. India is a megadiverse country and includes 4 biodiversity hot spots. These features, along with the transitioning Indian sociodemographic profile, make the gut microbiota of Indian subjects an interesting area to study. In this review, we critically discuss the present status of the gut microbiome in the Indian population and its difference from other populations. We also discuss the aberrations in the available study designs that could introduce heterogeneity. An ideal study to evaluate the core gut microbiota of healthy Indians should involve a large homogeneous population across the country and use the same technology and data analytics tools. The "Landscape of Gut Microbiome-Pan India Exploration" (LogMPIE) is such a study that confirmed the most predominant organisms in Indians to be Prevotella copri and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.

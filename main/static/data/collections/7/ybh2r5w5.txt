Sixty-eight case herds seropositive to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) were compared to 128 seronegative controls in a double-blinded questionnaire survey. The study indicated no increased risk of PRRS seropositivity for herds using artificial insemination with semen from PRRS seropositive AI-stations. Also the herd-size was non-related to the risk of PRRS seropositivity, indicating that air-borne spread of PRRS may not have been a predominant feature in Denmark. Introduction of replacement breeding animals from seropositive breeding- and multiplying herds significantly increased the risk of a herd being PRRS seropositive, as did introduction of 25 kg pigs for feeding. PRRS seropositivity was in the farmers' opinions associated with abortions in sows, early farrowing, high postweaning mortality and low weight gain in fattening pigs. However, the reported frequencies of problems were relatively low.

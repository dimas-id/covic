BACKGROUND Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak during anterior cervical spine surgery can lead to complications, including wound breakdown, meningitis, headaches, need for lumbar drain, or additional surgery. These leaks can be difficult to manage given the limited field of view and lack of deep access. Herein, we describe 8 consecutive patients who underwent intraoperative repair of CSF leak, with no postoperative evidence of wound dehiscence or drainage. METHODS A retrospective review was performed on 8 cases where CSF leak was encountered during an anterior cervical spine surgery. Patients had ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, intradural disk herniation, or dural ectasia. Intraoperative repair was as follows. First, CSF was drained to low pressure, and durotomy was covered by dural substitute and sealant agent. Then the interbody graft used was manually undersized in the anteroposterior dimension to allow for expansion of the agents used. Anterior instrumentation was then performed. Finally, a wound drain was anchored to a biologic bag for shoulder level passive drainage. RESULTS In all 8 cases, there were no cases of wound dehiscence or CSF leak using this strategy. Likewise, there was no evidence of cord compression or neurologic deficits. No meningitis or persistent headaches were reported, and there was no need for lumbar drain placement at any time postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Once durotomy is encountered during anterior spine surgery, draining the CSF to a low pressure followed by dural substitute with a sealing agent, followed by a smaller anteroposterior size graft is an effective strategy of preventing complications in an inescapable problem.

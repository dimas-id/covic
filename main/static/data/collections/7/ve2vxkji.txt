Pathogen separation is of great significance for precise detection and prevention of disease outbreaks. For the first time, protein A conjugated with chitosan-coated iron oxide nanoparticles was prepared for pathogen separation at low concentrations from liquid samples. Vibrio cholerae O1 (VO1) bacteria were used for testing the effectiveness of this conjugate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the presence of captured VO1. The results showed that, after binding with a specific antibody, the conjugate allows separation of VO1 bacteria from water samples at a concentration as low as 10 cfu mL(-1). Moreover, the conjugate can be used in parallel with conventional or modern diagnostic tests for quick and accurate detection of pathogens.

Abstract Objectives Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) is the most common cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries, including Haiti. Our objective was to detect pathogens found in children with ARI in rural Haiti to help develop evidence-based guidelines for treatment and prevention. Methods Retrospective study of students with ARI at four schools in rural Haiti. Viral and/or bacterial pathogens were identified by qPCR in 177 nasal swabs collected from April 2013 through November 2015. Results Most common viruses detected were Rhinovirus (36%), Influenza A (16%) and Adenovirus (7%), and bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%). Compared to older children, children aged 3–5 years had more Influenza A (28% vs. 9%, p=0.002) and Adenovirus detected (14% vs. 3%, p=0.01). Similarly, S. pneumoniae was greatest in children 3–5 years old (71% 3–5yrs; 58% 6–15 years; 25% 16–20 years; p=0.008). Children 3–10 years old presented with fever more than children 11–20 years old (22% vs 7%; p=0.02) and were more often diagnosed with pneumonia (28% vs 4%, p<0.001). Conclusions Younger children had increased fever, pneumonia, and detection of Influenza A and S. pneumoniae. These data support the need for influenza and pneumococcus vaccination in early childhood in Haiti.

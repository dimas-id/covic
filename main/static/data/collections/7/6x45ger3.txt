We introduce a 2-layer network model for the study of the immunization dynamics in epidemics. Spreading of an epidemic is modeled as an excitatory process in a small-world network (body layer) while immunization by prevention for the disease as a dynamic process in a scale-free network (head layer). It is shown that prevention indeed turns periodic rages of an epidemic into small fluctuation. The study also reveals that, in a certain situation, prevention actually plays an adverse role and helps the disease survive. We argue that the presence of two different characteristic time scales contributes to the immunization dynamics observed.

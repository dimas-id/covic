Computational Fluid Particle Dynamics (CFPD) is an emerging research field that involves interdisciplinary research areas with a broad range of applications. Fluid-particle flows can be found all around us, from the airborne particles we breathe to industrial applications such as fuel spray in internal combustion engines, fluidised bed combustors, and mineral processing to name a few. In the health, pharmaceutical, and biomedical fields, interest is increasing in the use of computational modelling for inhalation toxicology analysis, effectiveness of drug delivery systems, respiratory and physiological flows. Computational modelling is being used in many industries as a valuable tool for cost and cycle time reductions during product development, and it can provide proof of concept for model designs. This technique has been encouraged by the rapid developments in computational models to reflect the physics, which is in line with the increase in computing power.

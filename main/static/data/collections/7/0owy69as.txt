Abstract Cutaneous manifestation is a newly reported clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The clinical description of cutaneous manifestation is still not fully described. Our patient, a medical personnel, had viral exanthem distributed in the extremities along with “pin and needles sensation” which differ from the previously published paper on cutaneous manifestation. The differential diagnosis of drug-induced skin rash and hand-foot-mouth disease have already been ruled out based on the patient's previous history and course of disease.

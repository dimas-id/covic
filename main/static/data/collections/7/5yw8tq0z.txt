A 52-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. Treatment with dasatinib, a second-generation Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was initiated, and complete cytogenetic remission was achieved. Two years later, proteinuria occurred, and the urinary protein level increased gradually in the next 3 years. Moreover, the serum creatinine level increased mildly during this period. The urinary protein level reached 2.18 g/gCr; hence, a renal biopsy was conducted. Light microscopy revealed mild proliferation of mesangial cells, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed IgG and C3 depositions in the mesangial area. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposition in the paramesangial area, partial podocyte foot process effacement, and segmental endothelial cell swelling with a slight expansion of the subendothelial space. Dasatinib was discontinued, and within 3 weeks, the proteinuria disappeared, with improvements in her renal function. After switching to bosutinib, a new second-generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, the proteinuria remained negative. The rapid cessation of proteinuria following dasatinib discontinuation indicated that proteinuria was induced by the long-term administration of dasatinib. Proteinuria and renal function should be regularly monitored during dasatinib therapy.

BACKGROUND Patients on haemodialysis (HD) have a decreased physical and functional capacity. Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of exercise on the physical, functional and psychological functioning of HD patients. Despite these results, exercise programmes on HD are not commonplace. OBJECTIVE To analyse the effect of an intradialysis endurance training programme on muscular strength and functional capacity in our HD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A 6-month single-centre prospective study. HD patients were non-randomly assigned to an exercise group (group E) or a control group (group C). Exercise training included complete endurance training using balls, weights and elastic bands in the first 2 h of an HD session; group C received standard HD care. Analysed data: (1) biochemical parameters; (2) biceps and quadriceps muscle tone, maximum quadriceps length strength (MQLS) and dominant hand grip (HG); (3) functional capacity tests: sit-to-stand-to-sit (STS10) and 6-min walking test (6MWT). RESULTS Forty patients were included, 55% were men; their mean age was 68.4 years; the patients were 61.6 months on HD; 16 patients were in group E and 24 in group C. In group E, muscular strength showed a significant improvement in MQLS (15.6 ± 10.7 vs. 17.7 ± 12.5 kg, p < 0.05) and HG (22.1 ± 13.2 vs. 24.1 ± 15.8 kg, p < 0.05) at the end of the programme, while a global decrease was reported in group C (MQLS 20.9 ± 9.3 vs. 16.2 ± 8.4 kg, p < 0.05; HG 25.1 ± 10.3 vs. 24.1 ± 11.1 kg). 6MWT significantly improved in group E (20%, 293.1 vs. 368 m, p < 0.001) and decreased in group C (10%, 350 vs. 315 m, p < 0.004). At the end of the programme, STS10 time was reduced in group E (2.1 ± 18.5 vs. 28.7 ± 20.6 s), while it rose in group C (31.5 ± 17.9 vs. 36.4 ± 19.8 s), though significant differences were not found. CONCLUSIONS (1) The intradialysis training programme improved muscular strength and functional capacity in our HD patients. (2) These results support the benefits of exercise training for HD patients. (3) Nephrologists should consider exercise training as a standard practice for the care of HD patients.

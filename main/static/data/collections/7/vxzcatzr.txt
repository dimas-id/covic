The present study concerns the production of specific secretory antibodies in turkeys orally inoculated with turkey coronavirus (TCV). Tissue localization of secretory antibodies in the intestines of recovered birds 4 and 5 months later was demonstrated by immunofluorescence technique. Intestinal sections were stained by sandwich method, using concentrated TCV antigen and anti-TCV conjugate. It was suggested that local synthesis of antibody might be responsible for life-long immunity seen in these birds after recovery from infection.

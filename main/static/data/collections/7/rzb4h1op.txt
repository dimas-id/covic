OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the IgM and IgG responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV)‐2 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients with varying illness severities. METHODS: IgM and IgG antibody levels were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay in 338 COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: IgM levels increased during the first week after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, peaked 2 weeks and then reduced to near‐background levels in most patients. IgG was detectable after 1 week and was maintained at a high level for a long period. The positive rates of IgM and/or IgG antibody detections were not significantly different among the mild, severe and critical disease groups. Severe and critical cases had higher IgM levels than mild cases, whereas the IgG level in critical cases was lower than those in both mild and severe cases. This might be because of the high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in critical cases. The IgM antibody levels were slightly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients, but IgG levels in these groups did not significantly differ. A longitudinal detection of antibodies revealed that IgM levels decreased rapidly in recovered patients, whereas in deceased cases, either IgM levels remained high or both IgM and IgG were undetectable during the disease course. CONCLUSION: Quantitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 quantitatively has potential significance for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID‐19.

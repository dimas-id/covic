Highly porous poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) scaffolds were fabricated using non-solvent-induced phase separation with chloroform as the solvent and tetrahydrofuran as the non-solvent. The microporosity, nanofiber morphology, and mechanical strength of the scaffolds were adjusted by varying the fabrication parameters, such as the polymer concentration and solvent composition. The influence of these parameters on the structure and morphology of PHB organogels and scaffolds was elucidated using small-angle neutron scattering and scanning electron microscopy. The organogels and scaffolds in this study have a complex hierarchical structure, extending over a wide range of length scales. In vitro viability assays were performed using the human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), and all PHB scaffolds demonstrated the excellent cell viability. Microporosity had the greatest impact on HaCaT cell proliferation on PHB scaffolds, which was determined after a 3-day incubation period with scaffolds of different morphologies and mechanical properties. The superior cell viability and the controlled scaffold properties and morphologies suggested PHB scaffolds fabricated by non-solvent-induced phase separation using chloroform and tetrahydrofuran as promising biomaterials for the applications of tissue engineering, particularly of epidermal engineering.

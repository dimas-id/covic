An original papillary muscle heads approximation procedure, commonly known as a sandwich plasty, has been successfully used for the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation (MR) associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and aortic valve disease (AVD). In this study, we evaluated the availability of this method as the concomitant procedure for the plasty of organic MR in comparison with the operative results in patients with functional MR. Fifty-six patients who underwent sandwich plasty were reviewed, including 45 functional MR (29 ICM and 16 AVD) patients and 11 organic MR patients. The mean age of patients was 67 years. In the organic MR patients, predominant cardiac diseases were solitary MR in six patients and combined valve diseases including aortic valve stenosis in five. Mitral valve changes included prolapse in six patients and moderate cusp thickening with calcification in five. Two heads of the papillary muscle connecting to the choldae of both the anterior and posterior leaflets are fixed with two teflon-pledgeted 3-0 TiCron™ (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) sutures in order to achieve coaptation of the two leaflets. Prominent MR was observed in a patient with functional MR after surgery, however residual MR was not detected in organic MR patients. The tenting height (coaptation distance) of mitral valve significantly decreased after surgery from 11±1 to 7±2mm in the organic MR patients, which was similar to the results in the functional MR patients (from 12±2 to 7±2 mm). The postoperative mean mitral orifice area in the organic MR patients was 4.3±0.1cm2 without stenosis. Sandwich plasty reduces the distance of choldae connecting to anterior and posterior leaflets and achieves the better coaptation of two leaflets. This procedure is effective in the treatment of both functional and organic MR.

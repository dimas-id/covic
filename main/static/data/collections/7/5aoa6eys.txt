An elderly woman receiving hemodialysis via a right brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula presented to the clinic for elective removal of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter inserted 5 years ago. The catheter had not been removed earlier at the patient's request. Removal was now unsuccessful in the clinic. Exploration in the operating room revealed the innominate vein had fibrosed around the length of the catheter. The procedure was abandoned, catheter cut short and the remnant left in situ. This case serves as a reminder to exercise caution if there is difficulty in removing the catheter even after the cuff is dissected free, and to remove them once a working fistula or graft is available. Failing which, the patient bears an unnecessary risk of line infection, or as in this case, the catheter may unintentionally end up what its common misnomer "perm-cath" alludes to--becoming truly "permanent."

[Image: see text] The pandemic outbreak of a new coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, has captured the world’s attention, demonstrating that CoVs represent a continuous global threat. As this is a highly contagious virus, it is imperative to understand RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the key component in virus replication. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 80% sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV, their RdRps and nucleotidyl-transferases (NiRAN) share 98.1% and 93.2% identity, respectively. Sequence alignment of six coronaviruses demonstrated higher identity among their RdRps (60.9%–98.1%) and lower identity among their Spike proteins (27%–77%). Thus, a 3D structural model of RdRp, NiRAN, non-structural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 was generated by modeling starting from the SARS counterpart structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2. The network of interactions established by these drug molecules affirms their efficacy to inhibit viral RNA replication and provides an insight into their structure-based rational optimization for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.

Let’s take inventory on the therapies that are being developed for the coronavirus epidemic Here is a very thorough list of at Biocentury, and I should note that (like Stat and several other organizations) they’re making all their Covid-19 content free to all readers during this crisis I’d like to zoom in today on the potential small-molecule therapies, since some of these have the most immediate prospects for use in the real world The ones at the front of the line are repurposed drugs that are already approved for human use, for a lot of obvious reasons The Biocentury list doesn’t cover these, but here’s an article at Nature Biotechnology that goes into detail Clinical trials are a huge time sink – they sort of have to be, in most cases, if they’re going to be any good – and if you’ve already done all that stuff it’s a huge leg up, even if the drug itself is not exactly a perfect fit for the disease So what do we have? The compound that is most advanced is probably remdesivir from Gilead, at right This has been in development for a few years as an RNA virus therapy – it was originally developed for Ebola, and has been tried out against a whole list of single-strand RNA viruses That includes the related coronaviruses SARS and MERS, so Covid-19 was an obvious fit The compound is a prodrug – that phosphoramide gets cleaved off completely, leaving the active 5-OH compound GS-44-1524 It mechanism of action is to get incorporated into viral RNA, since it’s taken up by RNA polymerase and it largely seems to evade proofreading This causes RNA termination trouble later on, since that alpha-nitrile C-nucleoside is not exactly what the virus is expecting in its genome at that point, and thus viral replication is inhibited

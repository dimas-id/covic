Corticosteroid use has been implicated in the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). The exact mechanism and predisposing factors such as age, gender, dosage, type and combination of steroid treatment remain controversial. Between March and July 2003, a total of 539 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were treated with five different types of steroid. There were 129 men (24%) and 410 women (76%) with a mean age of 33.7 years (21 to 59). Routine screening was undertaken with radiographs, MRI and/or CT to determine the incidence of ONFH. Of the 129 male patients with SARS, 51 (39.5%) were diagnosed as suffering from ONFH, compared with only 79 of 410 female patients (19.3%). The incidence of ONFH in the patients aged between 20 and 49 years was much higher than that of the group aged between 50 and 59 years (25.9% (127 of 491) versus 6.3% (3 of 48); p = 0.018). The incidence of ONFH in patients receiving one type of steroid was 12.5% (21 of 168), which was much lower than patients receiving two different types (28.6%; 96 of 336) or three different types of steroid (37.1%; 13 of 35).

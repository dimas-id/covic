BACKGROUND: Giant inguinal hernia(GIH), a rare disease, has brought great challenges to surgeons. GIH is defined as an inguinal hernia that extends below the midpoint of the inner thigh in standing position. However, a giant recurrent inguinal hernia resulting from previous operations that destroy the anatomical structure of the inguinal region is extremely rare. Nerve injury, a complication following inguinal hernia repair, is mostly found in ilioinguinal nerve and iliohypogastric nerve, which often presents as numbness and acute or chronic pain, while postoperative muscular dysfunction results from femoral nerve injury is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-years-old woman presented with a complaint of a reducible mass in the left inguinal of duration 1 year. The patient had three previous inguinal hernia repairs. Physical examination and auxiliary examination indicated a giant inguinal hernia with femoral nerve injury. After preoperative evaluation and preparation, a transabdominal partial extraperitoneal(TAPE) repair have performed. Finally, the patient recovered and was discharged. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we reported a rare case of a giant recurrent inguinal hernia with femoral nerve injury and made a successful treatment for the patient via transabdominal partial extraperitoneal(TAPE) repair.

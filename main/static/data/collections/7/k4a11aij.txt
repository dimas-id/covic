Abstract While more attention has been placed on scientific innovativeness and breakthroughs in the advanced countries’ attempt to contain the spread and develop vaccines for the Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19), little attention has been paid to the few but significant innovations being achieved in some African countries. This is understandable because the scientific capacity and research infrastructure of most African countries are deficient and weak compared to other regions of the world. Nevertheless, the African country of Ghana, despite its acute healthcare and scientific infrastructure deficit, is achieving some innovational and scientific breakthrough in the COVID-19 fight. Ghanaian scientist was among the first in Africa to successfully sequenced the genome of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The country’s laboratory leading the fight has also introduced some innovative testing methods allowing the country to test a far greater scale per million than the rest of Africa. Besides, drones are being used to deliver samples to the laboratory centers for testing. Local scientists and developers have also developed rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and solar-powered handwashing machines. This paper highlights Ghana’s innovativeness, scientific, and technological breakthroughs achieved so far in the fight against the pandemic.

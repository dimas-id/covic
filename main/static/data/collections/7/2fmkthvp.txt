The coronavirus disease 2019 represents an unprecedented threat to human health worldwide. In the absence of a specific available cure for this disease, countries are adopting mitigation strategies that largely depend on physical distancing, with a dramatic restriction of social contacts. Whereas the psychological burden related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is starting to be well characterized by population-based surveys, we would like to capitalize from infant research evidence about the potentials of psychological reparation for human trauma and disconnection. Reparation can be defined as the human ability to coregulate emotions and to resolve interactive mismatches and separations by reciprocally engaging in attuned interactive exchanges capable of expanding our capacities for resilience. Alongside economical and medical health solutions, investing in psychological, emotional, and affective reparatory acts is warranted to be a key component of the recovery strategies worldwide.

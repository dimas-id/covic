To control the spread of COVID-19 transmission, Indonesia government has broadcasted information about the pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the understanding of young people, about COVID-19 during the early outbreak in Indonesia. An online-based cross-sectional data collection was conducted from adolescents aged 10 to 25 years, based on 10 questions regarding general COVID-19 information. There were 355 subjects from 25 out of 34 Indonesian provinces who participated in the study, with mean age of 19.93 Â± 2.91 years. Better understanding was found in the female and higher-income population. Largely, the subjects got the information from social media, instead of the official government site for COVID-19. Lack of understanding about crucial preventive measures was found, such as handwashing and physical distancing. In conclusion, the participants have an overall moderate-good initial understanding toward COVID-19 during the early outbreak in Indonesia. These results can be used as baseline data for development of awareness measurement tools.

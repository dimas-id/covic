Evaluation of the antiviral activities of flowers, flower-peduncles, leaves, and roots of Aloe hijazensis against haemagglutinating viruses of avian paramyxovirus type-1 (APMV-1), avian influenza virus type A (AI-H5N1), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and egg-drop syndrome virus (EDSV) in specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryos were carried out. Extract of the flowers and leaves showed relatively higher activity than the extracts of other plant parts. Thirteen compounds were isolated from both the flowers and flower-peduncles of A. hijazensis. The isolated compounds were classified into: five anthraquinones; ziganein, ziganein-5-methyl ether, aloesaponarin I, chrysophanol, aloe-emodin, one dihydroisocoumarin; feralolide, four flavonoids; homoplantaginin, isoorientin, luteolin 7-glucuronopyranoside, isovitexin, one phenolic acid; p-coumaric acid, the anthrone; barbaloin together with aloenin. Eleven compounds were attributed to the flowers and seven to the flower-peduncles. Homoplantaginin and luteolin 7-glucuronopyranoside are reported here for the first time from Aloe spp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the chemical composition and biological activity of those plant parts.

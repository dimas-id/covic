Five active metal-conjugated inhibitors (PMA, TDT, EPDTC, JMF1586 and JMF1600) bound with the 3C-like protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus were analyzed crystallographically. The complex structures reveal two major inhibition modes: Hg(2+)-PMA is coordinated to C(44), M(49) and Y(54) with a square planar geometry at the S3 pocket, whereas each Zn(2+) of the four zinc-inhibitors is tetrahedrally coordinated to the H(41)â€“C(145) catalytic dyad. For anti-SARS drug design, this Zn(2+)-centered coordination pattern would serve as a starting platform for inhibitor optimization.

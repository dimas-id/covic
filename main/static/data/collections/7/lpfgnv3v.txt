BACKGROUND The objective of this article was to compare the outcomes of self-gripping mesh (GM) with sutured mesh (SM) in open inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis were taken to compare the outcomes of GM and SM in open inguinal hernia repair. RESULTS A total of 1,353 patients in 6 randomized controlled trials and 2 observational studies were reviewed (666 patients in GM group; 687 patients in SM group). The 2 groups did not significantly differ in chronic groin pain (P = .23) or recurrence (P = .59). The operating time was significantly shorter in GM group (P < .00001). There was no significant difference in infection (P = .18), seromas (P = .35), hematomas (P = .87), or discomfort (P = .58) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS The data showed that GM was equivalent to SM in open inguinal hernia repair. However, this new mesh still needs to be confirmed in large, multi-center, well-designed randomized controlled trials.

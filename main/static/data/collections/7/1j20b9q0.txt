Branched thoracic aortic aneurysm repair requires arterial access from above the diaphragm in order to insert the visceral branches. This is routinely performed from the subclavian, axillary or carotid arteries and less commonly direct thoracic aorta puncture. The left ventricular apex is an alternative access route which is commonly used for percutaneous aortic valve replacement and rarely used for EVAR, FEVAR and TEVAR access. Here we describe two patients for which the left ventricular apex was the most suitable available access to the visceral branches during a branched thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. This access should be considered as an alternative approach if conventional arterial access is not available.

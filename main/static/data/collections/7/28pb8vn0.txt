OBJECTIVE This study reports the feasibility of adopting a total endovascular approach for the treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) at a European aortic center and compares the short- and midterm results against those from large and multicenter studies. METHODS All patients treated endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) for juxta/pararenal AAAs or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), both elective and acute, as well as reoperations, from 2010 to 2015 were included. Treatment was fenestrated (FEVAR) or branched (BEVAR), and outcomes were analyzed for technical success and mortality at 30 and 90 days and by Kaplan-Meier curve estimates at 3 years. Outcomes on target vessels were reported as freedom from branch instability in the follow-up period. Reinterventions, endoleaks and perioperative and postoperative morbidities were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 71 patients were treated for juxta/pararenal AAA (n = 40) or TAAA (n = 31): 14 type II, 4 type III, and 13 type IV. There were 47 FEVAR (including 2 physician-modified fenestrated grafts) and 24 BEVAR procedures performed. Four TAAAs were ruptured. No open repairs were performed for these pathologies in this period. Mortality was 2.8% (n = 2) at 30 days and 9.9% at 90 days (n = 7). One late rupture occurred in a patient whose treatment was a technical failure. Survival at 3 years was 77.9% ± 5.6% overall, 90.9% ± 5.2% for juxta/pararenal AAAs, and 60.7% ± 10.3% for TAAAs. Graft deployment was successful in 69 of 71 patients. Revascularization was successful in 205 of 208 target vessels (98.6%): 51 of 51 superior mesenteric arteries, 27 of 27 celiac arteries, and 127 of 130 renal arteries. There were 131 fenestrated bridging stent grafts and 74 branched bridging stent grafts. Technical success was 68 of 71 (95.7%). There were nine cases of branch instability (5 BEVARs, 4 FEVARs) in five patients (7.0%). Seven vessels (5 renal arteries and 2 superior mesenteric arteries) underwent reintervention: 5 for stenoses, 1 for occlusion, and 1 for stent migration. Freedom from branch instability at 3 years was 92.7% ± 2.5% overall, 88.6% ± 6.4% for BEVAR, and 94.6% for FEVAR. CONCLUSIONS The short- and midterm results obtained here indicate that the benefits of a total endovascular treatment for complex aortic aneurysms, as demonstrated by large and multicenter studies, can be adapted and replicated at other centers with a dedicated aortic service. This may help guide future considerations of how to refer or treat this complex patient group.

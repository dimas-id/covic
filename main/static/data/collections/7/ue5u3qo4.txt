As seen in recent avian influenza outbreaks in Asia, prevention is the key to fighting infectious disease successfully. Efficient disease surveillance systems on the basis of molecular diagnostics will help monitor the emergence of viruses in the early stage and thus prompt containment measures can be in place to minimize disease spread. Here we describe and review molecular diagnostics focusing on nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) technology in detecting viruses causing animal diseases, such as avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, and Newcastle disease. NASBA offers high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and speed of availability of results, and NASBA would be the most applicable molecular diagnostics for disease surveillance and control.

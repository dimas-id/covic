INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak in France is disturbing our health system. Urologists in training who are already known to have burnout, are in the front line to face this disease. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young French urologists in training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire evaluating the pandemic added stress, and its negative impact on work and training quality, was e-mailed to the members of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF). The association includes all French junior and senior residents. The survey lasted 3 days. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was performed to identify the predictive factors. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five (55.5%) of the 495 AFUF members responded to the questionnaire. More than 90% of responders felt more stressed by the pandemic. Fellows and senior residents were more likely to feel that the crisis had an important impact on their work quality (OR=1.76, IC95=[1.01-3.13]), even more when COVID 19 patients were present in their department (OR=2.31, IC95=[1.20-4.65]). Past medical history of respiratory disease (OR=2.57, IC95=[1.31-5.98]) and taking in charge COVID19 patients (OR=1.85, IC95=[0.98-3.59]) were additional risk factors. CONCLUSION: COVID19 pandemic has a negative impact on young French urologists in training and on their work and training quality. Managing their psychosocial well-being during this time is as important as managing their physical health. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

Abstract During novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients usually present with several reports showing symptoms of severe systemic or respiratory illness and, although rare, some genital complaints such as scrotal discomfort can be seen. In the majority of patients, however, genital complaints seem not to be the initial or sole symptoms. In this article, we report an unusual presentation of a male case with severe external genital pain which was suspected to be the first clinical sign of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: To show how to safely perform nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs for 2019-novel coronavirus. METHODS: The video describes in detail the dressing and undressing procedures of health personnel, with the appropriate personal protective equipment. Technical notes for the execution of the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab are also provided to avoid sampling errors. RESULTS: The undressing phase is the procedure with the highest risk of self-contamination for the health worker. Following the various steps as shown in the video, there were no cases of contagion among the otolaryngology team appointed to perform the swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of safely performing nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs for identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.

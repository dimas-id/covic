Patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) frequently receive transfusions of blood products. While these therapies are often beneficial, they can be associated with significant, yet often overlooked, risks. Clinical guidelines for blood product transfusions must be well defined in order to prevent misuse of this limited resource. It is important for the intensivist to have a thorough understanding of the indications for specific blood products, and the transfusion needs of particular patient populations.

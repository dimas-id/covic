The aim of research was to analyze the results of microbiological tests for typical and atypical bacteria in patients with symptoms of chronic cough. A total of 214 outpatients aged from 2 to 94 years (110 women, 64 men, and 40 children) with chronic cough were studied. Four hundred twenty eight throat swabs were examined for atypical bacteria antigen (Chlamydophila pneumoniae) (n = 214) and typical pathogens (n = 214). Chl. pneumoniae detection was performed using indirect immunofluorescence test. Classical microbiological culture was used for typical bacteria detection. Chl. pneumoniae antigen was detected in 55/214 (26.0 %) patients with chronic cough (in 31 (28.2 %) women, 14 (21.9 %) men, and 10 (25.0 %) children). Positive culture for typical pathogens was observed in 30 (27.3 %) women, 22 (34.4 %) men, and 21 (52.5 %) children. Simultaneous occurrence of Chl. pneumoniae and typical pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus strain MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Moraxella catarrhalis) was found in 16 (7.5 %) patients. The findings show that in patients with chronic cough Chl. pneumoniae infection, although less than that with typical pathogens, is rather frequent. Further, the performance of test for Chl. pneumoniae in throat swabs from patients with chronic cough is good and provides an efficient way to diagnose the infection and implement appropriate therapy.

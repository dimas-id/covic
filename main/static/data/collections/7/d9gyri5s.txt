Gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 are associated with prolonged symptoms and increased severity. We employed human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC-HIOs) to analyze SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and to validate efficacy of specific drugs in the gut. Certain, but not all cell types in PSC-HIOs express SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2, rendering them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir, a promising drug to treat COVID-19, effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection of PSC-HIOs. In contrast, the histamine-2-blocker famotidine showed no effect. Thus, PSC-HIOs provide an interesting platform to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify or validate drugs.

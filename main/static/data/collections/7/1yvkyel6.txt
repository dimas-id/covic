The rapid developments of genomics and proteomics have driven the demand for multiplex and high throughput analysis of large numbers of biomolecules in the fields of medical diagnostics, drug discovery, and environmental monitoring. Encoding the biomolecular binding events is the key technique to fulfill this demand, in which microparticles play the most important roles. This review outlines the development of multiplex and high throughput biodetections, and highlights the most recent advances in the field of encoding microparticles, together with problems that need to be resolved.

Infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 produces acute hepatitis, encephalitis, and chronic demyelination in mice. However, little is known about a closely related strain, MHV-2, which is only weakly neurotropic. To better understand the molecular basis of neurotropism of MHVs, we compared the pathogenesis and genomic sequence of MHV-2 with that of MHV-A59. Intracerebral injection of MHV-2 into 4-week-old C57B1/6 mice produces acute meningitis and hepatitis without encephalitis or chronic inflammatory demyelination. Sequence comparison between MHV-2 and MHV-A59 reveals 94-98% sequence identity of the replicase gene, 83-95% sequence identity of genes 2a, 3, 5b, 6, and 7, and marked difference in the sequence of genes, 2b, 4, and 5a. This information provides the basis for further studies exploring the mechanism of viral neurotropism and virus-induced demyelination.

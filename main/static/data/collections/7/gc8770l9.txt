BACKGROUND: In June 2020, a large randomised controlled clinical trial in the UK found that dexamethasone was effective in reducing the number of deaths in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a patient with rapid worsening of COVID-19 pneumonia and its dramatic improvement under corticosteroids. DISCUSSION: Corticosteroids could be useful in patients with an inflammatory profile, considering that acute respiratory distress syndrome may be the consequence of cytokine storm syndrome. LEARNING POINTS: One of the main pathophysiological hypotheses for severe COVID-19 pneumonia is inappropriate immunological hyperactivation. Corticosteroid therapy may be useful in these patients.

â€”Corona virus is a virus capable of mutating very quickly and many other viruses that arise due to mutations of this virus. To find out the location of corona virus mutations of one type to another, DNA sequences can be aligned using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Corona virus data was taken from Genbank National Center for Biotechnology Information from 1985-1992. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a global alignment algorithm in which alignment is performed to all sequences with the complexity of O (mn) and is capable of producing optimal alignment. An important step in this reserach is the sequence alignment of two corona viruses using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Second, identification of the location of mutations from the DNA of the virus. The result of this reserach is an alignment and the location of mutations of both sequences. The results of identification DNA mutation can be used to find out other viruses mutation corona virus as well as can be used in the field of health as a reference for the manufacture of drugs for corona virus mutation outcome.

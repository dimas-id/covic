For more than a century, healthcare has been challenged to keep environmental surfaces clean to control microbes and improve patient outcomes. However despite an annual cost exceeding ten billion dollars cleaning with disinfection has done little to reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAI). This chapter will review the scientific evidence delineating the role that the environment and healthcare workers play in the acquisition and movement of the microbes implicated in HAI and how through controlling the microbial burden of the built clinical environment it is possible to mitigate the rate of HAI acquisition. Specifically evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of solid copper surfaces for its ability to continuously limit the concentration of bacteria found on surfaces and objects within the built environment will be reviewed in concert with a discussion of how through the mitigation of the environmental burden copper surfaces are able to concomitantly reduce the incidence of HAI. Insights provided by this chapter are intended to facilitate an understanding and importance of the need to use a comprehensive or systems based approach to fight healthcare associated infections.

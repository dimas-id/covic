Infections are considered nosocomial if they occur 48 hours or more after hospital admission or within 30 days after discharge. One third of these infections are considered preventable.

In this article, we will review the literature on preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infection, central line-associated blood stream infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) caused a pandemic that first discovered in Wuhan, China. While 10% of the patients have asymptomatic infection, 15–20% have lung involvement, 5–10% have multiple organ failure, and macrophage activation syndrome. Chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cancer are risk factors for mortality. Prognosis or optimal treatment strategy for renal transplant recipients in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. Besides fatal cases, there were also milder case reports. In addition, COVID-19 treatment and the maintenance immunosuppression strategy is still under debate. Antiviral therapies and drug interactions are special topics for these patients. To the best of our knowledge, favipiravir and anti-cytokine treatments have not been previously reported in a kidney transplant recipient with SARS-CoV-2 infection before. We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a kidney transplant recipient with fatal outcomes.

Abstract This chapter provides a comprehensive update about various technological developments in the field of biothreat agent detection. We have attempted to provide the reader with all the basic information starting with the culture considered as gold standard of diagnosis, immunological assays like the immunochromatographic test (ICT) which includes the lateral flow rapid strip test, flow through spot test and molecular assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time RT-PCR, isothermal gene amplification assays, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, etc. One major highlight of the chapter includes bio-monitoring and aerosol generation technologies. We have also provided information about the sensor technologies nanomaterials biosensors, various analytical techniques besides various instrumental technologies like mass spectroscopy and Raman chemical imaging. The last part of the chapter is devoted to some newer technologies like biodetectors where we have given details about those that are currently commercially available.

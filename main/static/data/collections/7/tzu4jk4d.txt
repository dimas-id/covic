Monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of several human diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory conditions and represent a new frontier for the treatment of infectious diseases. In the last decade, new methods have allowed the efficient interrogation of the human antibody repertoire from influenza immune individuals and the isolation of several monoclonal antibodies capable of dealing with the high variability of influenza viruses. Here, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the specificity, antiviral and immunological mechanisms of action and development into the clinic of broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies against influenza A and B viruses.

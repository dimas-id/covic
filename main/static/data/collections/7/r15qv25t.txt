The monopolar output receptacle on the Covidien ForceTriad electrosurgical generator is designed in such a way that users can unknowingly connect active accessories in the wrong orientation, disabling the system's coagulation function. The manufacturer is developing labeling for ForceTriad production units that depicts the proper orientation in which to connect the accessory during setup. Covidien is currently considering how it will address units already in the field.

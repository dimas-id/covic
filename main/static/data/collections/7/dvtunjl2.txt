The current morbidity of rib plating is due to the size of the incision required to perform an open procedure. We describe a minimally invasive laparoscopic approach to rib plating. A cadaver model was used to develop the surgical technique by performing both left and right posterior-lateral rib plating. A small incision was made over the auscultatory triangle. The potential working space is developed under the posterior shoulder girdle and the scapula. A table-based retractor was used to elevate the scapula and the muscles. Two separate ports were placed: one camera port and one working port. In three cadaver models, 12 rib fractures were plated and the surgical technique is described. This novel technique will likely allow for faster recovery and was especially useful in the subscapular space. Level of evidence II.

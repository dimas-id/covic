Novel 2019 coronavirus has created havoc across the globe since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and fast spreading potential. While we were able to identify the causative agent within a few days of the disease outbreak, several questions still remain unanswered. In this review, we discuss the extent of virus spread, current statistics, SARS-CoV-2 genome organization, comparison between the novel coronavirus and causative agents involved in previous outbreaks, ongoing clinical trials and myths associated with the virus. Lastly, we provide insights into the future perspectives which could prove useful for the scientific community as they work on finding the cure against the disease. IMPACT STATEMENT: Early availability of the sequence, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), has prompted efforts towards identifying a safe and effective vaccine in the current public health emergency. To that end, understanding the pathophysiology of disease is crucial for scientists around the world. Since conventional vaccine development and manufacturing may take several years, it is important to think about alternative strategies that we could use to mitigate imminent catastrophe. We hope that this article will open up new avenues and provide insights that could potentially save hundreds of lives affected by COVID-19.

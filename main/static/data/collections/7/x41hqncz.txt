INTRODUCTION Severe thromboembolism with complete occlusion of the proximal arteries during or after coil embolization can cause serious neurologic deficits. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of Solitaire AB device as a rescue therapy for severe thromboembolic complications in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2013 and April 2016, 1047 intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular procedures were retrospectively reviewed in our center. Severe thromboembolisms occurred in ten patients and were treated by Solitaire AB device including clot retriever and permanent stent deployment. RESULTS The location of arterial occlusion was distal to the aneurysm rather than the coil/parent artery interface or in-stent area. Four patients had distal thromboembolic events before coil embolization, and six patients had it after coiling. The complete arterial recanalization (TICI 3) was achieved in all patients, and no cerebral hemorrhage was related to the procedure after the rescue therapy. Among these patients with the aforementioned neurovascular procedures, the mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score was 4.5 (ranging 3-5) and eight cases had good outcome with a score of GOS 4-5 at discharge, while eight patients presented mRS â‰¤2 at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that mechanical recanalization using Solitaire AB device seems to be effective and safe as a rescue therapy for severe thromboembolic events during cerebral aneurysm embolization.

BACKGROUND The incidence of infertility caused by the mesh inguinal hernia repair is not known. The aim of this study was to determine circulation and immunological testicular disorders after inguinal hernia mesh repair which can be related with infertility. METHODS From February 2010 to December 2010, 43 male patients who underwent inguinal hernia mesh repair were included in a prospective study. Testicular, capsular and intratesticular arterial flow dynamics were measured by Color Doppler ultrasound before the operation, in early and late postoperative period. The antisperm antibodies were analyzed before hernia repair and 5 months after. RESULTS The difference between patients who underwent laparoscopic (Group I) and anterior open tension-free hernia repair (Group II) in age, duration of symptoms and hernia characteristics were not significant. Statistically significant differences were found in peak-systolic and end-diastolic velocity in testicular and intratesticular arteries in Group II and in peak-systolic velocity on all levels in Group I. Only Group I had significant differences in resistive index of intratesticular arteries. All the values returned to basal in late postoperative period except testicular peak-systolic velocity in Group I which stayed in normal range. Wilcox matched pair test showed significant difference between preoperative and late postoperative measurements of the antisperm antibodies only in Group II, but it was within normal range in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Inguinal hernia mesh repair do not have clinically significant influence on testicular flow and immunological response.

The introduction of immunologic techniques for rapid viral diagnosis and the availability of high quality commercial reagents have resulted in significant advances in the laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. Laboratories just beginning in the area of diagnostic virology are advised to direct their efforts at viral isolation using cell types such as human embryonic kidney; immunofluorescence and other techniques of rapid viral diagnosis are recommended when the laboratory is prepared to expand.

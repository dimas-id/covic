This prospective randomized study compared single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with respect to estimated blood loss, operative time, postoperative pain levels, and complications. Thirty-four study patients were divided into 2 groups: 17 patients underwent SILC and 17 underwent LC. Operative time was longer for SILC than for LC, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the relationship of body mass index with operative time between SILC and LC (P=0.613, P=0.983, respectively). The 2 groups had no statistically significant differences with respect to visual analog scale scores, estimated blood loss, shoulder pain, or complications (P>0.05). SILC can be the treatment of choice for gallbladder disease. Although the surgeon's first several attempts at SILC require a longer operative time compared with LC, there are no differences in hospital length of stay, blood loss, complication rates, or pain scores between SILC and LC.

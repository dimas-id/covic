OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the reparative role of hyaluronic acid in acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). PATIENTS AND METHODS 48 patients affected by ARS were submitted to nasal endoscopy, nasal cytology, mucociliary transport evaluation (MCTt) and visual analogue scale questionnaire (VAS) at T0, after 14-18 days (T1) and after 30-35 days (T2). The patients were randomized into two groups, A and B, and received Levofloxacin and Prednisone. Moreover, using a nebulizer ampoule for nasal douche, Group A received high molecular weight Sodium Hyaluronate (3%) plus saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) twice a day for 30 days; Group B received saline solution twice a day for 30 days. RESULTS At T0 only the VAS score showed differences regarding nasal discharge and post-nasal drip. At T1, in Group A MCTt and the number of bacteria were significantly lower than in Group B. The VAS score showed improvement in Group A. At T2 in Group A, MCTt and number of neutrophils were significantly lower than in Group B. The VAS score showed statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding nasal discharge. CONCLUSIONS In ARS patients sodium hyaluronate plus saline solution significantly improved symptoms, MCT time and reduced neutrophil count on nasal cytology.

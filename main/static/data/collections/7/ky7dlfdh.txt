A 51-year-old male presented with 2 weeks of hemoptysis. Pulmonary angiography was performed and identified a bronchial artery to pulmonary artery fistula of the right upper lobe. Despite angioembolization, the hemoptysis recurred 1 year later. It was hypothesized that the recurrence occurred due to retrograde filling from the pulmonary arterial side of the abnormality. Right upper lobectomy was performed and resulted in resolution of hemoptysis. We present a case report of a rare, congenital bronchial artery to pulmonary artery fistula.

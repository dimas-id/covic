The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic in early 2020. The infection has been associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms. In the severely affected patients, it has caused dysregulation of immune responses including over-secretion of inflammatory cytokines and imbalances in the proportion of na√Øve helper T cells, memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells. Identification of the underlying mechanism of such aberrant function of immune system would help in the prediction of disease course and selection of susceptible patients for more intensive cares. In the current review, we summarize the results of studies which reported alterations in cytokine levels and immune cell functions in patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.

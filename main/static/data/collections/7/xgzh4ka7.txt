The pharmacokinetics of intramuscularly administered ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) were determined in pigs that were clinically healthy (n = 8), vaccinated with a Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome modified live virus (PRRS MLV) (n = 10), challenged with wild-type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) VR-2385 (n = 10), or vaccinated with PRRS MLV and later challenged with wild-type PRRSv VR-2385 (n = 10). Animals were given a single dose of CCFA intramuscularly at 5 mg/kg body weight. Blood was collected at 0 (pretreatment), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240 h postinjection. Plasma was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma concentration-time curves for each group were evaluated with noncompartmental modeling. When compared to control animals, those receiving the PRRSv wild-type challenge only had a lower AUC0-last , higher Cl/F, and higher Vz/F. The PRRSv wild-type challenge only group had the longest T1/2Î» . The Cmax did not differ among all four treatments. Control animals had no statistically significant differences from animals vaccinated with PRRS MLV alone or animals vaccinated with PRRS MLV and later challenged with wild-type PRRSv. Our results suggest that PRRSv wild-type infection has the potential to alter CCFA pharmacokinetics and PRRS MLV vaccination may attenuate those changes.

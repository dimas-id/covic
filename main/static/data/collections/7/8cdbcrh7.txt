The nonstructural proteins (nsPs) of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are expressed as one or two polyprotein precursors, which are translated directly from the viral genomic RNA. Mature nsPs are generated by precise processing of these polyproteins. Both the precursors and mature nsPs are essential for CHIKV replication. Similar to other alphaviruses, CHIKV nsPs not only perform virus RNA replication but are also crucial for other activities essential for virus infection and pathogenesis. Thus far the best-studied CHIKV ns-protein is nsP2, for which protease, NTPase, RNA triphosphatase, and RNA helicase activities have been demonstrated. In addition, nsP2 is crucial for shut-off of host cell transcription and translation and it counteracts cellular antiviral responses. Compared to their homologues from the well-studied Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses, CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and nsP4 have been subjected to only few studies. Nevertheless, there are strong indirect pieces of evidence indicating that these CHIKV proteins have the same enzymatic activities as their counterparts in the other alphaviruses. Information concerning the specific interaction of CHIKV nsPs with host components is beginning to emerge. All the nsPs are involved in the functioning of membrane-bound replication complexes also called spherules, but the finer details of the structure and assembly of these complexes are currently poorly understood.

Summary Ongoing healthcare system reform is one of the most important issues in China. There is an increasing awareness that public health education should be reformed to meet the demands of public health practice. This paper summarizes the current status of increasing public healthcare demand and public health service capacity in China, especially in less-developed provinces, and introduces the current public health educational system and public health administration structure. The paper also provides evidence for a considerable gap between public health education and practice, and suggests possible measures to bridge the gap.

BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) splenectomy which is performed on small number of patients, has been introduced with better cosmetic outcome, less postoperative pain, greater patient satisfaction and faster recovery compared to standard laparoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty six patients were included in the study comparing standard laparoscopic splenectomy (LS, 17 patients) transumbilical multiport splenectomy performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments (TUMP-LS, 19 patients). Two groups of patients were compared retrospectively by means of operation time, intra- and postoperative blood loss, perioperative complications, packed red cell and platelet requirements, lenght of hospitalization, pain scores and patient satisfaction. RESULTS There was no mortality in any of the groups, and no significant differences determined in operative time (P = 0,069), intraoperative blood loss (P = 0,641), patient satisfaction (P = 0,506), pain scores (P = 0,173) and the average length of hospital stay (P = 0,257). Umbilical incisions healed uneventfully and no hernia formation or wound infection was observed during follow-up period (2-34 months). There were no conversions to open surgery. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical multiport splenectomy performed with the conventional laparoscopic instruments is feasible and could be a logical alternative to classical laparoscopic splenectomy by combining the advantages of single access techniques and standard laparoscopy.

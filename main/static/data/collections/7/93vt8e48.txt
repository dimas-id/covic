Abstract A number of new virus isolates from finfish have been reported in the scientific literature during the past five years. These include nine aquareoviruses, eight picornaviruses, six iridoviruses, five herpesviruses, three rhabdoviruses, three retroviruses, a paramyxovirus, and a coronavirus. Not all of these agents have been isolated in cell culture or established as etiologic agents of disease by controlled transmission studies. The burgeoning number of fish viruses is a reflection of the increased interest in fish diseases, particularly those occurring in aquaculture facilities, and the number will surely grow as fish farming intensifies on a global scale. This review chronicles the new virus isolates and lists them with other members of their virus family where appropriate.

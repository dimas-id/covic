Abstract Fleximers, a novel type of flexible nucleoside that have garnered attention due to their unprecedented activity against human coronaviruses, have now exhibited highly promising levels of activity against filoviruses. The Flex-nucleoside was the most potent against recombinant Ebola virus in Huh7 cells with an EC50 =2μM, while the McGuigan prodrug was most active against Sudan virus-infected HeLa cells with an EC50 of 7μM.

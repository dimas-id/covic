Abstract Aim To approach the effects of luteolin on proliferation of rat lung fibroblasts. Methods The lung fibroblasts were isolated from the lungs of Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day 3, and were then passaged to 96-well culture plates. All cells were divide into 6 groups including normal control group, positive control group, 4×10 time, the cytomorphology of LFb, drew growth curve, determined superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were observed. Results Luteolin at the concentration of 4×10−4, 4×10−5 mol·L−1 inhibited evidently the growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts, and enhanced SOD activity. The density, interval and volume of lung fibroblasts became decrescent. The effects, dose-dependently, had obvious statistical significance compared with normal control group. Conclusion Luteolin can inhibit the proliferation of the lung fibroblasts in rat.

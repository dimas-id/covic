We developed a new system for detection of viral nucleic acids because rapid detection of pathogens is necessary to prevent potential outbreaks of infectious diseases. This system, named rapid determination of viral RNA sequences (RDV), involves whole-genome amplification and a new direct sequencing technique. Using the RDV system, it is possible to obtain viral nucleic acid sequences within 2 days. The nucleic acid sequences of SARS-CoV and West Nile virus, which represent emerging and re-emerging infectious viruses, were determined from infectious viral culture supernatant by the RDV method. We demonstrated the clinical application of this system in human specimens and its diagnostic usage in mosquitoes. Furthermore, new adenovirus and herpesvirus were found in bats using the RDV method.

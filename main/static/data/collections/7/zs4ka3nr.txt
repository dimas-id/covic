OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in terms of weight loss, metabolic parameters, and postoperative complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a diagnosis of morbid obesity between January 2012 and June 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were compared in terms of age, sex, body mass index, duration of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, and long term follow-up results. RESULTS During the study period, 91 patients (45 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 46 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) underwent bariatric surgery. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of preoperative patient characteristics. Both groups showed statistically significant weight loss and improvement in co-morbidities when compared with the preoperative period. Weight loss and improvement in metabolic parameters were similar in both groups. The duration of operation and hospital stay was longer in the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group. Furthermore, the rate of total complications was significantly lower in the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective method with a significantly lower complication rate and length of hospital stay than laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with similar improvement rates in metabolic syndrome.

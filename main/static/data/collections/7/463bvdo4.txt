The three-dimensional digitization of the cultural heritage objects during different stages of the conservation process is an important tool for objective documentation. Further data analysis is also important to monitor, estimate and understand any possible change as accurately as possible. In this work, the cultural heritage (CH) objects were selected for 3D scanning, analysis and visualisation of the change or degradation on their surface over time. The main goal of this work is to develop analysis, and visualization methods for CH object to assess local change in their surface geometry to support conservation processes documentation. The analysis was based on geometrical analysis of change in global distance between before and after chemical cleaning for a chosen object. The new local neighborhood distance histogram has been proposed as a local measure of surface change based on optimized k-neighborhood search algorithm to assess the local geometry change of a focus point.

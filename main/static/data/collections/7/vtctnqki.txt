This paper reports a chemico-enzymatic synthesis of β-CD derivatives. The recognition properties of these derivativeswere tested using flocculating yeast and isolated lectins. It was observed that the substitution of β-cyclodextrins with galactose end arms induces the better recognition by a cell-linked galactose-specific lectin. The physicochemical effects of the β-CD derivatives on membranes were estimated using red blood cells and the effects on the viability of yeast and human rectal tumor cells were appreciated by measuring the mitochondrial deshydrogenase activity. The substitutions of the β-CD ring by sugar antennae decrease the negative physicochemical effects of the β-CD, ie their, hemolytic properties. However, these substitutions induce significant modifications of the biological properties of the molecules, particularly the cytotoxicity and the growth of eukaryotic cells.

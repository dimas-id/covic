OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to define the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes of laparoscopic adrenalectomy. METHOD A total of 172 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. The patients were divided into 3 groups: group I, normal weight; group II, overweight; and group III, obesity. Perioperative outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS The median operative time was 72, 75, and 90 minutes in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The median blood loss was <50 mL in all groups. There were no intraoperative blood transfusions. There was no statistical difference in the rate of intraoperative incidences and postoperative complications. Moderately increased operative time was the only perioperative parameter that statistically differed from nonobese patients. The regression analysis found significant but weak correlation between BMI and operative time. The BMI did not correlate with other surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adrenal surgery for obese patients can be done as safely as for nonobese patients.

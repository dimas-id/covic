This chapter illustrates parallels and similarities between the interplay that links and shapes the four internal dimensions, and the interaction between individuals (micro-level), their close environment, including the institutions they work in (meso), society (macro) and the planet (meta). This perspective is applied to the working of humanitarian organizations with an overview of options for using this logic to optimize the full potential that is inherent to the mandate of these institutions. It is shown how the proposed paradigm shift can be started, expanded and maintained, from individuals to institutions and vice versa. The outline of Compassion for Change (C4C) proposes a concrete way for using the paradigm-shift that this book is based up to transform the internal culture of humanitarian and development organizations in order to reanimate and expand their external influence.

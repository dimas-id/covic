Objective@#To investigate the CT and clinical features of 2019 novel coronavirus (NCP) pneumonia.@*Methods@#Chest CT and clinical data of confirmed 103 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in January 2020, retrospectively. According to diagnosis and treatment of NCP infected pneumonia (trial version 5), all the patients were classified into mild(n=58), severe (n=36) and very severe (n=9) type, and their clinical findings, laboratory examination and CT finding were analyzed. CT features included lesions’ distribution, location, size, shape, edge, number, density, percentage of pneumonia lesions of the whole lung and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The CT features of different clinical subtypes were compared using &#x03C7;2test or Fisher&apos;s exact probability. Comparisons between the percentage of pneumonic lesions to total lung volume were computed by using analysis of variance (normal distribution) or Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (non-normal distribution).@*Results@#In terms of clinical manifestations, the patients with severe NCP were more common in elderly men, with a median age of 65 years. Fever was the first symptom in 49 (84%) of 58 patients with NCP, and fever was the first symptom in both severe and critical NCP patients. The incidence of cough in severe (25 / 36, 69%) and critical (6 /9, 67%) NCP patients was higher than that in general (20 /58, 34%). All critical patients have dyspnea. In terms of CT findings, common NCP showed double lung (40/58,71%) multiple (40 / 58,69%) ground glass (31/58,52%) or mixed (25 / 58,43%) lesions (56 / 58,97%); severe and critical NCP showed double lung lesions, heavy NCP mainly showed multiple (34 / 36,96%) patches (33 / 36,92%) mixed density lesions (26 / 36,72%); 9 severe NCP lesions were more than 3 cm Mixed density lesions. The percentage of pneumonia focus in the whole lung volume: the common type (12.5% ± 6.1%) was significantly lower than the severe type (25.9% ± 10.7%) and the critical type (47.2% ± 19.2%) NCP, the difference was statistically significant (P values were &lt; 0.001 and 0.002 respectively), and the severe type NCP was also significantly lower than the critical type (P = 0.032).@*Conclusions@#CT and clinical features of different clinical types of NCP pneumonia are different. Chest CT findings have unique characteristic, which can not only make early diagnosis, but also evaluate its clinical course and severity.

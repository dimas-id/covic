Measures to reduce the impact of COVID19 require a mix of logistic, political and social capacity. Depending on the country, different capacities to increase of hospitalization or to properly apply lockdowns are observed. In order to better understand the impact of these measures we have developed a compartmental model which, on the one hand allows to calibrate the reduction of movement of people within and among different areas, and on the other hand it incorporates a hospitalization dynamics that differentiates the available kinds of treatment that infected people can receive. By bounding the hospitalization capacity, we are able to study in detail the interplay between mobility and hospitalization capacity.

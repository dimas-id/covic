Non-compliance with treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) by an individual can put the community at risk of transmission of TB. Public health (detention) orders can be issued to detain non-compliant individuals, but this is a last resort and rarely used. Two recent cases in New South Wales illustrate the process of issuing a public health order in NSW, and some of the issues that may arise. The NSW law can also be applied to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or HIV/AIDS. The other states and territories have similar laws, which often apply to a broader range of diseases and have fewer limits on issuing and extending orders.

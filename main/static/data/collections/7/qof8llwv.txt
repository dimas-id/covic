Significant efforts have been conducted to improve access to Mental Health Services (MHS) and reduce the burden of Mental Health Disorders (MHD) in Low-to Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). However, important challenges to accessing MHS still exist and limit improvements. Telemental Health (TMH), a modality that delivers remote MHS provides an ideal solution to complement existing efforts; however, there are limited reports on its implementation in developing countries such as Lebanon. This study presents the first roadmap for TMH applicability in Lebanon, with a focus on the Primary Health Care (PHC) setting, which has international relevance. We review existing guidelines and contextualise them to the Lebanese setting by addressing essential components for implementation. In specific, we shed light on 6 aspects: (1) patient population, (2) technological guidelines, (3) clinical guidelines, (4) administrative guidelines, (5) workforce, and (6) monitoring and evaluation. In addition, we acknowledge the important role of governmental efforts in setting the infrastructural and regulatory aspects for TMH practice. We provide guidance for public health professionals, government officials, and clinicians looking to adopt TMH practice in Lebanon or other countries with similar development and cultural landscapes.

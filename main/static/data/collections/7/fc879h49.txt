The Public Health Agency of Sweden has analysed how many pregnant and postpartum women with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have been treated in intensive care units (ICU) in Sweden between the March 19 and April 20, 2020, compared with non‐pregnant women of similar age. Cases were identified in a special reporting module within the Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR). Fifty‐three women aged 20‐45 years with SARS‐CoV‐2 were reported in SIR, and thirteen (n=13) of these women were either pregnant or postpartum (<1 week). The results indicate that the risk of being admitted to ICU may be higher in pregnant and postpartum women with laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 in Sweden, compared to non‐pregnant women of similar age.

Bats are the natural reservoir of Coronaviruses (CoVs). Human CoVs cause mild respiratory diseases worldwide, but, in the last decade, two Beta-CoVs [Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome] caused thousands of deaths and cases worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the evolutionary origin of mammalian CoVs is derived from bats. In this study, we characterized three Alpha-CoVs and two Beta-CoVs demonstrating the circulation of bat strains in Italy. Isolates were sequenced using a next-generation sequencing approach and genomes reconstructed using the online tool Galaxy Aries. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA7 and MrBayes. Similarity plots were generated using SSE v1.2. The structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein was predicted by sequence-homology method using the protein data bank. Bioinformatics analysis permitted the identification of 2 Beta-CoV complete genomes of 30 kb and three Alpha-CoV of 28 kb (named BatCoV-ITA1-5). BatCoV-ITA1 and 2 formed a monophyletic group with MERS-CoV sequences. The comparison of the concatenated domains within ORF1ab confirmed their classification into the MERS-CoV species. The 3D structure of RBD of Italian strains showed two amino acid deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD. BatCoV-Ita3 and BatCoV-Ita4/5 were classified into two novel Alpha-CoV species by comparison of concatenated domains within ORF1ab. Due to the high divergence with the Alpha human spike protein strains, it was impossible to establish the protein structure and the potential affinity to human receptor. The Italian strains showed the typical organization of Alpha and Beta-CoVs. We reported two Beta-CoVs closely related to MERS-CoVs from bats belonging to common Italian species (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii). The analysis of the RBD in the spike protein indicates significant differences from human RBD known to date. The three Alpha-CoV strains were classified into two novel species, confirming the high heterogeneity of CoV strains in bats. Although the studies conducted cannot confirm a risk for humans, surveillance studies are needed to investigate the genetic diversity of CoVs in bats. Because this exceeds what is known for other hosts, it is compatible with bats being the major reservoir of mammalian CoVs.

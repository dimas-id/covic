A 52-year-old woman with no medical history was admitted on March 18, 2020, presenting since 3 days asthenia, abdominal pain, and dry cough but no fever. Adenomegalies, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and elevated LDH suggested mature lymphoproliferation. Considering the current health context, an RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was performed and found to be positive. Early chest CT showed no sign of pulmonary infection but multiple adenomegalies. An (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed 5 days later to assess the extent of the hemopathy revealed the apparition of FDG-avid bilateral ground glass and subpleural curvilinear opacities suggesting COVID-19â€“associated pneumopathy.

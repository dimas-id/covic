Pneumonia may be complicated by necrosis and destruction of lung tissue due to factors related to both pathogen and host as well as to their interactions. Lung necrosis may lead to two main entities sharing common features, but also several clinical and pathological differences: lung abscesses and necrotizing pneumonia. Necrotizing pneumonia is characterized by diffuse, possibly bilateral, lung parenchyma inflammation with multiple cavitations and necrosis. Necrotizing pneumonia is usually associated with severe sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Adequate antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, pleural drainage, and prolonged supportive care are mandatory. Adult patients with necrotizing pneumonia may require surgery. In our practice, indications for surgery are: (1) uncontrolled sepsis in spite of medical therapy and chest drainage; (2) major air leaks responsible for ventilation difficulties with serious hypoxemia/hypercapnia; and (3) hemodynamic disturbances by compression of vena cava and/or right heart cavities by tumor-like forms. Surgical treatment should be adapted to each case. Despite serious morbidity, massive parenchyma damage and prolonged hospitalization, long-term outcome following necrotizing pneumonia seems good when multidisciplinary care management is used in these patients with unusual but severe respiratory infectious disease.

INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic surgery through a single port is an evolution of laparoscopic surgery, possible after recent technological development of new access systems. It is an established minimally invasive technique, although its indications in the field of Urology are currently under development. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present the first case of incision-less pyelolithectomy, performed through a single-port placed in the umbilicus, performed in a 47 years-old male patient (38.2 BMI) with solitary 4 cm diameter lithiasis in a horseshoe kidney. An umbilical 2.5 cm incision was used for the introduction of a prototype of the reusable Richard Wolf single-port system, without any ancillary elements. RESULTS After placement of left double-J stent proximal left ureter and renal pelvis, pyelolithectomy and pyelorraphy were performed with DuoRotate-InstrumentsÂ© (Richard Wolf). Water-tightness was demostrated with methylene blue intravesical instillation and no drain was placed. The procedure lasted for 280 min and bleeding was 30 cc. The patient was discharged 24 hours later without pain. CONCLUSION Incision-less pyelolithectomy is a feasible and resolutive option to treat pelvic lithiasis. It can be considered the most beneficial option in aesthetical terms in experienced centers, especially in peculiar cases like horseshoe kidney.

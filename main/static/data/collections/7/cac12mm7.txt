Hypothalamic obesity is a potential sequela of craniopharyngioma, arising from hypothalamic damage inflicted by either the tumor and/or its treatment. The marked weight gain that characterizes this disorder appears to result from impaired sympathoadrenal activation, parasympathetic dysregulation, and other hormonal and hypothalamic disturbances that upset the balance between energy intake and expenditure. Given hypopituitarism is commonly present, careful management of hormonal deficits is important for weight control in these patients. In addition, diet, exercise, and pharmacotherapy aimed at augmenting sympathetic output, controlling hyperinsulinism, and promoting weight loss have been used to treat this disease, but these measures rarely lead to sustained weight loss. While surgical interventions have not routinely been pursued, emerging data suggests that surgical weight loss interventions including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can be safely and effectively used for the management of hypothalamic obesity in patients with craniopharyngioma.

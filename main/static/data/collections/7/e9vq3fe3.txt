The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.

OBJECTIVE Existing simulators for off-pump coronary artery (CA) bypass grafting training are unable to provide cardiac surgery residents all necessary skills they need entering the operation room. In this study, we introduced a secure and high-fidelity live animal model to supplement the in vitro simulators for off-pump CA bypass grafting training. DESIGN The left internal thoracic artery (ITA) of 3 Chinese miniature pigs was grafted to the left anterior descending CA using an end-to-side anastomosis. The free segment of the ITA was fixed on the ventricle surface, making it a simulative CA beating in synchrony with the heart. A total of 6 to 8 training anastomoses were made on each ITA. SETTING Animal Experiment Center in Fuwai Hospital. PARTICIPANTS In total, 19 resident surgeons with at least 3 years of cardiac surgery work experience were trained using the new model. Their performances were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS Simulative coronary arteries were successfully constructed in all 3 animals with no adverse event observed. A total of 19 anastomoses were then completed, 1 pig of 7 anastomoses and the other 2 animals of 6 anastomoses. Time consumption for the anastomosis was 782 Â± 107 seconds. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 10/19 procedures. The most frequency site (7/10) was at the toe of the anastomosis. Further, the most common cause was uneven spacing or small margin of the stitches or both. Emergencies occurred during the training process included hypotension (7 procedures), tachyarrhythmia (4 procedures), and low blood oxygen saturation (1 procedure). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of our new live pig model in training resident surgeons. The simulative arteries can be easily accomplished and were long enough to place at least 6 anastomoses. Both on lumen diameter and motion status, they were proven to be a good substitution of the CA.

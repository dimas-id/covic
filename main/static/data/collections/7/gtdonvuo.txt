AIM To access the incidence and predictive factors of incisional hernia after single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). METHODS Eighty-two consecutive patients operated on for uncomplicated cholelithiasis between 2009 and 2013 were eligible for the study. Clinical outcome was assessed by a combination of case notes review, office consultation and telephone interview. Long-term incisional hernia rate was the major outcome of the study. Secondary outcome was the evaluation of predictive factors. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed using the following variables: age, gender, ASA score, BMI, risk, or comorbidity factors and surgical site infection. RESULTS Six patients (7 %) were lost to follow-up after the 1-month office visit and excluded. The study group consisted of 16 men and 60 women with a median age of 42 years (range 18-69) and a BMI of 25 (range 19-34). Eight patients had risk or comorbidity factors, 46 were classified ASA I, and 30 ASA II. Early postoperative course was uneventful in all cases but two patients developed a superficial wound abscess after hospital discharge. With a median follow-up of 44 months (range 12-72), incisional hernia was noted in six patients (7.9 %). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that age (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00-1.16, p < 0.038) and BMI (OR 1.37, 95 % CI 1.03-1.82, p < 0.029) were independent predictive factors of developing an incisional hernia. The incidence of hernia was, respectively, 15 % in patients with an age ≥ 50 and 33 % in patients with a BMI ≥ 30. CONCLUSION After SILC, we noted an incisional hernia rate of 8 %. To decrease the risk of developing that specific complication, SILC should only be proposed to young and non-obese patients.

Backgroung: Coronaviruses (CoV) make up a large family of viruses, known since the mid-1960s, which received this name due to the spikes on its surface, which resemble a crown (from the Latin corona). CoV infections can cause everything from a common cold to severe respiratory syndromes, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) is a new variant of the coronavirus, and its isolation occurred in China on January 7th, 2020. COVID-19 has stood out with a high impact on public health due to the high number of cases with infection in a short period of time. However, it is possible to observe that 17% of patients confirmed with COVID-19 have severe infections and about 2.5% of these patients die. Current studies have shown that the number of mild and asymptomatic cases may be even greater. Thus, the challenges for controlling unreported cases of patients with mild symptoms that are spreading the virus and interfering with the magnitude and real data of the cases stand out. The transmission of the coronavirus occurs between humans, and it can occur from person to person through the air, through coughing or sneezing, by touching or shaking hands or by contact with contaminated objects or surfaces, followed by contact with the mouth, nose or eyes. Given the fluctuation in the incidence and the lethality rate, it is essential to stand out the precepts of health promotion in search of reorienting hygiene practices, considering that there is validity in health care models, still with a curative approach and the current situation experienced by the world population requires a preventive stance.(AU)

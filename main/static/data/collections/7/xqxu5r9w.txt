Abstract Antigenic variation among murine coronaviruses is associated primarily with the surface peplomer protein E2 (180,000 Dal. E2 is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell, MHV-induced cell fusion, and eliciting neutralizing antibody. We report here the molecular mimicry between E2 and Fc γ receptor (FcγR). Molecular mimicry between E2 and FcyR may allow the escape of virus-infected cells from destruction by immunological mechanisms. Rabbit IgG, monoclonal rat IgG1 and IgG2b, monoclonal mouse IgG2a and IgG2b, and the rat anti-mouse FcγR monoclonal antibody 2.4132 immunoprecipitated from MHV-JHM-infected cells a polypeptide with a molecular mass identical to that immunoprecipitated by anti-E2 antibodies. F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit IgG did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from MHV-infected cells. All of these antibodies did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from uninfected cells. The anti-mouse FcyR monoclonal antibody 2.4132 immunoprecipitated from MHV-JHM-, MHV-3-, or MHV-A59-infected L-2 cells and 17CL-1 cells, or MHV-JHM-infected cultures of neonatal BALB/c brain cells, a protein with a molecular weight identical to that of MHV-JHM E2. The anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody did not immunoprecipitate any proteins from uninfected cells. Furthermore, the 2.4132 monoclonal antibody (mab), unrelated rat and mouse monoclonal antibodies, and a goat antiserum against E2, but not normal goat serum, immunoprecipitated a 75,000- to 77,000-Da molecule from uninfected WEHI-3 cells, a FcγR bearing cell line. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that the protein immunoprecipitated by the anti-FcγR mab from MHV-JHM-infected cells is the E2 glycoprotein: (1) Partial proteolytic maps obtained by Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease treatment of the 180,000-Da proteins immunoprecipitated by the anti FcγR mab and the anti-E2 mab were identical. (2) Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments from MHV-JHM-infected cells revealed that the same polypeptide chain was recognized by the anti-E2 mab and by the anti-FcγR mab 2.41G2. (3) Actinomycin D did not influence the induction and expression of the 180,000-Da polypeptide chain that was immunoprecipitated by the anti-FcγR mab, demonstrating that this protein is of viral origin.

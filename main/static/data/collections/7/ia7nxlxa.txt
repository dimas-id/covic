INTRODUCTION Single incision transumbilical laparoscopic procedures are the next step in development of minimally invasive surgery. Recent studies prove that the new technique can be a safe alternative to multiport laparoscopy; therefore it is becoming more and more popular. AIM We present our preliminary experience with single incision laparoscopy of the spleen. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyse a group of 9 patients (7 women and 2 men) in whom we attempted single incision laparoscopic surgery of the spleen. RESULTS Single incision laparoscopy was successful in all patients - in 7 of them we performed splenectomy and in 2 unroofing of the splenic cyst. Additionally, in 3 patients we performed concomitant cholecystectomy. The operative technique was identical to multiport procedures. One patient required reoperation due to intra-abdominal bleeding from the wound on the first postoperative day. In one patient due to superficial injury of the stomach wall continuous suture was used to prevent perforation. In our opinion these complications are not the result of the new technique. CONCLUSIONS The described technique can become a safe alternative to multiport laparoscopy. It is a reasonable alternative in young patients to whom an excellent cosmetic effect is particularly important because until now it is the only documented advantage of this surgical technique.

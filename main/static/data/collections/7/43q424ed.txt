Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral illness of wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals. The causative agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), replicates rapidly, efficiently disseminating within the infected host and being passed on to susceptible animals via direct contact or the aerosol route. To survive in the host, FMDV has evolved to block the host interferon (IFN) response. Previously, we and others demonstrated that the leader proteinase (L(pro)) of FMDV is an IFN antagonist. Here, we report that another FMDV-encoded proteinase, 3C(pro), also inhibits IFN-α/β response and the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Acting in a proteasome- and caspase-independent manner, the 3C(pro) of FMDV proteolytically cleaved nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO), a bridging adaptor protein essential for activating both NF-κB and interferon-regulatory factor signaling pathways. 3C(pro) specifically targeted NEMO at the Gln 383 residue, cleaving off the C-terminal zinc finger domain from the protein. This cleavage impaired the ability of NEMO to activate downstream IFN production and to act as a signaling adaptor of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway. Mutations specifically disrupting the cysteine protease activity of 3C(pro) abrogated NEMO cleavage and the inhibition of IFN induction. Collectively, our data identify NEMO as a substrate for FMDV 3C(pro) and reveal a novel mechanism evolved by a picornavirus to counteract innate immune signaling.

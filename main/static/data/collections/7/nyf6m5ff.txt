We are in a crisis where healthcare providers on the frontlines are running out of the appropriate personal protective equipment including N95 masks and power air-purifying respirators Here, we propose a makeshift filter mask that we call the Modified Airway from VEntilatoR Circuit (MAVerIC) that can be assembled within seconds using widely available supplies routinely utilized by anesthesia providers in the operating room to provide practitioners on the frontlines with the high standard of protection of a N95 mask during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and can be easily quantitatively "fit tested" to ensure no significant leak to optimize safety and efficacy

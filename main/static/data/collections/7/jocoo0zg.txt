A biotinylated virus overlay was used to identify a 120kD virus-binding molecule in dissociated newborn mouse brain (nmb) cell suspensions after separation of the proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotting, and blockage of non-specific binding sites. The virus-binding molecule was not detected in adult mouse brain cell suspensions. Mannose- and glucose-rich glycoproteins from nmb cell membranes were selected by ConA-Sepharose (Pharmacia) chromatography. A 30kD virus-binding molecule was eluted by 0.2 M alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. O-linked sialic acid, a receptor component, was identified in the eluate.

We report four patients with novel observations during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (ECMO). ECMO was initiated because of severe ARDS due to the primary H1N1 pandemic influenza pneumonia. Two patients had excessive conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and two had unproportional depletion of the coagulation factor IX. Pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical relevance of the noticed phenomena are discussed.

The report describes the outcome of four horses treated with homologous faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for acute colitis. The horses developed diarrhoea and fever a few days after a laparotomy to treat gastrointestinal disease. Medical records were reviewed to identify the horses as well as to describe the primary intestinal disease, clinical findings, surgical intervention, FMT protocol, outcome and follow-up of each case. The principle of the efficacy of FMT is that restoration of a balanced nonpathogenic bacterial population may be the primary defence mechanism against colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the equine gastrointestinal tract. The FMT did not produce adverse reactions and was demonstrated to rapidly control diarrhoea and fever in all cases. A complete resolution of clinical sings was observed within 24 hours when horses were given a single FMT. Further clinical studies are necessary to determine the optimal preparation and to reinforce the efficacy of FMT for treating acute colitis following colic surgery. The technique has the potential to be an inexpensive, safe and highly efficient tool for the prevention and treatment of infectious gastrointestinal diseases in horses, preventing antimicrobial resistance.(AU)

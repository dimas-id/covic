IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD HIV-1 is a retrovirus that has infected millions in recent decades. The level of life cycle complexity and host control exerted by this small virus with only nine proteins is astonishing. An interesting direction that has emerged in recent years is the role of small non-coding RNAs in viral gene expression. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW We focus on HIV-1 produced microRNAs (miRNAs), namely, TAR, Nef and miR-H1, and their roles in HIV-1 biogenesis. The article provides insights into TAR miRNA-mediated downregulation of viral and host gene expression by recruitment of chromatin remodeling components (HDAC1). WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN We address the influence of TAR miRNA on host cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and the role of Nef miRNA in the regulation of viral and host gene expression. The review also highlights an intriguing connection between miR-H1 and HIV-1-associated neurological pathogenesis, and the influence of the miRNA machinery in the establishment of latency. In the Expert Opinion section, we analyze the issue of host-based therapeutics against HIV-1 and how transcription inhibitors are influenced by viral miRNA production. TAKE HOME MESSAGE HIV-derived miRNAs are of significance not only to understand host-virus interactions, but also for the design of effective therapeutics.

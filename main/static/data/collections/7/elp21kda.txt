Resistance of mice to mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) infection is genetically determined. Normal adult A/J mice are resistant, and BALB/c mice are susceptible. Higher titers of virus and interferon (IFN) in vivo were found in MHV3-infected BALB/c mice compared with A/J mice. In vitro activation of macrophages (MФ) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delayed MHV3 replication only in cells that originated from A/J mice, although cell populations from both A/J, and BALB/c mice were able to synthesize comparable amounts of IFN-α/β. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that the delayed MHV3 replication in LPS-activated A/J MФ was due, in part, to IFN-α/β. A/J MФ were found to be more sensitive to IFN-γ than to IFN-α/β, and BALB/c MФ did not develop an antiviral state to either IFN. Cultured spleen cells from A/J mice synthesized more IFN-γ than BALB/c spleen cells after specific or non-specific stimulation. The results indicate that IFN-activated MФ may play a crucial role in the resistance to MHV3 infection. Since IFN-γ is produced in large amounts by A/J spleen cells after specific stimulation with MHV3 and is efficient in activating the A/J MФ, a T cell-dependent mechanism- is likely to be involved.

The efficacy and the long-term protection of a recombinant feline leukemia virus (FeLV) vaccine were determined in 30 specified pathogen free cats for over 3 years. At the same time, in order to specify the effects of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the immune system, one half of the cats (n = 15) were previously infected with the Swiss isolate FIV Zurich 2. The second half of the animals (n = 15) served as non-infected controls. Eighteen (nine FIV-negative, nine FIV-positive) vaccinated and 12 (six FIV-negative, six FIV-positive) non-vaccinated cats were intraperitoneally challenged with FeLV A. Seventeen of 18 vaccinated cats were protected against persistent viremia, while ten of 12 non-vaccinated controls became infected. An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU was found in all protected cats after the challenge exposure. No difference in vaccine efficacy was found between FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals. The whole group of cats was observed for over 3 years. There were no further vaccinations during this period. CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation. Anti-recombinant FeLV SU antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although a continuous decline of antibodies was found in FeLV vaccinated cats, they remained protected against constant FeLV challenge for over 3 years. FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio than FeLV infection. Within the group of FIV-positive cats, the FeLV-vaccinated animals had significantly better survival rates as well as better clinical and laboratory parameters. FIV- and FeLV-coinfected cats showed the lowest CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio, mainly caused by decreased CD4(+) lymphocyte counts. CD8(+) lymphocytes with strong fluorescence (CD8(high)) disappeared and cells with weak fluorescence (CD8(low)) appeared instead. Prevention of coinfection by immunizing FIV-positive cats against FeLV infection improved the clinical outcome and prolonged the cat's life expectancy.

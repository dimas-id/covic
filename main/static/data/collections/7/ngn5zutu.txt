Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease, caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV), that is characterized by atypical pneumonia. The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV plays an important role in inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) production via an unknown mechanism. In this study, the SARS-CoV N protein was found to bind to the SPRY domain of the tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby interfering with the association between TRIM25 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and inhibiting TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. Type I IFN production induced by poly IÂ·C or Sendai virus (SeV) was suppressed by the SARS-CoV N protein. SARS-CoV replication was increased by overexpression of the full-length N protein but not N amino acids 1 to 361, which could not interact with TRIM25. These findings provide an insightful interpretation of the SARS-CoV-mediated host innate immune suppression caused by the N protein.IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV N protein is essential for the viral life cycle and plays a key role in the virus-host interaction. We demonstrated that the interaction between the C terminus of the N protein and the SPRY domain of TRIM25 inhibited TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, which resulted in the inhibition of IFN production. We also found that the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) N protein interacted with TRIM25 and inhibited RIG-I signaling. The outcomes of these findings indicate the function of the coronavirus N protein in modulating the host's initial innate immune response.

Community discussion forums are increasingly used to seek advice; however, they often contain conflicting and unreliable information. Truth discovery models estimate source reliability and infer information trustworthiness simultaneously in a mutual reinforcement manner, and can be used to distinguish trustworthy comments with no supervision. However, they do not capture the diversity of word expressions and learn a single reliability score for the user. CrowdQM addresses these limitations by modeling the fine-grained aspect-level reliability of users and incorporate semantic similarity between words to learn a latent trustworthy comment embedding. We apply our latent trustworthy comment for comment ranking for three diverse communities in Reddit and show consistent improvement over non-aspect based approaches. We also show qualitative results on learned reliability scores and word embeddings by our model.

The therapeutic options for patients with advanced pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disorders are currently limited. Lung transplantation remains one of the few viable interventions, but on account of the insufficient donor pool only a minority of these patients actually undergo the procedure each year. Following transplantation there are a number of early and late allograft complications such as primary graft dysfunction, allograft rejection, infection, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and late injury that is now classified as chronic lung allograft dysfunction. The pathologist plays an essential role in the diagnosis and classification of these myriad complications. Although the transplant procedures are performed in selected centers patients typically return to their local centers. When complications arise it is often the responsibility of the local pathologist to evaluate specimens. Therefore familiarity with the pathology of lung transplantation is important.

To ask what is new in Entamoeba histolytica research, one need look no further than the surface of this protozoan parasite. In the past year the cloning and partial characterization of five different surface antigens have been reported, a remarkable result of international research efforts against amebiosis. One of these proteins is the first protective immunogen identified in the animal model of amebic liver abscess. Barbara Mann and William Petri review these recent results, propose a nomenclature for the gene family of E. histolytica galactose lectins and discuss the roles of the different surface proteins in adhesion.

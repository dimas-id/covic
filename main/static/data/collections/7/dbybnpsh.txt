Primers were designed and tested for their ability to distinguish rhinoviruses from enterovi‐ruses. A primer set derived from the 5′‐UTR/VP coding region junction was able to amplify all the rhinovirus serotypes tested. Enteroviruses were either not amplified by these primer pairs or produced a band of larger size that could easily be discriminated from the rhinovirus‐specific product. In contrast, primers embedded in the 5′‐UTR region alone were able to amplify both rhinovirus and enterovirus RNA. It is shown that rhino‐viruses could be specifically typed by sequencing the amplicon derived from this 5′‐UTR set. The sequences of the 5′‐UTR region often previously unsequenced rhinoviruses were derived. The sequences obtained cluster into two groups: 18,41, 15, 30, 63, 31,56, and 44; and 17, 69, and 70. Ampliconsfrom serotypes 17, 69, and 70 also group by sequence with the equivalent region of HRV14 from the genetic database, while the others group with 2 and 89. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, inc.

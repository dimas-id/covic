Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are an important cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs). HPIV‐4, a newly identified virus, has been associated with severe ALRTIs recently. A total of 771 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were collected from hospitalized children between March 2010 and February 2011. HPIVs were detected by Nest‐PCR, and other known respiratory viruses were detected by RT‐PCR and PCR. All amplification products were sequenced. HPIVs were detected in 151 (19.58%) patients, of whom 28 (3.63%) were positive for HPIV‐4, 12(1.55%) for HPIV‐1, 4 (0.51%) for HPIV‐2, and 107 (13.87%) for HPIV‐3. Only three were found to be co‐infected with different types of HPIVs. All HPIV‐positive children were under 5 years of age, with the majority being less than 1 year. Only the detection rate of HPIV‐3 had a significant statistical difference (χ(2) = 29.648, P = 0.000) between ages. HPIV‐3 and HPIV‐4 were detected during the summer. Sixty (39.74%) were co‐infected with other respiratory viruses, and human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most common co‐infecting virus. The most frequent clinical diagnosis was bronchopneumonia, and all patients had cough; some patients who were infected with HPIV‐3 and HPIV‐4 had polypnea and cyanosis. No significant difference was found in clinical manifestations between those who were infected with HPIV‐4 and HPIV‐3. Two genotypes for HPIV‐4 were prevalent, although HPIV‐4a dominated. HPIV‐4 is an important virus for children hospitalized with ALRTIs in China. HRV was the most common co‐infecting virus. Two genotypes for HPIV‐4 are prevalent, HPIV‐4a dominated. J. Med.

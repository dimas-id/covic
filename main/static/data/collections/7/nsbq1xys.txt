Abstract Acoustic monitoring presents itself as a flexible but under-reported method of tool condition monitoring in milling operations. This paper demonstrates the power of the monitoring paradigm by presenting a method of characterizing milling tool conditions by detecting anomalies in the time-frequency domain of the toolsâ€™ acoustic spectrum during cutting operations. This is done by training a generative adversarial neural network on only a single, readily obtained class of acoustic data and then inverting the generator to perform anomaly detection. Anomalous and non-anomalous data are shown to be nearly linearly separable using the proposed method, resulting in 90.56% tool condition classification accuracy and a 24.49% improvement over classification without the method.

Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, a disease which has subsequently spread rapidly across the entire country. Highly infectious, COVID-19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count. While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19, its accuracy is limited. The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low. There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination. This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.

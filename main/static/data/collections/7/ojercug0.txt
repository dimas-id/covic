Using Mt. Sinai (New York City) EMR health system data, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 8438 COVID-19 patients seen between March 1 and April 22, 2020. Risk of intubation and of death rose as a function of increasing age and as a function of greater cardiovascular comorbidity. Combining age and specific comorbidity markers showed patterns suggesting that cardiovascular comorbidities increased relative risks for adverse outcomes most substantially in the younger subjects with progressively diminishing relative effects at older ages.

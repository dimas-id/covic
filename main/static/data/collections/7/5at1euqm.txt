The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has led to a worldwide pandemic. This pandemic presents a huge challenge for the healthcare system and also for ophthalmologists. Previous studies and case reports indicated that SARS-CoV‑2 also infects the conjunctiva resulting in conjunctivitis. In addition, infectious virus particles in the tear fluid can be potential sources of infection; however, the detection of SARS-CoV‑2 RNA in the tear fluid has rarely been successful. Although isolated conjunctival involvement is highly unlikely, at the current point in time of the COVID-19 pandemic, practically every patient examined by an ophthalmologist could be infected with SARS-CoV‑2. Therefore, protective and hygiene measures should currently be consistently followed to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Currently, there are no treatment recommendations for conjunctivitis associated with COVID-19. Tear substitutes might be helpful for symptom relief but there is no evidence for a topical antiviral therapy. In the future ophthalmologists could play a decisive role in the screening of maculopathies that might occur during COVID-19 treatment using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.

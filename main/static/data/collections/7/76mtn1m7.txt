Internal medicine has been immediately involved in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Italy, which started in late February 2020. The first few COVID-19 cases were suspected and diagnosed in internal medicine wards, including, among others, a young adult male from Codogno (referred to as "patient 1"), who was later transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of our hospital.

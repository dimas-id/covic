Abstract Background A novel influenza A virus, subtype A/H1N1v emerged in April 2009 and caused the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Reliable detection and differentiation from seasonal influenza viruses is mandatory for appropriate case management as well as public health. Objectives To develop and technically validate a novel one-step real-time RT-PCR assay which can be used for influenza A virus screening and subtyping of A/H1N1v in a singleplex fashion. To assess the clinical performance of a novel commercial influenza RT-PCR kit based on the in-house version. Study design A real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the matrix gene of influenza A viruses was developed and validated using in vitro transcribed RNA derived from influenza A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus as well as plaque-quantified influenza A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus samples. After validation of the in-house version the commercial RealStar kit was used to assess the clinical performance and specificity on a panel of influenza viruses including A/H1N1v, A/H1N1, swine A/H1N1, A/H3N2, avian A/H5N1 as well as patient specimens. Results The lower limit of detection of the in-house version was 2149, 1376 and 2994 RNA copies/ml for A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, respectively. The RealStar kit displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity and could reliably discriminate influenza A viruses from A/H1N1v. No cross reaction with swine A/H1N1 and A/H1N2 was observed with the RealStar A/H1N1v specific probe. Conclusion Both assays demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity and might assist in the diagnosis of suspected influenza cases.

Methods used to control microbiological problems are discussed. Good housekeeping and regular inspection of all areas, effective boilouts, and regularly scheduled washups reduce slime development. Conventional slime control methods generally employ combinations of biocides. Alternative control measures use enzymes, biodispersants, bacteriophages, competing organisms, and biological complex formers. Using enzymes for slime control is expected to bring important benefits to the pulp and paper industry. Enzymes represent a clean and sustainable technology: they are nontoxic, readily biodegradable, and are produced using renewable raw materials. Use of enzymes in combination with biodispersants appears to be a promising method for slime control.

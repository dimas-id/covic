We present the case of a patient who underwent F-fluorocholine PET/CT for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer in which bilateral pneumonia was diagnosed. In the current state of COVID-19 pandemic, a high prevalence of incidental pneumonia may be expected, even with previous clinical triage, explained by a nondefined number of patients who were asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic for infectious process. Therefore, nuclear medicine physicians should be prepared to recognize and diagnose incidental COVID-19 pneumonia manifestation on F-fluorocholine PET/CT, due to the crucial epidemiological implications.

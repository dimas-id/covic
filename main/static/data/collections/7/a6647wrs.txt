We describe a novel minimally invasive procedure: dual-port laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection using a SILS port, and report our experience of using this to treat ten patients with lower rectal cancer. A SILS port was placed in the left lower quadrant at the intended colostomy site. A 5-mm trocar was inserted at the umbilicus at the subsequent drain site. Via a standard laparoscopic medial-to-lateral approach, the inferior mesenteric artery and vein were ligated and total mesorectal excision was performed. Via a perineal approach, the specimen was retrieved from the perineal wound, and a sigmoid colostomy was created at the site of the SILS port. Ten consecutive patients with lower rectal cancer at clinical stage T3 or lower underwent the procedure at our institution. The procedure was completed successfully in all patients, without any intraoperative problems and all postoperative outcomes were satisfactory. Thus, dual-port laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection can be performed safely and feasibly in selected patients.

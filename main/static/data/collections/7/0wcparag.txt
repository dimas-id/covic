Coronavirus gene expression involves proteolytic processing of the gene 1-encoded polyproteins and a key enzyme in this process is the virus-encoded 3C-like proteinase. In this study, we describe the biosynthesis of the human coronavirus 229E 3C-like proteinase in Escherichia coli and the substrate specificity of the purified protein. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we have also investigated the subcellular localization of the 3C-like proteinase and have found a punctate, perinuclear distribution of the proteinase in virus-infected cells.

After the initial fulminant outbreak, the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic has now taken a more protracted course which, nevertheless, challenges hospitals in returning to a “normal” mode and in preparing for a worst-case scenario of a second wave. Not only the organization of the first contact with the patient and the admission in the emergency department but also the admission as an in-patient and the subsequent management requires both flexibility and clear directions of action for the medical personnel involved. The aim of the algorithm was to develop a structured, easy to implement and easy to follow guideline while simultaneously preserving resources. The algorithm covers some key points of decision making such as clinical signs, first contact, admission for in-patient treatment, consequences of swab and computed tomography (CT) results, and allocation and isolation measures within the hospital. The algorithm is not intended to guide diagnostics, decisions and treatment in the narrower medical sense but to provide more general instructions for the management of in-patients considering specific aspects of SARS-CoV‑2.

In this paper, we examine cross-country differences, in terms of the age distribution of symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) cases, and fatalities due to the novel COVID-19. By calculating conditional probabilities, we bridge country-level incidence data gathered from different countries and attribute the variability in data to country demographics. We then provide case, hospitalization, ICU, and fatality estimates for a comprehensive list of countries using the existing data from a variety of countries.

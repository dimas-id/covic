Background and Purpose- We analyzed the relationship between HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) levels and clinical outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Methods- A total of 534 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with MT were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. The primary outcome measured was the modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months, according to HbA1c level. High HbA1c levels were defined as a plasma level of HbA1c >6.5%. Favorable outcomes were defined as functional independence, with modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2. Secondary functional outcomes included mortality, early clinical outcomes, and intracranial hemorrhage. Results- The number of patients with a favorable outcome was significantly lower in patients with HbA1c >6.5% than in those with HbA1c â‰¤6.5% (28.8% versus 42.1%; P=0.006). In multivariate analysis, high HbA1c levels (especially >7.0% HbA1c) were significantly associated with poor functional outcomes 3 months after AIS in patients with large vessel occlusion treated with MT. High HbA1c was also significantly associated with increased mortality and worse early clinical outcomes after AIS in patients treated with MT. Subgroup analyses showed that HbA1c >6.5% was associated with significantly lower odds of functional independence at 3 months after AIS, when comparing the recanalized group with nonrecanalized patients. Conclusions- These results suggest that high HbA1c level is an independent predictor of a poor outcome at 3 months after AIS in patients with large vessel occlusion treated with MT, particularly in those with recanalization, and may augment the risk of mortality and early clinical worsening after AIS.

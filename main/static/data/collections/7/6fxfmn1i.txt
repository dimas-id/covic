Abstract Group A bovine rotaviruses (BRVs) are the most important cause of diarrheal diseases in neonatal calves and cause significant morbidity and mortality in the young animals, and epidemiologic surveillance of bovine rotavirus G genotypes conducted in various cattle populations throughout the world has shown that approximately 90% of the bovine rotavirus isolates belong to G6 and G10. Based on the modified Jennerian approach to immunization, we constructed and characterized a reassortant rotavirus stain, which bears a single bovine rotavirus VP7 gene encoding G genotype 6 specificity while the remaining 10 genes are derived from the ovine attenuated rotavirus LLR-85. The reassortant rotavirus strain, named as R191, and its parental virus strain LLR-85 were combined as bivalent vaccine candidates to inoculate the colostrums-deprived neonatal calves for evaluation of the immunogenicity. The calves were orally inoculated with the reassortant R191 (group 1), the parental rotavirus LLR-85 (group 2), or combined the R191 and LLR-85 (group 3), and serum specimens were detected to determine the immune response of IgG and IgA antibodies. Results showed that seroconversion to positivity for IgG and IgA antibodies occurred at postinoculation day (PID) 10 in all of the inoculated calves, and the highest titers of the serum IgG (range 1:800 to 1:6400) and IgA (range 1:800 to 1:3200) antibodies were obtained at PID 21 for all calves. Meanwhile, virus shedding was detected after inoculation, showing that the inoculated virus was positive in 2 of 77 fecal specimens (2.6%) collected from the inoculated calves during the first 7 days of oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates. The results suggested that the rotavirus strains R191 and LLR-85 are promising bivalent vaccine candidates for the prevention of bovine G6 and G10 rotavirus infection.

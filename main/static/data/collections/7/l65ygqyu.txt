Although there is a significant amount of literature that deals with the identification of plant viral proteins involved in membrane remodeling and vesicle production in infected cells, there are very few investigations that report on the impact that infection has on the overall architecture and dynamics of the early secretory endomembranes. Recent investigations have shown that for some viruses the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies and other organelles are heavily recruited into virus-induced perinuclear structures. These structures are not isolated organelles and are dynamically connected to the bulk of non-modified endomembranes. They also have a functional link with peripheral motile vesicles involved in virus intracellular movement. The full molecular events that consubstantiate with this endomembrane recruitment in virus-induced structures remain to be elucidated but viral genome replication and virion assembly are probably taking place within these structures.

New patient referrals from primary care into dermatology services usually enter via one of three routes: (i) 2 week wait for suspected serious skin malignancies, (ii) routine non-urgent cases and (iii) emergency referrals (via an on call service). All these patients are assessed via a face-to-face consultation, after various waiting times depending on their urgency.

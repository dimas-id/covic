We report the case of a 77–year–old man who developed a Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome following immunosuppressive therapy more than 60 years after he moved away from an area endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis. Successful eradication of the nematode was achieved with an off label subcutaneous formulation of ivermectin. However, the patient subsequently died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite a high wormload in the stool and sputum of the patient and delayed infection control measures in the hospital, testing of the medical staff revealed a very low risk of Strongyloides transmission among healthcare workers.

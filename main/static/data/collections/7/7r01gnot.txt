TYPE: Abstract Publication TOPIC: Respiratory Care PURPOSE: 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is attributed for outbreak with first human infection detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which has caused clusters of severe respiratory illness like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The latest mortality was 2.07%. Currently, the standard care is supportive care, and no treatment is proven to be effective METHODS: We systematically analysed the contemporary protocols of the seven ongoing trials through the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (4 trials) and the trials registry (3 trials) database. The latest evaluation was on January 29, 2020 with key word ‘2019-nCoV’, for the trials evaluating the diagnostic and the therapeutic interventions to manage the respiratory infection caused by 2019-nCoV RESULTS: Therapeutic interventions include, lopinavir-ritonavir with aerosolized interferon-alpha compared with the adjunctive IV methylprednisolone, umifenovir (broad-spectrum antiviral), SARI-nCoV trial for role of glucocorticoid, three comparative antiviral therapies utilising ribavirin, interferon alpha-1b, lopinavir -ritonavir, Xue-Bi-Jing injection (only Chinese medicine injection approved for sepsis) and novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique is under trial for simple, fast and portable diagnosis. The mean number of patients being enrolled is 193 (SD ± 183, maximum 500, minimum 40, range 460, 95% CI 24 to 362). Cumulatively, 1350 patients are targeted across 7 trials. CONCLUSIONS: Varied novel approaches based on the current scientific understanding of the disease are being evaluated for quick and effective management CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: As the 2019-nCoV becomes a global threat, the rapidity of the Chinese trials for an evidence-based approach are in direction to provide rational, efficacious and potential solutions to effectively manage the disease DISCLOSURE: No significant relationships.

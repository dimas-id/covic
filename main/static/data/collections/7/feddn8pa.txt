UNLABELLED INTRODUCTION AND INDICATIONS: Robotic surgery has numerous advantages in rectal cancer surgery. Studies have reported the advantages associated with single-port approaches, such as eliminating the need for additional incisions, as well as the difficulties inherent in this technique. The authors present a hybrid technique that they performed using a robotic total mesorectal excision with the aid of a single port-device. Materials and methods. The authors performed the technique on 2 patients using a single-port device through an umbilical incision and 3 accessory ports for the robotic arms. There was no need to place ports for the assistant's equipment or for an assistant incision. RESULTS AND COMPLICATIONS The operation time was 177.5 minutes, and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Both patients were discharged 7 days after the operation. CONCLUSIONS This technical variation is an additional step forward for oncological surgery with minimal damage to the abdominal wall.

BACKGROUND Emerging reports indicate a high incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia during the spring 2020 pandemic. The pronounced pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses observed in these patients may contribute to a transient hypercoagulable state. In this setting, pulmonary embolism may cause further respiratory distress and clinical deterioration. CASE PRESENTATION We describe the clinical course of three patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress, where pulmonary embolism was detected during the course of the hospitalisation. Two of the cases occurred despite early institution of standard dosage of low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis, and in one case, pulmonary embolism was diagnosed during the convalescent phase of an otherwise benign COVID-19 disease course. INTERPRETATION These cases highlight the importance of awareness of the potentially increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 disease. Further research is required to establish appropriate clinical management guidelines for prevention of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.

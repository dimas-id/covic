BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the predictive value of susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) burden and morphology in middle cerebral artery recanalization. METHODS We retrospectively examined clinical and imaging data from 72 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke with middle cerebral artery occlusion and examined the association of recanalization with SVS length and shape. RESULTS None of the patients with a middle cerebral artery SVS >20 mm in length achieved recanalization. For patients with a relatively short SVS (length <20 mm), irregular shape was a strong independent predictor for no recanalization (odds ratio, 6.891; 95% confidence interval, 1.441-32.950; P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS Irregular shape and long length (>20 mm) of SVS decrease the potential to recanalize the occluded middle cerebral artery with intravenous thrombolysis.

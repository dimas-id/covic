BACKGROUND Sore throat is a remarkable complication after thyroid surgery with endotracheal tube (ETT). Many studies revealed that laryngeal mask airway (LMA) might reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat. However, little is known about the use of a flexible reinforced LMA (FLMA) in thyroid surgery. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential benefits of FLMA compared with ETT on postoperative sore throat. METHODS In this prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, ninety-six patients aged 20-80 years, scheduled for elective radical thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled. They were randomly divided into ETT group and FLMA group. All the included patients received total intravenous anesthesia (with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium) and controlled mechanical ventilation during the surgery. Cuff pressure of ETT and FLMA were strictly controlled. Incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat, numbness and hoarseness at 1, 24, and 48 h after surgery was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Incidence and severity of buckling during extubation and the hemodynamic profile during intubation were also recorded and compared. RESULTS The incidence of sore throat and hoarseness was significantly lower in FLMA group than those in ETT group at 1 h, 24 h and 48 h postoperatively, as well as the severity of sore throat. Compared to ETT group, there was a significantly lower incidence of buckling during extubation and less fluctuation of HR and BP at 1 min and 3 min after intubation in FLMA group. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing thyroid surgery with FLMA had less postoperative laryngopharyngeal symptoms when compared with ETT. The use of FLMA also achieved less buckling during extubation and better hemodynamic profiles during intubation. TRIAL REGISTRATION The research was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-15006602) on May 23th, 2015.

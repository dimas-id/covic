BACKGROUND: In the lung, melanoma is mostly arranged as patterns of multiple nodules, solitary nodules, or miliary invasions. Very rarely, it also displays a “crazy paving” pattern (also described as a “paving stone,” “flagstone,” or “slabstone” pattern), which is rarer still in discrete bilateral nodules. This pattern is considered to be caused by pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, but its association with various diseases is unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with pulmonary melanoma. Computed tomography revealed discrete bilateral nodules surrounded by a “paving” pattern. A literature review found more than 40 types of diseases that have presented with “paving” patterns in the lung—predominantly pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, viral pneumonia, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS, squalene aspiration pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis, pulmonary leptospirosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary nocardiosis. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first case of pulmonary melanoma in the form of discrete bilateral nodules accompanied with a computed tomography paving pattern. Although pulmonary paving patterns are rare, more than 40 diseases reportedly display them; clinicians should consider melanoma of the lung in differential diagnoses for patients who show such a pattern.

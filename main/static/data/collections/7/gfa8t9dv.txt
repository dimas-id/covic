Robotic-assisted major pancreatic resections allow recreation of time-tested open surgical procedures on a minimally invasive platform. Early outcomes from robotic-assisted major pancreatic resections are comparable with those of laparoscopic and open approaches. Robotic assistance has the potential to bring the well-recognized advantages of minimally invasive surgery to major pancreatic resections. Technological innovations and increased surgeon familiarity with this approach will improve, likely leading to greater adoption and acceptance.

Abstract Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly identified enteric alphacoronavirus that causes fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets in China. Here, we propagated a virulent strain SADS-CoV/CN/GDWT/2017 in Vero cells for up to 83 passages. Four strains of SADS-CoV/GDWT-P7, -P18, -P48 and -P83 were isolated and characterized. Sequence alignments showed that these four novel strains exhibited 16 nucleotide mutations and resultant 10 amino acid substitutions in open reading frame 1a/1b, spike, NS3a, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. Furthermore, a 58-bp deletion in NS7a/7b was found in P48 and P83 strains, which led to the loss of NS7b and 38 amino acid changes of NS7a. Pig infection studies showed that the P7 strain caused typical watery diarrhea, while the P83 strain induced none-to-mild, delayed and transient diarrhea. This is the first report on cell adaption of a virulent SADS-CoV strain, which gives information on the potential virulence determinants of SADS-CoV.

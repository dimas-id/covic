Differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy can be difficult, especially because in early phase they might present with overlapping clinical features. Notably, orthostatic hypotension and cognitive dysfunction are common nonmotor aspects of parkinsonian syndromes and can be both present from the earliest stages of all α-synucleinopathies, indicating a common neurobiological basis in their strong relationship. In view of the increasing awareness about the prevalence of mild cognitive dysfunction in multiple system atrophy, the relevance of autonomic dysfunction in demented parkinsonian patients, the critical role of non-motor symptoms in clustering Parkinson's disease patients and the shift to studying patients in the prodromal phase, we will discuss some intrinsic limitations of current clinical diagnostic criteria, even when applied by movement disorder specialists. In particular, we will focus on the early coexistence of autonomic and cognitive dysfunction in the setting of overt or latent parkinsonism as pitfalls in the differential diagnosis of α-synucleinopathies. As early and accurate diagnosis remains of outmost importance for counselling of patients and timely enrolment into disease-modifying clinical trials, a continuous effort of research community is ongoing to further improve the clinical diagnostic accuracy of α-synucleinopathies.

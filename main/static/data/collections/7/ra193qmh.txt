The bolus delivery method is designed to deliver a dose to the desired location in the lung, and it has the advantage of fewer side effects and a more efficient way of delivery. Based upon the lung deposition model developed for continuously inhaling aerosols of constant concentration, a mathematical model of aerosol bolus deposition is proposed. The calculated results show that the recovery depends on the bolus penetration depth, flow rate, particle size, breath holding time and bolus volume. Three sets of published experimental data with different controlling factors (particle size, flow rate and breath holding time) are adopted to make the quantitative comparisons with the calculated results. The predictions and data for the low intrinsic motion particles (∼1 μm) have good agreement, as do the coarse particles in the shallow airways region. For females, the recovery was found to be consistently lower than that for males.

The political context of religious freedom law enforcement in health care settings, in addition to hateful rhetoric and physical violence against transgender people, requires health care employees, specifically hospital chaplains and educators, to expand their traditional roles from bedside spiritual companions to practical public theologians. This expansion includes shocking the hospital system that has become “chilled” by religious freedom enforcement, becoming literate about religious freedom law, becoming active lobbyist against discrimination in the name of religious freedom, and becoming culturally competent. Buddhist-Christian dialogue can inspire and support the womb visualization practices and Buddhist gathas in the Thich Nhat Hanh tradition. It is recommended that chaplains and spiritual care professionals implement the practical and trans-culturally-specific instructions called “Special Considerations for Pastoral Care in Health Care Settings” by consultants Bradley and Metrick of Elements Consulting.

The human bocavirus (hBoV) has been identified in respiratory infections in children in a large number of studies. Despite this, the pathogenic role of the HBoV is under discussion. The main objectives of the study were: to determine the incidence of HBoV in hospitalized children; to describe the main clinical features of the positive children; and to compare the data with those from other viral infections in the same population. A prospective study was performed between 2005 and 2013 including children up to 14‐year old with respiratory infection admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Spain). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from 3,275 patients and were tested for HBoV and other 15 respiratory viruses by RT‐nested PCR. HBoV was detected in 319 patients (9.9%); 80 cases as a single pathogen, and 239 cases (75%) as coinfections with other viruses. The HBoV was the fourth most common virus detected, behind respiratory syncytial virus (39.8%), rhinovirus (30.6%), and adenovirus (15%). The most common clinical diagnosis, in cases that HBoV was detected as a single pathogen was asthma exacerbation followed by pneumonia. A seasonal distribution was shown, with higher positivity rates in December and January. Children affected by HBoV were older than children infected by other viruses. Differences in terms of clinical diagnosis were found, bronchiolitis diagnosis was lower compared with the other viruses, and HBoV was associated with diagnosis of pneumonia, with increased use of antibiotics (41.8%), and radiographic infiltrates (47%). These findings could suggest a pathogenic role of HBoV in respiratory infections in children under 14 years of age. J. Med. Virol. 88:2052–2058, 2016. Published 2016.

BACKGROUND: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis, infects swine of all ages causing vomiting and diarrhea, in newborn piglets the mortality rate is near 100%. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that TfR1 is an additional receptor for TGEV and assists TGEV invasion and replication.

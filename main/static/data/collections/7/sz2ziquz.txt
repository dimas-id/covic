PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review summarizes past and ongoing efforts for using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of influenza, and is focused on products that have entered clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS At least three polyclonal and eight monoclonal antibody products have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of influenza. Considered across the two classes of therapeutics, these products appear to be safe and well tolerated. However, the efficacy results have been mixed and inconclusive. To date, no products have consistently shown superiority to currently available antivirals. SUMMARY No products within these two classes have been licensed, and several products appear to have stopped further clinical development. There are several ongoing studies that are anticipated to be completed or reported in the next 1-2 years which will be critical for understanding the value of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of influenza.

Abstract Background To document the management of drug-sensitive TB patients during the Hajj and assess compliance with the Saudi TB management guidelines. Method The study was conducted in hospitals in Makkah during the 2016 and 2017 Hajj seasons. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data on relevant indices on TB management and a scoring system was developed to assess compliance with guidelines. Results Data was collected from 31 TB cases, 65.4% (17/26) were Saudi residents. Sputum culture was the only diagnostic test applied in 67.7% (21/31) of patients. Most (96.8%, 30/31) confirmed TB cases were isolated, but only 12.9% (4/28) were tested for HIV and merely 37% (10/27) received the recommended four 1st-line anti-TB drugs. Guideline compliance scores were highest for infection prevention and control and surveillance (9.6/10) and identifying TB suspects (7.2/10). The least scores were obtained for treating TB (5.0/10) and diagnosing TB (3.0/10). Conclusions Healthcare providers training and supervision are paramount to improve their knowledge and skill and ensure their compliance with existing TB management guidelines. However, there may be a need for the introduction of an international policy/guideline for TB control and management during mass gatherings such as the Hajj to guide providersâ€™ choices and facilitate monitoring.

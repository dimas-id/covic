Among all the neural cells in fetal rat brain culture developing neurons showed the highest rate of infection by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). JEV specifically bound to these cells as measured by immuno-staining. These results indicate that developing neurons are the major target of JEV, and that the initial specific binding of virus to these cells may be one of the reasons for the neurotropism of JEV.

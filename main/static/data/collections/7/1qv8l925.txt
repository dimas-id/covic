A robust biomarker screening and validation is crucial for overcoming the current limits in the clinical management of infectious diseases. In this chapter, a general workflow for metabolomics is summarized. Subsequently, an overview of the major contributions of this omics science to the field of biomarkers of infectious diseases is discussed. Different approaches using a variety of analytical platforms can be distinguished to unveil the key metabolites for the diagnosis, prognosis, response to treatment and susceptibility for infectious diseases. To allow the implementation of such biomarkers into the clinics, the performance of large-scale studies employing solid validation criteria becomes essential. Focusing on the etiological agents and after an extensive review of the field, we present a comprehensive revision of the main metabolic biomarkers of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases. Finally, we discussed several articles which show the strongest validation criteria. Following these research avenues, precious clinical resources will be revealed, allowing for reduced misdiagnosis, more efficient therapies, and affordable costs, ultimately leading to a better patient management.

We propose the design of a ventilator which can be easily manufactured and integrated into the hospital environment to support COVID-19 patients. The unit is designed to support standard ventilator modes of operation, most importantly PRVC (Pressure Regulated Volume Control) and SIMV-PC (Synchronised Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) modes. The unit is not yet an approved medical device and is in the concept and prototyping stage. It is presented here to invite fast feedback for development and deployment in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION We present an approach to laparoscopic right colon resection utilizing a single port placed through the umbilicus. The technique described is performed through a single small umbilical incision with a virtually scar-free result. METHODS A 77-year-old woman with a tubulovillous adenoma in her cecum underwent a laparoscopic right colectomy using a single port placed through the umbilicus. Straight and reticulating laparoscopic instruments were utilized. RESULTS The total operative time was 112 minutes. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The patient was discharged home on day 5 postoperatively with normal bowel function and tolerance of a solid diet. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic right colectomy can be safely performed through a single incision through the umbilicus with an excellent cosmetic result.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus transmits rapidly, it has a basic reproductive number ($R_0$) of $2.2-2.7$. In March, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Effective testing for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak since infected patients can be quarantined. But the demand for testing outstrips the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to detect COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence. Our technique takes only a few seconds to detect the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a dataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution neural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet, InceptionResNet) to classify chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models we then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to detect COVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98\% and a validation accuracy of 100\%. Feature maps of our model show which areas within a chest X-ray are important for classification. Our work can help to increase the adaptation of AI-assisted applications in clinical practice.

Host–vector–pathogen interactions have been governed since their origin by a subtle balance between attack and transmission strategies and defense mechanisms. Dialogues and conflicts are established between a molecular pathogen and its host and will generate a mutual selection pressure that will result in profound changes in gene expression. In the postgenomic era, proteomics is in its infancy, but represents a promising tool to fill the blanks that still exist in biology despite the sequencing of the genomes of many organisms. In this chapter, we present the interest of proteomics in a better understanding of host–vector–pathogen crosstalks through a synthetic review of the available data generated by proteomics studies, discuss the pitfalls of current approaches, and present new approaches to decipher from molecular interactions to population proteomics leading to biomarkers discovery for diagnosis, therapy, and vaccine purposes.

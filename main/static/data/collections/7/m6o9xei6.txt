We report the results of F-FDG PET/CT in an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 infection. A 27-year-old woman underwent FDG PET/CT for revaluation of a stage IIIE B Hodgkin lymphoma after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. It showed intense avid FDG subpleural mixed ground-glass and consolidative lesions, especially in the left lung. Because of this morpho-metabolic aspect and the epidemic context, a viral pneumopathy was suspected. The patient who was initially asymptomatic was admitted for fever 28 hours after the PET/CT. The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, and the outcome was favorable.

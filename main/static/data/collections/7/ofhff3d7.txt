The MEROPS website (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) includes information on peptidase inhibitors as well as on peptidases and their substrates. Displays have been put in place to link peptidases and inhibitors together. The classification of protein peptidase inhibitors is continually being revised, and currently inhibitors are grouped into 67 families based on comparisons of protein sequences. These families can be further grouped into 38 clans based on comparisons of tertiary structure. Small molecule inhibitors are important reagents for peptidase characterization and, with the increasing importance of peptidases as drug targets, they are also important to the pharmaceutical industry. Small molecule inhibitors are now included in MEROPS and over 160 summaries have been written.

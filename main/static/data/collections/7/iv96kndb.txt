INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS We investigated the incidence of suture complications and recurrent prolapse following uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) using delayed absorbable polyglyconate monofilament suture (Maxon). METHODS We reviewed the medical records of subjects who underwent vaginal USLS using polyglyconate suture. Primary outcomes were suture complications and anatomic failures defined as recurrent apical prolapse stage 1 or greater. Secondary outcomes were subjective failures and reoperation rate for apical prolapse. RESULTS Fifty-seven out of 68 subjects who underwent USLS with polyglyconate suture over the study period were included in analysis. At median follow-up of 12 months, 3.5% had suture complications. The anatomic and symptomatic failure rate was 7%. One subject underwent repeat surgery for prolapse. CONCLUSIONS Suture complications are uncommon using polyglyconate suture for USLS, and failure rates are low. This is in comparison to a 44.6% suture erosion rate with permanent suture reported by our institution using the same surgical technique.

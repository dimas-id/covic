The QuantiFERON-CMV (QF) assay measures cell-mediated immunity against cytomegalovirus (CMV-CMI), which is particularly useful in individuals susceptible to CMV infection such as transplant patients. A positive QF result identifies patients that are better protected against CMV infection. However, the significance of a negative QF result in CMV-seropositive individuals needs to be clarified. CMV-CMI was analyzed in healthy subjects using the QF assay, and, in parallel, the Flow-cytometric Assay of Specific Cell-mediated Immune response in Activated whole blood (FASCIA). FASCIA assay measures T-cell proliferation using CMV lysate as stimulus whereas QF assay use a mix of peptides. A total of 93 healthy volunteers were enrolled, and 13/71 CMV-seropositive individuals (18.3%) showed humoral/cellular discordance using QF assay (CMV+ QF-). Interestingly, with FASCIA assay CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferations were lower in CMV+ QF- than in CMV+ QF+ individuals. Furthermore, CMV+ QF- volunteers had a lower level of anti-CMV IgG than CMV+ QF+ subjects. Discordant CMV+ QF- volunteers can be defined as low responder individuals since they show lower CMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in comparison to CMV+ QF+ individuals. Immune discordance shows the high heterogeneity of immunity to CMV in healthy subjects.

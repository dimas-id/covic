BACKGROUND With the addition of laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to the bariatric surgery procedural toolkit, patients desiring a restrictive bariatric procedure often choose between adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and SG. One study compared quality of life after these 2 procedures and found no difference. The purpose of our study was to re-evaluate the postoperative quality of life in LAGB and SG patients at a military teaching hospital in the United States. METHODS A retrospective review of 108 consecutive laparoscopic restrictive bariatric procedures performed within 15 months at a Department of Defense hospital was conducted. Of these 108 patients, 69 had undergone laparoscopic vertical SG and 39 LAGB. A validated quality of life questionnaire (Bariatric Quality of Life) was conducted a mean of 9.3 Â± 3.2 months (range 5-16) postoperatively. The weight loss and standard laboratory parameters were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS The quality of life assessment revealed significantly better scores after SG than after LAGB (66.5 versus 57.9, P = .0002). The excess weight loss and excess body mass index loss at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively were significantly greater in the laparoscopic SG group. The patients demonstrated a clear preference over time for SG once it was offered. CONCLUSION Early postoperative quality of life was superior after SG than after LAGB. SG also resulted in superior early excess weight loss. In a practice not constrained by reimbursement, these findings were associated with increased patient choice of SG after it began to be offered.

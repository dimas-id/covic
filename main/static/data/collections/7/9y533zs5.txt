Innate immunity is involved in regulating inflammatory and tissue repair responses to injury. In particular, humoral innate immunity plays functions related to wound clearance from tissue debris, and regulation of macrophage and stromal cell activities. PTX3, a component of humoral innate immunity, orchestrates tissue repair by interacting with plasminogen and fibrin. Fluid-phase molecules of innate immunity interact with elements of the extracellular matrix, and some of the latter display opsonic activity against certain bacterial species. Thus, recognition of extracellular matrix and microbial components is a recurrent theme in the humoral arm of the innate immune system.

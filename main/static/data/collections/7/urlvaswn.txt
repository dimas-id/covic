BACKGROUND: In 2015, the 68th World Health Assembly declared that effective, rapid, low-cost diagnostic tools were needed for guiding optimal use of antibiotics in medicine. This review is devoted to interferon-inducible myxovirus resistance proteins as potential biomarkers for differentiating viral from bacterial infections. CONTENT: After viral infection, a branch of the interferon (IFN)-induced molecular reactions is triggered by the binding of IFNs with their receptors, a process leading to the activation of mx1 and mx2, which produce antiviral Mx proteins (MxA and MxB). We summarize current knowledge of the structures and functions of type I and III IFNs. Antiviral mechanisms of Mx proteins are discussed in reference to their structural and functional data to provide an in-depth picture of protection against viral attacks. Knowing such a mechanism may allow the development of countermeasures and the specific detection of any viral infection. Clinical research data indicate that Mx proteins are biomarkers for many virus infections, with some exceptions, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin have established positions as general biomarkers for bacterial infections. SUMMARY: Mx genes are not directly induced by viruses and are not expressed constitutively; their expression strictly depends on IFN signaling. MxA protein production in peripheral blood cells has been shown to be a clinically sensitive and specific marker for viral infection. Viral infections specifically increase MxA concentrations, whereas viruses have only a modest increase in CRP or procalcitonin concentrations. Therefore, comparison of MxA and CRP and/or procalcitonin values can be used for the differentiation of infectious etiology.

Since the identification of viruses at the start of the 20th century, detecting their presence has presented great challenges. In the past two decades, there has been significant progress in viral detection methods for clinical diagnosis and environmental monitoring. The earliest advances were in molecular biology and imaging techniques. Advances in microfabrication and nanotechnology have now begun to play an important role in viral detection, and improving the detection limit, operational simplicity, and cost-effectiveness of viral diagnostics. Here we provide an overview of recent advances, focusing especially on advances in simple, device-based approaches for viral detection.

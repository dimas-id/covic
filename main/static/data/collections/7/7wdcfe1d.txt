This chapter describes common viral pathogens in humans with emphasis on the molecular diagnosis. Each section includes molecular characteristics, clinical presentation, and commonly used diagnostic methods (both conventional and molecular). Commercially available molecular diagnostic kits are preferentially described. Recommendations and guidelines (if available) for result interpretation and clinical approach are also included. For detailed methods, please refer to the chapter “Methodology and Instrumentation” in this book.

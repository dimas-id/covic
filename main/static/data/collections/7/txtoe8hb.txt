The outbreak and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a dire global pandemic with millions of people infected and ~ 400,000 deaths thus far. Highly accurate detection of antibodies for COVID-19 is an indispensable part of the effort to combat the pandemic1,2. Here we developed two-plex antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins3 (the S1 subunit and receptor binding domain RBD) in human serum and saliva on a near-infrared nano-plasmonic gold (pGOLD) platform4â€“8. By testing nearly 600 serum samples, pGOLD COVID-19 assay achieved ~ 99.78 % specificity for detecting both IgG and IgM with 100 % sensitivity in sera collected > 14 days post disease symptom onset, with zero cross-reactivity to other diseases. Two-plex correlation analysis revealed higher binding of serum IgM to RBD than to S1. IgG antibody avidity toward multiple antigens were measured, shedding light on antibody maturation in COVID-19 patients and affording a powerful tool for differentiating recent from remote infections and identifying re-infection by SARS-CoV-2. Just as important, due to high analytical sensitivity, the pGOLD COVID-19 assay detected minute amounts of antibodies in human saliva, offering the first non-invasive detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The importance of systemic infections in pregnancy is often underestimated. This is primarily due to the fact that pregnant women, in the majority of cases, do not notice any complaints or only have unspecific flu-like symptoms (e.g. toxoplasmosis). Serological screening within the framework of German maternity care is often insufficient to diagnose existing or emerging infections in time. However, the long-term consequences for the affected children and their parents can be immense. A serological TORCH analysis should be performed if a pregnant woman complains about any typical or unspecific symptoms on suspicion of an infection.

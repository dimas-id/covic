A 4-year-old male one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) was referred to Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Urmia University, Iran in 2017 with anorexia, weakness, depression and pale mucosa. Decreased red blood cell count, packed cell volume and hemoglobin concentration were detected by complete blood cell count. In Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears Trypanosoma spp. trypomastigotes scattered between erythrocytic spaces and Mycoplasma-like organisms were observed attached to the surface of erythrocytes. Species-specific PCR assay confirmed T. evansi and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemolamae (CMhl) co-infection. Administration of diminazene aceturate, oxytetracycline 20%, flunixin meglumine and phosphorus-vitamin B12 were not effective in treatment. Hemoplasmosis should be considered as an important differential diagnosis of conditions associated with hemolytic anemia in camel.

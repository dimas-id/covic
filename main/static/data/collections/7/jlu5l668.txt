The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia has been reported for almost 50 years. A recent systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggested that corticosteroids reduce the critical illness associated with community-acquired pneumonia. There is little doubt that a prolonged administration of a moderate dose of corticosteroids may alleviate the systemic inflammatory response and subsequent organ dysfunction in severe infection. Whether these favorable effects on morbidity may translate into better survival and quality of life needs to be addressed in additional adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

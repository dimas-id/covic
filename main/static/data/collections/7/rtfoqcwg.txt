We studied the application of a mobile terminal application program in endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressure measurement to improve the implementation rate of scientific ETT cuff pressure measurement and to ensure that the pressure falls within the recommended range. A pre-post controlled study lasting for 18 months was undertaken in a 40-bed general intensive care unit (GICU). This included a 6-month baseline period (baseline group) and a 6-month intervention period (intervention group). The mobile terminal application program was applied to monitor the cuff pressure of endotracheal intubation as an intervention measure during the intervention period. ETT pressure was the main outcome measure, while gender, age, causes for ICU admission, sedation score, duration of prior intubation, size of ETT, and number of VAP patients were secondary outcomes. ETT cuff pressure was monitored 742 times in both the baseline group and the intervention group. A total of 56.9% of the cuff pressure measurements in the baseline group were within the recommended range, while 78.4% of measurements in the intervention group were within the recommended range, reflecting a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The application of the mobile terminal application program used for ETT cuff pressure measurement could improve the percentage of ETT cuff pressure measurements falling within the recommended range.

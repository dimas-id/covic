Abstract Nedocromil sodium is a mast-cell stabilizer that prevents or ablates both the acute and late phases of the allergic response. It is an antiinflammatory agent that is not a steroid. It is more potent than the currently available mastcell stabilizer, cromolyn, and maintenance therapy may be possible at less frequent intervals than the initially recommended regimen of 4 times daily. Nedocromil for pulmonary administration is currently available. The nasal form has undergone clinical trials but has not yet been released in the United States.

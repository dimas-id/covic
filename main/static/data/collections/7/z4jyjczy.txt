In conclusion, the following observations can be made. aPL are present in approximately 2% to 4% of the normal population and the prevalence increases with age. There is a high prevalence among patients with autoimmune connective tissue disorders, especially SLE. There is an association with both venous and arterial thrombosis as well as with pregnancy morbidity, but the strength of association varies amongst studies. This probably reflects different populations, study designs, and different assays and definitions used. In several studies the risk of thrombosis appears to be higher with LA and the data suggests a true association rather than epiphenomenon. In a given patient, both aCL and LA should be measured. A significant impact on long-term survival has been noted and aPL also contribute significantly to accumulated damage in diseases such as SLE. The clinical spectrum of APS features is enormous and continues to expand. It behoves us all as clinicians and health care professionals to consider an early diagnosis of Hughes syndrome, with its distinct clinical and serological features, to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality in our patients.

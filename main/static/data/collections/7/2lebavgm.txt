Abstract A young child presented with severe ventricular dysfunction and troponin leak in the setting of Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). He developed intermittent, self-resolving, and hemodynamically insignificant episodes of complete heart block (CHB), which were diagnosed on telemetry and managed conservatively. This report is the first description of COVID-19 induced transient CHB in a child.

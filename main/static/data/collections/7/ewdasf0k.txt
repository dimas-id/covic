BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of breast cancer patients develop metastatic disease, with over 450,000 deaths globally per year. Bone is the most common first site of metastatic disease accounting for 40% of all first recurrence and 70% of patients with advanced disease develop skeletal involvement. Treatment of bone metastases currently focusses on symptom relief and prevention and treatment of skeletal complications. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects. METHODS/DESIGN: CARBON is a UK-based, open-label, multi-centre study which comprises an initial safety phase to establish the feasibility and safety of combining radium-223 given on a 6-weekly schedule in combination with orally administered capecitabine followed by a randomised extension phase to further characterise the safety profile and provide preliminary estimation of efficacy. DISCUSSION: The CARBON study is important as the results will be the first to assess radium-223 with chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. If the results find acceptable rates of toxicity with a decrease in bone turnover markers, further work will be necessary in a phase II/III setting to assess the efficacy and clinical benefit.

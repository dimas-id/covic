We report here that in rat and human neuroprogenitor cells as well as rat embryonic cortical neurons Zika virus (ZIKV) infection leads to ribosomal stress that is characterized by structural disruption of the nucleolus. The anti-nucleolar effects were most pronounced in postmitotic neurons. Moreover, in the latter system, nucleolar presence of ZIKV capsid protein (ZIKV-C) was associated with ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Deletion of 22 C-terminal residues of ZIKV-C prevented nucleolar localization, ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Consistent with a casual relationship between ZIKV-C-induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis, ZIKV-C-overexpressing neurons were protected by loss-of-function manipulations targeting the ribosomal stress effector Tp53 or knockdown of the ribosomal stress mediator RPL11. Finally, capsid protein of Dengue virus, but not West Nile virus, induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Thus, anti-nucleolar and pro-apoptotic effects of protein C are flavivirus-species specific. In the case of ZIKV, capsid protein-mediated ribosomal stress may contribute to neuronal death, neurodevelopmental disruption and microcephaly.

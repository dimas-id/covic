An adept, rapid and novel water-soluble glutathione functionalized CdS quantum dots (GSH@CdS QDs) were fabricated using green pathway for sensing of heavy metal contamination prevalent in industrial wastewater. GSH@CdS QDs were facilely synthesized in an aqueous phase reaction and were effectively characterized using FT-IR, XRD, FESEM, HRTEM and EDX techniques. The distinct fluorescence characteristics of GSH@CdS QDs were explored and the QDs showed selective sensitivity towards mercury ions with a low limit of detection of 0.54 nM under optimal conditions. The detailed interaction between GSH@CdS QDs and Hg2+ and the probable fluorescence quenching mechanism were established in this study. In comparison to already reported fluorescent probes, GSH@CdS QDs showed high sensitivity, biocompatibility, long fluorescence stability and convenient removal of mercury ions. Graphical Abstract Facile green route for the fabrication of glutathione capped CdS quantum dots for fluorescence-based detection of toxic Hg2+ ions.

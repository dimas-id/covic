Bovine torovirus (BoTV) is a pleomorphic virus with a spike-bearing envelope and a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. This kidney-shaped virus is associated with diarrhea in calves and apparently has a worldwide distribution. This review provides details of the history and taxonomy of BoTV since its discovery in 1979. Information about virion morphology and architecture, antigenic and biological properties, viral genome, protein composition, thermal and chemical stability, and pH and proteolytic enzymes resistance is also summarized. A major focus of this review is to postulate a possible epidemiological cycle for BoTV, based on epidemiological data obtained in our studies and other published data, and progressing from the newborn calf to the adult animal. The distribution, host range, pathogenesis, disease and clinical signs (under experimental and natural exposure), pathology, diagnosis, prevention, treatment and control of BoTV infections are also described. In addition, a discussion of the zoonotic implications of torovirus-like particles detected in patients with gastroenteritis that resemble and cross-react with BoTV is presented. Hopefully, the findings described here will alert others to the existence of BoTV in cattle and its contribution to the diarrheal disease complex. This review also highlights the need for continual vigilance for potential zoonotic viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, such as the SARS coronavirus.

Modeling the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for informing public health policy. All models for COVID-19 epidemiology rely on parameters describing the dynamics of the infection process. The meanings of epidemiological parameters like R_0, R_t, the"serial interval"and"generation interval"can be challenging to understand, especially as these and other parameters are conceptually overlapping and sometimes confusingly named. Moreover, the procedures used to estimate these parameters make various assumptions and use different mathematical approaches that should be understood and accounted for when relying on parameter values and reporting them to the public. Here, we offer several insights regarding the derivation of commonly-reported epidemiological parameters, and describe how mitigation measures like lockdown are expected to affect their values. We aim to present these quantitative relationships in a manner that is accessible to the widest audience possible. We hope that better communicating the intricacies of epidemiological models will improve our collective understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and will help avoid possible pitfalls when using them.

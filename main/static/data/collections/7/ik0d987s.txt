BACKGROUND Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important cause of hospital admission and death, but the extent of the problem of CAP at the primary healthcare level is largely unknown. AIMS To investigate the contribution of general practitioners (GPs) to the management of patients with CAP in the Netherlands. METHODS The study population consisted of all people enlisted in a GP network. We obtained information on CAP episodes from GP electronic records (using ICPC code R81) during the years 2002-2009. CAP registrations were also obtained from national hospital discharge data (ICD-9 codes) and cause of death statistics (ICD-10 codes). The three registration systems were linked at the individual level. We used descriptive analyses to estimate the annual number of CAP episodes (i.e. defined as a CAP diagnosis within 30 days). RESULTS From 2002 to 2009 the mean annual size of the study population was 395,039. For this population, 3,700 (0.9%) CAP episodes per year were registered in at least one of the registration systems, 2,933 (79%) of which were in the GP system only. Recovery within 30 days occurred on average in 95% (2,791/2,933) of the CAP episodes annually registered by a GP, while 2.3% (67/2,933) of patients with a GP-registered CAP episode were admitted to hospital within 30 days and 1% (26/2,933) had a fatal outcome within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS The vast majority of CAP episodes registered in the Netherlands are managed successfully at the GP level without hospitalisation.

Abstract The enantiomerically pure carbocyclic purine and pyrimidine C-nucleosides 1â€“4 were synthesized via the key intermediate, 2,3-(isopropylidenedioxy)-4-(trityloxymethyl)-4-cyclopenten-1-ol (5), which was prepared from d-ribose in eight steps. Synthesized compounds were evaluated as potential antiviral agents against HIV, SARSCoV, Punta Toro, West Nile, and Cowpox viruses. However, only 9-deazaneplanocin A (1) exhibited moderate anti-HIV activity.

Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a common respiratory virus that causes moderately severe infections. We have previously shown that the virus uses heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as the initial attachment factors, facilitating viral entry into the cell. In the present study, we show that the membrane protein (M) of HCoV-NL63 mediates this attachment. Using viruslike particles lacking the spike (S) protein, we demonstrate that binding to the cell is not S protein dependent. Furthermore, we mapped the M protein site responsible for the interaction with HSPG and confirmed its relevance using a viable virus. Importantly, in silico analysis of the region responsible for HSPG binding in different clinical isolates and the Amsterdam I strain did not exhibit any signs of cell culture adaptation. IMPORTANCE It is generally accepted that the coronaviral S protein is responsible for viral interaction with a cellular receptor. Here we show that the M protein is also an important player during early stages of HCoV-NL63 infection and that the concerted action of the two proteins (M and S) is a prerequisite for effective infection. We believe that this study broadens the understanding of HCoV-NL63 biology and may also alter the way in which we perceive the first steps of cell infection with the virus. The data presented here may also be important for future research into vaccine or drug development.

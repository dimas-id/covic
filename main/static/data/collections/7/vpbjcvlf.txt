To report feasibility, safety, and technical advantages of flat-detector computed tomography perfusion (FD-CTP) during balloon test occlusion (BTO) angiography studies, 10 patients patients scheduled for BTO were evaluated. Cerebral blood volume maps were extracted from FD-CTP images acquired during the test. The FD-CTP perfusion combined with BTO is feasible and safe in intracranial tumor, and aneurysm cases in which vessel sacrifice should be considered.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart audit. OBJECTIVES: Describing the respiratory complications and their predictive factors in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injuries at C5–T5 level during the initial hospitalization. SETTING: Hospital Vall d’Hebron, Barcelona. METHODS: Data from patients admitted in a reference unit with acute traumatic injuries involving levels C5–T5. Respiratory complications were defined as: acute respiratory failure, respiratory infection, atelectasis, non-hemothorax pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism or haemoptysis. Candidate predictors of these complications were demographic data, comorbidity, smoking, history of respiratory disease, the spinal cord injury characteristics (level and ASIA Impairment Scale) and thoracic trauma. A logistic regression model was created to determine associations between potential predictors and respiratory complications. RESULTS: We studied 174 patients with an age of 47.9 (19.7) years, mostly men (87%), with low comorbidity. Coexistent thoracic trauma was found in 24 (19%) patients with cervical and 35 (75%) with thoracic injuries (p < 0.001). Respiratory complications were frequent (53%) and were associated to longer hospital stay: 83.1 (61.3) and 45.3 (28.1) days in patients with and without respiratory complications (p < 0.001). The strongest predictors of respiratory complications were: previous respiratory disease (OR 5.4, 95% CI: 1.5–19.2), complete motor function impairment (AIS A–B) (OR 4.7, 95% CI: 2.4–9.5) and concurrent chest trauma (OR 3.73, 95% CI: 1.8–7.9). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory complications are common in traumatic spinal cord injuries between C5–T5. We identified previous respiratory disease, complete motor function impairment and the coexistence of thoracic trauma as predictors of respiratory complications. Identification of patients at risk might help clinicians to implement preventive strategies.

Abstract An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting serum antibodies to the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) was established by using cell culture-grown PEDV as antigen for coating. Ultracentrifugation through 20 and 45% (w/w) sucrose cushion proved to be the best antigen purification method. Examination of 1024 swine sera showed a high specificity and a greater sensitivity of the ELISA, when compared with indirect immunofluorescence. Reference sera with high antibody titers to PEDV originated from two pigs experimentally infected with PEDV. Three different antigen purification methods and the advantages of the ELISA compared with an immunofluorescence test are discussed.

For the healthcare professional dealing with infections presents two main problems. First, managing detainees or police personnel who have contracted a disease and may be infectious or unwell, and second, handling complainants of assault, including police officers, who have potentially been exposed to an infectious disease. This chapter addresses some general principles of infection control and safety in the working environment and then goes on to discuss some infections that may be encountered in police custody and how they can best be managed.

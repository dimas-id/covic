The current coronavirus pandemic has reached global proportions and requires unparalleled collective and individual efforts to slow its spread. One critically important issue is the proper sterilization of physical objects that have been contaminated by the virus. Here, we review the currently existing literature on thermal inactivation of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and present preliminary guideless on temperatures and exposure durations required to sterilize. We also compare these temperatures/exposure durations with potential household appliances that may be thought capable of performing sterilization.

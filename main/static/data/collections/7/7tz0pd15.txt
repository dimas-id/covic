The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the entire world to stop. Silence occupies side streets while emptiness cleanses our oceans and skies. For those who have the privilege of staying home, the world feels frozen. Everything and everyone are paused, with the exception of healthcare and other essential workers. On the front lines, physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and other healthcare workers are overwhelmed. Emergency rooms are inundated, and intensive care units are besieged with COVID-19 patients.

Abstract Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Its roots have been used for anti-inflammation, anticancer, antiviral and antibacterial infections of the respiratory and the gastrointestinal tract, cleaning away heat, moistening aridity, purging fire, detoxifying toxicosis, reducing the total cholesterol level and decreasing blood pressures. Baicalin, baicalein, wogonin and oroxylin A are its main active components. This review provides an overview of various separation, detection, and identification techniques employed for the quantitative and qualitative determination of these active components. Applications of high-performance liquid chromatography, high-speed counter-current chromatography, thin layer chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography to the separation and determination of these active components are described. Examples of identification of these active components and their metabolites in complex matrices by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry are also presented. The advantages and limitations of these separation and identification methods are assessed and discussed.

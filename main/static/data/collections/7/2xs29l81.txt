Background In the absence of direct data on ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 related mortality in the UK, we examine the relationship between ethnic composition of an area and rate of mortality in the area. Methods Ecological analysis using COVID-19 related mortality rates occurring by 24th April 2020, and ethnic composition of the population, across local authorities in England and Wales. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. Results For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19 related deaths increased by 5.10 (3.99 to 6.21) per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined. The size of this increase is a little reduced in a fully adjusted model, suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas. This estimate suggests that the average England and Wales COVID-19 related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with twice the average number of ethnic minority people. Discussion We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19 related mortality within a local authority increase as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities, including among key workers, driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination. We argue that these factors should be central to any investigation of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes.

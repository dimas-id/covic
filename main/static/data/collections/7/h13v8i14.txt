Abstract Aims & Background The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world. The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China. Methods A comprehensive search of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention official websites and announcements was performed between 20 Jan 2019 and 29 Feb 2020. The relevant data of the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. Results& findings Up to 29 Feb 2020, 79,824 confirmed cases with the COVID-19 including 66,907 in Hubei Province and 12,377 in other administrative regions were reported. The SARS-COV-2 showed faster epidemic trends compared with the 2003-SARS-CoV. A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, with a mortality of 3.6%. The mortality of the COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1% versus 0.84%). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased. Conclusions The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies.

Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is a widespread infection that has created a bad memory in Africa. In the 2014 and 2015 outbreak, more than 28,000 infections were reported by the World Health Organization, with about 11,300 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5), termed also GRP78, is a host cell chaperone protein responsible for the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under stress, HSPA5 is upregulated and becomes cell-surface exposed. Recent studies report the association of cell-surface HSPA5 with EBOV glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. In this study, structural and sequence analysis and molecular docking are used to predict the possible binding site between the cell-surface HSPA5 and EBOV GP1. The results show a promising binding site that supports the hypothesis of HSPA5 selectivity for binding to a specific peptide sequence (pep42). This study paves the way to suggest possible inhibitors to stop viral association with cell-surface receptors and subsequently reduce viral infection.

Medical management of mechanically ventilated patients is challenging to novice providers. Incorrect management of this population may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. A three-day simulation-based boot camp serves to provide one-on-one instruction with a critical care provider. These intensivists may dispense personalized immediate feedback as learners engage in hands-on practice with a real mechanical ventilator. Multiple different pathologies can be reviewed that may not be encountered in the clinical setting. Learners can visualize immediate consequences of their actions and may troubleshoot and ask questions, all while in a safe learning environment. We describe the use of human-patient simulators connected to breathing simulators and mechanical ventilators. Potential curriculum executors should be aware of the cost of the equipment and the time needed to dedicate to boot camp execution; however, this intensive interactive training has been shown to increase provider competency, knowledge, and confidence in ventilator management. This curriculum outline provides guidance on how to execute a simulation-based boot camp to train providers on the management of mechanically ventilated patients.

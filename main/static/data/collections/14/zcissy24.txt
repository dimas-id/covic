Worldwide, we observe an increasing focus on fostering well-being in adolescents. This is reflected in growing research in the field of care. However, empirical research is lacking that focuses on the relationship between components of care: receiving care, self-care and extending care. This lack of research is mirrored in the lack of valid measures for assessing care competencies in educational contexts. The present research, therefore, has four goals: 1) to create a valid and reliable scale assessing levels of care competencies based on the multifaceted and multidimensional concept of care; 2) to explore the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and care competencies in adolescents; 3) to examine the psychological outcomes associated with different levels of care competencies in adolescents; 4) to explore the interaction of the three care dimensions in predicting adolescents’ well-being. Based on data from 742 adolescents, a reliable and valid scale could be developed with six subscales: Receiving care, self-care and extending care, with each of them falling apart in care competencies and care failures. Gender, age and academic achievement were related to care competencies/failures. Findings support the link between adolescents’ well-being and care competencies/failures. These results have implications for promoting adolescents’ well-being through school-based care-cultivation programs.

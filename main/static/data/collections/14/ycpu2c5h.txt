Background: With the increasing body of knowledge in molecular biology, gene transfer respectively gene therapy becomes more and more a valid therapeutic option. Methods: This is a critical review of gene therapy protocols for treatment of different types of cancer. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanism, therapeutically strategies as well as experimental approaches toward gene transfer in septic shock and organ transplantation are critically elucidated. Results: Gene transfer as a therapeutic option was first successfully applied in children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in 1990. The majority of gene marking or gene therapy protocols approved for human clinical trials to date are related to the treatment of cancer. Besides viral vectors for brain tumors, non-viral vectors, liposomes particularly, with almost no side effects are increasingly used. Conclusions: Different approaches of gene transfer in cancer patients are under investigation. Experimental data of septic shock treatment and rejection therapy of the allograft in organ recipients with gene transfer are encouraging for future applications in clinical trials.

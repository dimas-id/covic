Although the principles of burn management are still primarily focused on survival, as advances are realized in resuscitation, nutrition, and wound management, the functional and aesthetic outcomes following burn injury have become increasingly important. Acellular dermal matrix materials, which allow surgeons to minimize skin graft donor site morbidity in the process of repairing injured areas, play a role in addressing these important issues. Many favorable reports have been published, but they are generally characterized by small sample sizes, limited objective testing, and retrospective analysis. There does appear to be some evidence for ADM application in patient populations in whom donor site availability (those with massive burns) or morbidity (children, the elderly) is a concern, but more studies are needed. In this article, the authors discuss the current applications for ADM in burn management, review the existing literature, and present opportunities for future research.

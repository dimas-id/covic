Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a significant complications in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate if traditional vs. single-use instrumentation had an effect on SSI's. We compared SSI rates and costs of TKAs performed with single-use (449) and traditional (169) TKA instrumentation trays. Total OR Time was, on average, 30 min less when single-use instrumentation was used. SSIs decreased in the single-use group (n=1) compared to the traditional group (n=5) (P=0.006). Single-use instrumentation added $490 in initial costs; however it saved between $480 and $600. Single-use instrumentation may provide a benefit to the patient by potentially decreasing the risk of infection and reducing the overall hospital costs.

In the long-term care setting The diagnosis of infection is primarily based from the clinical assessment. Infection is a common cause of fever, when present, and acute change in functional status. Infection can often present atypically; usual symptoms, physical findings, and diagnostic abnormalities may be lacking. Evaluation of fever and suspected infection should initially focus on the most common clinical syndromes. Treatment should initially focus on the most common organisms that are present at the most likely suspect site of infection.

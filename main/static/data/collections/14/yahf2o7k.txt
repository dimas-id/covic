The coordination of influenza pandemic preparedness planning within Europe is especially important for Germany with 10 out of 16 LÃ¤nder (regions) bordering neighbouring countries. The language barrier presents only one of the challenges to overcome. Creating a European early warning system by linking national surveillance structures and the development of a communication network are important initial achievements. Several instruments have been designed and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has already played a major role in the coordination of this process. It has also led the assessment of preparedness and planning by Member States. The speed of the European Member States in preparing for and the foci they have chosen when dealing with an influenza outbreak are heterogeneous. The simultaneous analysis presented here from European, national and regional points of view aims to identify both opportunities and risks of this diversity in Europe for coping with a new pandemic. Regional and local initiatives for cross-border measures and crisis management will play a central role in achieving successful influenza pandemic preparedness in Europe.

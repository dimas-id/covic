In the field of medicine and cardiology newer therapy and devices have been launched with a huge promise and a lot of hype. Unfortunately, over the course of time, a good many of them like biovascular scaffold, renal denervation and intra-aortic balloon pump have failed to live up to their initial promise so much so that some of them have been withdrawn. The reason for this downfall may be multifold from incomplete understanding of the patho-physiology of disease, incomplete understanding of mechanism of action of the therapy, in-appropriate application in clinical practice, in-efficient therapy development related to flawed trial design, regulatory impediments placed on the trials or deficits in application of scientific techniques. Here-in we investigate the specific reason for failure for some of these therapies and attempt to suggest a way forward.

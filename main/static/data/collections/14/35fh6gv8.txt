In the following paper Rory Bell and David Eckersall give a clinical introduction to the diagnostic use of Acute Phase Protein analysis in small animal medicine. David Eckersall is the leading expert in this field in the world and has presented his research findings widely over the last few years. This included a series of lectures at the American College of Veterinary Pathology meeting in 2006, which was reported in summary in this column (March 2007). The following review is timely and relevant because these tests are now increasingly commercially available and have a significant impact on diagnosis and case management.

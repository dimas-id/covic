This is a brief review of the history of the role of acellular dermal matrices in breast reconstruction surgery, with a summary of several currently available products, including a table of comparisons. Key features, including biologic tissue source, surgical preparation, sterility, polarity, contraindications, shelf life, and cost, are examined. A paucity of data exists to directly compare AlloDerm®, DermaMatrix®, Strattice™, Permacol™, DermACELL, FlexHD®, SurgiMend®, and ALLOMAX™ for breast reconstruction; most studies relate to hernia repair. An ideal acellular dermal matrix product is still unavailable but the information provided in this review should facilitate a breast surgeons decision-making process.

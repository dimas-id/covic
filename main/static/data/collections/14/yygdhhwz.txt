Minimal-disease (MD) cats raised in a barrier-maintained feline breeding colony routinely become coronavirus (CV) antibody-positive at 5–8 weeks of age and remain seropositive indefinitely. In addition, they shed coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) in their feces which are morphologically distinct from “typical” coronaviruses. Oronasal, intraperitoneal, intraduodenal, and intravenous inoculations of CVLPs were uniformly unsuccessful in the seroconversion of cats to CV, whereas subsequent prolonged close contact with colony cats did result in seroconversion. Such evidence indicates that MD cats in this barrier colony are infected with at least two non-cross-reactive agents: (1) feline enteric CVLPs, which are shed in feces and are morphologically and antigenically distinct from established coronaviruses (CVs), and (2) a virus which is antigenically cross-reactive with CVs, but which is apparently shed by some route other than the lower gastrointestinal tract.

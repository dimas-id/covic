Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a common and life-threatening event in cancer patients. It is the leading cause of admission to ICU among the patients with hematologic and solid malignancies and is often associated with poor outcome. Timely identification of the cause of ARF and the initiation of the appropriate therapy may improve the survival. Pulmonary infections represent the leading cause of ARF in those patients, and unless proven otherwise, ARF must be considered as an infectious emergency. Noninfectious causes of ARF include cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute pulmonary embolism, and complications related both to the underlying malignancy and the toxic effects of chemotherapy. This chapter reviews the most common causes of ARF in oncologic patients and discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic approach before ICU admission.

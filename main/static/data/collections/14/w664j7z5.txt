The trend of massive disintermediation is threatening the livelihood of travel agents. This paper investigates the disintermediation of travel agents in the hospitality industry when hotels take distribution back into their own hands by setting up websites that allow guests to make bookings online. We analyze the factors affecting an agent's possible responses to a hotel's destructive acts, and put forward suggestions to agents to fight against the trend of disintermediation. We also point out what hotels can do to improve the quality of their relationship with their agents should they decide to launch their online channel.

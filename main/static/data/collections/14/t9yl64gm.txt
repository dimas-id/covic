BACKGROUND This is a 2-year study to evaluate the feasibility; outcomes in terms of postoperative pain, weight loss, and complication rates; and cosmesis of the single-incision sleeve gastrectomy versus the conventional multiport sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS A prospective comparative analysis was done in 300 patients in each arm who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and single-incision sleeve gastrectomy from September 2009 till January 2012. Both groups were matched for age and BMI. Postoperative pain scoring was done using visual analogue scale. Outcomes in terms of pain score, scar satisfaction score, excess weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities, and complications were compared in both groups at the end of 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. RESULTS Female patients preferred to undergo single-incision sleeve gastrectomy. Operating time and intraoperative blood loss were comparable in both groups. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring revealed lesser postoperative pain in the single-incision group. Excess weight loss and resolution of co-morbidities were also comparable in both groups at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Incisional hernia was seen in 3 patients (1%) in the single-incision group. Leak rate was comparable. Cosmetic satisfaction was superior in patients who underwent single-incision surgery. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcomes are comparable in both groups at the end of 2 years. The myth of high long-term incisional hernia rate after single-incision surgery has been dispelled. Single-incision surgery is less painful with better cosmesis. It has come of age and should no longer be considered as an experimental procedure.

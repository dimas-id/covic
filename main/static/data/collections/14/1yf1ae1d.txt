The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can be transmitted via respiratory secretions. Since there are currently no specific therapeutics or vaccines available against the SARS-CoV-2, the commen nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are still the main measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Face mask wearing is one important measure to suppress the pandemic. In order to know how efficient is face mask wearing in reducing the pandemic even with low efficiency non-professional face masks, we exploit physical abstraction to model the non-professional face masks made from cotton woven fabrics and characterize them by a parameter virus penetration rate (VPR){gamma}. Monte Carlo simulations exhibit that the effective reproduction number R of COVID-19 or similar pandemics can be approximately reduced by factor {gamma}4 with respect to the basic reproduction number R0,if the face masks with 70% <{gamma}< 90% are universally applied for the entire network. Furthermore, thought experiments and practical exploitation examples in country-level and city-level are enumerated and discussed to support our discovery in this study and indicate that the outbreak of a COVID-19 like pandemic can be even suppressed by the low efficiency non-professional face masks.

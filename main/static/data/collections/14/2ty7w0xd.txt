Objective@#To investigate awareness of digestive system injury caused by corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in gastroenterologists.@*Methods@#From February 21 to 23 in 2020, the electronic questionnaire was sent out to explore the condition of the basic knowledge of COVID-19 and knowledge of digestive system injury caused by COVID-19 grasped by gastroenterologists. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis.@*Results@#A total of 2 216 gastroenterologists from 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities nationwide completed the survey. 99.7% (2 209/2 216) of gastroenterologists stated that they had read the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines. The percentage of physicians who well knew the diagnostic criteria of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 34.9% (774/2 216) and 39.4% (874/2 216), respectively. The percentage of physician who gave the right answer of COVID-19 detectable methods and lung imaging was 68.4% (1 516/2 216) and 71.6% (1 586/2 216), respectively. The percentage of correct answer of digestive system injury caused by COVID-19 in residents, attending physicians, associate chief physicians and chief physicians was 30.9% (134/433), 33.9% (234/691), 32.4% (213/657) and 34.9% (152/435), respectively, however there were no statistically significant differences among physicians of different level (&#x03C7;2=6.60, P&gt; 0.05). 95.6% (2 119/2 216) of gastroenterologists believed that probiotics could effectively improve bowel function, and 94.0% (2 082/2 216) of gastroenterologists considered that enteral nutrition support could improve patientsâ€™ prognosis.@*Conclusions@#The knowledge and dynamic progress of the digestive system injury caused of COVID-19 are still insufficiently grasped by gastroenterologists in China. So it is necessary to carry out systematic and pertinent training for them.

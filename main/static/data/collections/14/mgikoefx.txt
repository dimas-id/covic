Viral infections have become increasingly recognized as a significant cause of asthma exacerbations, mainly because of improved viral detection techniques. Unfortunately, the ability to specifically treat viral infections and to limit the asthma morbidity associated with these agents has not kept pace with diagnostic technology. This article focuses on current concepts of the epidemiology of viruses in asthma exacerbations, investigations studying the physiologic and immunologic consequences of viral infection, and potential therapies to minimize virally-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. To impact this significant health problem, researchers must definitively ascertain the mechanisms by which viruses induce airway reactivity and must develop rational, safe approaches to prevent the consequences of viral infection in the patient with asthma.

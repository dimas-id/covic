Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), an RNA virus which has caused pandemic in the whole world. It has put an unprecedented burden on healthcare system globally, and neither obstetricians nor labour rooms are spared as deliveries and caesarean sections cannot be postponed. There is a threat of collapse of healthcare system in maternity wards and labour rooms due to risk for transmission to healthy patients, obstetricians, midwives and other staff. It is not possible to screen all pregnant women especially in developing countries but due to asymptomatic cases, risk of infection looms large. Many countries including India have declared lockdown to stop the transmission but delivery services have to continue. Proper planning and division of the healthcare system into COVID-positive and negative areas with separate staff can help minimise the spread and preserve precious resources. Hospital staff must protect themselves by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in COVID-positive and suspected cases.

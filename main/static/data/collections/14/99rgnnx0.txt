Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic loss to the cattle industry. The continued high prevalence of the disease underlines a gap in understanding of the host immune response to respiratory infection. The host immune response is beneficial and detrimental, required for clearing the disease but often leading to tissue damage and long-term defects in lung function. This article highlights advancements made in understanding innate and adaptive immunity in BRD, factors that predispose animals to BRD, and novel intervention strategies that may lead to changes in the approach to treating and controlling BRD.

BACKGROUND The relationship between adenovirus infection and Kawasaki disease (KD) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between adenovirus infection and KD using a cohort study in Taiwan. METHODS We used Taiwan National Health Insurance data (from 2000 to 2008) to conduct a population-based cohort study, analyzing children that was under 18 years of age. In total, 5,280 children had adenovirus infection, and 5,280 children without adenovirus infection were matched and followed up. Subsequent KD was the major outcome event. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of developing KD associated with adenovirus infection. RESULTS There was a significantly higher cumulative incidence of KD in the adenovirus-infected cohort than that in the non-infected cohort (log-rank test, p < 0.001). In the adenovirus-infected cohort, overall incidence of KD was 5.29 times higher than that of the non-infected cohort (adjusted HR 5.29, 95% CI: 2.48-11.3). Increased KD risk was associated with previous adenovirus infection in children aged 3 to 5 years, in female patients, in those with a low urbanization level, and in those with allergies. CONCLUSION An association between previous adenovirus infection and KD was identified in Taiwanese children, but other potential risk factors were not fully analyzed. The relationship between infection and KD requires further study.

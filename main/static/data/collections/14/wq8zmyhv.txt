Cardiovascular disease is characterized by its highest morbidity and mortality. One of the main pathological basis of this disease is the dysregulation of gene expression. Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a kind of functional RNA, which is transcript from DNA but not translated into proteins. More and more studies have established the important roles of ncRNAs, including transcription, RNA maturation, translation, protein degradation, and their involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This chapter will focus on the biological functions of ncRNAs and their advances in cardiovascular disease. With the development of sequencing and computer technology, more and more databases can be easily obtained on the internet. In another part of this chapter, we will summarize some commonly used non-coding RNA databases, which can be easily and quickly used for relevant research.

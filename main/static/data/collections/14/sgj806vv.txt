Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Despite the availability of medical therapy it remains a challenge to treat. Autonomic nervous system imbalance resulting in overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and under activity of the parasympathetic nervous system is integral in the development of hypertension and ultimately the development of HHD. Emerging data suggest that neuromodulation device therapy for treatment of HHD is promising.

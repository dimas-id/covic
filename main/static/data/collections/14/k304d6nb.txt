BACKGROUND Although fever is recognised as a major presentation symptom at Emergency Departments (EDs) and is often used as a rationale for the institution of antibiotics, few studies describing patients with fever as the sole inclusion criterion at the ED of a general hospital have been performed. The objective of this study is to describe epidemiology of non-surgical febrile patients at the ED and to identify risk factors for adverse outcome. METHODS Blood, sputum, urine and faeces cultures, urine sediments and throat swaps for viral diagnostics were obtained from febrile ED patients. Outcome parameters were bacterial/viral infection, non-bacterial/non-viral infection, non-infectious febrile disease; mortality, hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and length of hospital stay. RESULTS 213 Patients were included (87.8% were hospitalised, 8.5% were admitted to ICU, 4.2% died). In 75 patients (35.2%), bacterial infection was confirmed; in 78 patients (36.6%) bacterial infection was suspected. In nine patients (4.2%), viral diagnosis was confirmed; in six patients (2.8%), a viral condition was suspected. The most frequently encountered infection was bacterial pneumonia (58 patients, 27.2%). Only older age was correlated with mortality (œÅ=0.176, p=0.01). CONCLUSION A majority of the febrile patients were admitted to the hospital, mostly for bacterial infection. An overall mortality rate of 4.2% was registered. Only a few risk factors for adverse outcome could be identified in this cohort. Overall, the outcome of patients presenting with fever at the ED is rather benign.

In the present study, computer-assisted searches for sequence similarities were performed with amino acid sequences from mammalian reovirus proteins. These analysis revealed that many proteins of reovirus are partially similar to known viral or cellular proteins. Consensus sequences have been identified that are in accordance with already suspected functions of reovirus proteins. The analysis has also revealed unexpected similarities of some reovirus proteins with specific classes of proteins which sequences are present in the databases. This could suggest yet unidentified activities for some of the reovirus proteins.

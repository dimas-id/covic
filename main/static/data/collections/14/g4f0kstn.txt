The ARQMath Lab at CLEF 2020 considers the problem of finding answers to new mathematical questions among posted answers on a community question answering site (Math Stack Exchange). Queries are question postings held out from the test collection, each containing both text and at least one formula. We expect this to be a challenging task, as both math and text may be needed to find relevant answer posts. While several models have been proposed for text question answering, math question answering is in an earlier stage of development. To advance math-aware search and mathematical question answering systems, we will create a standard test collection for researchers to use for benchmarking. ARQMath will also include a formula retrieval sub-task: individual formulas from question posts are used to locate formulas in earlier answer posts, with relevance determined by narrative fields created based on the original question. We will use these narrative fields to explore diverse information needs for formula search (e.g., alternative notation, applications in specific fields or definition).

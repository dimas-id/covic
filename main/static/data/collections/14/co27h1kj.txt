The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and exemplifies the general threat to global health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we developed CoV3D, a database and molecular viewer of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus protein structures updated weekly. CoV3D annotates structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Additionally, CoV3D provides information on spike glycoprotein sequence variability and polymorphisms, and maps these features onto the spike structure in the integrated molecular viewer. In order to further aid structure-based design and analysis, CoV3D includes viewable and downloadable spike glycoprotein structures with modeled glycosylation from Rosetta. CoV3D is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.

Field epidemiology training programs have been successful models to address a country's needs for a skilled public health workforce, partly due to their responsiveness to the countries' unique needs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has partnered with ministries of health to strengthen their workforce through customized competency-based training programs. While desirable, emphasis on program flexibility can result in redundancy and inconsistency. To address this challenge, the ADDIE model (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) of instructional design was used by a cross-functional team to guide completion of a standard curriculum based on 15 competencies. The standard curriculum has supported the development and expansion of programs while still allowing for adaptation. This article describes the process that was used to develop the curriculum, which, together with needs assessment and evaluation, is crucial for successful training programs.

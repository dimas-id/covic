Abstract Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to healthcare organizations worldwide. A steadily rising number of patients requiring intensive care, a large proportion from racial and ethnic minorities, demands creative solutions to provide high-quality care while ensuring healthcare worker safety in the face of limited resources. Boston Medical Center has been particularly affected due to the underserved patient population we care for and the increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods: We present protocol modifications developed to manage patients with acute ischemic stroke in a safe and effective manner while prioritizing judicious use of personal protective equipment and intensive care unit resources. Conclusion: We feel this information will benefit other organizations facing similar obstacles in caring for the most vulnerable patient populations during this ongoing public health crisis.

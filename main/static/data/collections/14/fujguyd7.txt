PURPOSE OF REVIEW Severe childhood obesity, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) greater than the 99th percentile for age and gender, is rising in most countries and is associated with early morbidity and mortality. Optimal management of the health of the child with obesity requires a multidisciplinary approach that identifies and treats associated derangements. RECENT FINDINGS Lifestyle interventions such as diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy for the severely obese pediatric patient are generally not effective. Few centers worldwide offer bariatric surgery for adolescents in a multidisciplinary setting, and we are the only center that offers a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates bariatric surgery for severely obese children and adolescents across all age groups. In this paper, we review up-to-date evidence in this subject including ours, and provide details on the multidisciplinary approach to pediatric obesity that accommodates bariatric surgery for children across all age groups.

Dogs given nonmyeloablative conditioning and marrow grafts from two dog leukocyte antigen- (DLA) identical littermate donors developed stable trichimerism and stably accepted a subsequent kidney graft from one of the marrow donors without the need for immunosuppression. Here, we used trichimeras to evaluate strategies of adoptive immunotherapy to solid tumors, using the kidney as a tumor surrogate. Three DLA-identical trichimeric recipients were established by simultaneously infusing marrow from two DLA-identical donor dogs into a DLA-identical recipient conditioned with 2 Gy total body irradiation and given a short course of postgrafting immunosuppression. After confirming stable hematopoietic engraftment, a kidney was transplanted from one of the two marrow donors into each respective trichimeric recipient. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from each kidney donor were then used to sensitize the alternate marrow donor. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) from the sensitized dogs were given to the trichimeric recipients, whereupon chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and kidney rejection were monitored. After DLI, we observed both prompt rejection of the transplanted marrow-donor kidney and disappearance of corresponding hematopoietic chimerism. Presumably, owing to shared minor histocompatibility antigens, host chimerism also disappeared and GvHD in skin, gut, and liver developed. The native kidneys, while showing lymphocytic infiltration, remained functionally normal. The current study demonstrated that under certain experimental conditions, the kidney, an organ ordinarily not involved in graft-versus-host reactions, can be targeted by sensitized donor lymphocytes.

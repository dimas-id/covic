Abstract Numerous host factors are required for the efficient replication of rotavirus, including the activation and inactivation of several cell signaling pathways. One of the cellular structures that are reorganized during rotavirus infection is the actin cytoskeleton. In this work, we report that the dynamics of the actin microfilaments are important at different stages of the virus life cycle, specifically, during virus internalization and viral RNA synthesis at 6 h post-infection. Our results show that the actin-binding proteins alpha-actinin 4 and Diaph, as well as the Rho-family small GTPase Cdc42 are necessary for an efficient virus entry, while GTPase Rac1 is required for maximal viral RNA synthesis.

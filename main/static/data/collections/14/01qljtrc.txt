Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a mysterious and lethal disease of cats. The causative agent, feline coronavirus (FCoV), is ubiquitous in most feline populations, yet the disease is sporadic in nature. Mutations in the infecting virus combined with an inappropriate immune response to the FCoV contribute to the development of FIP. Diagnosis can be challenging because signs may be vague, clinical pathology parameters are nonspecific, and the gold standard for diagnosis is invasive: histopathology of affected tissue. This article discusses the developments in the understanding of this disease as well as the progress in diagnosis and treatment.

In this paper, we first introduce a new family of operators on weighted graphs called p-bilaplacian operators, which are the analogue on graphs of the continuous p-bilaplacian operators. We then turn to study regularized variational and boundary value problems associated to these operators. For instance, we study their well-posedness (existence and uniqueness). We also develop proximal splitting algorithms to solve these problems. We finally report numerical experiments to support our findings.

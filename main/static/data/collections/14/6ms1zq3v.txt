OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to increase education and awareness among pediatric practitioners of possibility of simultaneous hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease/Kikuchi disease occurring in the pediatric population and the diagnostic dilemma it can present. We describe a case presentation of acquired and self-limited simultaneous hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease in a 16-year-old in the United States who presented with fevers, night sweats, and joint pain, along with tiredness and decreased appetite along with pancytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. To the best of our knowledge, simultaneous hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Kikuchi-Fujimoto in the pediatric population has not been described in North America but remains fairly common in Asia. The literature on both diseases and their simultaneous occurrence is comprehensively reviewed. METHODS This was a case report and review of the literature. RESULTS The patient was diagnosed with both hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease based on bone marrow aspiration/biopsy and axillary node biopsy, respectively. Both illnesses resolved completely. CONCLUSIONS Benign causes of pancytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase exist, but they may not be always straightforward diagnostically. Bone marrow aspiration and lymph node biopsy may be helpful in ascertaining the diagnosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease may represent a continuum of illness.

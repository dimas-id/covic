Intracranial aneurysm is a leading cause of stroke. Its treatment has evolved over the past 2 decades. This review summarizes the treatment strategies for intracranial aneurysms from 3 different perspectives: open surgery approach, transluminal treatment approach, and new technologies being used or trialed. We introduce most of the available treatment techniques in detail, including contralateral clipping, wrapping and clipping, double catheters assisting coiling and waffle-cone technique, and so on. Data from major trials such as Analysis of Treatment by Endovascular approach of Non-ruptured Aneurysms (ATENA), Internal Subarachnoid Trial (ISAT), Clinical and Anatomical Results in the Treatment of Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (CLARITY), and Barrow Ruptured Aneurysm Trial (BRAT) as well as information from other clinical reports and local experience are reviewed to suggest a clinical pathway for treating different types of intracranial aneurysms. It will be a valuable supplement to the current existing guidelines. We hope it could help assisting real-time decision-making in clinical practices and also encourage advancements in managing the disease.

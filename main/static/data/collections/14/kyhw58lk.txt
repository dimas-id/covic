During childhood several adenovirus infections have to be experienced, each with another of the multiple types. The spectrum of associated diseases ranges from endemic, mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections to epidemic gastroenteritis, eye infections, cystitis and less frequently atypical pneumonia and severe infections of internal organs; however, the vast majority of adenovirus infections during childhood are not life threatening with the exception of the infrequent infections of neonates and the frequent infection of hematopoietic stem cell recipients (disseminated disease).

Standard uses of ligand-receptor docking typically focus on the association of candidate ligands with a single targeted receptor, but actual applications increasingly require comparisons across multiple receptors. This study demonstrates that comparative docking to multiple receptors can help to select homology models for virtual compound screening and to discover ligands that bind to one set of receptors but not to another, potentially similar, set. A serial docking algorithm is furthermore described that reduces the computational costs of such calculations by testing compounds against a series of receptor structures and discarding a compound as soon as it fails to satisfy specified bind/no bind criteria for each receptor. The algorithm also realizes substantial efficiencies by taking advantage of the fact that a ligand typically binds in similar conformations to similar receptors. Thus, once detailed docking has been used to fit a ligand into the first of a series of similar receptors, much less extensive calculations can be used for the remaining structures.

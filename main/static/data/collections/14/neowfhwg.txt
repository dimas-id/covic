OBJECTIVES: To develop a sensitive monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Vip3Aa in genetically modified (GM) crops and their products. RESULTS: Vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vips) are secreted by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and are known to be toxic to Lepidoptera species. Vip3Aa family proteins, Vip3Aa19 and Vip3Aa20, were successfully applied in GM crops to confer an effective and persistent insecticidal resistance. A sensitive monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA was developed to detect Vip3Aa in GM crops and their products. Two monoclonal antibodies were raised against the overexpressed and purified His-Vip3Aa20, were purified from mouse ascites and characterized. A sandwich ELISA method was developed using the 2G3-1D7 monoclonal antibody for capture and the biotin-labeled 1F9-1F5 monoclonal antibody for detection of Vip3Aa20. The linear detection range of the method was found to be approximately 31.25â€“500 pg/ml, with a sensitivity of 10.24 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The established ELISA was effective for detecting Vip3Aa family proteins other than Vip3Aa8, and was successfully applied in the detection of Vip3Aa20 and Vip3Aa19 expressed in transgenic maize and cotton.

The SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 3 million people and caused more than 240,000 death globally. Among the COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of people with other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease is much higher than others. More strikingly, the survival rate of diabetic patients is also much lower than in non-diabetic patients. In addition to the general damage of high glucose to cells and tissues, a recent discovery that high glucose activates interferon regulatory factor 15 promotes influenza virus -induced cytokine storm. This discovery may shed light on the high incidence of diabetes in COVID-19. Several diabetes prevention strategies together with recent significant data-driven diabetes prediction approaches, which may help COVID-19 treatments, have been proposed.

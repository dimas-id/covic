OBJECTIVES: N95 mask is essential for healthcare workers dealing with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, N95 mask causes discomfort breathing with marked reduction in air exchange. This study was designed to investigate whether the use of N95 mask affects rescuer's fatigue and chest compression quality during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). METHODS: After a brief review of CPR, each participant performed a 2-minute continuous chest compression on a manikin wearing N95 (N95 group, n = 40) or surgical mask (SM group, n = 40). Compression rate and depth, the proportions of correct compression rate, depth, complete chest recoil and hand position were documented. Participants' fatigue was assessed using Borg score. RESULTS: Significantly lower mean chest compression rate and depth were both achieved in the N95 group than in the SM group (p < 0.05, respectively). In addition, the proportion of correct compression rate (61 ± 19 vs. 75 ± 195, p = 0.0067), depth (67 ± 16 vs. 90 ± 14, p < 0.0001) and complete recoil (91 ± 16 vs. 98 ± 5%, p = 0.0248) were significantly decreased in the N95 group as compared to the SM group. At the end of compression, the Borg score in the N95 group was significantly higher than that in the SM group (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Wearing a N95 mask increases rescuer's fatigue and decreases chest compression quality during CPR. Therefore, the exchange of rescuers during CPR should be more frequent than that recommended in current guidelines when N95 masks are applied.

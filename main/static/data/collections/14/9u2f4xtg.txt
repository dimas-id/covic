PURPOSE Peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structures (PHOMS) are novel and not well characterized findings occurring in several disorders of the optic nerve. The aim of this study is to present two cases of tilted disc syndrome (TDS) and one case with optic disc drusen undergoing a multimodal imaging approach. METHODS In this case series, a qualitative evaluation of the OCTA findings in regions with PHOMS was performed. RESULTS Structural OCT revealed the presence of PHOMS. OCTA identified the presence of a vascular complex within this hyperreflective structure. CONCLUSIONS Assuming that PHOMS are thought to correspond to herniating nerve fibers or be secondary to axoplasmic stasis, this vascular complex may represent a displacement of the deeper vessels deputed at the irroration of the optic nerve into the retina or, alternatively, might be secondary to an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and a subsequent development of neovessels.

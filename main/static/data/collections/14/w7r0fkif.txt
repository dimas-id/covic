Understanding the epidemiology and improving vaccinal protection against the highly variable chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) requires the knowledge of circulating IBV serotypes/genotypes in defined geographic areas. Accordingly, the authors initiated a survey among the major poultry producers in Hungary in order to reveal the prevailing IBV serotypes in the country. Tracheal swabs and organ samples (caecal tonsils, kidneys, and trachea) were collected from broiler, layer, and meat-type breeder flocks, and were subjected to IBV detection by virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The IBV-positive samples were further characterised by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the S1 IBV gene. Seventeen out of the 26 submitted samples proved to be positive for IBV. Sequence analyses revealed ten 4/91 and six QX serotypes, and a single D274 type IB virus. One sample contained a mixture of QX and Massachusetts serotype viruses. Presumably most of the 4/91 and D274 type viruses were vaccine strains. The proportion of QX type viruses and their observed variation are in good agreement with the situation in a few other European countries. The detected viruses clustered largely according to their geographic origin, with a few exceptions. If updated regularly, the preliminary 'virus map' will be useful for the adjustment of vaccination protocols.

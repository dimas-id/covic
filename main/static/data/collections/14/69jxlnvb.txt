Maintenance of homeostasis at body barriers that are constantly challenged by microbes, toxins and potentially bioactive (macro)molecules requires complex, highly orchestrated mechanisms of protection. Recent discoveries in respiratory research have shed light on the unprecedented role of airway epithelial cells (AEC), which, besides immune cells homing to the lung, also significantly contribute to host defence by expressing membrane‐bound and soluble pattern recognition receptors (sPRR). Recent evidence suggests that distinct, evolutionary ancient, sPRR secreted by AEC might become activated by usually innocuous proteins, commonly referred to as allergens. We here provide a systematic overview on sPRR detectable in the mucus lining of AEC. Some of them become actively produced and secreted by AECs (like the pentraxins C‐reactive protein and pentraxin 3; the collectins mannose binding protein and surfactant proteins A and D; H‐ficolin; serum amyloid A; and the complement components C3 and C5). Others are elaborated by innate and adaptive immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages and T cells (like the pentraxins C‐reactive protein and pentraxin 3; L‐ficolin; serum amyloid A; and the complement components C3 and C5). Herein we discuss how sPRRs may contribute to homeostasis but sometimes also to overt disease (e.g. airway hyperreactivity and asthma) at the alveolar–air interface.

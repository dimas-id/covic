The conclusion chapter not only summarizes the main results of the research conducted for this book but also connects the events and discussions between the 1960s and 1980s to later political developments. It shows striking ideational and institutional continuity and reveals a substantial character of European integration: by relying on powerful political framings and discourses, as well as on sturdy institutions, the European Community/Union was able to move into areas that were not sanctioned by the treaties. The chapter further argues that to stay relevant, the EU research policy must be capable of breaking with the past and dramatically expand its mission to embrace the social and environmental challenges of the twenty-first century. In fact, with the existential threat of climate change and other global challenges, and the urgent need for socio-technological transformation at scale, opportunities and imperatives for European level activity in research might be greater than ever.

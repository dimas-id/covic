Sleeve gastrectomy is a rapid and less traumatic operation, which thus far is showing good resolution of comorbidities and good weight loss if a narrower channel is constructed than for the duodenal switch. There are potential intraoperative complications, which must be recognized and treated promptly. Like other bariatric operations, there are variations in the technique used. The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is being performed for super-obese and high-risk patients, but its indications have been increasing. A second-stage bariatric operation may be performed if necessary, with increased safety. Long-term results of LSG and further networking are anxiously awaited.

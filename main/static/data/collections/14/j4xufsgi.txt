Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is often unresectable at the time of the initial diagnosis, and the provision of a definite palliative benefit is important in patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety of percutaneous biliary stenting and to analyze whether percutaneous biliary stenting combined with radiotherapy (RT) prolonged the stent patency and survival time of patients. In total, the cases of 38 patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma that underwent percutaneous biliary stenting at the Navy General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed in the present study. Uncovered metallic stenting (UMS) combined with RT was administered to 25 patients, and UMS alone was administered to 13 patients. The records of early complications subsequent to percutaneous biliary stenting were collected, and the stent patency and survival times of patients were analyzed and compared between the two groups. The technical success rate of the procedure was 100% and the successful drainage rate was 86.8%. The overall early complication rate was 15.8% and the procedure-associated mortality rate was 2.6%. The median stent patency was 326 days in the UMS+RT group and 196 days in the UMS group (P=0.022). The UMS+RT group (median, 367 days) demonstrated a longer survival time compared with the UMS group (median, 267 days; P=0.025). Percutaneous biliary stenting offers a safe and effective method for the palliative treatment of patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and percutaneous biliary stenting combined with RT may prolong stent patency and patient survival time.

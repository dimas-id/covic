Health care–acquired viral respiratory infections are common and cause increased patient morbidity and mortality. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus are frequently transmitted in the hospital setting. Studies report decreased nosocomial transmission when aggressive infection control measures are implemented with more success using a multicomponent approach. Influenza vaccination of health care personnel has been shown to further decrease rates of transmission, thus mandatory vaccination is becoming more common. This article focuses on the epidemiology, transmission, and control of health care–associated respiratory viral infections.

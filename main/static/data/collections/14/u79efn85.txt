Following abdominal wall surgery, incisions are commonly sutured, stapled, or glued together by primary intention. Developments within the field of tissue engineering have led to the use of prosthetic meshes, with over 20 million meshes implanted each year worldwide. The function of the mesh is to hold together abdominal wall incisions and repair abdominal hernias. This has been demonstrated to be highly effective in some individuals; however, some patients have experienced postoperative complications, including dehiscence with further abdominal herniation (viscera protruding through the abdominal wall). Little is currently known about why these complications occur in a subset of patients who have had prosthetic mesh implants in abdominal wall repairs; therefore, this literature review examined existing studies identified via six electronic databases. A total of 463 studies were identified, of which 13 were included in this review. The results identified that the prosthetic mesh is highly successful in a large proportion of patients who have had a had a hernia repair in a range of locations; however, the prosthetic mesh has long-term complications, with rejection being observed in a subset of patients. The reason why the prosthetic is being rejected is still largely unknown, and therefore, further investigation needs to be carried out.

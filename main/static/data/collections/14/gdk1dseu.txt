Preexisting antibody to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) causes acceleration and enhancement of disease on subsequent infection of cats with FIPV. Other workers have shown that canine coronavirus (CCV) can infect cats subclinically, but have found no evidence of enhancement of, or protection against, subsequent FIPV infection. With various isolates of CCV, we determined that 1 strain of CCV can induce transient mild diarrhea in cats and, furthermore, that previous infection with CCV causes acceleration and enhancement of subsequent infection with FIPV. In addition, sequential inoculation of cats with another strain of CCV caused lesions indistinguishable from those of FIP, without exposure at any time to FIPV.

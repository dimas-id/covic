The infection with the novel SARS Cov-2 corona virus, the cause of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, possessing its origin in the Chinese province Hubei, has reached the extent of a global pandemic within a few months. After aerosol infection, most people experience mild respiratory infection with cold symptoms such as cough and fever, and healing within two weeks. In about 5% of those infected, however, a severe course develops with the occurrence of multiple sub pleural bronchopulmonary infiltrates and even death as a result of respiratory failure.

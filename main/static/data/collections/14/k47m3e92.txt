INTRODUCTION SARS-CoV-2 is dispersed from patients by talking, coughing and sneezing. The generated micro-droplets aerosols can travel up to 8 meters, stay suspended for long periods and preserve viral infectivity for a median of 2.7 hours. An unprotected person exposed to this cloud, might inhale a considerable amount of infectious viral doses, which will attach to the ACE 2 receptors on alveoli epithelium, resulting in infection. N95 respirators and surgical masks block 95% and 50-60% respectively of inhalable particles and protect the wearer from infection. Surgical masks and N95 without exhalation valve, protect both the wearer and the environment from carriers and sick people.

Among the emerging viruses, hantaviruses are being focused on more and more due to their increasing number and worldwide distribution. Transmission occurs via inhalation of aerosolized infected rodent excreta. The symptoms and course of disease vary with the infecting hantavirus species. The distribution of the different hantavirus species correlates with the geographical distribution of the virus-type-specific rodent host. Hantaviruses in Europe and Asia cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Infection with Puumala, the prevalent virus type in Germany, results in a more moderate form of HFRS, nephropathia epidemica. Infections with virus species on the American continents lead to a clinical picture with predominantly pulmonary pathology (hantaviral pulmonary syndrome). No specific antiviral therapy or approved vaccines are available for any hantavirus species. Controlling the rodent populations and avoiding contact with rodent excrement are the only measures that can be undertaken to contain and prevent infection.

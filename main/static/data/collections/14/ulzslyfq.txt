Hospital preparedness is a key step in strengthening a countryâ€™s ability to address any public health emergency of international concern caused by these diseases.

Methods The study was a cross-sectional study, and hospitals which provided consent were included. The estimated participants for the study were 54. Results The results were expressed in a descriptive manner. For the purpose of analysis, the questionnaire was redistributed based on the monitoring and evaluation framework of International Health Regulations and its core capacities.

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that knee effusion presence in those with knee osteoarthritis (OA) alters knee joint muscle activation patterns and sagittal plane mechanics during gait. METHODS Thirty-five patients with medial compartment knee OA were assessed for the presence of effusion using a brush test. Based on the results, they were assigned to the knee effusion (n = 17) and no knee effusion (n = 18) groups. Electromyograms from seven lower extremity muscles (lateral and medial gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris and the lateral and medial hamstrings), leg motion and ground reaction forces were recorded during self-selected walking. Isometric knee extensor, plantar flexor and knee flexor strength were measured. Discrete measures from angular knee motion and net external moment of force waveforms were identified. Principal component analysis extracted electromyographic waveform features. Analysis of variance models tested for main effects (group, muscle) and interactions (Î± = 0.05). Bonferroni post-hoc testing was employed. RESULTS No differences in age, body mass index, knee pain, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index scores, gait velocity and muscle strength were found between groups (P > 0.05). Individuals with effusion had a greater overall quadriceps activation and prolonged hamstring activation into mid-stance (P < 0.05). Knee joint flexion angles were higher (P < 0.05) and net external knee extension (KE) moments in mid to late stance lower in the effusion group. CONCLUSION Quadriceps and hamstrings activation during walking were altered when effusions were present. Increased knee flexion (KF) angles and decreased KE moment in mid-late stance provide a mechanical explanation for the effect of joint effusion on muscle activation in those with knee OA.

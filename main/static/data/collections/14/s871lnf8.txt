A 17-month-old previously healthy child presented with a 2-day history of inability to fully open his eyes and slight gait ataxia. In the month preceding admission, he had had low grade, intermittent fevers, followed by a nonproductive cough and sneezing. During hospital admission he lost deep tendon reflexes and was unable to walk. Lumbar puncture revealed abnormally high protein, and a nasopharyngeal specimen was positive for influenza A (pH1N1). He received intravenous immunoglobulin and oseltamivir with clinical improvement. Although it is difficult to ascertain whether pH1N1 or another microorganism was responsible for this toddler's neurologic syndrome, this is the first reported case of Miller Fisher syndrome associated with pH1N1. During pandemics, one may expect to see an increased incidence of uncommon neurologic complications of influenza.

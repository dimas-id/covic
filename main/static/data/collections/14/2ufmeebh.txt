BACKGROUND: No comprehensive analysis is available on the viral etiology and clinical characterization among children with severe acute lower respiratory tract infection (SALRTI) in Southern China. METHODS: Cohort of 659 hospitalized children (2 months to 14 years) with SALRTI admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in the Guangzhou from May 2015 to April 2018 was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens or induced sputum were tested for eight categories respiratory viral targets. The viral distribution and its clinical characters were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Viral pathogen was detected in 326 (49.5%) of children with SALRTI and there were 36 (5.5%) viral coinfections. Overall, the groups of viruses identified were, in descending order of prevalence: Influenza virus (IFV) (n = 94, 14.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 75, 11.4%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 56, 8.5%), adenovirus (ADV) (n = 55, 8.3%), parainfluenza (PIV) (n = 47, 7.1%), human coronavirus (HCoV) (n = 15, 2.3%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (n = 14, 2.1%) and human bocavirus (HBoV) (n = 11, 1.7%). The positive rate in younger children (< 5 years) was significantly higher than the positive rate detected in elder children (> 5 years) (52.5% vs 35.1%, P = 0.001). There were clear seasonal peaks for IFV, RSV, HRV, ADV, PIV, and HMPV. And the individuals with different viral infection varied significantly in terms of clinical profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections are present in a consistent proportion of patients admitted to the PICU. IFV, RSV, HRV, and ADV accounted for more than two‚Äêthirds of all viral SALRTI. Our findings could help the prediction, prevention and potential therapeutic approaches of SALRTI in children.

The 2002 ATS/ERS consensus classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias standardizes definitions and criteria for classification and diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and replaces previous classifications. Based on clinico-radiologic-pathologic criteria seven entities were defined: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease, desquamative interstitial pneumonia and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. The following paper includes a brief overview of the histopathological diagnosis of these entities as compared to other diffuse interstitial pulmonary diseases and pulmonary manifestations of collagenvascular diseases.

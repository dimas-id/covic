This study reports an integrated microfluidic system which utilizes virus-bound magnetic bead complexes for rapid serological analysis of antibodies associated with an infection by the dengue virus. This new microfluidic system integrates one-way micropumps, a four-membrane-type micromixer, two-way micropumps and an on-chip microcoil array in order to simultaneously perform the rapid detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). An IgM/IgG titer in serum is used to confirm the presence of dengue virus infection. By utilizing microfluidic technologies and virus-bound magnetic beads, IgG and IgM in the serum samples are captured. This is followed by purification and isolation of these beads utilizing a magnetic field generated from the on-chip array of microcoils. Any interfering substances in the biological fluids are washed away automatically by the flow generated by the integrated pneumatic pumps. The fluorescence-labelled secondary antibodies are bound to the surface of the IgG/IgM complex attached onto the magnetic beads. Finally, the entire magnetic complex sandwich is transported automatically into a sample detection chamber. The optical signals are then measured and analyzed by a real-time optical detection module. The entire process is performed automatically on a single chip within 30 min, which is only 1/8th of the time required for a traditional method. More importantly, the detection limit has been improved to 21 pg, which is about 38 times better when compared to traditional methods. This integrated system may provide a powerful platform for the rapid diagnosis of dengue virus infection and other types of infectious diseases.

We report a case of a male with COVID-19 who developed acute hepatotoxicity related to remdesivir with probable interaction of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. Until further details upon this interaction become available, we recommend physicians to be cautious with the prescription of P-gp inhibitors in patients receiving remdesivir therapy.

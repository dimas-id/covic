The biophysics, mechanism of actions, applications, benefits and complications of electromagnetic (EM) energy-based surgical instruments, and their current use are reviewed. Understanding the mechanism of action, tissue effects, and appropriate applications of EM devices is critical to achieving an optimal surgical outcome. Although a more diverse range of EM devices are used in human medicine, current use in veterinary medicine is limited to conventional electrosurgery and CO(2) lasers.

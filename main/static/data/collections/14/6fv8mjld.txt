In recent years, viruses have been recognized increasingly as an important cause of foodborne infections. More than 160 enteric viruses are excreted in the feces of infected individuals, and some may also be present in the vomitus. Food and water are directly contaminated with fecal material, through the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, sewage pollution of shellfish culture beds, or may be contaminated by infected food-handlers.

Vector insect cells infected with Rice dwarf virus had vesicular compartments containing viral particles located adjacent to the viroplasm when examined by transmission electron and confocal microscopy. Such compartments were often at the periphery of infected cells. Inhibitors of vesicular transport, brefeldin A and monensin, and an inhibitor of myosin motor activity, butanedione monoxime, abolished the formation of such vesicles and prevented the release of viral particles from infected cells without significant effects on virus multiplication. Furthermore, the actin-depolymerizing drug, cytochalasin D, inhibited the formation of actin filaments without significantly interfering with formation of vesicular compartments and the release of viruses from treated cells. These results together revealed intracellular vesicular compartments as a mode for viral transport in and release from insect vector cells infected with a plant-infecting reovirus.

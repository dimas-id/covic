An ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was developed for quantitative monitoring of Alpha fetoprotein (AFP). To achieve this objective, an incorporated signal amplification strategy of platinum nanoparticles anchored on cobalt oxide/graphene nanosheets (Pt NPs/Co3O4/graphene) was proposed by acting as the label of secondary antibodies. The prepared label not only empowered by advantages of each component but exhibited better electrochemical performance than single Pt NPs, Co3O4 and graphene, which has shown large specific surface area and good catalytic activity towards the reduction of H2O2. Meanwhile, the nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles adhered on 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane functionalized graphene sheets (Au@MPTES-GS) was used as matrix to accelerate electron transfer and immobilize primary antibodies in this system. The signal amplification mechanism of the matrix and the label were explored successfully. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range from 0.1 pg mL-1 to 60 ng mL-1 with a low detection limit of 0.029 pg mL-1for AFP. The proposed immunosensor may have promising application in the clinical diagnosis of AFP and other tumor markers.

PURPOSE To identify the most effective dressing for covering long-term central venous catheter exit site to prevent catheter-related infections and skin irritation in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS Systematic Review. The search was performed in the following electronic databases: CINAHL, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Google Scholar was used for the gray literature search. RESULTS Seven studies were included which tested different arrangements of dressings: sterilized gauze and adhesive tape with a transparent polyurethane film (n = 2), transparent polyurethane film with a different replacement interval frequency (n = 2), transparent polyurethane film with and without chlorhexidine released continuously by the dressing at the site of intravascular catheter insertion (n = 2), and dressings vs. no dressings (n = 1). The meta-analysis for catheter-related infection prevention showed no difference between type of dressing (RR 1.76, [95% CI 0.82; 3.75], I2 0%) and for the replacement frequency at different intervals (RR 1.04, [95% CI 0.67; 1.61], I2 0%). The meta-analysis for skin irritation evaluated the transparent polyurethane film replacement frequency and indicated that a longer dressing replacement interval (10 to 15 days) reduces the risk of developing this outcome (RR 0.71, 0.52; 0.96, 95% CI, I2 24%). CONCLUSIONS Regarding the type of the dressing, there is no evidence indicating the best dressing. Although there is no evidence available for the ideal replacement frequency, the risk to develop skin irritation is reduced in longer dressing replacements intervals.

BACKGROUND Esophagectomy is the mainstay of therapy for esophageal cancer but is a complex operation that is associated with significantly high morbidity and mortality rates. The primary aim of this study is to report our perioperative outcomes, and long-term survival of Minimally Invasive Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy (MILE). METHODS IRB approved retrospective study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent elective MILE from September 2013 to November 2017 at University of Florida, Jacksonville. RESULTS Primary diagnosis was esophageal cancer (n = 96) and benign esophageal disease (n = 4). Anastomotic leak rate was observed in 6%; 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 2% and 3%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.3 days; 87 patients were discharged to home, while 12 patients were discharged to rehabilitation facility, and there was one in-hospital mortality secondary to graft necrosis. At a mean follow-up was 37 months (2-74), the 3- and 5-year overall survivals are 63.9 ± 5.0% (95% CI 53.3-72.7%) and 60.5 ± 5.3% (95% CI 49.4-69.9%), respectively. The 3- and 5-year disease-free survival is 75.0 ± 4.8% (95% CI 64.2-83.0%) and 70.4 ± 5.5% (95% CI 58.0-80.0%). CONCLUSION MILE can be performed with low perioperative mortality, and favorable long-term overall and disease-free survival.

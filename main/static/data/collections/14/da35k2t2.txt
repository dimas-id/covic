Multiple sclerosis (MS) and matched control sera had similar antibody titers to coronaviruses OC43 and 229E when tested by a radioimmunoassay method. In contrast, cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients contained coronavirus antibodies more frequently and in higher titers than matched controls. Intrathecal antibody synthesis to OC43 and 229E viruses was detected in 41% (9/22) and 26% (7/27) of MS patients, respectively, but was not found in any of the neurologic control patients. This intrathecal antibody synthesis may mean that coronaviruses play an etiologic or pathogenic role in MS. Alternatively, intrathecal synthesis of coronavirus antibodies may be but part of a generalized and variable intrathecal antibody synthesis that is typical for MS patients.

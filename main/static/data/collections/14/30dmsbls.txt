BACKGROUND Colon cancer rarely presents with a gastrocolic fistula and resection, if feasible, is usually carried out by open surgery. The authors present the first literature case report of laparoscopic multivisceral resection for gastrocolic fistula secondary to locally advanced colon cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 54-year-old man presented with feculant vomiting, cachexia, and severe iron deficiency anemia. Investigations confirmed a large nonmetastatic splenic flexure colon cancer with fistulation into the stomach. After 10 weeks of nutritional support and laparoscopic defunctioning proximal transverse loop colostomy, we proceeded to laparoscopic extended left hemicolectomy with en bloc sleeve gastrectomy and partial splenectomy. RESULT The procedure was completed laparoscopically (operating time, 400 min; blood loss, 150 mL). He was discharged on the 6th postoperative day after an uneventful recovery. Histology showed an R0 resection of a pT4N1a (1/45 lymph nodes involved) colon cancer with gastrocolic fistula. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic multivisceral en bloc R0 resection of locally advanced colon cancer with gastrocolic fistula can be accomplished safely in experienced hands.

Robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) has gained popularity within minimally-invasive urologic surgery, and has been shown to be a safe procedure with similar oncologic outcomes when compared to the conventional open standard. While initial RARC feasibility and outcomes studies were performed with extracorporeal urinary diversion, intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) is becoming increasingly utilized. Reported benefits of an intracorporeal approach include decreased blood loss and a lower incidence of ureteral strictures. While ICUD is technically challenging, many have overcome the learning curve associated with this procedure via a mentorship model and a dedicated operative team. Techniques vary between institutions, and ileal conduit, continent cutaneous and orthotopic continent (neobladder) diversions have all been performed. Herein, we describe the learning curve, technical points, and unique complications associated with ICUD.

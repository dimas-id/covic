BACKGROUND Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) via a jet ventilator (PTJV) is considered a rescue technique in difficult airway management. However, whether a conventional ventilator can generate adequate ventilation via PTV is not known. Our goal was to evaluate the tidal volume (V(T)) generated by a conventional ventilator during simulated PTV compared with PTJV in a lung model. METHODS A lung model simulating an adult lung was used. A catheter was inserted through the artificial trachea and connected to either a jet ventilator or a conventional ventilator. The direction of catheter insertion was perpendicular to the trachea, pointing towards the lung and away from the lung. The jet ventilator was operated at 344.7 kPa. The conventional ventilator was operated in the pressure mode at peak inspiratory pressures of 40-90 cm H(2)O. RESULTS The jet ventilator generated larger V(T) [817 (336) ml] when the catheter was pointing towards the lung than when pointing away from the lung or perpendicular to the trachea [121 (41) and 69 (24) ml, respectively, P<0.01]. With the conventional ventilator, changes in V(T) at different direction of catheter insertion were much less [222 (81) ml catheter pointing towards the lung, 229 (121) ml perpendicular to the trachea, and 187 (97) ml away from the lung]. CONCLUSIONS Our result demonstrated that PTJV was effective only when the catheter was pointing towards the lung and requires high operating pressure. A conventional ventilator can generate reasonable minute ventilation through the transtracheal catheter less dependent on directions of catheter insertion and should be considered during emergent PTV.

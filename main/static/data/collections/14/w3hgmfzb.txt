COVID-19 has already caused millions of infections, thousands of deaths and countless indirect and poorly estimated consequences on other diseases and the global economy. All ages are potentially susceptible, but the virus has had a lower direct impact on children, with fewer severe cases and low mortality rates. However, the reasons for this are still unclear and we cannot rule out children's role in transmitting the disease. The serious impact that restrictive measures have had on children's lives have not been fully considered. Because children are less affected by COVID-19, the scientific community, health agencies and governments have not focused much attention on them during this pandemic.

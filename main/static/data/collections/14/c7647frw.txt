Polish system of public law provides for the possibility of forced subjection of a person to a medical procedure, both in case of infectious and mental illnesses. The authors discuss the cases of infectious illnesses, subject to compulsory treatment in outpatient medical care and to compulsory hospitalization, as well as the procedure protocol in case of suspicion or corroboration of an infectious illness case. Another reason for a physician's authorization to initiate a compulsory medical procedure without the patient's consent is suspicion of a mental illness; whenever the patients' behavior can endanger them, other persons or their immediate surroundings. Introduced is also a detailed description of actual status in order to illustrate an appropriate application of coercion means.

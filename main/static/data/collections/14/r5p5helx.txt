Abstract Despite tremendous resources being invested in prevention and treatment, breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths in women globally. The available treatment modalities are very costly and produces severe side effects. Drug repurposing that relate to new uses for old drugs has emerged as a novel approach for drug development. Repositioning of old, clinically approved, off patent non-cancer drugs with known targets, into newer indication is like using old weapons for new battle. The advances in genomics, proteomics and information computational biology has facilitated the process of drug repurposing. Repositioning approach not only fastens the process of drug development but also offers more effective, cheaper, safer drugs with lesser/known side effects. During the last decade, drugs such as alkylating agents, anthracyclins, antimetabolite, CDK4/6 inhibitor, aromatase inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor and mitotic inhibitors has been repositioned for breast cancer treatment. The repositioned drugs have been successfully used for the treatment of most aggressive triple negative breast cancer. The literature review suggest that serendipity plays a major role in the drug development. This article describes the comprehensive overview of the current scenario of drug repurposing for the breast cancer treatment. The strategies as well as several examples of repurposed drugs are provided. The challenges associated with drug repurposing are discussed.

Lung transplantation is an accepted therapy for selected individuals with end-stage lung disease due to cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent data show that CF recipients oflung transplantation have survival as good as those of any other diagnostic group. After transplantation, CF patients confront the major threats to life and health of graft infection and rejection. Inflammation is the common mediator of injury to the lung in both these instances. Graft infection after lung transplantation involves the same micro-organismsas are typical with CF as well as opportunistic agents. Prophylactic strategies and aggressive diagnosis via bronchoscopy are both critical in the effective treatment of post-transplant lung infections. Graft rejection involves the detection and recognition of foreign antigen and the subsequent activation of specific T-lymphocyte clones leading to inflammatory injury to the donor organ. Immunosuppression is used to prevent and/or modulate host response to the donor organ and titrated to serum therapeutic drug monitoring and transbronchial biopsy findings. Precise clinical monitoring and aggressive diagnostic approaches are crucial to minimizing graft injury and aggressive diagnostic approaches are crucial to minimizing graft injury and enhancing life after transplantation. Although most CF lung transplant recipients experience both graft infection and rejection and the 5-yr survival rate remains at approx 50%, improvement in diagnosis and therapy continue over time. With the introduction of new approaches to antimicrobial therapy, new immunosuppressant agents and promising strategies to promote immune tolerance, survival after lung transplantation is likely to improve in the coming decades.

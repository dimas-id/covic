Pseudotyped viral particle production has been used extensively and broadly for many viruses to evaluate levels of neutralizing antibodies, viral entry inhibitors and vaccine immunogenicity. This assay is extremely safe and useful alternative to live virus-based assay without the need for high containment facilities. In this chapter, we describe the generation of MERS-CoV pseudotyped viral particles (MERSpp) expressing full-length spike protein using second-generation lentiviral packaging system. This platform is optimized to generate high titer of MERSpp and to test sera from different mammalian species.

A phenomenological model to describe the Corona Virus(covid-19) Pandemic spread in a given population is developed. It enables the identification of the key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by Ferguson and collaborators, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the initial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of infected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a `retardation/inhibition coefficient' k-star , which is a measure of the effectiveness of the control policies adopted. The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as `social/physical distancing' and population density reduction by strict quarantining are essential for making k-star greater than 1, necessary for suppressing the pandemic. The model indicates that relaxing such measures when the infection rate starts to decrease as a result of earlier policies could simply restart the infection rate in the non-infected population. Presently available available statistical data in WHO and other reports can be readily used to determine the the key parameters of the model. Possible extensions to the basic model to make it more realistic are indicated.

In many countries, herbal medicine has been developed and is currently practiced. Herbal medicine involves the use of the stalks, roots, leaves, flowers, and berries of several different plant species for medical treatment. Many practitioners believe that herbal medication has no side effects because of its natural origin. Thus, herbal medication has been used for a long time with little awareness of its side effects. However, there is an increasing incidence of interstitial pneumonia due to a drug-induced lung injury (DLI), which could be induced by common drugs. Moreover, increasing cases of bronchiolitis obliterans and pulmonary hypertension are being reported; further, these are drug-induced conditions. Clinicians should be more aware of DLI symptoms caused by herbal medication and interrogate patients regarding their use of herbal medication and supplements as well as prescription drugs.

Abstract Five dogs with chronic-recurring diarrhea were positive for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but were unresponsive to treatment with metronidazole. One of these animals was subjected to a colonoscopy, which revealed eosinophilic infiltration of the colon. All five animals completely recovered after dietary changes. The present work suggests that CDI might occur in dogs with other intestinal alterations. In addition, this report suggests that dysbiosis should be considered in animals that have chronic-recurring diarrhea and test positive for C. difficile.

BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to describe the sleep structure (especially slow wave sleep) in adults with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare genetic disease due to mutations in the PHOX2B gene. Fourteen patients aged 23 (19.0; 24.8) years old (median [1rst-3rd quartiles]) with CCHS underwent a sleep interview and night-time attended polysomnography with their ventilatory support. Their sleep variables were compared to those collected in 15 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index. RESULTS The latency to N3 sleep was shorter in patients (26.3 min [24.0; 30.1]) than in controls (49.5 min [34.3; 66.9]; P = 0.005), and sleep onset latency tended to be shorter in patients (14.0 min [7.0; 20.5]) than in controls (33.0 min [18.0; 49.0]; P = 0.052). Total sleep time, sleep stage percentages, sleep fragmentation as well as respiratory and movement index were within normal ranges and not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS Normal sleep in adult patients with CCHS and adequate ventilator support indicates that the PHOX2 gene mutations do not affect brain sleep networks. Consequently, any complaint of disrupted sleep should prompt clinicians to look for the usual causes of sleep disorders, primarily inadequate mechanical ventilation. Shorter N3 latency may indicate a higher need for slow wave sleep, to compensate for the abnormal respiratory-related cortical activity during awake quiet breathing observed in patients with CCH.

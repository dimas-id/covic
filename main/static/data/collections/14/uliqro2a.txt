This work is aimed to investigate the effect of research and development (R&D) on reduce in environmental pressures through an empirical analysis of the top six global carbon emitters (the C6: China, USA, India, Russia, Japan, and Germany). This work is valuable toward carbon reduction within C6 countries and the world (C6 emit roughly 60% of the global carbon emissions). Moreover, it is also meaningful for exploring the decoupling of economic development from carbon emissions in other areas (both developing and developed countries). The main findings displayed that the decoupling status in developed countries (i.e., USA, Japan, and Germany) were better and more stable than in developing countries (i.e., China, India, and Russia). Germany performed best among the developed countries, and China performed most stable among the developing countries. The effect of the per capita R&D expenditure was main resistance to decoupling carbon emissions from economic development in C6 countries. However, the energy intensity effect and R&D efficiency effect related to technological progress were the main driving forces for the decoupling process. Consequently, this study proposes that the improvement of technological progress should be prioritized.

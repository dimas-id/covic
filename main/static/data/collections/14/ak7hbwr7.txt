Viruses must hijack cellular translation machinery to efficiently express viral genes. In many cases, this is impeded by cellular stress responses. These stress responses swiftly relocate and repurpose translation machinery, resulting in global inhibition of translation and the aggregation of stalled 48S mRNPs into cytoplasmic foci called stress granules. This results in translational silencing of all mRNAs excluding those beneficial for the cell to resolve the specific stress. For example, expression of antiviral factors is maintained during viral infection. Here we investigated stress granule regulation by Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which causes the economically important poultry disease, infectious bronchitis. Interestingly, we found that IBV is able to inhibit multiple cellular stress granule signaling pathways whilst at the same time IBV replication also results in induction of seemingly canonical stress granules in a proportion of infected cells. Moreover, IBV infection uncouples translational repression and stress granule formation and both processes are independent of eIF2Î± phosphorylation. These results provide novel insights into how IBV modulates cellular translation and antiviral stress signaling.

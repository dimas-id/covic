Pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV infection has been reported in Wuhan since December 2019, and spread rapidly across the country. The radical operation of colorectal cancer is semi-elective operation. Patients with colorectal cancer should receive operation as soon as possible after elective operation is resumed in each hospital. 2019-nCoV virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic infectors, and it has been confirmed to be transmitted by droplets and contact. However, fecal-oral transmission and aerosol transmission have not been excluded. Based on our experience with laparoscopic colorectal operation, we propose some surgery strategies for colorectal cancer patients under the corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) situation: the screening process should be strictly carried out before surgery to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection in the later stage; laparoscopic-assisted surgery is recommended for radical surgery for patients with colorectal cancer; strict aerosol management must be made during the operation; natural orifice specimen extraction surgery and transanal total mesorectal excision are should be performed prudently; scientific and reasonable prophylactic stoma should be done; personnel protection in surgical ward and operation room must be strengthened.

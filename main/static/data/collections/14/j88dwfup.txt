It could be argued that bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the most economically significant infectious pathogens of feedlot cattle. Although the direct economic losses caused by this virus have not been well quantified, the role it plays as an immunosuppressive agent and as a potentiator for other diseases, most notably bovine respiratory disease, have been well documented. It is also a difficult disease for the feedlot veterinarian to control effectively. Individual cattle persistently infected with BVDV often serve as the source of infectious virus within a group of feedlot cattle, and the ultimate responsibility for preventing persistent infections in cattle rests with the cow-calf producer and not with the feedlot owner. The enormous impact of the virus on the livestock industry has led the Academy of Veterinary Consultants to draft a position statement that resolves that the beef and dairy industries adopt measures to control and target eventual eradication of BVDV from North America.

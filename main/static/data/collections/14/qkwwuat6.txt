OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of recurrent positive nucleic acid detection in a recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient and to provide clinical data for the further study of COVID-19. METHODS: A case of COVID-19 was retrospectively analyzed, and the relevant literature was reviewed. RESULTS: Based on the 6th edition of the COVID-19 treatment plan, the patient met the discharge standards after treatment and was discharged after consultation with the expert panel. Two weeks after discharge, nucleic acid testing of a sputum sample for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive again. There may be various reasons. CONCLUSION: Recurring positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests pose a formidable challenge, and more stringent discharge standards should be considered. When considering recurrent positive nucleic acid results in COVID-19 patients, the clinicians should have a rational judgment.

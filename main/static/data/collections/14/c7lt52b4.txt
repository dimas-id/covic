In the ongoing fight against the epidemic of COVID-19, the medical staff has been under tremendous pressure. Wearing the protective equipment (masks, goggles, and protective screens) with a poor breathability for a long time causes various skin problems, such as allergies, excessive skin hydration, local mechanical injuries, and even secondary infections. In addition, in a closed environment, compression and friction aggravate skin reactions, which may compromise duty performance of the medical staff. It is therefore essential to provide timely treatment opinions and prevention methods for common skin problems. We also give suggestions concerning the preparation of medical kit for skin protection in the epidemic area.

SARS-CoV-2 has a positive sense RNA genome of 29.9 kb in size, showing high sequence similarity to the BAT-CoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of 14 open reading frames (ORFs), which encodes for a total of 27 proteins divided into structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs). The fundamental structural protein-encoding genes are a spike protein (S) gene, envelope protein (E) gene, a membrane protein (M) gene, and a nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. They make about 33% of the entire genome and are vital for the viral life cycle. Rest 67% is distributed among different NSPs (such as M(pro), helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) encoding genes across the ORFs, which are involved in virus-cell receptor interactions during viral entry. Researchers are trying to formulate vaccines, therapeutic antibodies or protein-targeted antiviral drugs to control the spread. This review proceeds stepwise through the COVID-19 outbreak, structural and genomic organization, entry mechanism, pathogenesis, and finally highlighting the essential proteins involved at each step that might be potential targets for drug discovery. Currently, approved treatment modalities consist of only supportive care and oxygen supplementation. This review is established on the current knowledge that has expanded on structural motifs and topology of proteins and their functions.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the approach to management of systemic immunosuppressive therapies for dermatologic indications in children. Given the absence of data to address concerns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection while on these agents in an evidence-based manner, a Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force (PDCRTF) was assembled to offer time-sensitive guidance for clinicians. METHODS A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring. RESULTS Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their decision to initiate immunosuppressive medications. The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications. In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried. The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for acute infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering. CONCLUSIONS The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families. Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.

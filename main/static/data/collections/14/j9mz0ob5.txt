Tafenoquine [TQ] exhibited EC50/90s of ~ 2.6/5.1 Î¼M against SARS-CoV-2 in VERO E6 cells and was 4-fold more potent than hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]. Time-of-addition experiments were consistent with a different mechanism for TQ v HCQ. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling suggested that lung unbound concentrations of TQ in COVID-19 patients may exceed the EC90 for at least 8 weeks after administration. The therapeutic potential for TQ in management of COVID-19 should be further evaluated.

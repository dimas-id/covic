Abstract Objective: The purpose of our study was to assess organ function in 102 patients with severe COVID-19 infections, using retrospective clinical analysis. Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 102 patients with severe COVID-19 infections. The patients were divided into a survival group (n=73) and a non-survival group (n=29) according to their prognosis. The age, sex, underlying diseases, clinical laboratory data within 48 hours (routine blood tests, ALT, AST, TBIL, ALB, BUN, CR, D-Dimer, PT, APTT, FIB, F VIII:C, CK-MB, CK, and LDH), and ventilation status were collected. The organ functions of these severe COVID-19 patients were assessed by comparing the differences between the two groups. Results: AST, BUN, CR, CK-MB, LDH, and CK in the non-survival group were higher than those in the survival group, and the differences were statistically significant (P＜0.05). D-Dimer, PT, FIB, and F VIII:C in the non-survival group were higher than the values observed in the survival group, and the differences were statistically significant (P＜0.05). PLT, AST, BUN, CR, D-Dimer, PT, FIB, F VIII:C, CK-MB, CK, and LDH predicted the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the COVID19 endpoint events and were 0.721, 0.854, 0.867, 0.757, 0.699, 0.679, 0.715, 0.811, 0.935, and 0.802, respectively. Conclusion: The results showed that there were different degrees of damage to the liver, kidneys, blood coagulation, and heart function in the non-survival group. In addition, PLT, AST, BUN, CR, D-Dimer, PT, FIB, F VIII:C, CK-MB, CK, and LDH had value in evaluating disease prognosis.

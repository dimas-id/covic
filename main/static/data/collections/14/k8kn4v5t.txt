In March 2015, the American College of Physicians (ACP) released a clinical guideline on the value of screening for coronary heart disease (CHD) in asymptomatic persons. The guideline authors found that results of screening studies are unlikely to change patient management or the intensity of risk factor reduction strategies. Most events occur in patients who are at low to intermediate risk for CHD; and in low-risk asymptomatic patients, percutaneous coronary intervention in "screen-positive" patients does not improve outcomes and creates unnecessary risks. As a result, the ACP recommended against screening for asymptomatic patients who are at low risk for CHD. Instead, it recommended a focus on proven strategies, such as treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, to reduce risk in appropriately selected asymptomatic persons. Two discussants weigh the evidence for and against screening for CHD in asymptomatic patients with varying degrees of risk and provide recommendations for a specific patient who is uncertain whether to proceed to screening.

We read with great interest the very thoughtful commentary by Drs. Joob and Wiwanitkit. We agree with the authors that, despite conflicting clinical data to date, it is possible that HCQ may have a protective effect in the setting of COVID-19. More importantly, we agree that optimal HCQ dosage and timing is a critical underpinning for clinical trials. However, we highlight several considerations regarding treatment with high dose HCQ.

Porcine gamma interferon is a cytokine produced by activated T cells and NK cells with broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunomodulatory function. However, pIFN-γ is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-γ in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-γ protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-γ protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-γ gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3' end of the pIFN-γ gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells. Our data also showed that the fermentation process could significantly improve productivity. A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-γ gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN-γ protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0–24 h at 28°C, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24–72 h at 25°C, pH 6.0 and 30% DO. These data demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression level of pIFN-γ in Pichia pastoris was improved significantly by gene optimization with 3' end mutation and a fermentation process that maintained good biological activity, which is beneficial to the application of pIFN-γ in animal husbandry.

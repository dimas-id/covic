PURPOSE Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) can occur after elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. Effective treatment approaches to prevent the development of CPSP in this population have not been extensively investigated. The impact of multimodal strategies to prevent CPSP following elective mid/hindfoot surgery is unknown because of both the heterogeneity of acute pain management and the lack of a recognized definition particular to this surgery. This review aimed to identify and evaluate current pain management strategies after elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. SOURCES Manual and electronic searches (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were conducted of literature published between 1990 and July 2017. Comparative studies of adults undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed studies and assessed their methodological quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We found seven randomized-controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria. Interventions focused on regional anesthesia techniques such as continuous popliteal sciatic and femoral nerve blockade. Participants were typically followed up to 48 hr postoperatively. Only one study assessed pain six months following elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. CONCLUSION There is an overwhelming lack of evidence regarding CPSP and its management for patients undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. The lack of a recognized and standard definition of CPSP after this group of surgeries precludes accurate and consistent evaluation.

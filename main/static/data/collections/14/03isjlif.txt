PURPOSE: Recently, the world has been dealing with a new type of coronavirus called COVID-19 that in terms of symptoms is similar to the SARS coronavirus. Unfortunately, researchers could not find a registered therapy to treat the infection related to the virus yet. Regarding the fact that drug repurposing is a good strategy for epidemic viral infection, we applied the drug repurposing strategy using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19. For this purpose, five proteins of COVID-19 (3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Papain-Like protease (PLpro), cleavage site, HR1 and RBD in Spike protein) were selected as target proteins for drug repositioning. METHODS: First, five proteins of COVID-19 were built by homology modeling. Then FDA-approved drugs (2471 drugs) were screened against cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein via virtual screening. One hundred and twenty-eight FDA-approved drugs with the most favorable free-binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein. Of these 128 drugs, 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects. Virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ACE2, 3CLpro and PLpro and HR1 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: According to the results, glecaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, ledipasvir, glycyrrhizic acid, TMC-310911, and hesperidin showed highly favorably free binding energies with all tested target proteins. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned drugs can be regarded as candidates to treat COVID-19 infections, but further study on the efficiency of these drugs is also necessary.

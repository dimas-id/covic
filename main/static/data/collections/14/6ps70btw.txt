OBJECT Significant haemorrhage following intracranial tumour resection may occur in 1-2% of cases and the majority occur within the first few hours post-operatively. Implantation of carmustine wafers has been associated with increased operative site complications in some series, but post-operative haematoma is not routinely reported. We analyzed the characteristics of post-operative haemorrhage after carmustine wafer insertion. METHODS We performed a retrospective audit of surgical site haematoma after tumour resection and insertion of carmustine wafers in two neurosurgical units in the UK (University Hospital of North Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, March 2003 - July 2012; Wessex Neurological Centre, Southampton, October 2005 - January 2013). RESULTS During the specified time periods, carmustine wafers were inserted in 181 operations in 177 patients. We identified acute operative site haematomas after carmustine wafer insertion in 8 (4.4%) patients. All presented in a delayed fashion on or after Day 2 post-operatively. In contrast, acute operative site haematoma was present in 4/491 (0.81%) of patients who underwent resection without gliadel wafer insertion. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the expected timing of bleeding following intracranial tumour resection, all carmustine wafer patients who experienced haemorrhage presented in a delayed fashion on or after Day 2 post-operatively. The causative factors for universally delayed post-operative haematoma after carmustine wafer insertion are unclear and further studies are required to characterize this phenomenon.

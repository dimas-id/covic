Records, irrespective of their nature (whether electronic or paper-based), are vulnerable to fraud. People's hard-earned money, their personal information, identity, and health are at a higher risk than ever due to the misuse of technology in doing forgery. However, the technology can also be used as an answer to counteracting against fraudulence prevalent in affairs from every walk of life. This short paper attempts to present the blockchain technology as a solution to overcome the menace of forgery by promoting trustless computing in business transactions. The paper explains the blockchain technology and a variety of its implementation through five different use cases in the field of drug supply chain, health insurance, land record management, courier services, and immigration records. The immigration blockchain is also proposed as a solution to check pandemic like the coronavirus (COVID-19) effectively. The implementation of the Blockchain is performed using a locally built IBMâ€™s hyper-ledger fabric-based platform, and Ethereum public platform. The results are encouraging enough to substitute existing business operations using Blockchain-based solutions.

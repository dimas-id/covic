The new coronavirus disease, named by World Health Organization (WHO) as COVID‐19 brought great challenges to patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD). In general, ESRD patients have higher number of comorbidities and are at age‐risk for severe pulmonary presentation of this disease. Another important issue is that hemodialysis (HD) clinics are usually not located in small towns, and these frail patients often travel to their dialysis center in groups and also cannot keep the 6‐feet safe distance during their HD session.(1)

Continued reports of infections with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variants have occurred since its first isolation in the 1930s. Currently, QX-like IBVs are the predominant circulating genotype around the world. Here, the pathogenicity of QX-like IBV strain SD was characterized in chickens at different ages of exposure to the virus, and the protection efficacy of available vaccine combinations against IBV was evaluated. The results revealed that QX-like IBV strain SD was severely pathogenic in chickens, causing respiratory, urinary and reproductive infections, irrespective of age, based on clinical observations, viral distribution in tissues and a ciliostasis study. Severe respiratory signs, tracheal cilia injury, nephritis and abnormal development of the oviduct and ovarian follicles were evident throughout the experiment. A challenge experiment demonstrated that the homologous QX vaccine showed superior protection efficacy compared with other available vaccines, confirming the importance of IBV vaccine seed homology against the circulating IBV strains. Our findings aid an understanding of the pathogenicity of QX-like IBVs that may help to further control the infection.

Methods previously developed by the author are applied to uncover several sites of interest in the spike glycoproteins of all known human coronaviruses (hCoVs), including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. The sites comprise three-dimensional neighborhoods of peptides characterized by four key properties: (1) they pinpoint regions of high free energy in the backbone whose obstruction might interrupt function; (2) by their very definition, they occur rarely in the universe of all gene-encoded proteins that could obviate host response to compounds designed for their interference; (3) they are common to all known hCoV spikes, possibly retaining activity in light of inevitable viral mutation; and (4) they are exposed in the molecular surface of the glycoprotein. These peptides in SARS-CoV-2 are given by the triples of residues (131, 117, 134), (203, 227, 228), and (1058, 730, 731) in its spike.

Abstract Breda virus (BRV), a member of the genus torovirus, is an established etiological agent of diarrhea of cattle, which is found as two separate serotypes, BRV-1 and BRV-2. In this study, a 7.5 kb fragment of the BRV-1 genome that bracketed the genes for the structural proteins of BRV was amplified by long RT-PCR and the amplicon purified and sequenced directly. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORF) corresponding to the peplomer (S), envelope (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and an ORF for a novel 1.2 kb gene located between the M and N genes. This new gene was identical in nucleotide sequence to the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of BRV-2. With the exception of this new ORF, BRV-1 manifests 80% nucleotide sequence identity with the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV) in the 7.5 kb region from the 3â€² end of the genome that contains the genes for the structural proteins. A 504 base segment containing the ORF for the BRV-1 N gene was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system. The resulting protein was purified by SDS-PAGE and used to immunize guinea pigs. Hyperimmune serum was reactive with bovine torovirus (BTV) and human torovirus (HTV) antigens. By immunoelectron microscopy, it was shown to aggregate broken but not intact torovirus particles from BTV-positive fecal specimens. By immunoblot, the hyperimmune serum reacted specifically with the 20 kD N proteins of both BTV and HTV, as well as with the expressed N protein. BRV-1 and BRV-2 immune sera from gnotobiotic calves, but not human convalescent sera from HTV-infected patients, reacted with the expressed N protein by immunoblot. These findings were applied to the design of a dot blot assay that could specifically detect BTV and HTV from fecal specimens.

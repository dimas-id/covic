The following chapter intends to give the reader an overview of the current field of applied infectious disease epidemiology. Prevention of disease by breaking the chain of transmission has traditionally been the main purpose of infectious disease epidemiology. While this goal remains the same, the picture of infectious diseases is changing. New pathogens are identified and already known disease agents are changing their behavior. The world population is aging; more people develop underlying disease conditions and are therefore more susceptible to certain infectious diseases or have long term sequelae after being infected.

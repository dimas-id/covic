This paper discusses the most important parasites that inhabit the human small intestine. Beginning with the protozoa and proceeding through the various species of cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes that inhabit the human small bowel, the most important organisms are presented. Possible future developments are discussed along with pathophysiology and treatment in this phylogenic approach. Zoonotic illnesses, those diseases that by their rarity are of little import, and diseases without significant clinical or social implications are beyond the scope of this article and are not discussed.

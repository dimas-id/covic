Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the frequently occurring pitfalls in hospital preparedness and response. Significant systemic constraints make hospitals reluctant partners in preparedness and generate ineffective responses. Such a condition has been highlighted by the antiterrorism training and preparedness programs over the past few years. The results of numerous such exercises and actual responses across the United States indicate a list of pitfalls—such as communications, hospital security, and hospital staff management—which are related to the inherent system limitations that hinder the effective disaster operations in hospitals. Hospitals are required to have and exercise emergency-preparedness plans. An all-hazard approach can allow for preparedness and a measured, flexible response to a variety of potential incidents. Generally, plans may contain annexes for specific hazards, but an all-hazard plan should obviate a separate plan for each hazard—for example, an earthquake plan and a terrorism plan.

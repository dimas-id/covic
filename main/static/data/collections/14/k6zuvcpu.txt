INTRODUCTION Despite the preference of many patients to die at home, high proportions of patients with advanced cancer undergo major procedures, receive intensive care, and die in the hospital. The goal of this study is to examine variation in hospital utilization and site of death for patients dying with poor-prognosis cancer in the Regione Emilia-Romagna (RER), Italy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective, population-level study using administrative data. Patients were included if they died in 2012 and had at least one hospital admission for metastatic or poor-prognosis cancer within 180 days of death. Variations in the use of the hospital, intensive care, and procedures performed were evaluated. RESULTS 11,470 patients died with metastatic or poor-prognosis cancer in 2012. Seventy-eight percent of patients were hospitalized in the last month of life while 50.7% of patients died in the hospital. Results varied by local health authority from 38.3% to 69.3%. Of patients who had an ICU stay, 55.1% in the community hospitals and 59.8% in the teaching hospitals were admitted to the ICU on the day of death or the day before death. 7.5% of patients underwent a major procedure in the last 30 days of life. CONCLUSIONS The overall high rate, and substantial variation, in hospital care at the end of life offers the RER the opportunity to evaluate if increasing availability of palliative care, along with provider and patient education, could reduce utilization of high-cost hospital care and increase patient and family satisfaction.

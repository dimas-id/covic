A novel porcine parvovirus, PPV4, was identified in the lung lavage of a diseased pig coinfected with porcine circovirus type 2. This virus exhibits limited similarity to its closest relative, bovine parvovirus 2, but resembles viruses of the genus Bocavirus (bovine parvovirus, canine minute virus and human bocavirus) that encode an additional ORF3. The ORF3 of PPV4 is predicted to encode a protein of 204 amino acid residues, which is similar in size to the ORF3-encoded proteins of the bocaviruses. Whereas the ORF3-encoded proteins of bocaviruses share significant similarity with each other, the PPV4 ORF3 encoded protein does not exhibit homology with any protein in the GenBank non-redundant database.

Child sexual abuse (CSA) represents a significant public health problem. While CSA is associated with several adverse outcomes, recent attention has been given to its effect on maternal parenting. Despite a growing literature on this topic, a comprehensive systematic review has not been conducted. Thus, this review aimed to fill this gap. Several search strategies were used, including searches in academic databases. Two reviewers completed screening, full-text review, data extraction, and quality determinations. Extracted qualitative data were synthesized for the 108 studies meeting inclusion criteria. The primary themes emerging from women's accounts of the effects of CSA on their current parenting included abuse of child, breastfeeding, child-rearing practices, coping related to parenting, mother-child relationship, perceptions of child, perceptions of motherhood, and protection of children from abuse. Given the current lack of interventions designed for these mothers, the results of this review may aid in the development of evidence-based interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Current evidence-based guidelines for the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) focus primarily on timing, modality and technique of aneurysm occlusion, and on prevention and treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia. Significant aspects of management in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the later course of aSAH such as ventilation and sedation (VST) remain unaddressed. aSAH patients present unique challenges not accounted for in general ICU recommendations and guidelines, which is why we attempted to further characterize ICU practices in aSAH patients in Germany. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey on ICU practices in aSAH in Germany. Secondarily, we assessed the existence of and compliance with current guidelines regarding ICU practices. The questionnaire was designed in interdisciplinary fashion and distributed online through the kwiksurvey(Â®) platform (Bristol, UK). RESULTS: A total of 50 responses were received, accounting for a response rate of 49%. Twenty-one were university hospitals (UH), 23 high-volume centers (HVC), 6 low-volume centers (LVC). Half of the participating centers do not take into consideration WFNS at presentation to indicate ventilation. While 42% of centers rely on the P/F ratio to indicate ventilation, 62% of them have a cutoff value of < 200, and 38% of < 100. While most UH and HVC used propofol for the first phase of sedation (95%), LVC employed benzodiazepines (100%). Sedation deepening was done with ketamine in UH (75%) and HVC (60%), whereas LVC used predominantly clonidine (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrates that attitudes and practices pertaining to ICU management in aSAH are enormously heterogeneous, reflecting the lack of good quality evidence and differing interpretations thereof.

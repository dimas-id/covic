Nasal washings were collected from 27 normal adults during 38 naturally acquired colds. The washings were exhaustively tested using tissue cultures, organ cultures and electron microscopy. Washings yielding no identifiable agent were inoculated into human volunteers, and further specimens obtained from the latter were examined by the same techniques in vitro. Viruses were identified in association with 25 of the original 38 colds (65.7%). Fifteen were rhinoviruses (39.5%), seven coronaviruses (18.4%), two were parainfluenza viruses, and one was influenza virus. Use of organ cultures and of volunteers significantly increased the isolation rate. No agent was cultivated from the remaining 13 specimens, although tests in volunteers showed that cold‚Äêproducing agents were present in five of them (13%). Three specimens gave doubtful results in volunteers, and five others, all collected within a period of six weeks in December and January, apparently contained no infectious agent.

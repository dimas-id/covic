To investigate the sedative effect of dexmedetomidine in spinal-epidural anesthesia on hysteromyomectomy a total of 100 hysteromyomectomy patients were randomly divided into the control group and the observation group with 50 in each group. Patients in the control group received the general anesthesia, while those in the observation group received spinal-epidural anesthesia, and intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine. For maintenance of anesthesia, ropivacaine was adopted for both groups. Before anesthesia, at 30 min and 60 min after anesthesia, we measured the heart rate (HR), bispectral index (BIS) and sedative effect. Before anesthesia, HR, BIS and Ramsay scores were compared between two groups, and the results showed that differences had no statistical significance (p>0.05); but at 30 min after anesthesia, HR and BIS of patients in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p<0.05), and Ramsay score was higher than the control group (p<0.05). No statistical significance was found in differences of the incidence rate of adverse reactions between two groups (p>0.05). Application of dexmedetomidine in spinal-epidural anesthesia gains promising sedative effect and safety in hysteromyomectomy, which is worthy of being promoted in clinical treatment.

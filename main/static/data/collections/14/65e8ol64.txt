DiscoveryDot(TM) is a novel solution‚Äêphase technology for chemical compound microarrays which has been validated for several targets (e.g. serine proteases, cysteine proteases, metalloproteinases, histone deacetylases, phosphatases and various kinases) of significance for drug discovery. The historical context of microarrays and the advantages of the DiscoveryDot(TM) technology are highlighted. The success of this chemical microarray technology will provide unprecedented possibility and capability for parallel functional analysis of hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds.

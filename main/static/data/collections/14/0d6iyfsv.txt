Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2005;86:1134–40. Objective To investigate the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the physical fitness and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among SARS survivors. Design A cohort study. Setting An outpatient physiotherapy department in a major hospital in Hong Kong. Participants SARS patients (N=171) discharged from the hospital. Their mean age was 37.36±12.65 years, and the average number of days of hospitalization was 21.79±9.93 days. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Subjects’ cardiorespiratory (6-minute walk test [6MWT], Chester step test for predicting maximal oxygen uptake [V̇o2max]), musculoskeletal (proximal/distal muscle strength and endurance test), and HRQOL status (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]) were measured and compared with the normative data matched for age and sex. Results Seventy-eight (45.61%) patients continued to require prednisolone (<0.5mg·kg−1·d−1) for residual lung opacities when data were collected. The values of 6MWT distance, predicted V̇o2max, proximal and distal muscle strength, and the scores from all SF-36 domains, particularly perceived role-physical, were significantly lower than the normative data (P<.05). Conclusions SARS survivors had deficits in cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal performance, and their HRQOL appeared to be significantly impaired.

BACKGROUND Symptomatic perineal hernia is a rare complication after abdominoperineal resection (APR). Management of these hernias is challenging. The recurrence rate after surgical repair is high because of the difficulty of prosthetic material fixation; there is no consensus regarding the best method of repair. METHODS We introduced a novel combined laparoscopic-perineal dual fixation technique in the repair of perineal hernias after APR. This technique begins with a perineal approach under laparoscopic vision. After excision of the hernia sac, the mesh is introduced and fixed anteriorly to the urogenital diaphragm and laterally to the sacrotuberous ligament and the surrounding scar tissue. The perineal incision is then closed. Next, the mesh is fixed to the sacrum with ProTackÂ® and is fixed again to the sacrotuberous ligament via a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS The dual fixation repair method is successful and without difficulties, with no recurrence at 13-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Our laparoscopic-perineal dual fixation method is a good alternative method for large perineal hernia repair after APR.

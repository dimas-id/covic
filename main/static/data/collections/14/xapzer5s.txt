The current COVID-19 pandemic is threatening global health. Rates of infection outside of China are rapidly increasing, with confirmed cases reported in over 160 countries as of 19 March 2020 [1]. During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, 21% of the global cumulative case total were healthcare workers [2], while a recent study from Wuhan, China reported that 1716 healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19, representing 3.8% of confirmed cases [3]. During the SARS epidemic, it is likely that a lack of awareness and preparedness put healthcare workers at risk [4]. Thus, delivering rapid, reliable information that addresses critical infection control issues is of key importance, and tracheal intubation is known to be associated with a high-risk of transmission of viral infections to healthcare workers [5, 6].

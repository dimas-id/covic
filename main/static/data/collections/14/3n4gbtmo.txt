In this paper, we derive several a posteriori error estimators for generalized diffusion equation with delay in a convex polygonal domain. The Crankâ€“Nicolson method for time discretization is used and a continuous, piecewise linear finite element space is employed for the space discretization. The a posteriori error estimators corresponding to space discretization are derived by using the interpolation estimates. Two different continuous, piecewise quadratic reconstructions are used to obtain the error due to the time discretization. To estimate the error in the approximation of the delay term, linear approximations of the delay term are used in a crucial way. As a consequence, a posteriori upper and lower error bounds for fully discrete approximation are derived for the first time. In particular, long-time a posteriori error estimates are obtained for stable systems. Numerical experiments are presented which confirm our theoretical results.

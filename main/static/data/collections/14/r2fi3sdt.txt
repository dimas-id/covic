Since the first description of the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) in the pediatric urology population, various authors have shared their experiences and results. We aim to provide a review of current studies of LESS and share our experience with this modality. The current literature describes the use of LESS for most surgeries performed in the pediatric urology population with similar results to open and standard laparoscopic surgery. The authors have described their experiences with transabdominal and retroperitoneal nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy, pyeloplasty, orchidopexy, varicocelectomy, and renal cyst decortication. In our experience, LESS has taken a role for extirpative surgery since we use other modalities for upper tract reconstruction. The data available has validated LESS as safe and has demonstrated similar results to standard laparoscopic surgery and open surgery with better cosmetic results.

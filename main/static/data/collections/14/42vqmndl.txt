A series of sialosides modified at the 4- and 9-hydroxy group were synthesised and tested for inhibition of the viral haemagglutinin-esterase activity from various Orthomyxoviruses and Coronaviruses. While no inhibition of the sialate-4-O-acetylesterases from mouse hepatitis virus strain S or sialodacryoadenitis virus was found, a 9-O-methyl derivative displayed inhibitory activity against recombinant sialate-9-O-acetylesterase from influenza C virus.

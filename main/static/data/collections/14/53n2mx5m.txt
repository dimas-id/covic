OBJECTIVE: These recommendations aim to provide guidance on breastfeeding for mothers with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 METHODS: We performed a review of the recent medical literature on breastfeeding mothers with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, focusing on the neonatal period RESULTS: We analyzed 20 recent publications on breastfeeding, Covid-19, and its transmission through breastmilk We presented possible options for breastfeeding and their consequences for the mother and the child CONCLUSION: All maternal decisions in relation to breastfeeding are justifiable since the infection by Covid-19 is still poorly known However, puerperal women and their families must be very well informed to make a conscious choice based on the information available in the literature so far

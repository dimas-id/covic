Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has recently been shown to be a prominent cause of respiratory infections in immunocompromised hosts, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We report a case of hMPV pneumonia in a lung transplant recipient presenting with respiratory failure and sepsis syndrome. hMPV was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction, and treated with intravenous ribavirin with a successful outcome.

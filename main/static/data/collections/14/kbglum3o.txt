A 15-year-old neutered female domestic shorthair cat was presented for weight loss, polydipsia/polyuria, and lethargy. A large fluctuant mass was palpated in the ventral right cervical region. Biochemistry results were consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid hormone level in the fluid was higher to that observed in the plasma, consistent with a cystic parathyroid lesion. Right parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy were performed without complications. Ionized calcium normalized within a few hours. Histopathology yielded a diagnosis of cystic parathyroid adenoma. Follow-up showed complete recovery of clinical signs and normalization of ionized calcium. This case shows an uncommon presentation of feline primary hyperparathyroidism secondary to a cystic parathyroid adenoma and is, to our knowledge, the first case presented with a large palpable mass in which parathyroid hormone concentration was measured. This report highlights the value of selective hormonal analyses of the cystic fluid to confirm the origin of the cystic lesion pre-operatively.

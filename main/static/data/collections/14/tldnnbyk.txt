INTRODUCTION THUNDERBEAT (TB) is a novel device that uses both ultrasonic and advanced bipolar energies for hemostasis. Several recent human studies have proved the safety and efficacy of TB in different surgical procedures, but there have been no similar studies about its efficacy in hepatic parenchymal transection. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the TB device in laparoscopic liver resection. METHODS This retrospective study compared TB and ultrasonic Harmonic devices in 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection from 2010 to 2016 in our institution. To reduce the selection bias, the two groups were matched in a 1-to-2 ratio on the basis of propensity scores. RESULTS There were no differences in the preoperative patient characteristics between the two groups. The extent of liver resection was comparable between the groups. Although the Harmonic group's intraoperative blood loss and operative time were less than that of the TB group, the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.08, P = 0.32, respectively). Postoperative complications, mortality within 90 days, and hospital stay were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION TB is as safe and effective for parenchymal transection in laparoscopic hepatectomy as ultrasonic devices, but it is not a superior alternative.

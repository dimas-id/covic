Abstract This paper is the sixteenth installment of our annual review of research concerning the opiate system. It is restricted to papers published during 1993 that concern the behavioral effects of the endogenous opiate peptides, and does not include papers dealing only with their analgesic properties. The specific topics this year include stress; tolerance and dependence; eating; drinking; gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic function; mental illness and mood; learning, memory, and reward; cardiovascular responses; respiration and thermoregulation; seizures and other neurological disorders; electrical-related activity; general activity and locomotion; development; immunological responses; and other behaviors.

• In the occurrence of new-onset neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients, we should suspect an acute ischemic stroke and not assume that it is secondary to the respiratory syndrome (hypoxia). Acute ischaemic stroke continues to be a treatable medical emergency also during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. • Arterial thrombotic events may not only occur as a complication in severe cases of COVID-19; but can also appear in mild-moderate cases due to other mechanisms. • Several pathogeneses may be behind ischemic strokes in COVID-19, in addition to the more evident coagulopathy associated with the severe infection.

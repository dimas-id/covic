Abstract Crystals of the two ammo-terminal domains of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, the receptor for the major group of human rhinovirus serotypes, diffract to 3.0 Å resolution. The crystals are trigonal in space group P3121 or P3221 with cell dimensions of a = b = 55.7 A ̊ , c = 166.3 A ̊ , with probably six molecules per unit cell.

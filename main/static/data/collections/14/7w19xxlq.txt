The infection by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes major public health concern and economic burden. Although clinically approved drugs have been repurposed to treat individuals with 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the lack of safety studies and limited efficiency as well jeopardize clinical benefits. Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir (SFV) are clinically approved direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against hepatitis C virus (HCV), with satisfactory safety profile. In the HCV replicative cycle, daclatasvir and SFV target the viral enzymes NS5A and NS5B, respectively. NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. These characteristics of the HCV and SARS-CoV-2 motivated us to further study the activity of daclatasvir and SFV against the new coronavirus. Daclatasvir consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and in type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 μM, respectively. Daclatasvir targeted early events during SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and prevented the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α, inflammatory mediators associated with the cytokine storm typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sofosbuvir, although inactive in Vero cells, displayed EC50 values of 6.2 and 9.5 μM in HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, respectively. Our data point to additional antiviral candidates, in especial daclatasvir, among drugs overlooked for COVID-19, that could immediately enter clinical trials.

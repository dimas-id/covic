Abstract This study investigated methylene blue (MB) degradation by the vacuum-ultraviolet/ultraviolet/persulfate (VUV/UV/PS) process using a mini-fluidic VUV/UV photoreaction system. Results show that MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was significantly higher than that of the conventional UV/PS process, as the VUV photolysis of H2O and PS generated more reactive oxygen species (ROSs). HO• and SO4 •−, identified as the main ROSs, were mostly consumed by dissolved organic carbon and Cl‒ in real waters, respectively. Additionally, the impacts of solution pH and the concentrations of PS, humic acid, and inorganic ions (HCO3 ‒, Cl‒, NO3 ‒, SO4 2‒, Fe(II), and Fe(III)) were systematically evaluated. The solution pH significantly affected the photon absorption distributions, as well as the contributions of photolysis and oxidation to MB degradation, resulting in different variations in the degradation rate constant and total organic carbon removal ratio with increasing solution pH. At all tested pH levels (3.0–11.0), particularly under acidic conditions, HO and SO4 − were two predominant contributors to MB degradation, while VUV and UV photolysis contributed more when the solution pH increased. This study provides a highly efficient process for organic pollutant removal, which could be applied in water treatment.

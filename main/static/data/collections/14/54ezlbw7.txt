Although in heart failure (HF) there is a strict correlation between heart and kidney, no data are available on the potential relationship in HF between renal dysfunction (RD) and the impaired sympathetic innervation. Aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between RD and cardiac sympathetic innervation in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. Two hundred and sixty-three patients with mild-to-severe HF underwent iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy to assess sympathetic innervation, evaluating early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate. In all patients, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula was assessed. A direct association was found between EPI-eGFR and late H/M (r = .215; P < .001). Dividing the population into moderate-to-severe eGFR reduction and normal-to-mildly reduced eGFR (cutoff ≤ 60 mL·min-1·1.73 m-2), a statistically significant reduction of late H/M value was found in patients with RD compared to patients with preserved eGFR (P = .030). By multivariable linear regression analysis, eGFR resulted in the prediction of impaired late H/M in patients with RD (P = .005). Patients with RD and HF show more impaired cardiac sympathetic activity than HF patients with preserved renal function, and reduced eGFR is a predictor of reduced late H/M.

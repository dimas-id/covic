BACKGROUND Laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair (LPEHR) has been shown to be both safe and efficacious. Compulsory operative steps include reduction of the stomach from the mediastinum, resection of the mediastinal hernia sac, ensuring an appropriate intraabdominal esophageal length, and crural closure. The use of mesh materials in the repair of hiatal hernias remains controversial. Synthetic mesh may reduce hernia recurrences, but may increase postoperative dysphagia and result in esophageal erosion. Human acellular dermal matrix (HADM) may reduce the incidence of hernia recurrence with reduced complications compared with synthetic mesh. METHODS A retrospective review of all cases of laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair using HADM from December 2008 through March 2010 at a single institution was performed evaluating demographic information, BMI, operative times, length of stay, and complications. DISCUSSION Forty-six LPEHRs with HADM were identified. The mean age of patients was 60.3 years (± 13.9); BMI 30.3 (± 5.3); operative time 182 minutes (± 56); and length of stay 2.6 days (± 1.9). Nine of 46 (19.6%) patients experienced perioperative complications, including subcutaneous emphysema without pneumothorax (n=2), urinary retention (n=1), COPD exacerbation (n=2), early dysphagia resolving before discharge (n=1), esophageal perforation (n=1), delayed gastric perforation occurring 30 days postoperatively associated with gas bloat syndrome (n=1), and PEG site abscess (n=1). There were 2 clinically recurrent hernias (4.3%). Radiographic recurrences occurred in 2 of 26 patients (7.7%). Six of 46 (13%) patients reported persistent dysphagia. CONCLUSION LPEHR with HADM crural reinforcement is an effective method of repairing symptomatic paraesophageal hernias with low perioperative morbidity. Recurrences occur infrequently with this technique. No meshrelated complications were seen in this series.

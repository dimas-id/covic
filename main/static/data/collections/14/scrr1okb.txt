Antibodies are a crucial part of the body's specific defense against infectious diseases and have considerable potential as therapeutic and prophylactic agents in humans and animals. The development of recombinant single-chain antibodies allows a genetic application strategy for prevention of infectious diseases. To test this in a fish model, a gene construct encoding a neutralizing single-chain antibody to the fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus VHSV (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) was administered to rainbow trout by intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA. Circulating recombinant antibodies could later be detected in the fish, and protective immunity to the viral disease was established.

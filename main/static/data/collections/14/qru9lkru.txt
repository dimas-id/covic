Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) govern all aspects of cell function and, as such, are a major target for research and therapeutic intervention. A major rate-limiting step in PPI research is the expression and purification of full-length proteins. The use of peptides to study PPIs significantly facilitates the structural and biophysical characterization of PPIs as well as the effort to develop drugs to control PPIs. Here we describe examples for the use of peptides to study PPI and some of the important experimental methods that are used in the field. Peptides have proved to be excellent tools to study PPIs and have been contributing both for understanding mechanisms of PPIs as well as for drug design for PPI modulation.

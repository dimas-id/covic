A key component of crisis management involves the management of asymmetric information problems. Drawing on the experience of the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, this article examines the nature of the asymmetric information problems that typically prevail during a crisis, the costs associated with it, and the various mechanisms to address the problems. We find that the asymmetric information problems in the event of a crisis can be severe and potentially costly if the problems are not adequately resolved. Â© 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

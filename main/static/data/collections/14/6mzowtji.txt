Abstract Introduction. Current reports indicate that the increased use of social distancing for preventive COID-19 distribution may have a negative effect on patients who suffering from acute medical conditions. Aim. We examined the effect of social distancing on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients' referral to the emergency department (ED) Method. A retrospective archive study was conducted between January 2017 and April 2020 in a comprehensive stroke center. We compare the number of neurologic consultations, time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, patients diagnosis with AIS, number of patients receiving treatment (tPA, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or combine) and in-hospital death. Results. The analysis included a total of 14,626 neurological consultations from the years 2017 to 2020. A significant decrease of 58.6% was noted during the months of January-April of the year 2020 compared to the parallel period of 2017. Percent of final AIS diagnosis for the year of 2020 represent 24.8% of suspected cases, with the highest diagnosis rate demarcated for the year of 2019 with 25.6% of confirmed patients. The most remarkable increase was noted in EVT performance through the examined years (2017, n=21; 2018, n=32; 2019, n=42; 2020, n=47). Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in routing constraints on health care system resources that were dedicated for treating COVID-19 patients. The healthcare system must develop and offer complementary solutions that will enable access to health services even during these difficult times.

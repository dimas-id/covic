OBJECTIVE Although sacrocolpopexy (SCP) can provide durable apical support, the use of mesh may give rise to various complications, including vaginal mesh erosion. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for vaginal mesh erosion after SCP in Korean women. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 363 women who underwent SCP with type 1 polypropylene mesh. They were evaluated at 1, 4, and 12 months after surgery and then annually thereafter with respect to anatomy and complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model were performed to identify the risk factors for mesh erosion. RESULTS During the median 2-year follow-up period, vaginal mesh erosion was found in 29 women (8.0%). Among them, 19 (65.5%) required surgical correction. Estrogenic status was the only independent risk factor for mesh erosion. The risk for mesh erosion was 4.5 times higher in premenopausal women than in menopausal women not on estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.9-10.9, p<0.01). Menopausal women on ERT also had an increased risk, with a statistically marginal significance (hazard ratio 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-6.6; p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS Premenopausal or menopausal women on ERT are at high risk for mesh erosion after SCP with type 1 polypropylene mesh, and two-thirds of mesh erosion cases require reoperation. This information should be incorporated into patient counseling and treatment decisions.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Transplant patients are particularly at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed state, and they have the propensity to develop opportunistic infections. The pre-immunosuppressed state, along with other existing comorbidities, can influence the outcomes of COVID-19 in transplant patients. We describe a case of a renal transplant patient who developed COVID-19. Real-time nucleic acid testing (NAT) should be done in deceased and living donors. The most common management strategy is the modification of immunosuppression along with current experimental strategies for COVID-19.

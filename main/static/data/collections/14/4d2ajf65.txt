Germicidal agents are nonspecific antimicrobial agents that are too toxic to be administered internally but are safe and effective when used topically. When applied to living tissue (e.g., the skin), they are termed antiseptics. When applied to inanimate objects (e.g., environmental surfaces or instruments used to perform medical procedures), they are termed disinfectants. All of these agents work at least by damaging microbial surfaces, often by alkylation, oxidation, or reaction with proteins. Products capable of destroying all forms of microbial life, including bacterial spores, are termed sterilizing agents.

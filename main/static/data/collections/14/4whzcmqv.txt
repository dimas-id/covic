Viral infections are a major global health threat. Over the last 50 years, significant efforts have been devoted to the development of antiviral drugs and great success has been achieved for some viruses. However, other virus infections, such as epidemic influenza, still spread globally and new threats continue to arise from emerging and re-emerging viruses and drug-resistant viruses. In this review, the contributions of microbial products isolated in Institute of Microbial Chemistry for antiviral research are summarized. In addition, the current state of development of antiviral drugs that target influenza virus and hepatitis B virus, and the future prospects for antivirals from natural products are described and discussed.

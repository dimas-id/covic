Abstract Patients with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and thrombotic events. Statins are known for their pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immunomodulatory effects. They may have a potential role as adjunctive therapy to mitigate the effects of endothelial dysfunction and dysregulated inflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection.

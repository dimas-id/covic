INTRODUCTION Recently, laparoscopic lavage emerged as an effective alternative for patients with perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis. CASE REPORT A 96-year-old woman, diagnosed with Hinchey 3 diverticulitis after a computed tomography scan, was operated on with a single-access "lavage" to reduce surgical trauma and to avoid stoma. METHODS The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. Tracheal intubation, nasogastric tube, and urethral catheterization were mandatory. The patient was in a modified Lloyd-Davis position, with the table tilted in Trendelenburg position, left side up. Surgeons were on the right side. INSTRUMENTATION The procedure was performed using a surgical technique similar to standard laparoscopy with traditional laparoscopic instruments. SURGICAL STEPS: The surgical procedure involved single-incision laparoscopic surgery (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) insertion, small bowel dissection, abscess opening, and peritoneal washing. RESULTS The procedure was completed in 75 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 120 mL. The patient was kept in the intensive care unit for 1 day. She was on postoperative analgesia for 2 days and was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5. The patient was able to drink on day 1 and eat on day 3 after flatus.

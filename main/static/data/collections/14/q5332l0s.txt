Abstract The international response to SARS-CoV has produced an outstanding number of protein structures in a very short time. This review summarizes the findings of functional and structural studies including those derived from cryoelectron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography, and incorporates bioinformatics predictions where no structural data is available. Structures that shed light on the function and biological roles of the proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis are highlighted. The high percentage of novel protein folds identified among SARS-CoV proteins is discussed.

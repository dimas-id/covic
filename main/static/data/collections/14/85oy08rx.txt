Robotic surgery offers potential technical advantages that may facilitate pancreatic resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning curve and short-term perioperative outcomes in patients who underwent laparoscopic and robot-assisted distal pancreatectomy. All perioperative variables were evaluated and compared retrospectively between laparoscopic (LDP) (n = 23) and robot-assisted (RDP) (n = 11) distal pancreatectomy. The mean total operative time was shorter in LDP (194 vs. 225 min; p = 0.017). All other perioperative criteria were similar between LDP and RDP patients (blood loss, transfusion rate, conversion, pancreatic fistula, postoperative morbidity, and duration of hospitalization). Non-adjusted CUSUM curve for composite events including operative time, conversion, postoperative morbidity and reoperation rates showed that the RDP learning curve corresponded to the first seven consecutive patients. During early experience, RDP was associated with longer operative time but similar short-term perioperative outcomes compared to conventional distal pancreatectomy.

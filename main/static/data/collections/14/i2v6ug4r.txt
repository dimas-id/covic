COVID-19 pandemic affects not only daily life activities but also traditional education systems. Based on the current developments, to stick by their academic calendars, most of the educational institutions continue their classes via online channels. Since the selection of the most appropriate e–learning platform depends on multi–criteria, the evaluation of this selection process can be dealt with decision support systems. In this study, cognitive mapping extended with intuitionistic fuzzy sets is introduced for prioritizing the e–learning platform selection factors under fuzzy environment based on the multi–expert judgments. Based on the results, infrastructure and ease of use are determined as the most effective factors. For further studies, a sensitivity analysis based on the initial vector determination can be studied to check its effect on the outputs.

Background Emerging evidence has demonstrated that nature-based interventions (NBIs) can improve mental and physical health. Considering that the global burden of poor mental health continues to rise, such interventions could be a cost-effective means to improve mental health, as well as reconnect individuals with the natural world, and thus aid efforts. However, the effectiveness of NBIs as a prescriptive intervention is, in part, a function of access to blue and green spaces. Accordingly, this scoping review will explore how structural inequalities influence the effectiveness of nature-based interventions as treatment options for mental and physical ill health. Methods A scoping review will be conducted to identify the barriers and facilitators associated with the utilisation of green and blue spaces. The review will follow the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, in addition to the associated Cochrane guidelines for scoping reviews. A literature search will be performed across five databases, and articles will be selected based on key inclusion/ exclusion criteria. All data will be extracted to a pre-defined charting table. The primary and secondary outcomes will be mental and physical health respectively. Discussion This review will better inform relevant stakeholders of the potential enablers and barriers of nature-based interventions, and thereby improve provision and implementation of NBIs as public health initiatives.

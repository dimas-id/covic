INTRODUCTION Considering the high prevalence of respiratory infections in hospitalized infants with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), the objective of this study is to determine the direct costs of this infection. PATIENTS AND METHOD Prospective longitudinal study in infants under one year of age hospitalized due to RSV during 2015. The patients were divided into 2 groups, Group 1 pa tients without risk factors and Group 2 patients with risk factors (prematurity, oxygen dependence, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, heart disease, immunocompromised patients), comparing each other variables such as nutritional status, gender, breastfeeding, discharge diagnosis, radiological diagno sis, length of hospital stay, among others. Direct costs for hospitalization were estimated according to the fees of the National Health Fund (FONASA) and the Modality of Institutional Care (MAI). RESULTS The total patients admitted in the period were 260: 234 (90%) in Group 1 and 26 (10%) in Group 2. The average hospital stay for Group 1 was 7.3 days (SD+5.1) with a median of 6 days, and 13.6 days (SD+16.3) for Group 2 with a median of 7 days (p < 0.05). The direct costs associated with RSV hospitalization were on average CLP $ 413,529 (US$ 632.1) for Group 1, and CLP $ 744,260 (US$ 1,137.6) for Group 2 (p < 0.05). There was also statistically significant higher cost for Group 2 due to tests and drugs (p < 0.05) and costs per day of hospital stay (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION These values, known for the first time in the national reality, confirm the high cost of these infections and particularly in risk groups.

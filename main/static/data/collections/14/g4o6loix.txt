The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) have proven to be a crucial factor to decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. However, there are various hurdles that impede people from purchasing EVs. For example, long charging time, short driving range, cost and insufficient charging infrastructures available, etc. This article reports the public perception of EV-adoption using statistical analyses and proposes some recommendations for improving EV-adoption in Qatar. User perspectives on EV-adoption barriers in Qatar were investigated based on survey questionnaires. The survey questionnaires were based on similar studies done in other regions of the world. The study attempted to look at different perspectives of the adoption of EV, when asked to a person who is aware of EVs or a person who may or may not be aware of EVs. Cumulative survey responses from the two groups were compared and analyzed using a two sample t-test statistical analysis. Detailed analyses showed that among various major hindrances raising of public awareness of such greener modes of transportation, the availability of charging options in more places and policy incentives towards EVs would play a major role in EV-adoption. The authors provide recommendations that along with government incentives could help make a gradual shift to a greater number of EVs convenient for people of Qatar. The proposed systematic approach for such a study and analysis may help in streamlining research on policies, infrastructures and technologies for efficient penetration of EVs in Qatar.

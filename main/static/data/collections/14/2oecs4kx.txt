Five prototype strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) -1,-3, -S,- A59 and -JHM were analyzed for their ability to induce interferon (IFN) in seven cell lines of rodent origin. Induction of IFN by all of the prototype MHV strains was infrequent and unpredictable, while IFN was produced consistently by five cell lines treated with known inducers. Priming and/or aging of cells did not enhance IFN induction by the MHV strains except in the case of MHV-A59 which consistently induced moderate levels of IFN on L-cells which were both primed and aged. Kinetic studies of MHV-A59-induced IFN on primed and aged L-cells demonstrated that detectable levels of IFN were not produced until 24 hours post-inoculation (p.i.). Peak levels were attained at 30 hours p.i. with no additional IFN produced through 48 hours p.i. MHV-induced IFN was similar in composition and properties to Newcastle disease virus-induced IFN. The sensitivities of the five MHV strains to eight concentrations of preformed L-cell IFN were also assessed. All strains except MHV-S fit a linear model with MHV-3, MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM having similar slopes. At most concentrations MHV-3 was less sensitive than MHV-1, -A59 or -JHM to IFN. The response curve for MHV-S was non-linear. This strain was more sensitive to the antiviral effects of the pre-formed IFN except at the highest concentrations of IFN used.

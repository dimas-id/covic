Vascular tree development depends on the timely differentiation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. These latter are key players in the formation of the vascular scaffold that offers resistance to the blood flow. This review aims at providing an overview on the role of PDE5, the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase that historically attracted much attention for its involvement in male impotence, in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell function. The overall goal is to underscore the importance of PDE5 expression and activity in this cell type in the context of the organs where its function has been extensively studied.

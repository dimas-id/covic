Four virus-induced non-structural proteins with apparent molecular weights of 11-14 kilodaltons (kDa) were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis in cells infected by TGEV. Differences in the number of non-structural proteins were observed among virulent and attenuated TGEV strains as well as with two antigenically related feline and canine coronaviruses.

SARS‐CoV‐2 is a disease known from a few months, caused by a recently arisen virus and, consequently, it is little known. The disease has a benign course in most infected subjects (children and young adults), is often symptomatic in adults over the age of 50 and often serious and life threatening in people with comorbidities and the elderly. The few data published on COVID‐19 in the blood‐oncology field report a serious clinical presentation, a serious course of the disease and a high mortality rate, as has also been reported for other cancer contexts. The current strategy for treating patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 includes antivirals that are effective against other viral infections and drugs that can moderate the cytokine storm. There is no specific vaccine and consequently all possible precautions must be taken to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the areas of oncology, onco‐hematology, and bone marrow transplantation. In this reviewer's article, we report the information currently available on SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to help young doctors and hematologists to successfully manage patients with COVID‐19.

INTRODUCTION Responding to acts of terrorism requires the effective use of public-safety and medical-response resources. The knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to respond to future threats is unfamiliar to most emergency responders. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this report to describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a multidisciplinary, interactive and simulation-enhanced course to prepare responders to acts of terrorism. METHODS We used a 5-step systematic process to develop a blended-learning, simulation-enhanced training program. Learners completed a self-confidence questionnaire and written examination prior to the course and a self-confidence questionnaire, written examination and course evaluation when they finished the course. RESULTS From July 7, 2003 to March 8, 2005, 497 consenting learners completed the course. After course completion, learners demonstrated significant increases in their knowledge of terrorism response (t = -64.3, df = 496, p < 0.05) and their confidence in responding to terrorist events (t = -45.5, df = 496, p < 0.05). Learner feedback about the course was highly positive. CONCLUSIONS We successfully implemented a two-day course for professionals likely to respond to terrorist acts that included scenario-based performance training and assessment. Course participants increased their knowledge and were more confident in their ability to respond to acts of terrorism after participating in this course.

The confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States since late January 2020. There were over 4.8 million confirmed cases and about 320,000 deaths as of May 19, 2020 in the world. We examined the characteristics of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in all affected counties of the United States. We proposed a COVID-Net combining the architecture of both Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by using the trajectories of COVID-19 during different periods until May 19, 2020, as the training data. The validation of the COVID-Net was performed by predicting the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in subsequent 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods. The COVID-Net produced relatively smaller Mean Relative Errors (MREs) for the 10 counties with the most severe epidemic as of May 19, 2020. On average, MREs were 0.01 for the number of confirmed cases in all validation periods, and 0.01, 0.01, and 0.03 for the number of deaths in the 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods, respectively. The COVID-Net incorporated five risk factors of COVID-19 and was used to predict the trajectories of COVID-19 in Hudson County, New Jersey and New York County, New York until June 28, 2020. The risk factors include the percentage of the population with access to exercise opportunities, average daily PM2.5, population size, preventable hospitalization rate, and violent crime rate. The expected number of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths depends on the dynamics of these five risk factors.

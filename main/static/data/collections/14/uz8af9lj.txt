BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disease that carries a high mortality. Very few case reports in the literature have described a relationship between Graves disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We present a case of a patient with Graves disease who was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 30-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension and a family history of Graves disease who had recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and placed on methimazole. She presented to our hospital with the complaints of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs were stable. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, depending on clinical and laboratory results, and also was found to have highly elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. She received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis and ultimately had a total thyroidectomy. The patient’s hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/μl, and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized despite multiple complications. The patient ultimately had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and died despite multiple attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Graves disease is an uncommon trigger for the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and very few cases have been reported thus far. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this association in the appropriate clinical context to comprehensively monitor hyperthyroid patients during treatment.

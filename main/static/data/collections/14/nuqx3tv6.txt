COVID-19 has affected the world tremendously. It is critical that biological experiments and clinical designs are informed by computational approaches for time- and cost-effective solutions. Comparative analyses particularly can play a key role to reveal structural changes in proteins due to mutations, which can lead to behavioural changes, such as the increased binding of the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein to human ACE2 receptors. The aim of this report is to provide an easy to follow tutorial for biologists and others without delving into different bioinformatics tools. More complex analyses such as the use of large-scale computational methods can then be utilised. Starting with a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, the report shows visualising DNA sequence features, deriving amino acid sequences, and aligning different genomes to analyse mutations and differences. The report provides further insights into how the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein mutated for higher binding affinity to human ACE2 receptors, compared to the SARS-CoV protein, by integrating existing 3D protein models.

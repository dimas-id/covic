BACKGROUND Mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) is a recommended method of treatment for comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. However, the proper site of temperature measurement in MTH is still not defined. The aim of this study was to compare temperature measurements in the esophagus and urinary bladder in comatose post-OHCA patients treated with MTH. METHODS This temperature comparison protocol was a part of a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study. The study population included 36 unconscious patients after resuscitation for OHCA. The patient's core temperature was independently measured every hour during MTH in the urinary bladder and in the esophagus. RESULTS The mean temperature was lower in the esophagus (differences during induction phase: 1.04 ± 0.92ºC, p < 0.0001; stabilization phase: 0.54 ± 0.39ºC, p < 0.0001; rewarming phase: 0.40 ± 0.47ºC, p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, a strong correlation between both sites was found (R² = 0.83, p < 0.001). The decrease in temperature observed in the esophagus during the induction phase was faster when compared with the urinary bladder (1.09 ± 0.71°C/h vs. 0.83 ± 0.41°C/h; p = 0.002). As a consequence, time to reach temperature < 34.0°C was longer when temperature was measured in the urinary bladder (the difference between medians of the time 1.0 [0-1.5] h, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Urinary bladder temperature measurements may lag behind temperature changes measured in the esophagus.Monitoring temperature simultaneously in the esophagus and in the urinary bladder is an accessible and reliable combination, although esophageal measurements seem to better reflect the dynamics of temperature changes, thus it seems to be more appropriate for MTH control.

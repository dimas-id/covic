Influenza viruses are among the most common causes of human respiratory infection, causing high morbidity and mortality. In the United States, influenza results in approximately 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths during a seasonal epidemic [1]. During a pandemic, up to 50% of the population can be infected by influenza, increasing the number of deaths [2]. In 1918, the worst influenza pandemic recorded in history caused up to 50 million deaths worldwide, with elderly, infants, and people with underlying illness having the highest risk of fatality [3].

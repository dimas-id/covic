Abstract Why do more complex viruses (e.g., HIV, AIDS-virus and SARS coronavirus) tend to be more fatal? The paper concludes that the cell fractal geometry of viruses is the key. This paper also suggests two possible new approaches using nanotechnology and temperature to cure or prevent virus infection.

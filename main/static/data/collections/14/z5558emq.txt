COVID 19 pandemic is a worldwide health emergency. Every single Hospital and Department was forced to radically modify clinical practice decreasing or stopping daily activities. Oncological patients had to carry on treatments in order to prevent disease progression and improve their quality of life. However, many health workers may be a potential source of infection if not tested with swabs but this diagnostic procedure was not suitable universally in Italy. Aiming to reduce hospitalization of our patients with advanced lung cancer, vinorelbine in its metronomic formulation is one of the best strategy. Here, we report the experience with oral vinorelbine in a few patients of our Oncology Department.

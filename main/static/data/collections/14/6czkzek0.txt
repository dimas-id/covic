Nineteen patients with spasmodic torticollis, unresponsive to standard therapy, were administered local injections of botulinum‐A toxin into the affected muscles. During an average follow‐up period of 11.5 months, a more than 25% improvement was noted in 14 of 19 patients. All those with purely focal dystonia and 9 of 10 patients with a disease history of less than three years benefited from treatment. Side effects were insignificant and transient. Botulinum toxin is a very effective and safe method of treatment for spasmodic torticollis.

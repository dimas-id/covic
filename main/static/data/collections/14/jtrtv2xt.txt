Covid‐19 infection has the potential for targeting the central nervous system and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress. Here we described the case of a 60‐year old subject with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed an akinetic mutism due to encephalitis. MRI was negative whereas EEG showed generalized theta slowing. CSF analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased IL‐8 and TNF‐α concentrations while other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded. A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of CSF parameters was observed after high‐dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory‐mediated brain involvement related to Covid‐19.

Most of the existing methods for the robustness and targeted immunization problems can be viewed as greedy strategies, which are quite efficient but readily induce a local optimization. In this paper, starting from a percolation perspective, we develop two strategies, the relationship-related (RR) strategy and the prediction relationship (PR) strategy, to avoid a local optimum only through the investigation of interrelationships among nodes. Meanwhile, RR combines the sum rule and the product rule from explosive percolation, and PR holds the assumption that nodes with high degree are usually more important than those with low degree. In this manner our methods have a better capability to collapse or protect a network. The simulations performed on a number of networks also demonstrate their effectiveness, especially on large real-world networks where RR fragments each of them into the same size of the giant component; however, RR needs only less than [Formula: see text] of the number of nodes which are necessary for the most excellent existing methods.

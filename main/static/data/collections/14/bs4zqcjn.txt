Abstract COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the XXI century. In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations. As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases. Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing. We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers. Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.

Focus a laser on dissolved particles and analyze the scattered light to reveal their size. This well established principle is used in dynamic light scattering (DLS), or also called photon-correlation spectroscopy, which is a widely popular and highly adaptable analytical method applied in different fields of life and material sciences, as well as in industrial quality control processes.

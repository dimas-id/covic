BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The experience of flow diverters (FDs) in treating large vertebral artery-dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) is still limited. This study was conducted to present our long-term outcome of VADAs treated with a Tubridge flow diverter (TFD), a new device developed in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical and angiographic data of six patients harboring large VADAs and treated with TFDs were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of nine TFDs were successfully implanted in six patients. Angiographic follow-up images were available for all patients at a median of 26.0 (18.5, 37.5) months after treatment. Five of the six VADAs were completely occluded, and the last was improved (near complete occlusion). In-stent stenosis was detected in one case and was handled appropriately by angioplasty and stenting. All covered branches and parent arteries remained patent. There were no complications or new neurological deficits observed in any of the patients. At the latest clinical follow-up (36.5 (26.0, 44.5) months), all patients achieved 0 in the modified Rankin scale score. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience suggests that the Tubridge flow diverter might be an alternative treatment for large and recurrent dissecting aneurysms derived from the vertebral artery.

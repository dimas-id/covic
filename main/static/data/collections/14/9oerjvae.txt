The EMHJ was established in 1995 to provide a peer-reviewed platform for health professionals to share their research with the scientific community. The objective of this review was to examine EMR public health research trends, as reflected by EMHJ publications in 20 years (1995-2014), through secondary data analysis. Published articles were categorized according to EMR strategic priority areas (93%), i.e. health systems strengthening (25%); reproductive and child health (22%); communicable diseases (26%); noncommunicable diseases (25%); emergency preparedness (1.5%). Most papers were original research articles (85 %), published in English (94 %), but just over half (52 %) mentioned obtaining a form of ethical clearance in the text. Six countries had each over 100 papers published during the study period, i.e. Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan. Half EMHJ publications during this period came from 4 countries only (Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan), which calls for further study to evaluate why other EMR nations are less well represented and how to encourage greater contribution from them over the coming years.

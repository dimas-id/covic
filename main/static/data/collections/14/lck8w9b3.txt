BACKGROUND For patients with an identified germline E-cadherin-1 (CDH1) mutation, prophylactic gastrectomy is the treatment of choice to eliminate the high risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer. Laparoscopic total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch reconstruction is a novel approach that may be especially suitable in these patients. METHODS Patients with a germline CDH1 mutation who underwent prophylactic laparoscopic total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch were included in our prospective database. RESULTS A total of 11 patients with a median age of 40 (22-61) years were included. The average operative time was 4:26 ± 0:49 h and the average blood loss was 219 ± 155 ml. Median length of hospital stay was 10 (7-27) days. In two patients, an esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage occurred (grade 4). The leakages were seen in patient numbers 2 and 3, which may be a result of a learning curve. The latter eight patients did not develop anastomotic leakage. Pulmonary complications occurred in one patient with atelectasis and in one patient with pneumonia (grade 2). The 60-day mortality rate was 0 %. Multiple foci of intramucosal diffuse gastric signet ring cell carcinoma were found in the resection specimen of 9/11 (82 %) patients. All 11/11 (100 %) resections were microscopically radical. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic laparoscopic total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch reconstruction in patients with a CDH1 germline mutation is feasible and safe. In 82 % of patients, foci of intramucosal diffuse gastric signet ring cell carcinoma in the resection specimen were found.

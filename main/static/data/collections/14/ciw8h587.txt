OBJECTIVE To investigate of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) convalescent stool shedding by RT-PCR. METHODS One hundred and three stool samples from 46 SARS patients were collected on May 16th, 20th, and 23rd, 2003. For each sample, RNA was extracted using commercial kit and 7 Nest RT-PCR using a 14-pair different SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) special primers were carried out simultaneously. RESULTS Among these 46 SARS patients, 17 cases (37.0%) were stool SARS-CoV RT-PCR negative, and 29 cases (63.0%) were SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive. The duration of positive cases lasted (31.76 +/- 10.78) d (12-64 d). The longest stool shedding case in this study lasted 64 days. Two serial stool samples and for each sample 2 RT-PCR tests using different primers were positive in this case. CONCLUSIONS Our study observed longest stool shedding of SARS patients to be 64 days after initial onset of SARS. The average stool shedding was 32 days. Hence it is important to think highly of SARS convalescent patient stool sterilization.

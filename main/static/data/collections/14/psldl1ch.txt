Neutrophil granules contain serine proteases that are central components of the antimicrobial weapons of the innate immune system. Neutrophil proteases also contribute to the amplification and resolution of inflammatory responses through defined proteolytic cleavage of mediators, cell surface receptors, and extracellular matrix proteins. In the blood and at mucosal surfaces, neutrophil serine proteases are regulated by serpins found in plasma and by non-serpin secreted inhibitors. Distinct mechanisms leading to neutrophil cell death have been described for the granule serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3. Granule leakage in neutrophils triggers death pathways mediated by cathepsin G and proteinase-3, and both proteases are tightly regulated by their inhibitor SERPINB1 in a cell intrinsic manner. Although stored in the same types of granules, neutrophil elastase does not significantly contribute to cell death following intracellular release from granules into the cytoplasm. However, heterozygous mutations in ELANE, the gene encoding elastase, are the cause of severe congenital neutropenia, a life-threatening condition characterized by the death of neutrophils at an early precursor stage in the bone marrow. This chapter focuses on recent work exploring the biology of clade B intracellular serpins that inhibit neutrophil serine proteases and their functions in neutrophil homeostasis and serine protease control at sites of inflammation.

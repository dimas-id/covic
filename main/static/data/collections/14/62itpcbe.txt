We report a 28-year-old male co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). His clinical course of the COVID-19 pneumonia improved smoothly in 9 days; however, his immune status from HIV infection was not well-controlled due to a lack of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The HIV-1 viral load decreased during the acute phase and subsequently increased in the recovery phase. Antiretroviral therapy was given a month after the twice non-detections of SARS-CoV-2 to avoid immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS). Previous reports suggest COVID-19 do not become more severe in untreated HIV patients than non-HIV patients. However, untreated HIV patients with COVID-19 should be followed up carefully for IRIS with ART. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

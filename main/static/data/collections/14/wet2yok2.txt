Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. Pretransplant assessments for infection risk and immunization updates may help reduce posttransplant infections. In addition careful choice of posttransplant prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus and fungal infections is critical. Because of the potential association of infections such as respiratory viral infections and gram-negative bacterial infections with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, prompt attention to these pathogens is critical. Choice of antimicrobials for prophylaxis and treatment should take into consideration both adverse effects and drug interactions associated with antimicrobial choice.

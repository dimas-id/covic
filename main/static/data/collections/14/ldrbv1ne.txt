This chapter distinguishes among several versions of capitalism that have very different views of corporate social responsibility (CSR): the maximization of $ value shareholder, the balance the interests of stakeholders view, and the sustainability model that is the official position of the European Union (EU). The Chapter then considers CSR in Japan, and in countries like India and China that have a system of “state capitalism.” I argue that the view of corporate social responsibility (CSR) held by the EU sustainability model of corporate social responsibility is morally superior. I also contend that the American finance based model of philanthropic CSR is not economically adequate in the new international economic order.

An increasing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level portends an adverse cardiovascular prognosis; however, the association between glycemic control, platelet reactivity, and outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) is unknown. We sought to investigate whether HbA1c levels are associated with high platelet reactivity (HPR) in patients loaded with clopidogrel and aspirin, thereby constituting an argument for intensified antiplatelet therapy in patients with poor glycemic control. In the prospective, multicenter Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug Eluting Stents registry, HbA1c levels were measured as clinically indicated in 1,145 of 8,582 patients, stratified by HbA1c <6.5% (n = 551, 48.12%), 6.5% to 8.5% (n = 423, 36.9%), and >8.5% (n = 171, 14.9%). HPR on clopidogrel and aspirin was defined after PCI as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) >208 and aspirin reaction units >550, respectively. HPR on clopidogrel was frequent (48.3%), whereas HPR on aspirin was not (3.9%). Patients with HbA1c >8.5% were younger, more likely non-Caucasian, had a greater body mass index, and more insulin-treated diabetes and acute coronary syndromes. Proportions of PRU >208 (42.5%, 50.2%, and 62.3%, p <0.001) and rates of definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST; 0.9%, 2.7%, and 4.2%, p = 0.02) increased progressively with HbA1c groups. Clinically relevant bleeding was greatest in the intermediate HbA1c group (8.2% vs 13.1% vs 9.5%, p = 0.04). In adjusted models that included PRU, high HbA1c levels (>8.5) remained associated with ST (hazard ratio 3.92, 95% CI 1.29 to 12.66, p = 0.02) and cardiac death (hazard ratio 4.24, 95% CI 1.41 to 12.70) but not bleeding at 2-year follow-up. There was no association between aspirin reaction units >550 and HbA1c levels. In conclusion, in this large-scale study, HbA1c and HPR were positively associated, but the clinical effect on adverse outcome was driven by poor glycemic control, which predicted ST and cardiac death after PCI regardless of PRU levels, warranting efforts to improve glycemic control after DES implantation in patients with diabetes mellitus.

High-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to quantify the dispersion of aerosol-laden gas clouds generated during phonetic vocalization by a human subject at different sound intensity levels. The measured PIV data was used to quantify the initial penetration depth. Using classical pulsed jet scaling laws propagation distances were computed for time periods beyond the measured duration. Our results indicate that the penetration distance was comparable between loud intensity speech (for example during singing, classroom lectures, parties etc.) and moderate intensity cough. Based on theoretical aerosol propagation distance and time, the 6 feet physical distancing recommendations are likely sufficient to avoid incidental exposure by the initial penetration of the aerosol cloud, but insufficient for prolonged exposure to slow propagating aerosol clouds.

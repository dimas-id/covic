Accurate atomic modeling into cryoEM maps is a major challenge due to the moderate resolution of most datasets. We present RosettaES a method which, by enumerating a large space of backbone conformations consistent with the data, is able to identify near-native conformations in 85% of benchmark cases, including all shorter than 35 residues. We use this method in determining three structures that were unsolvable by expert structural biologists.

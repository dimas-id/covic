BACKGROUND Recent data suggest that reoperative fundoplication is associated with poor long-term control of reflux. For long-term reflux control, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) may be a better option. This study assessed outcomes and quality-of-life data after fundoplication takedown and conversion to LRYGB for patients with failed fundoplications. METHODS After institutional review board approval, the medical records of 25 patients who underwent fundoplication takedown and LRYGB conversion between March 2007 and July 2011 were reviewed. The data recorded included patient demographics, body mass index (BMI), preoperative symptoms, operative duration and findings, hospital length of stay (LOS), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of the follow-up period, and postoperative outcomes. The gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) and the gastrointestinal symptoms rating scale (GSRS) were used at the most recent follow-up visit to assess symptom severity and quality of life. RESULTS The patients in this study had undergone 40 total prior antireflux surgeries. They had a median age of 55 years (range 36-72 years), a BMI of 34.4 kg/m(2) (range 22-50 kg/m(2)), an operative duration of 345 min (range 180-600 min), an EBL of 181 ml (range 50-500 ml), and an LOS of 7 days (range 2-30 days). Five patients had concomitant incisional hernia repair. There was no mortality. Of the 10 patients (40%) who had had complications, 5 required reoperation. During a 14-month follow-up period (range 1-48 months), 96% of the patients were reflux-free with a GIQLI score of 114 (range 80-135) and a GSRS score of 25 (range 17-45). Excess weight loss was 60%, and comorbidity resolution was 70%. Most of the patients (96%) were satisfied with their outcome and would undergo the surgery again, and 62% reported that their personal relationships and sexual life had improved. CONCLUSIONS Patients who undergo LRYGB after failed fundoplications have excellent symptomatic control of reflux, excellent quality of life, and high rates of satisfaction with their outcome. Nevertheless, because the procedure is challenging and associated with considerable morbidity, it should be performed by surgeons experienced in antireflux and bariatric surgery.

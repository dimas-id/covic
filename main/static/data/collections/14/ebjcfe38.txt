Whether defined as chronically critically ill, long-term mechanical ventilator dependent (or otherwise chronically medically supported), or medically fragile, a population of infants and children with chronic illness clearly exists. Infants and children with chronic healthcare needs are at an increased risk for physical, developmental, behavioral, and/or emotional conditions and generally require healthcare services of a type or amount beyond that of a general pediatric or adult population. This review will focus on the specific management and psychosocial needs associated with the healthcare of this subgroup of infants and children with chronic illness. Attention will be paid to defining the population, describing trends over time, reviewing their special needs, and discussing outcomes. Increased focus and an increasing quantity of resources for this subgroup of infants and children are needed, as the number of such pediatric patients continues to grow.

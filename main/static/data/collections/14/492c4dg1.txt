OBJECTIVE Patients suffering from an incisional hernia after abdominal surgery have an impaired quality of life (QoL). Surgery aims to improve QoL with a minimum risk of further complications. The aim was to analyze QoL, predictors for outcome, including recurrence and reoperation rates during the first postoperative year. METHODS In a randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopic and open mesh repair, 133 patients were assessed preoperatively and after 1 year with regard to QoL using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), visual analog scale (pain, movement limitation, and fatigue), and questions addressing abdominal wall complaints. Factors concerning recurrence, reoperations, satisfaction, and improved QoL were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 124 patients remained for analysis. All SF-36 scores except mental composite score increased, reaching and maintaining levels of the Swedish norm already after 8 weeks with no difference between groups. Event-free recovery was seen in 85% in the laparoscopic group and in 65% of the open cases (P < 0.010). Five recurrences occurred after laparoscopic surgery and 1 in the open group (P < 0.112). Overall, abdominal wall complaints decreased from 82% to 13% of the patients; and 92% were satisfied with the result after 1 year.In univariable logistic regression analyses laparoscopic surgery and male sex predicted an event-free recovery. Obesity (BMI > 30) predicted better outcome with regard to QoL. No predictors for recurrence or satisfaction were identified. CONCLUSIONS Patients with incisional hernia benefit substantially from surgery concerning QoL, independent of surgical technique. An event-free recovery occurred frequently after laparoscopic surgery. SF-36 seems well suited for assessing surgical outcome in patients after incisional hernia repair.

Deep Learning image processing methods are gradually gaining popularity in a number of areas including medical imaging. Classification, segmentation, and denoising of images are some of the most demanded tasks. In this study, we aim at enhancing optic nerve head images obtained by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). However, instead of directly applying noise reduction techniques, we use multiple state-of-the-art image Super-Resolution (SR) methods. In SR, the low-resolution (LR) image is upsampled to match the size of the high-resolution (HR) image. With respect to image enhancement, the upsampled LR image can be considered as low quality, noisy image, and the HR image would be the desired enhanced version of it. We experimented with several image SR architectures, such as super-resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), very deep Convolutional Network (VDSR), deeply recursive Convolutional Network (DRCN), and enhanced super-resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN). Quantitatively, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM), the SRCNN, VDSR, and DRCN significantly improved the test images. Although the ERSGAN showed the worst PSNR and SSIM, qualitatively, it was the best one.

Background: The Ca-Star CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway pressure) Hood is a relatively novel method of delivering CPAP to infants and children. Aims: To report the experience of a single centre in the application of Hood CPAP for provision of NIV. Methods: We retrospectively analysed all children admitted to a six bedded PCCU for NIV over a 2 year period. Children included in the study were those who had failed conventional mask CPAP yet gone on to tolerate Hood CPAP for >24 hours or until NIV was no longer required. Results: Six patients (4 males) were identified with mean age of 14 months (range 6 months - 3 years). The reasons for failing conventional CPAP were pressure areas on face (1), child intolerance of mask pressing on face (4) and inability to get seal due to facial abnormalities (1). The indications for CPAP included primary Respiratory condition (5) and neuromuscular (1). The underlying co-morbidities were ex pre-maturity (2), Trisomy 21 (2), congenital abnormalities (1) and none (1). Hypothermia was observed as a complication in 2 patients. Conclusions: Intolerance of the mask is a problem in the ‘toddler’ age range, and in our experience the HOOD is an under-utilised but useful interface to provide CPAP in these patient groups. It can be used successfully as an alternative to intubation, for relief of facial pressure areas and to provide an effective seal in case of facial abnormalities.

OBJECTIVES We sought to identify angiographic predictors of 2-year stent thrombosis (ST) in the ADAPT-DES study. BACKGROUND A strong relationship between platelet reactivity and ST after implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES) was recently confirmed in the prospective, multicenter ADAPT-DES study. METHODS In a pre-specified analysis of patients enrolled in ADAPT-DES, an independent angiographic core laboratory performed detailed angiographic analyses for all cases of ST. Patients with Academic Research Consortium definite/probable target-lesion ST were matched with controls in a 1:2 ratio, and multivariable Cox regression models identified angiographic predictors of 2-year ST. RESULTS Among 8,582 patients who had successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and were included in the ADAPT-DES study, 92 (1.1%) patients had ST at 2-year follow-up. Target lesion-related ST was identified in 77 patients (82 lesions) who were clinically matched with 153 patients (196 lesions) without ST. Patients with ST were more likely to have longer target lesions, thrombus, moderate/severe calcification, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) type C lesions, and saphenous vein grafts. After adjustment for clinical covariates the angiographic variables that predicted ST were lesion complexity (ACC/AHA type C lesion, adjusted HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.26, P = 0.01) and presence of thrombus on index PCI (HR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.40 to 3.59, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Anatomically complex lesions and the presence of thrombus are strong predictors of 2-year ST in the DES era. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

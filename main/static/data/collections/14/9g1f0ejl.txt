Abstract During a pandemic such as COVID-19, the forensic community plays a key role in the management of the crisis, both nationally and internationally. Much has been written and disseminated regarding protocols for death investigation, infection mitigation and risks, and management of dead. However, in many contexts, the ability of forensic practitioners to follow best-practice procedures is limited by the resources available to them. This article examines some of the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Brazil, with emphasis on management of the dead and challenges faced by medicolegal services.

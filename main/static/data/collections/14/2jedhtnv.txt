Participation in regular physical activity decreases the risk of developing cardiometabolic disease. However, the proportion of people who participate in the recommended amount of physical activity is low, with common barriers including competing interests and inclement weather. In people with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions, participation in physical activity is reduced further by disease-specific barriers; time-burden of treatment and unpleasant symptoms during physical activity. Addressing these barriers during adolescence and early adulthood may promote greater physical activity participation into older age. The aim of this review was, in people aged 15 to 45 years with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions, to classify interventions aimed at optimising participation in physical activity as 'promising' or 'not promising', and categorise the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) within these interventions. Nine databases and registries were searched (October 2017) for studies that reported objective measures of physical activity before and after an intervention period. Interventions were classified as 'promising' if a between-group difference in physical activity was demonstrated. Michie et al.'s (2013) v1 Taxonomy was used to unpack the BCTs within interventions. Across the six included studies (n = 396 participants), 19 (20%) of 93 BCTs were described. The interventions of three studies were classified as 'promising'. The most commonly used BCTs comprised goal setting, action planning and social support. Five BCTs were solely used in 'promising' interventions. Our review demonstrated that only 20% of BCTs have been utilised and isolated those BCTs that were used only in 'promising' physical activity interventions in adolescents and adults with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the incessant spread of the disease with substantial morbidity and mortality rates, there is an urgent demand for effective therapeutics and vaccines to control and diminish this pandemic. A critical step in the crosstalk between the virus and the host cell is the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the surface of the host cells. Hence, inhibition of this interaction could be a promising strategy to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Docking and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation studies revealed that designed peptide maintains their secondary structure and provide a highly specific and stable binding (blocking) to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We have designed a novel peptide that could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2, thereby blocking the cellular entry of the virus. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that computationally developed inhibitory peptide may be developed as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further plan to pursue the peptide in cell-based assays and eventually for clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate General Practitioner (GP) satisfaction with a radiographer-led general radiography reporting service in a single district general hospital in order to identify areas for improvement. METHODS: A mixed method online survey was created and distributed to all GP surgeries in the catchment area of the hospital with a 6 week response period. RESULTS: Although the majority of GPs are satisfied with the service they receive, there were areas for improvement. Key areas included methods of contacting radiology department with queries, report content/terminology and recommendations for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of GPs are happy for radiographers to report imaging examinations some resistance was encountered, particularly with regards to chest reporting. Recommendations are made for improvements designed to address these issues. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article is one of the first in the UK to assess GP satisfaction with general X-ray reporting services. As the majority of GP reporting in the UK is now completed by radiographers, the results will allow reporting teams to tailor their service, in order to improve outcomes for both commissioners and patients.

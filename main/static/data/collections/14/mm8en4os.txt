Infectious processes of the trachea represent a distinct clinical entity with an evolving landscape owing to advances in airway management and vaccination practices. Untreated inflammatory processes of the trachea may present in the form of acute airway obstruction, potentially resulting in significant morbidity and even mortality. Therefore it is important to recognize the cardinal features of some of the common tracheal infectious processes to differentiate them from non-infectious pathology, as the latter is associated with a more indolent course. As with most other infectious processes of the airway, pathogens causing tracheal infection can be bacterial, viral or fungal in nature. Viral etiology represents the most common cause of laryngotracheal infection in a child. Bacterial infections of the trachea are responsible for more significant morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and even an occasional tracheostomy. The current chapter describes the clinical features and microbiology of tracheal infections at large, explores the utility of diagnostic tests, and provides an algorithm for management.

BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is a novel technique developed to reduce the port-related morbidities and improve the cosmetic outcomes of laparoscopic surgery. To date, no series of LESS inguinal hernia repair has been published or documented. This study aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of LESS technique for inguinal hernia repairs. METHODS Between December 2008 and March 2009, LESS procedures for inguinal hernia repair through a transumbilical incision were performed for 16 patients with symptomatic inguinal hernias. The initial 9 cases were performed by a transabdominal preperitoneal method and the remaining 7 were completed with a totally extraperitoneal approach. All procedures were accessed with our homemade single port for simultaneous passage of laparoscope and instruments. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully without conversion to standard laparoscopic or open surgery. These patients ranged in age from 21 to 80 years (median, 46.5 y) with a male to female ratio of 15:1. A total of 24 inguinal hernias, including 3 complicated types, were repaired. The median operative time was 83.5 minutes (range, 52 to 150 min). Two of the 16 patients suffered postoperative complications (12.5%). Most patients were discharged home on the second postoperative day. No port-related complications occurred. The cosmetic results were excellent. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, LESS procedures for inguinal hernia repair shows this technique to be both safe and feasible, even for complicated cases. More studies are needed to compare LESS inguinal hernia repair with standard laparoscopic techniques.

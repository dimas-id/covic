Single trocar transanal endoscopic surgery (STTE) is a well-known technique for evaluation and management of rectal lesions in adults. We used an 11mm balloon trocar with a 10mm operative optic, introduced into the anal canal to excise a rectal lesion along with multiple rectal biopsies in a child. Rectal visibility was good with an ease to maintain the rectum insufflated.

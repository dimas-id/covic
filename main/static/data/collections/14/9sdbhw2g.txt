Fine needle aspiration and small tissue biopsies have become a primary modality to achieve a definitive diagnosis of a mass-like lesion of the lung and mediastinum. This chapter delineated cytologic and histologic features of common and rare neoplastic and nonneoplastic mass-like lesions of the lung and mediastinum. The utilities and pitfalls of commonly used diagnostic immunohistochemical (IHC) stains, such as TTF1, Napsin A, p40 and CK5/6, and small diagnostic IHC panels, were described. Multiple challenging and yet practical cases at the end of the chapter were used to reemphasize important points illustrated throughout the chapter.

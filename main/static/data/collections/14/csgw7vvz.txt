At present, the prevention and control of new coronavirus has entered a critical period. However, the use of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of viral nucleic acid, as a crucial diagnostic approach, has been doubted in clinical practice. Herein, we have reviewed the current status of epidemic prevention and control, latest development of detection technologies, disease characteristics, clinical sampling and transport. We have also discussed the factors that may affect the performance of viral nucleic acid detection, and suggested some effective methods to improve the detection performance of the assays.

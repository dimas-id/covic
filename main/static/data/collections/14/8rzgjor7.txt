Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV is a newly emerging respiratory virus with a high case fatality rate among identified cases. The virus is thought to cause a severe disease in patients with underlying comorbidities. The identification of asymptomatic patients and mild cases among family and healthcare worker contacts of confirmed cases indicates a wider spectrum of clinical manifestation of the disease. The majority of patients presented with fever 98%, fever with cough 83%, and shortness of breath 72%. Radiographic manifestations range from unilateral infiltrate 43%, to increased bronchovascular markings 17%, and diffuse reticulonodular pattern 4%. Our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical presentation of the disease is increasing overtime. It is still not known what the source of the virus is and what the best treatment modality should be.

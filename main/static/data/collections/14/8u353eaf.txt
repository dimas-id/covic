Hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are responsible for most cases of viral hepatitis. Infection by each type of virus results in a different typical natural disease course and clinical outcome that are determined by virological and immunological factors. HCV tends to establish a chronic persistent infection, whereas HAV does not. HBV is effectively controlled in adults, although it persists for a lifetime after neonatal infection. In this Review, we discuss the similarities and differences in immune responses to and immunopathogenesis of HAV, HBV and HCV infections, which may explain the distinct courses and outcomes of each hepatitis virus infection.

INTRODUCTION Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) represents the next step in laparoscopic surgery in further reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures with cosmetic advantages. Recalling the increased rates of major complications at the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy 20 years ago, however, it is clear that appropriate training is required before adopting a new technique. This study aims to review the current evidence for training and skills acquisition for SILS. METHODS A comprehensive database search of PubMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar was carried out. Studies considered for inclusion were those addressing SILS learning curves, skills acquisition, or training. RESULTS 21 studies were included in the final analysis. Ten clinical case series with analysis of SILS learning curve demonstrated a significant learning curve for conventional multiport laparoscopic (LAP)-trained surgeons over the course of initial SILS cases, with several studies reporting increased risk of conversion and complication rates. Five laboratory-based studies demonstrated differences in SILS skills acquisition compared with LAP. Six studies describing SILS-specific training curricula were analysed, but none included a robust validation of the curriculum. CONCLUSIONS Clinical case series and laboratory-based skills acquisition studies demonstrate the unique requirements of SILS, with skill sets and ergonomic demands which cannot be directly adapted from existing LAP experience. Some studies have already reported higher complication rates in initial SILS cases. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, the implementation of an evidence- and competency-based SILS curriculum is necessary to ensure appropriate training of future SILS surgeons.

Health surveillance is the continuous observation, a strategic and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data for public health purposes. The data collected from surveillance systems can be stored in databases and can be used for scientific research, proving facts and identifying trends that can be used to make informed decisions. Surveillance systems do provide information that can be used as an early warning system for disease outbreaks and epidemics. Health surveillance, active or passive, provides a window into the health conditions and risks in communities and how these conditions are affecting the populations and their livelihoods. Developing countries should install systems of registration in place in order to track behaviour, traditions, diet and other ways of life that could contribute to infectious disease occurrence. Lack of knowledge has cost many lives especially for the poor communities in developed countries. Promoting the use of information and data in public decision-making is cardinal in managing infectious diseases and controlling disease outbreaks.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain perception after Milligan Morgan and Ligasure™ techniques in hemorrhoidectomy. METHODS Fifty-four patients diagnosed with Grade 3-4 hemorrhoids requiring surgery between May 2013 and September 2013 were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized into either the Ligasure™ hemorrhoidectomy group (Group 1, n = 26) or the Milligan Morgan hemorrhoidectomy group (Group 2, n = 28). RESULTS The difference between visual analogue scale scores on postoperative day 1 was not statistically significant but on the third postoperative day, the Ligasure™ group had higher visual analogue scale scores (4 ± 2.61) when compared to the Milligan Morgan hemorrhoidectomy group (2.43 ± 1.20). This difference on the third postoperative day visual analogue scale scores was statistically significant (p < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS Ligasure™ does not seem to have an advantage in postoperative pain when compared to Milligan Morgan hemorrhoidectomy.

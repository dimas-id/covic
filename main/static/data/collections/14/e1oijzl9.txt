This is a chapter about food defense that focuses on “Back to the Basics” with a significant study of risk, vulnerability, and threat. Many key food defense terms are defined in an effort to “level set” on them before looking at historical perspectives, consumer education, and federal government/food and agriculture sector specific plans. Several case studies (the Bagwan Shree Rajneesh attempt in Oregon, 1984; EHEC O104 in Germany, 2011; Horsemeat Scandal in UK, 2013) are explored before outlining the next steps.

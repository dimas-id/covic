Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, many cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services and programs are stopped. Because CR is a class I level A recommendation with clinical benefits that are now well documented, the cessation of CR programs can lead to dramatic consequences in terms of public health. We propose here a viewpoint of significant interest about the sudden need to develop remote home-based CR programs both in clinical research and in clinical care routine. This last decade, the literature on remote home-based CR programs has been increasing, but to date only clinical research experiences have been implemented. Benefits are numerous and the relevance of this approach has obviously increased with the actual health emergency. The COVID-19 crisis, the important prevalence of smartphones, and high-speed Internet during confinement should be viewed as an opportunity to promote a major shift in CR programs with the use of telemedicine to advance the health of a larger number of individuals with cardiac disease.

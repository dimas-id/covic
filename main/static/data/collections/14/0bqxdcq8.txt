INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need to identify patients at high risk during the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Whether a history of stroke is associated with increased severity of disease or mortality is unknown. METHOD We pooled studies from published literature to assess the association of a history of stroke with outcomes in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS A pooled analysis of 4 studies showed a ∼2.5-fold increase in odds of severe COVID-19. While a trend was observed, there was no statistically significant association of stroke with mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSION Our findings are limited by a small number of studies and sample size. CONCLUSION There is a ∼2.5-fold increase in odds of severe COVID-19 illness with a history of cerebrovascular disease.

INTRODUCTION Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality amongst HIV-infected infants and children. Polymicrobial infection is common and, due to the difficulties in confirming the etiology of pneumonia, empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is frequently used. Areas covered: The author based this article on literature identified from PubMed. The author's search terms included: pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, HIV, children. The articles reviewed included original studies, recent review articles and current guidelines on the management of pneumonia in HIV-infected children. The microbiological etiology and the empiric and pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and children are also discussed. Expert opinion: There are many changing epidemiological factors impacting antimicrobial management of community-acquired pneumonia in the context of HIV infection in infants and children. These include vaccination strategies, antimicrobial prophylaxis, emerging drug-resistant pathogens, and recognition of the importance of viruses and tuberculosis in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed on optimal amtimicrobial management strategies in HIV-exposed uninfected children, and HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral therapy.

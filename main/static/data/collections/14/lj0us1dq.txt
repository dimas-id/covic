The identification of immunogenic whole-protein antigens is fundamental to the successful discovery of candidate subunit vaccines and their rapid, effective, and efficient transformation into clinically useful, commercially successful vaccine formulations. In the wider context of the experimental discovery of vaccine antigens, with particular reference to reverse vaccinology, this chapter adumbrates the principal computational approaches currently deployed in the hunt for novel antigens: genome-level prediction of antigens, antigen identification through the use of protein sequence alignment-based approaches, antigen detection through the use of subcellular location prediction, and the use of alignment-independent approaches to antigen discovery. Reference is also made to the recent emergence of various expert systems for protein antigen identification.

Background: Barbed suture use has become more popular as technology and materials have advanced. Minimal data exist regarding performance of the 2 commercially available products, V-LocTM and StratafixTM in tendon repairs. The purpose of this study was to compare gap resistance and ultimate tensile strength of both suture materials and nonbarbed suture in a porcine ex vivo model. Methods: Porcine flexor tendons were harvested and divided into 3 groups of 10 of varying suture material (3-0 PDS™, 3-0 V- V-Loc 180™, or 3-0 Stratafix™). A modified 4-strand cruciate technique was used to repair each tendon. Knotless repair was performed using barbed suture, whereas a buried 6-throw square knot was done using conventional suture. A servohydrolic tester was used for biomechanical testing of linear 2-mm gap resistance and maximum tensile strength. Results: No difference was found in 2-mm gap resistance among the 3 groups. No difference was found in ultimate tensile strength between V-Loc™ (76.0 ± 9.4 N) and Stratafix™ (68.1 ± 8.4 N) repairs, but the ultimate strength of the PDS™ control group (83.4 ± 10.0 N) was significantly higher than that of Stratafix™. Conclusions: Barbed (knotless) and nonbarbed suture repairs demonstrate equivalent 2-mm gap resistance. Stratafix™ repairs show slightly inferior performance to nonbarbed repairs in ultimate tensile strength, although this occurred at gap distances far beyond the 2-mm threshold for normal tendon gliding. Both barbed and nonbarbed 4-strand cruciate flexor tendon repairs may require peripheral repair to withstand physiologic loads.

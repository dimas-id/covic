COVID-19 may predispose patients to an increased risk of thrombotic complications through various pathophysiological mechanisms. Most of the reports on a high incidence of thrombotic complications are in relation to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, while the evidence about arterial thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 is limited. We describe 4 cases of aortic thrombosis and associated ischemic complications in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

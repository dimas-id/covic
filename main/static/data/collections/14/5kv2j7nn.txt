Using a stochastic epidemic model explicitly considering the entire population of Guadeloupe (1), we explore the domain of solutions presenting an efficient slowing down of the COVID-19 epidemic spread during the post-containment period. The considered model parameters are the basic reproduction number R0 to simulate the effects of social distancing, the time delay {delta}TQ elapsed between the detection of a symptomatic person and her/his placement in quarantine to suppress her/his contagiousness, and the number Na of asymptomatic people tested positively and isolated. We show that acceptable solutions are obtained for a wide range of parameter values. Thanks to a good control of the initial epidemic spread resulting from an early containment and efficient communication by the sanitary and administrative authorities, the present situation corresponds to a pre-epidemic state. The most safe solutions are a combinations of social distancing, numerous testing to perform a systematic isolation of symptomatic patients and guided detection of asymptomatic people in the entourage of localised symptomatic patients.

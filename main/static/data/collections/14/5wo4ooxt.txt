addresses a number of aspects of the mother-infant dyad management during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Networking among maternity centers and anticipatory planning is essential to organise the assistance to mothers and neonates in maternity and neonatal wards. Early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, before delivery, allows their management through dedicated protocols and minimizes the risk of contagion for other patients and healthcare providers. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded at present, and should be ruled out as soon as possible after birth. Rooming in of infected mothers and neonates, provided their good clinical conditions, is not contraindicated based on current knowledge. The choice of breastfeeding should be carefully discussed with parents based on current, evolving scientific evidence.

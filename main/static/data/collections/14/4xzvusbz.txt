Since mid-March 2020, global COVID-19 pandemic has experienced an exponential growth in process from sporadic to sudden outbreaks. This paper selects the 8-day surge data of daily cases, death and recovery rates (March 19-26, 2020) from 18 countries with severe pandemic situation to discuss the impact of 9 factors of both socioeconomic and natural on the pathogen outbreak. Moreover, the paper also elaborates analysis and comparison of relatively slow 4-week (February 1-29, 2020) data of China's surge cases to determine the relationship between social and natural factors and on the spread of pandemic, which provides an effective reference for delaying and controlling the pandemic development.

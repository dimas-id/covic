Astroviruses (AstVs) are important pathogens associated with enteric diseases in humans and other animals. However, most animal AstVs, including feline astrovirus (FAstV), are poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and association of FAstV with enteric diseases in cats, and to conduct a molecular analysis of FAstVs, in Korea. Eleven faecal samples from 62 hospitalised cats at animal hospitals in the Moran market in South Korea tested positive for FAstV. The prevalence of FAstV was higher in cats <2 months old (25%) than in cats >2 months old (14.3%) (P = 0.31). Diarrhoea and normal faeces were observed in 19% (8/42) and 15% (3/20) of cats with FAstV, respectively (P = 1.00). Amino acid sequences alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that FAstVs, including Korean strains, formed a single clade within the mamastroviruses.

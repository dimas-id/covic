Abstract The new coronavirus pneumonia, named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has become a pandemic. It is highly pathogenic and reproduces quickly. There are currently no specific drugs to prevent the reproduction and spread of COVID-19. Some traditional Chinese medicines, especially the Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (Qing Fei Pai Du Tang), have shown therapeutic effects on mild and ordinary COVID-19 patients. Polysaccharides are important ingredients in this decoction. This review summarizes the potential pharmacological activities of polysaccharides isolated by hot water extraction from Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction, which is consistent with its production method, to provide the theoretical basis for ongoing research on its application.

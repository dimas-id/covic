This article presents raw inferential statistical data that determined the coronavirus readiness strategies at retail stores in South Africa and their consequences for consumer behavioural intentions. The data was collected from customers within the metropolitan area of Bloemfontein. The data were analysed using a quantitative approach. Structured questionnaires were provided to customers throughout South Africa's Bloemfontein metropolitan area. Reliability and validity were confirmed. The data was presented using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using the Smart PLS program. The analysis of the SEM path shows estimates of the interconnectivity of the major constructs in the data. The findings from this dataset show that sanitised retail entrances, sanitised retail counters and sanitised retail shelves had a statistically significant effect on customer satisfaction with covid-19 readiness in retail stores. Furthermore, the data reveals that retail social distancing and senior citizens shopping hours had a statistically insignificant effect on customer satisfaction with covid-19 readiness. Moreover, the data reveals that customer satisfaction with covid-19 readiness strategies of retail stores also had a positive and statistically significant effect on customer behavioural intentions.

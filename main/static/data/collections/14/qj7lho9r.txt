BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread globally with remarkable speed, and currently, there is limited data available exploring any aspect of the intersection between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Tehran, Iran. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 200 PLWH were recruited through the positive club via sampling, and completed the symptom-based questionnaire for COVID-19, which was delivered by trained peers. RESULTS: Of 200 participants, respiratory symptoms, including cough, sputum, and shortness of breath were the most prevalent among participants, but only one person developed symptoms collectively suggested COVID-19 and sought treatments. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that existing infection with HIV or receiving ART might reduce the susceptibility to the infection with SARS-CoV-2 or decrease the severity of the infection acquired. Further research is needed to understand causal mechanisms.

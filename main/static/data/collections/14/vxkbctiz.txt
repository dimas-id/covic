RNA interference (RNAi) is an antiviral pathway common to many eukaryotes that detects and cleaves foreign nucleic acids. In mammals, mitochondrially localized proteins such as MAVS, RIG-I, and MDA5 mediate antiviral responses. Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction in Caenorhabditis elegans activates RNAi-directed silencing via induction of a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I helicase viral response pathway. The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of eol-1 requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form dsRNA, as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses. The enhanced RNAi triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the increase in longevity that is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

BACKGROUND Gastroparesis is a common complication after splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection, remaining a chronic debilitating disorder with considerable treatment challenges. To minimize postoperative gastroparesis, we have developed a new modified laparoscopic pyloroplasty (LP) technique for use during laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (LSD). METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of 31 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive bleeding and secondary hypersplenism who underwent synchronous LSD with modified LP (n = 14) or LSD without modified LP (n = 17) between January 2015 and August 2015. Perioperative variables were compared. RESULTS LSD with and without modified LP were successful in all patients. Operation time was significantly longer for LSD with modified LP than LSD without modified LP ( P = .001). However, the LSD with modified LP group had significantly reduced incidences of bloating 1 month postoperatively ( P < .05), nausea ( P < .05), and bloating ( P < .05) 3 months postoperatively, gastric retention 3 months postoperatively ( P < .0001), and prokinetic use at 1 month ( P = .009) and 3 months postoperatively ( P < .05) compared with the LSD without modified LP group. Gastric emptying scintigraphy showed that the mean time required to empty 50% of the ingested meal was significantly shorter in the LSD with modified LP group than in the LSD without modified LP group at 3 months postoperatively (74.3 ± 19.1 vs 261.7 ± 61.0 minutes, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Modified LP during LSD was feasible, effective, and safe, and significantly reduced short-term symptoms of postoperative gastroparesis.

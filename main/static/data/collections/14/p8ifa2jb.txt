Actually, the choice of surgical approach for pelvic organ prolapse repair depends more on surgeon experience rather than patients characteristics. Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy seems to offer complete repair, low morbidity and satisfactory anatomic and functional results. This technique requires specially trained and experienced surgeons and optimal operative conditions. To improve feasibility of laparoscopic sacral colpopexy, we propose a simplified operative strategy to optimise this complex procedure.

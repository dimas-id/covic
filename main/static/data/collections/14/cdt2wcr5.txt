Numerous viruses, mycoplasmas, bacteria and parasites have been associated with infectious diseases in laboratory animals. It is clear that pathogenic agents causing overt disease represent a serious hazard to research results in both short- as well as long-term studies. However, these organisms may contaminate colonies without causing any clinical or pathological symptom. This makes research less reliable because of the more subtle effects of the silent infections, especially in long-term studies as in aging research. The establishment of animal colonies that were free from these (micro-) organisms has increased substantially the value of animals used in biomedical research. Characterization of the health status and microbiological monitoring of the animals in experiments are particularly important. This paper reviews many of the major considerations in the efforts to maintain animals free of unwanted organisms, including quality and sources of animals, transportation and quarantine, maintenance during experimentation, microbiological characterization and monitoring of animals and environment.

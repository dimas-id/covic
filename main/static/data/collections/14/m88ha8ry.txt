The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly in China, and has developed to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern However, no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available yet This work aims to share strategies and candidate antigens to develop safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 An outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) has raged in China since mid-December 2019 and has spread to 26 countries (February 20, 2020) The epidemic was identified by the first four cases confirmed on December 29, 2019 and was traced to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China1 A total of 75,465 cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections have been confirmed up to date (February 20, 2020), and 2,236 people have died in China2 COVID-19 spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission with a median incubation period of 3 0 days (range, 0 to 24 0), and the time from symptom onset to developing pneumonia is 4 0 days (range, 2 0 to 7 0)3 Respiratory droplets and direct contact are conventional transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, and fecal-to-oral transmission might also have a role3 Fever, dry cough, and fatigue are common symptoms at onset of COVID-194 Most patients have lymphopenia and bilateral ground-glass opacity changes on chest CT scans4,5 No specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available because it is a new emerging viral disease Development of SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines is urgently required The entire virus particle-based preparation of vaccines, including inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines is advisable, because it is based on previous studies about the prevention and control of seasonal influenza vaccines6 The first SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) was successfully sequenced and its genomic sequence submitted to GenBank on January 5, 2020 (Accession no MN908947 3)7 Subsequently large-scale culture of SARS-CoV-2 was quickly performed, and an inactivated virus vaccine could be prepared through the employment of established physical and chemical methods such as UV light, formaldehyde, and Î²-propiolactone8 The development of attenuated-virus vaccines is also possible by carefully screening the serially propagated SARS-CoV-2 with reduced pathogenesis such as induced minimal lung injury, diminished limited neutrophil influx, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expressions compared with the wild-type virus9 Both inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines have their own disadvantages and side effects (Table 1) Alternatively, new vaccine designs based on the putative protective antigen/peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 should be considered

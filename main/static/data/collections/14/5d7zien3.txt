In the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic—referred to as COVID‐19—there has been much uncertainty. We remain uncertain about its precise origin, its structure and composition, how best to test for it, or for resulting immunity, whether or not exposure leads to immunity, whether or not disposable surgical masks are effective, why men and some ethnic minorities are more susceptible and just exactly what the death rate as a result of this virus is. However, one thing is absolutely clear, there has been an epidemic of manuscripts on the subject of COVID‐19 to nursing journals and, amongst these new manuscripts the rejection rate is, unfortunately, very high.

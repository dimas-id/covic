BACKGROUND: Critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM) is a major cause of weakness in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but current diagnostic tests are limited. We evaluated the generalizability and validity of single nerve conduction studies (NCS) and muscle ultrasound testing to identify CIPNM, and we also assessed the ability of muscle ultrasound to prognosticate patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated medical, cardiac, surgical, and neurosurgical ICU patients. We performed weekly strength testing, NCS, electromyography (EMG), and muscle ultrasound. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and other test characteristics of single NCS and muscle ultrasound, and we used multivariable regression models to assess the prognostic ability of muscle ultrasound. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled. The incidence of probable CIPNM was 18% and did not differ significantly by type of ICU (p = 0.49). For diagnosing probable CIPNM, the peroneal motor NCS had a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71–100%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI 82–96%), the sural sensory NCS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 80–100%) and specificity of 42% (95% CI 31–54%), and abnormal muscle ultrasound echogenicity had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 48–98%) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 43–70%). Abnormal echogenicity was associated with reduced likelihood of discharge to home (9% vs 50%, p = 0.0001), fewer ICU-free days (median 3 (interquartile range 0–15) days vs 16 (9.3–19.3) days, p = 0.0002), and increased ICU mortality (42% vs 12%, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of critically ill patients, single NCS and muscle ultrasound achieved diagnostic accuracy for patients at risk for CIPNM. The routine utilization of these tests could be beneficial for all critically ill patients at risk for CIPNM.

Physical swarm system, including number of units, operated in physical time according to corporative algorithm, is considered. It is shown, that for proper corporative algorithm interpretation it is necessary to synchronize computational processes in units. Structural-parametric model of synchronized swarm operation, based on Petri-Markov nets apparatus, is worked out. In the Petri-Markov net transitions are abstract analogues of synchronization procedure, while places simulate corporative algorithm parts interpretation by swarm units. Primary Petri-Markov model is transformed into complex semi-Markov process. Formulae for calculation of stochastic and time characteristics of the process are obtained. It is shown, that after transformation all methods of ordinary semi-Markov processes investigation may be used for synchronized systems. With use the concept of distributed forfeit effectiveness of synchronization is evaluated.

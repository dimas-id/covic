Yellow head virus (YHV) is an invertebrate nidovirus that has caused mass mortality of cultured Penaeus monodon in Asia. In this study, we investigated whether mouse polyclonal antiserum raised against the YHV gp116 or gp64 structural glycoproteins could neutralize YHV infectivity as determined using an in vitro quantal assay in primary cultures of lymphoid organ cells. Anti-gp116 antiserum showed virus-neutralizing activity whereas anti-gp64 antiserum failed to inhibit infection. The results suggest that gpl16 antiserum blocks binding of virions to cellular receptors to facilitate YHV entry into lymphoid organ cells.

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The link between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 appears to be twofold. First, some reports of data indicate that certain groups of patients are more at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing cardiovascular conditions and older patients. In addition, these patients incur disproportionately worse outcome. Second, SARS-CoV2 infection can be complicated by life-threatening cardiovascular acute diseases. Despite the rapid evolution of data on this pandemic, this review aims to highlight the cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 whether as comorbidities including concerns and uncertainty regarding the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 or related to acute cardiovascular complications.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many undesirable effects, including death. The COVID-19 outbreak occurred suddenly, and many countries were ill prepared to face it. Community behaviour has been altered due to the pandemic. Uncertainty surrounding the disease triggered panic buying; public panic caused additional worry about limited food supplies, and thus demand increased. World economies have also felt the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Owing to the measures put in place to address the spread of COVID-19, many service providers and industries were closed, resulting in financial losses, and the risk of unemployment was elevated, which inevitably increased negative emotions in individuals. A psychosocial consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide fear. Because psychological defence is a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to encourage prevention of mental stress. Psychotherapy is able to provide counselling services to the community through teleconsultation. Strengthening psychological defences can help countries fight against this disease.

BACKGROUND Parastomal hernia (PH) is a frequent complication of colorectal surgery, which incidence reaches 55% of all stoma formation. Currently, there is no definitive strategy for its repair. This study was designed to assess the outcome in patients who underwent laparoscopic PH repair using a slit mesh/keyhole technique. METHODS We undertook a retrospective case review of all patients who underwent laparoscopic PH repair with a designed slit mesh/keyhole between 2005 and 2010. Three ports were placed opposite the stoma site, and careful adhesiolysis and hernia content reduction were performed. The parastomal fascial defect was measured and covered with a designated mesh. Fixation of the mesh was achieved with concentric tacks and transcutaneous Prolene suture. Recurrence was diagnosed after examination of patients by two surgeons or by imaging demonstrating an indolent hernia. RESULTS Twenty-nine laparoscopic PH mesh repairs were performed with an average age of 63.5 (range 42-81, median 64) years to treat paracolostomy hernia in 18 of 29 cases (62.1%), para-ileostomy hernia in 10 of 29 cases (34.5%), and for an ileal conduit site hernia in 1 of 29 cases (3.4%). The average operative time was 179 (range, 80-300; median, 180) min. Two operations (6.9%) were converted to an open approach. Early postoperative complications were documented in four patients (13.8%), including one elderly patient with severe comorbidities who died from postoperative sepsis (mortality rate, 3.4%). Only one late complication was recorded (3.4%). The average hospital stay was 4.7 (range, 1-19; median, 3) days. Average follow-up time was 28 (range, 12-53; median, 30) months. Recurrence of the hernia was found in 13 of 28 patients (46.4%). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic slit mesh/keyhole repair is feasible, although it is a complex surgery reflected by extended operative time. The high recurrence rate suggests that technical improvement of the method is essential.

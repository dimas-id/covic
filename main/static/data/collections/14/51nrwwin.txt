BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was initially performed as the first stage of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch in the super-obese population. In the past few years, however, LSG has been performed as a definitive procedure because of its promising early and midterm results. In this study we describe our initial experience and outcomes with LSG as a potential independent bariatric operation. METHODS A prospectively maintained database including all patients between 2008 and 2011 was reviewed. RESULTS A total of 100 initial consecutive patients (69 women and 31 men) were included, with a mean age of 50 years (range, 19 -79 years) and body mass index of 49 kg/m(2) (range, 36.6 -70.3 kg/m(2)). The mean operative time was 106 minutes (range, 58 -212 minutes) with a 2% conversion rate. Thirty-day perioperative complications included port-site hemorrhage (1.0%) and the inability to tolerate oral intake resulting in dehydration (3%). The reoperation rate was 2%, and the mean length of stay was 3.1 days (range, 2-12 days). In one patient with a prolonged hospital stay, an acute cholecystitis developed, and prosthetic heart valve complications developed in another patient. The mean excess body weight loss was 18%, 31.7%, 45%, 52%, 58.4%, and 64% at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months postoperatively, respectively. No deaths occurred in this series. CONCLUSIONS Satisfactory outcomes and low complication rates were observed after LSG. Our findings suggest that LSG is safe and effective to serve as a definitive bariatric procedure.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is unsure whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a risk factor for novel coronavirus infection (COVID‐19). METHODS: IBD patients were identified from population‐based databases in Hong Kong and Taiwan from January 21, 2020, until April 15, 2020. RESULTS: Total 2954 and 2554 IBD patients were identified in Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively. None had COVID‐19. Pooled analysis showed that 65.3%, 39.1%, 4.3%, and 12.8% IBD patients in Hong Kong and 75.8 %, 51.4 %, 26.1%, and 52.3 % in Taiwan were on 5‐aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, corticosteroids, and biologics, respectively. CONCLUSION: There were no reported cases of COVID‐19 infection amongst IBD patients in Hong Kong and Taiwan. IBD patients should continue their usual medications during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

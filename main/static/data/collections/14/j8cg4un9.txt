Mesh extrusion or exposure is a known complication of procedures using synthetic mesh for vaginal vault and pelvic organ suspension. Preservation of the uterine cervix is thought to be protective against such complications, as the well-vascularized in situ cervix provides an added barrier between the mesh and the colpotomy incision, limiting potential exposure to the vaginal flora. We describe a case of a 55-year-old multipara, who presented with vaginal discharge following a supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicopexy and was found to have a delayed mesh extrusion though the endocervical os.

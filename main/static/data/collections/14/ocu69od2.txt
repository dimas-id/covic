Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV‐2/COVID‐19) is a highly contagious and deadly disease caused by a virus belonging to the coronaviridae family. Researchers working in histopathology laboratories, dealing with morbid samples, are particularly vulnerable to infection unless they have very strong immunity. Hence, a proper precautionary protocol is required for the safety of the laboratory staff. The current review highlights the biological and physical agents that can be used to inactivate the virus and disinfect the surrounding environment in the laboratory.

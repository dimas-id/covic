The COVID‐19 pandemic has far‐reaching ramifications for patients undergoing cancer treatment. Oncologists and institutions have adjusted treatment practices and, in many cases, significantly curtailed clinical trial conduct. Whether these adjustments mitigate the risk of COVID‐19 complications without jeopardizing treatment of the cancer is unknown. Given the expected duration of the pandemic, it is imperative that treatment of the patient's cancer remain the priority and that advances in drug development continue through appropriately designed clinical trials.

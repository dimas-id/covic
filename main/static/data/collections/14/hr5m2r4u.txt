BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the health public authorities to impose extraordinary policies to limit the virus spread. Lockdown has been recognized as an effective measure to minimise the risk of infection. The effect of this extreme and prolonged situation on glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is unknown. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and Flash glucose monitoring (FGM) allow health care professionals to remotely monitored sensor glucose levels. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of lockdown on glycaemic control in adults with T1D. METHODS People with T1D on multiple daily insulin injections and using CGM or FGM were included. Sensor data from the 2 weeks before the start of the COVID-19 lockdown and from the 2 weeks after 5 weeks of consecutive lockdown were compared. RESULTS 147 subjects were selected (age: 39±14 years (15-80), 54% male (n=80), diabetes duration: 18±11 years). Forty six percent (n=68) were CGM users and 54% (n=79) FGM users. Estimated HbA1c was reduced from 57±11 mmol/l to 55±11 mmol/l (7.38±1.0% to 7.16±1.0%), (p<0.001). Time 70-180 mg/dl was increased from 60.3±16.0 to 62.8±17.0 (p=0.009). Time >180 mg/dl and >250 mg/dl were reduced from 36.0±17.2 to 32.6±17.5 (p<0.001) and from 11.9±11.8 to 9.4±10.3%, (p=0.001), respectively. Time in hypoglycaemia remained unchanged. Estimated HbA1c and time in range 70-180 mg/dl showed an improvement in 62% (n=91) of the subjects. Sensor use (93%) and coefficient of variation (36%) remained unchanged. CONCLUSION No deterioration in glycaemic control was found as a result of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

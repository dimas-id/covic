Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an evolving global pandemic that is predicted to strain healthcare resources at multiple locations throughout North America and the World. As of April 6, 2020, the apex of infection rates is predicted to occur within 1 to 5 weeks at various locations. Widespread reports of personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, and healthcare worker exposure to disease have become commonplace. To mitigate this crisis, we are suggesting imaging strategies that aim to use the least PPE, require the smallest number of potential staff exposures, and streamlines utilization of imaging. They are broadly organized by (1) substituting a noninvasive diagnostic test in place of a semi-invasive or invasive diagnostic tests, and (2) consolidating diagnostic imaging.

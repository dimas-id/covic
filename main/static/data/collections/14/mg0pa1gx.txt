We determined the prevalence of antibodies to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in sera of dairy cows on 4 different farms in the Republic of Croatia. A high percentage (60.8%) of cows had various reproductive disorders. The results showed that seroprevalence of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) was 85.8% and that of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) was 79.2% in tested cows. Antibodies to both viruses were found in 80.8% of cows with reproductive disorders but in only 46.8% of cows without reproductive disorders. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.01), and indicated a connection between reproductive disorders and simultaneous infections with IBR and BVD viruses in dairy cows.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a multifocal demyelinating disease in dogs. The mechanism of acute demyelination in distemper is still poorly understood. The initial demyelinating lesion in distemper is directly virus induced, since there is a clear correlation between the occurrence of demyelination and CDV replication in the cells of the white matter. Yet, there is little evidence for oligodendroglial infection. Changes of these cells have been reported in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro studies showed that – in contrast to other cells such as astrocytes and macrophages – oligodendrocytes hardly express CDV protein. However, we could show that these cells underwent a restricted infection with transcription of CDV RNA and that this phenomenon correlated with down-regulation of myelin gene transcription. The extension of these in vitro findings in vivo was obscured by the lack of reliable oligodendrocyte labelling techniques in canine brain tissue sections. In this study we combined immunohistochemistry with in situ hybridization to examine oligodendrocytes in demyelinating lesions and to investigate the question of oligodendrocyte infection in vivo. We could demonstrate that CDV infection leads to massive down-regulation of myelin gene expression in demyelinating lesions and that this effect correlates in part with a restricted infection of oligodendrocytes.

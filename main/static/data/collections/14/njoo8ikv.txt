BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE As aneurysms arising from the ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery increase in size, they can compress the optic nerve, prompting patients to present with visual disturbances. The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical and angiographic results with an emphasis on visual outcomes following the endovascular treatment of ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 1254 patients who presented for endovascular treatment of a cerebral aneurysm were retrospectively reviewed to identify 65 consecutive patients who underwent coil embolization of an ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysm. The clinical records, treatment reports, and imaging were reviewed with a focus on visual outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-two of the 65 patients (34%) who presented for treatment of an ophthalmic aneurysm reported a visual disturbance at presentation. Fifteen of the 22 patients (68%) experienced an improvement in their symptoms after treatment. Overall, patients with visual symptoms were significantly more likely to benefit from treatment than to have a decline in vision (P = .03). The overall morbidity was 4%, and mortality was 0%. The retreatment rate was high at 30%, though this was disproportionately weighted by an 86% retreatment rate in patients with ruptured aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS Patients with visual symptoms attributable to ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms undergoing endovascular coil embolization were statistically more likely to experience an improvement in their vision than to have worsening or unchanged vision. Coiling was associated with a low morbidity rate, though an elevated retreatment rate.

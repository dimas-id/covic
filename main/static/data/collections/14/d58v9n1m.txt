BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of a new esophagojejunal anastomosis (EJA) technique allowing the insertion of the anvil of a common circular stapler without hand-sewn securing. METHODS From August 2014 to May 2015, 20 consecutive patients with esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma underwent surgery. EJA was performed using a new technique; the free margins of the esophageal stump were suspended and the anvil of a circular stapler on a new dedicated and registered support bar (characterized by a push-rod making possible to hook-unhook the anvil of the circular stapler) was inserted into the lumen. Subsequently, the linear suturing stapler was closed over the bar and fired to suture the distal stump of the esophagus; the bar was retracted and the push-rod of the anvil was pulled out through the linear suture. Finally, the anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications, and R0 resection was achieved in all cases. Postoperative course has been uneventful for 18 patients (90%). Only 1 patient (5%) developed fistula, conservatively treated. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary clinical experience suggested that this technique was safe and efficient (for all online suppl. material, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000446856).

Murine coronavirus mutants resistant to neutralization with soluble receptors were isolated to study the receptor-binding site on the S proteins since such mutants were expected to have mutations in an important site for receptor-binding. We have isolated five soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutants which had mutations of a single amino acid at 3 different positions in S protein. Srr mutant 11 with an amino acid change at position 65 (Leu to His) in the S1 subunit showed an extremely reduced binding by virus overlay protein blot assay. However srr mutants with a mutation at 1114 (Leu to Phe) (srr mutants 3, 4 and 7) or 1163 (Cys to Phe) (srr mutant 18) in the S2 subunit had receptor-binding activity similar to that of wild type cl-2. These results suggest that an amino acid at position 62 located in a conserved region among MHV strains is in particular important for receptor binding. We also discuss why srr mutants with a mutation in S2 showed high resistance to neutralization by soluble receptor, irrespective of their binding to MHV receptors.

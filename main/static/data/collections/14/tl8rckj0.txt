Summary Background The number of travelers in Oman has increased significantly in the last 2 decades with an increase in the expatriate population workforce leading to the emergence of infections related to travel. This paper aims to highlight the burden of travel-related infections in Oman. Method Our study is a descriptive record-based review and analysis of travel-associated diseases over a 14 year time period from 1999 to 2013. The data was sourced from the communicable disease surveillance system, and central public health laboratory results. Results From 1999 to 2013 there were a combined total of 7022 cases of cholera, chikungunya, dengue, filariasis, leptospirosis, meningococcal infection, poliomyelitis, measles, schistosomiasis, viral hepatitis (A), typhoid and para-typhoid reported to and subsequently investigated by the Department of Communicable Diseases. Among these cases, 558 (7.9%) were attributed to travel. Fifty percent of these patients were admitted to hospitals. Conclusion Travel-associated infections account for about 8% of notifiable infections in Oman and have low mortality rate. However, some travel-associated infections are considered as a threat to polio eradication and measles elimination programs. Furthermore, some can cause outbreaks that can overwhelm the healthcare system.

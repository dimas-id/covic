BACKGROUND Single-port access offers cosmetic advantages in addition to the well-recognized benefits of standard multiport laparoscopic surgery, and can be performed with the use of standard straight instruments. We describe a technique of single-port access reversal of Hartmann colostomy by use of the colostomy site for access. METHODS After routine skin preparation and laparoscopic setup, the colostomy is mobilized from its mucocutaneous border, and the anvil of a circular stapler is secured to the distal lumen. By the use of a GelPoint system with 3 or 4 trocars, the intra-abdominal adhesions are divided and the splenic flexure is mobilized to achieve sufficient access to the abdominal and pelvic cavities and proximal colonic mobility. The rectal stump is mobilized to the mid rectum, starting from the posterior mesorectal fascia around to the anterior rectal wall. A tension-free colorectal anastomosis is secured with a standard circular stapling device inserted transanally, and leak tested. The colostomy wound is closed in standard fashion. RESULTS Five patients underwent single-port access reversal of Hartmann resection (4 diverticular perforations and 1 pT3N0 colon cancer), with a mean operating time of 155 (range, 137-187) minutes and a median length of stay of 3 (range, 2-11) days. There were no conversions, major surgical morbidity, or deaths. CONCLUSION Single-port access reversal of Hartmann colostomy through the stoma site is safe, and it offers additional cosmetic advantages with no apparent additional morbidity in comparison with standard multiport surgery.

Dengue virus (DENV) co-circulation in Brazil represents a challenge for treatment and vaccine development. Despite public health impact, the occurrence of coinfections with other viruses is a common event. Increased T cell activation and altered inflammatory response are found during DENV coinfection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) impacting HIV-pathogenesis. Even with Antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV- treated patients had chronic immune activation and lymphocyte apoptosis. However, apoptotic mechanisms have not been investigated during coinfection with DENV. Our attention was attracted to apoptotic cell markers expressions in PBMCs from DENV and DENV/HIV coinfected patients. We found CD4/CD8 ratio inversion in most coinfected patients. CD4 T and CD8 T-cell subsets from DENV and DENV/HIV groups expressed low levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, CD8 CD95 double positive cells frequency expressing low levels of Bcl-2 were significantly higher in these patients. Additionally, the density of Bcl-2 on classical monocytes (CD14(++)CD16(âˆ’)) was significantly lower during DENV infection. Upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins were found in DENV and DENV/HIV, while catalase, an antioxidant protein, was upregulated mainly in DENV/HIV coinfection. These findings provide evidence of apoptosis triggering during DENV/HIV coinfection, which may contribute to knowledge of immunological response during DENV acute infection in HIV-patients treated with ART.

The endocytic function of caveolae has been controversial for a long time. However, a real-time-imaging analysis of Simian virus 40 (SV40) 's entry in cells has indicated the existence of caveolar endocytosis during virus entry. The caveolae engulfed SV40 virions begin budding from plasma membrane depending on dynamin. SV40 enclosed in caveolae vesicles move to the caveosome, then to the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, it was demonstrated that human coronavirus-229E enters the cell through caveolae. This review examines the involvement of caveolae in endocytosis used by the viral entry system.

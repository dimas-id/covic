BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an intestinal coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea and high mortality in suckling piglets, can result in high economic losses in the swine industry. In recent years, despite the use of China’s current vaccine immunization strategy, multiple types of PEDV strains were still found in immunized swine herds. Our research aims to explore a new rapid differentiation method to distinguish the different types of PEDV strains and assess the safety evaluation of classical attenuated vaccine strains in swine herds. RESULTS: In the study, a differential one-step quantitative real-time fluorescent reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (real-time RT-RPA) method based on the PEDV universal real-time RT-RPA assay was established according to the ORF1 deletion sequences of three classical attenuated vaccine strains (PEDV attenuated vaccine KC189944, attenuated CV777 and DR13) and five Vero cell-adapted isolates (JS2008, SDM, SQ2014, SC1402, HLJBY), which could effectively differentiate PEDV classical attenuated vaccine strains from wild-type strains (PEDV classical wild strains and variant strains). The detection limits of PEDV RNA in the both PEDV real-time RT-RPA assays were 300 copies within 20 min at 39 °C, and the detection limits of classical attenuated vaccine strain CV777, Vero-cell-adapted isolate JS2008, and PEDV wild-type strain DX were 10(0.5) TCID(50)/100 μL, 10(1.1) TCID(50)/100 μL, and 10(1.2) TCID(50)/100 μL, respectively. Both assays were highly specific for PEDV, showing no cross-reactivity with other enteral viruses. CONCLUSION: This RPA method we developed is simple, time-effective, and safe and provides a reliable technical tool for the differential diagnosis and clinical epidemic surveillance of PEDV classical attenuated vaccine strains and wild-type strains.

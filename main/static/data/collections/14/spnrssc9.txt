Weight loss through lifestyle intervention remains the mainstay treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Nevertheless, only a minority of patients undergoing lifestyle intervention are able to achieve the weight loss threshold that reverses NASH histologic features. This case report demonstrates a minimally invasive method of treating NASH using an intragastric balloon. With endoscopic ultrasound-guided liver biopsy at the time of intragastric balloon removal, we demonstrate a significant improvement in NASH histologic features including steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis. This endoscopic method may offer an alternative solution to patients with NASH who fail lifestyle intervention.

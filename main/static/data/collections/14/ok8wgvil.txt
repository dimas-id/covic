Background: Infectious diseases are more frequent and can be associated with worse outcomes in patients with diabetes. Our aim was to systematically review and synthesize with a meta-analysis the available observational studies reporting the effect of diabetes in mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and medRxiv databases were reviewed. A random-effect model meta-analysis was used and I-square was utilized to assess the heterogeneity. In-hospital mortality was defined as the endpoint. Sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed. Results: 18,506 patients were included in this meta-analysis (3,713 diabetics and 14,793 non-diabetics). Patients with diabetes were associated with a higher risk of death compared to patients without diabetes (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.35, 1.96; I2 77.4%). The heterogeneity was high. A study level meta-regression analysis was performed for all the important covariates and no significant interactions were found between the covariates and the outcome of mortality. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that that the likelihood of death is 65% higher in diabetic hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared to non-diabetics. Further studies are needed to assess whether this association is independent or not, as well as to investigate to role of glucose control prior or during the disease.

In order to prevent secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions, we performed a noncontact determination of exposure to toxic conditions via 1215-MHz microwave radar and thermography. A toxic condition was induced by intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rabbits. The exposure to LPS was determined by linear discriminant analysis using non-contact derived variables.

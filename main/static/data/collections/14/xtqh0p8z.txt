The production of monoclonal antibodies and the development of recombinant antibody technology have made antibodies one of the largest classes of drugs in development for prophylactic, therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Currently, all of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved antibodies are immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs). However, more than 95%of the infections are initiated at the mucosal surfaces, where IgA is the primary immune effector antibody.

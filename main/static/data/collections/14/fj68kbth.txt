Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement is the most common surgical treatment for hydrocephalus. Laparoscopic techniques to aid in the placement of the peritoneal portion have been reported previously. Laparoscopic shunt placement has been associated with decreased operating time, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays. The authors describe a single-incision laparoscopic shunt (SILS) insertion technique that facilitates directed placement of the peritoneal portion of the catheter in children. A total of 6 pediatric patients underwent the SILS procedure between December 2008 and March 2009. This cohort included 5 girls and 1 boy; the average age was 6 years (range 1 day-16 years). One patient had previously undergone a VP shunt placement, but all other patients were undergoing the initial creation of their shunt. The most common pathological condition encountered was posttraumatic hydrocephalus (2 patients). All patients underwent successful placement of the peritoneal catheters. All catheters were seen to have CSF flowing freely within the peritoneal space. The authors' recent experience shows that SILS placement is safe and feasible in children. It allows accurate, directed placement of the VP shunt with a single, almost invisible, umbilical incision. The shunt tubing is remote from this incision.

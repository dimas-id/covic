RNA interference (RNAi) is a technology developed after the recent discovery of well-conserved cellular processes that induce posttranscriptional gene silencing triggered by small fragments of double-stranded RNA. This technique is rapidly developing into a promising tool used for functional genetics and therapeutic applications. We focus here on the aspects concerning RNAi mechanism, applications in mammals, and construct design and delivery. We summarize some therapeutic applications in general and speculate on the relevance in cardiovascular medicine.

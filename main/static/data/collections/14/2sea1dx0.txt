METHODS Review of indoor records in hospitals, interviews with relatives & physicians and active contact tracing using operational case definition. RESULTS Arrived on 16th December 2012, mostly stayed at daughter's house, visited by relatives, on 19th January, left for KSA accompanied by daughter, developed fever with chills and body aches on 23rd January.

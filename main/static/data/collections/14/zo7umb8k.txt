Background There is no consensus regarding the management of occult obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) patients without a confirmed bleeding source. This study aimed to consider the management of occult OGIB patients based on their long-term outcomes. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 357 consecutive occult OGIB patients (203 men; mean age: 59.7 years) who underwent capsule endoscopy (CE) at Hiroshima University Hospital, Japan and were followed up for more than 12 months (mean follow-up period; 50.2 months). Patients were divided into three groups as follows: Group A consisted of 98 of 157 patients who had positive findings and indication for treatment, Group B consisted of 59 of 157 patients who had positive findings but no indication for treatment, and Group C consisted of 200 patients who had negative small-bowel findings. We examined the rate of positive CE findings, detection rate and details of bleeding sources, overt bleeding rate, the rate of anemia exacerbation, 5-year anemia exacerbation rate, and overall survival rate. Results The positive CE findings rate was 44% (157/357) and detection rate of bleeding source was 27% (98/357). The details of Group A were as follows: angioectasia (n = 61), nonspecific ulceration (n = 10), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcer (n = 8), and others (n = 19). The details of Group B were as follows: erythema (n = 31), angioectasia (n = 25), and others (n = 3). There were no patients with overt bleeding in Group B. Although six patients had anemia exacerbation in Group B, they had angioectasia without a bleeding source. Conclusion The long-term outcomes of occult OGIB patients were good. Occult OGIB patients without bleeding source lesions may not require follow-up CE.

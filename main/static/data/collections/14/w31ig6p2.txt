BACKGROUND Outcomes after robotic distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation (RDP-SP) by the Warshaw technique and with splenectomy (RDP-S) were compared. METHODS All the data for patients undergoing robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) were prospectively collected. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were included, with 33 in each group. The console time was significantly shorter in the RDP-SP group than in the RDP-S group (165 minutes vs. 220 minutes). The median blood loss was 50 cm3 in the RDP-SP group and 100 cm3 in the RDP-S group. The surgical morbidity was significantly lower in RDP-SP group (18% vs. 58%). Spleen infarction (15%), gastric varices (6%) and perigastric varices (45%) after RDP-SP were not associated with any subsequent complication. Postoperative platelet count and white blood cell (WBC) count were significantly higher in the RDP-S group. CONCLUSIONS Both RDP-SP and RDP-S are feasible in selected patients. RDP-SP is feasible and time-saving. Although gastric/perigastric varices and spleen infarction are not uncommon after RDP-SP, they appear to be clinically irrelevant.

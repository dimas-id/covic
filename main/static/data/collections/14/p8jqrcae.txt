Laparoscopic splenectomy is now established as a safe and feasible procedure. However, it remains associated with some short- and long-term postoperative complications, especially infectious complications. To our knowledge, this is the first report (with video) focusing on the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic hemi-splenectomy and its surgical outcomes for the treatment of splenic abscesses causing septic emboli. This technique combines the immunological benefits of partial splenectomy and the postoperative benefits of a minimally invasive approach. Further studies are needed to standardize this technique and to assess its immunological and surgical benefits.

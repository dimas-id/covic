Renal nutcracker syndrome is an anatomic anomaly characterized by the compression of the left renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta or between the aorta and the vertebral body. Diagnosis is often challenging. Common presenting symptoms include hematuria, abdominal pain, and pelvic congestion. Several open and endovascular techniques have been described to treat this syndrome. We report a novel surgical technique with robotic-assisted left renal vein transposition to treat a 19-year-old woman with renal nutcracker syndrome. Robotic vascular surgery can be a safe and effective therapy for this condition.

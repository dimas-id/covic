Background: Since December 2019, a global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is responsible for massive influx of patients with acute respiratory failure in hospitals. We describe the characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in a large public hospital in France. Method: It is a single centre retrospective observational cohort. From 27th March to 23rd April, consecutive patients receiving 10 to 15 l/min of oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, who had signs of respiratory failure or were unable to maintain an SpO2 > 90%, were treated by CPAP with a face-mask unless the ICU physician judged that immediate intubation was indicated. The main outcome under study was reasons for CPAP discontinuation. Results: A total of 585 patients were admitted in Delafontaine hospital for COVID-19. ICU was quickly overwhelmed. Fifty-nine out of 159 (37%) patients requiring ICU care had to be referred to other hospitals. CPAP therapy was initiated in 49 patients and performed out of ICU in 41 (84%). Reasons for discontinuation of CPAP were intubation for invasive ventilation in 25 (51%) patients, improvement in 16 (33%), poor tolerance in 6 (12%) and death in 2 (4%). A decision not to intubate had been taken for the 2 patients who died while on CPAP. Conclusions: Treatment with CPAP is feasible and safe in a non-ICU environment in the context of a massive influx of patients. One third of these patients with high oxygen requirements did not eventually need invasive ventilation.

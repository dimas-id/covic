Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus, called the SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). Over 95% of well characterized cohorts of SARS have evidence of recent SARS‐CoV infection. The genome of SARS‐CoV has been sequenced and it is not related to any of the previously known human or animal coronaviruses. It is probable that SARS‐CoV was an animal virus that adapted to human‐human transmission in the recent past. The virus can be found in nasopharyngeal aspirate, urine and stools of SARS patients. Second generation reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays are able to detect SARS‐CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirates of approximately 80% of patients with SARS within the first 3 days of illness. Seroconversion for SARS‐CoV using immunofluorescence on infected cells is an excellent method of confirming the diagnosis, but antibody responses only appear around day 10 of the illness. Within the first 10 days the histological picture is that of acute phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with a mixture of inflammatory infiltrate, oedema and hyaline membrane formation. Desquamation of pneumocytes is prominent and consistent. After 10 days of illness the picture changes to one of organizing DAD with increased fibrosis, squamous metaplasia and multinucleated giant cells. The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of SARS is still unclear.

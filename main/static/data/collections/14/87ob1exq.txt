Activation of complement pathways, leading to production of C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins, has been postulated in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic airway inflammation. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of mannan‐binding lectin (MBL), an initiator of the lectin pathway of complement, in asthma and allergic rhinitis. MBL levels and MBL‐induced complement activity were determined in 19 patients of bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis and 20 unrelated, age‐matched controls of Indian origin. MBL levels and activity were correlated with percent eosinophilia and percent predicted FEV1 values of the patients. Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1 and intron 1 of the MBL with the disease, clinical markers, MBL levels and MBL‐induced complement activity was analysed using standard statistical tools. Significantly higher MBL levels and activity were observed in patients of bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis as compared to the controls. We identified five SNPs, of which two, A816G in exon 1 and G1011A in intron 1 of the MBL, were novel. SNP G1011A was significantly associated with the disease (P = 0.0024, OR = 5.8696, 95% CI: 1.7316 < OR < 19.8963). Individuals with ‘A’ allele at position 1011 showed increased MBL levels, activity and disease severity. Our results suggest that ‘A’ allele at position 1011 leading to high MBL levels and complement activity may be contributing to the severity of bronchial asthma and allergic airway inflammation.

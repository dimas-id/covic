BACKGROUND The use of biological materials for the repair of complex abdominal wall defects has increased over the years; however, the role of these materials in routine practice remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical outcomes following the use of Permacol™ porcine collagen surgical implant in complex abdominal wall repair. METHODS This subset analysis of seven European sites from a multicentre retrospective study included patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery and treated with Permacol™ surgical implant. Inguinal, parastomal, diaphragmatic, perineal, and hiatal repairs were excluded. Only patients with at least 12 months of follow-up after surgery were included. RESULTS A total of 109 patients (56 males and 53 females) were included. Patients had a median of two comorbidities (range 0-6). Thirty-three per cent of patients were treated for recurrent hernia. All but one case used an open approach. Sixty-six per cent were Center for Disease Control wound class II-IV at the time of surgery. Fascial closure was achieved in 69%. Median follow-up length was 720 days (range 368-2857). Recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 9.2 and 18.3 %, respectively, and were higher in cases without fascial closure. One-year recurrence was higher following use of an onlay technique (P = 0.025). In a multivariate analysis, among 16 comorbidities examined only fascial closure significantly impacted 1-year recurrence (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS Data from this large retrospective multicentre European study strongly suggest the use of Permacol™ porcine collagen surgical implant to be safe and effective for complex abdominal wall repair. The recurrence rate was impacted by fascial closure.

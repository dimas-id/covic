The international outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003 highlighted the need to develop pretested human vaccine vectors that can be used in a rapid response against newly emerging pathogens. We evaluated Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus that is highly attenuated in primates, as a topical respiratory vaccine vector with SARS-CoV as a test pathogen. Complete recombinant NDV was engineered to express the SARS-CoV spike S glycoprotein, the viral neutralization and major protective antigen, from an added transcriptional unit. African green monkeys immunized through the respiratory tract with two doses of the vaccine developed a titer of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies comparable with the robust secondary response observed in animals that have been immunized with a different experimental SARS-CoV vaccine and challenged with SARS-CoV. When animals immunized with NDV expressing S were challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV, direct viral assay of lung tissues taken by necropsy at the peak of viral replication demonstrated a 236- or 1,102-fold (depending on the NDV vector construct) mean reduction in pulmonary SARS-CoV titer compared with control animals. NDV has the potential for further development as a pretested, highly attenuated, intranasal vector to be available for expedited vaccine development for humans, who generally lack preexisting immunity against NDV.

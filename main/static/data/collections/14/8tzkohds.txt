OBJECTIVE: Garlic is a plant has been used as a flavor, and anti-microbial and anti-diarrheal agent. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus. The available vaccines against IBV cannot cover new variants. This study evaluated the inhibitory effects of garlic extract on IBV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The constituents of garlic extract were detected by gas chromatography. This study was done in four groups of embryonic SPF eggs; first group was used for virus titration; second group received the mixture of different virus titration and constant amount of garlic extract; third group received 10(-3) titration of virus and after 8 hr received garlic extract and the last group received different dilutions of garlic extract. RESULTS: Based on our results, in the second group, IBV vaccine strain (4/91) at all titration and M41 in 10(-2) and 10(-3) titration and in the third group both variants of virus the embryonic Index (EI) was significantly increased. CONCLUSION: The garlic extract had inhibitory effects on IBV in the chickens embryo.

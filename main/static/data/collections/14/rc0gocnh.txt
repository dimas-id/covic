BACKGROUND: Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19. Limited data regarding clinical outcome exist in adults, whereas very little is known about the spectrum of the disease in pediatric heart transplant recipients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of young heart transplant patients from our tertiary care center during the coronavirus pandemic in New York City and identified patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We present four cases with COVID-19 disease and elaborate on their presentation and clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Although far from conclusive and limited by the small sample size and selection bias, these cases demonstrate mild and self-limited disease despite immunosuppressive therapy and various comorbidities that are expected to increase the severity of the clinical picture based on extrapolation from the adult experience with this novel disease.

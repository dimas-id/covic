BACKGROUND Humans have faced 3 major influenza pandemics in the 20th century. In recent years, it has become evident that domestic poultry play an important role in the generation of novel influenza strains with the capacity to cross the species barrier and infect and kill humans at an alarming rate. There is particular concern that avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype could cause a pandemic. METHODS A better understanding of the genetic factors that lead to interspecies transmission is essential to prevent the emergence of influenza pandemics. In addition, the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and development of vaccines against potentially pandemic viruses must be considered under the umbrella of pandemic plans. RESULTS The world is ill-prepared to face an influenza pandemic. Only a handful of countries have developed influenza pandemic plans, and even fewer are developing vaccines or stockpiling antiinfluenza drugs to ameliorate the impact of a potential pandemic. Currently the major undertaking in several at risk nations is to implement effective control measures to stop the spread of the virus at its source, that is, avian species. These measures include the culling of domestic poultry to contain the virus, a practice that could eventually bring these countries to a financial and social breaking point. CONCLUSIONS Avian influenza disease is preventable in humans and birds with the concerted effort of governments and poultry producers, large and small, to improve biosecurity and education programs. Pandemic plans can reduce the impact of the pandemic; however, preventing avian influenza in poultry can avert a pandemic altogether.

Abstract Infectious diseases are a serious global problem, which not only take an enormous human toll but also incur tremendous economic losses. In combating infectious diseases, rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are required for pathogen identification at the point of care (POC). In this review, investigations of diagnostic strategies for infectious diseases that are based on aptamers, especially nucleic acid aptamers, oligonucleotides that have high affinities and specificities toward their targets, are described. Owing to their unique features including low cost of production, easy chemical modification, high chemical stability, reproducibility, and low levels of immunogenicity and toxicity, aptamers have been widely utilized as bio-recognition elements (bio-receptors) for the development of infection diagnostic systems. We discuss nucleic acid aptamer-based methods that have been developed for diagnosis of infections using a format that organizes discussion according to the target pathogenic analytes including toxins or proteins, whole cells and nucleic acids. Also included is, a summary of recent advances made in the sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria utilizing the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method. Lastly, a nucleic acid aptamer-based POC system is described and future directions of studies in this area are discussed.

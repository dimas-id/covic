Abstract Plausible representatives of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in pigs have been characterized as being CD4hiCD172lo. Due to their paucity in blood, we utilized novel fluorescent-activated cell sorting procedures to isolate them from PBMC. The resultant subset was greater than 98% homogeneous in regards to the selected phenotype and contained the preponderance of individuals secreting IFN-α after exposure to a known stimulant, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In addition to being a potent source of IFN-α, other properties of these porcine CD4hiCD172lo cells including their morphological transition from a plasma cell-like shape during quiescence to one resembling a dendritic cell (DC) after activation by TGEV and their relatively strong constitutive expression of interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) conformed to the expectations of genuine pDCs. While a substantial IFN-α response was also elicited from the porcine pDCs by pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV), and TLR7 and 9 agonists, there was an agent-dependent induction of varying amounts of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Notably, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) failed to provoke the pDCs to secrete any of the measured cytokines except IL-2. Moreover, whereas pDCs exposed to TGEV or the TLR9 agonist rapidly increased IRF-7 production and morphed into DCs with enhanced CD80/86 expression, similar alterations were not observed during incubation with PRRSV. This atypical response of pDCs to PRRSV may contribute to its pathogenesis, which unlike that associated with PrV, SIV or TGEV includes persistent infection and limited development of protective immunity.

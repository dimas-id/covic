SUMMARY Electron microscopic examinations were made on negatively stained preparations of supernatant fluids from cell cultures infected with haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV). The studies revealed that all related strains of the virus so examined were morphologically similar to coronaviruses. One strain, of similar origin, but known to differ serologically from the others, was shown to resemble the paramyxoviruses.

Machining parameters affects the final quality of components made in carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite materials. In this framework, the work here presented aims at studying the right combination of cutting speed (vc) and feed rate (vf), for dry drilling of carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite materials, which obtained better results regarding roughness, hole cylindricity, and diameter. A series of experimental tests were carried out under different drilling conditions (vc/vf), monitoring the thrust force (Fz), torque (T), and electric power (EP), to define which one can help more for industrial daily life production. Results validation was carried out using the analysis of variance, in order to relate main machining parameters cutting speed and linear feed, with thrust force, drilling torque, main spindle electric power and hole quality parameters (average roughness, cylindricity and diameter). The conclusions show that thrust force is not proportional to the cutting speed and the best combinations of cutting speed and feed were found out around the average values of tested parameters. Spindle electric power is an interesting element to take into account because it is easy to consider in real production.

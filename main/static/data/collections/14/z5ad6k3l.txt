PURPOSE Although the traditional cutdown inguinal hernia repair in children is well established, tubal occlusion has been reported as a complication in girls. The purpose was to investigate the mechanism of this complication and the efficacy of laparoscopic repair for preventing tubal occlusion. METHODS Between October 2006 and May 2010, we performed laparoscopic hernia repair in 100 girls (54 with a right hernia, including 2 with an inguinal ovarian hernia, 40 with a left hernia, including 3 with an inguinal ovarian hernias, and 6 with bilateral hernias). During laparoscopic repair we examined the anatomical relationship between the ovary, ovarian suspensory ligament, internal inguinal ring, and round ligament on both sides. RESULTS In 17 cases, 5 with an inguinal ovarian hernia and 12 without, the suspensory ligaments were ventrally dislocated and attached around the internal inguinal ring, and the ovary and fallopian tube were positioned near the internal inguinal ring and above the pelvic brim on the side of the original hernia. CONCLUSION This ventrally dislocated attachment may facilitate sliding of the ovaries and tubes into the hernial sac and induce tubal occlusion as a postoperative complication of inguinal hernia repair. The laparoscopic procedure makes it easy to prevent this complication.

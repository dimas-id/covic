Global Catastrophic Biological Risks (GCBRs) refer to biological events-natural, deliberate, and accidental-of a global and lasting impact. This challenges the life scientists to raise their game on two hitherto neglected innovation frontiers: a veritable "futures" thinking to "think the unthinkable," and "systems thinking" so as to see both the trees and the forest when it comes to GCBRs. This innovation analysis article outlines the promise of Omics systems science biotechnologies, for example, to deploy rapid fire diagnostics for health security crises at GCBR level, possibly involving neopathogens and/or incurring epidemics (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Ebola) that collectively threaten the lives of global society and interdependent biological ecosystems. Moreover, Omics encourages thinking beyond immediacy and in long-term strategies for biopreparedness and response innovation when the timelines are aggressive and compressed in response to crises such as GCBRs, but also to non-global but surging, multiple threats occurring as successive, overlapping, or distinct events, rather than as distinct entities-a prospect enforcing a reboot in Bioresilience. We define Next-Generation Bioresilience as "a systems approach against natural, accidental and perpetrated GCBRs using Omics technologies, and a shift in mentality, whereby the systems approach is expanded to include multiple plausible futures and expose unchecked assumptions attendant to risks, beyond technological determinism." In sum, it is time to think about the realistic potential of Omics biotechnologies beyond clinical practice and precision medicine so as to harness the opportunities and address the uncertainties associated not only with GCBRs but also with other emerging Omics applications in health and society.

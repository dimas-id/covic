The concept of Hand Awareness affects a more comprehensive respiratory infection prevention plan than vaccine immunization alone, as most respiratory infections do not have a vaccine solution. Additionally, the resurgence of measles, mumps, and pertussis in those who have been vaccinated is a good reminder that we must improve our approach to respiratory infection prevention. Weak links exist in the vaccine production and administration chain. It is not the panacea we once hoped. Changing behavior, while very difficult, is critical in order to have a greater impact on reducing all respiratory infections. Hand Awareness is defined as an integrated approach of hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and cross-contamination awareness practices or, in lay terms, knowing where your hands are and what they are doing at all times. Teaching strategies and resources are explored to assist with student understanding and application of desired behaviors that will achieve the greatest impact of both student and staff productivity and wellness.

While the world is facing the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers must plan for the direct response to the outbreak while minimising its collateral impact. Maintaining the supply chain of pharmaceutical products is not only paramount to cover the immediate medical response but will be fundamental to reducing disruption of the healthcare delivery system, which requires constant medicines, diagnostic tools and vaccines for smooth functioning. In this equation, the role of the Indian pharmaceutical industry will not only be critical to meet the domestic need of over 1.3 billion inhabitants but will equally be important for the rest of the world, including wealthy economies. Preventing a significant disruption of the Indian pharmaceutical supply chain during the outbreak and preparing it for large scale production for COVID-19 therapeutic or preventive medical products will not only help India but will assist the global response to this outbreak.

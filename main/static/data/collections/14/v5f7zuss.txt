BACKGROUND: The EGFR-vIII mutation is the most common malignant event in GBM. Epigenetic reprogramming in EGFR-activated GBM has recently been suggested to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Histone acetylation is important for chromatin structure and function. However, the role and biological function of H2AZK4/7AC in tumours have not yet been clarified. RESULTS: In our study, we found that EGFR-vIII negatively regulated H2AZK4/7AC expression though the PI3K/AKT-HDAC2 axis. Because HDAC1 and HDAC2 are highly homologous enzymes that usually form multi-protein complexes for transcriptional regulation and epigenetic landscaping, we simultaneously knocked out HDAC1 and HDAC2 and found that H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC were upregulated, which partially released EGFR-vIII-mediated inhibition of USP11, negative regulator of cell cycle. In addition, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that FK228 induced G1/S transition arrest in GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation. FK228 could enhance anti-tumour activity by upregulating expression of the tumour suppressor USP11 in GBM cells. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR-vIII mutation downregulates H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC, inhibiting USP11 expression though the PI3K/AKT-HDAC1/2 axis. FK228 is an effective and promising treatment for GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation.

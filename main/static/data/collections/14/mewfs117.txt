In an effort to find new antiviral agents from natural products, hot water extracts of eight traditionally used medicinal plants in Taiwan were investigated in vitro for their activities against adenoviruses (ADV) and herpes simplex viruses (HSV). Results demonstrated that all extracts exhibited antiviral activity with different degrees of potency. Only two extracts were active in suppressing both HSV and ADV infections. Three extracts inhibited only ADV infection whereas one extract blocked only HSV infection. These results suggested that the aforementioned medicinal plants merit further investigation.

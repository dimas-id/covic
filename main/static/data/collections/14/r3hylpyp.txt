BACKGROUND Major pulmonary resections for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are increasingly being performed by thoracoscopy, but there are economic concerns related to the use of many disposable items and increased operative time. We evaluated and compared the costs of thoracoscopic lobectomy versus open lobectomy. METHODS Data from all patients who underwent lobectomy for clinical stage I NSCLC from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009 were reviewed. Two hundred eighty-seven major pulmonary resections (269 lobectomies and 18 anatomic segmentectomies) for NSCLC were performed: 98 cases via a totally endoscopic approach (TS) and 189 via a classical posterolateral thoracotomy (PLT). Direct medical costs [hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, disposables, theatre time, laboratory, and radiology costs] were evaluated. RESULTS Patient demographics were similar in both groups. The two groups did not differ in histology, pathologic stage, or type of lobectomy. There were no differences in postoperative complications or readmissions during the 30-day postoperative period; however, patients in the TS group had significantly fewer chest tube days and shorter hospital length of stay (p < 0.001). Theatre costs were significantly higher in the TS group [2,861 ± 458 vs. 2,260 ± 399 (p < 0.001)]. Mean cost for disposables for TS was 1,800 ± 560.46 vs. 901 ± 328 for PLT (p < 0.001). Thoracoscopic upper-right lobectomy and anatomic segmentectomy were more expensive than other thoracoscopic lobectomies. Mean costs for hospital stay, laboratory, and radiological services for TS were less than for PLT (p < 0.001), although mean ICU stay was similar in both groups. Finally, overall costs were significantly greater for the PLT group (14,145.57 ± 7,117.84) than for the TS group (11,934.13 ± 6,690.25) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic lobectomy was less expensive than open lobectomy for patients with early-stage NSCLC. Although thoracoscopic lobectomy has a higher initial cost, overall cost is less expensive due to a shorter hospital stay.

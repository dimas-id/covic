The virus is 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), never been seen previously in human, but all the population is generally susceptible. The virus spreads through many ways and is highly infectious, which brings great difficulties to the prevention and control of NCP. Based on the needs of orthopedic trauma patients for emergency surgery and review of the latest NCP diagnosis and treatment strategy and the latest principles and principles of evidence-based medicine in traumatic orthopedics, the authors put forward this expert consensus to systematically standardize the clinical pathway and protective measures of emergency surgery for orthopedic trauma patients during prevention and control of NCP and provide reference for the emergency surgical treatment of orthopedic trauma patients in hospitals at all levels.

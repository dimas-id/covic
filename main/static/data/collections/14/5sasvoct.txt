Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of peptidomimetic severe acute respiratory syndrome chymotrypsin-like protease (SARS-3CLpro) inhibitors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are described. These inhibitors exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in infected cells in the micromolar range. An X-ray crystal structure of our lead inhibitor (4) bound to SARS-3CLpro provided important drug-design templates for the design of small-molecule inhibitors.

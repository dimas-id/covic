Since the end of 2019, the global COVID-19 outbreak has once again made coronaviruses a hot topic. Vaccines are hoped to be an effective way to stop the spread of the virus. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines available for coronavirus infections. Reverse genetics technology can realize the operation of RNA virus genomes at the DNA level and provide new ideas and strategies for the development of new vaccines. In this review, we systematically describe the role of reverse genetics technology in studying the effects of coronavirus proteins on viral virulence and innate immunity, cell and tissue tropism and antiviral drug screening. An efficient reverse genetics platform is useful for obtaining the ideal attenuated strain to prepare an attenuated live vaccine.

Objective of the current study was to assess whether game-formatted executive function (EF) training, is effective in improving attention, EF and academic performance in very preterm and/or extremely low birthweight children aged 8–12 years. A multi-center, double-blind, placebo- and waitlist controlled randomized trial (NTR5365) in two academic hospitals in The Netherlands was performed. Eighty-five very preterm children with parent-rated attention problems on the Child Behavior Checklist were randomized to one of three treatment conditions: EF training, placebo training or waitlist condition. EF or placebo training was completed at home (6 weeks, 25 sessions of 30–45 min each). At baseline, 2 weeks after training or being on the waitlist, and five months after first follow-up visit, children underwent assessments of primary outcomes (parent and teacher ratings of attention) and secondary outcomes (parent and teacher ratings of daily-life EF, computerized EF tasks and academic performance). Linear mixed model analyses were performed for all outcome measures. There were no significant differences in improvement over time on parent- and teacher ratings of attention, parent- and teacher ratings of daily-life EF, computerized EF tasks, and academic performance (arithmetic and reading) between the EF training, placebo training and waitlist condition. In conclusion, game-formatted EF training does not improve attention, EF or academic performance in very preterm children with parent-rated attention problems.

SARS-CoV-2, a highly transmittable pathogen has infected over 3.8 million people around the globe. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 engages host ACE2 for adhesion, TMPRSS2 for activation and entry. With the aid of whole-exome sequencing, we report a variant rs12329760 in TMPRSS2 gene and its mutant V160M, which might impede viral entry. Furthermore, we identified TMPRSS2 cleavage sites in S2 domain of spike glycoprotein and report the structure of TMPRSS2 in complex with spike glycoprotein. We also report the structures of protease inhibitors in complex with TMPRSS2, which could hamper the interaction with spike protein. These findings advance our understanding on the role of TMPRSS2 and in the development of potential therapeutics.

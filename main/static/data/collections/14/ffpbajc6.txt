OBJECTIVE To compare the perioperative surgical outcomes and complication rates between single-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy and conventional four-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN Between June 2009 and April 2011, 56 patients underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Of these 56 patients, 28 underwent single-port (Octoport™) total laparoscopic hysterectomy and 28 underwent conventional four-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy. We analyzed the following parameters for all the patients: age, body mass index, operative time, blood loss, change in hemoglobin level, vaginal stump suture time and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The general characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in blood loss, hemoglobin change, length of postoperative hospital stay and complication rate. However, the mean operative time of the single-port group was significantly longer than that of the four-port group (93.5±24.0min vs. 78.7±17.4min; P=0.011). The operative time for vaginal stump suture was profoundly decreased with experience in the single-port group. CONCLUSION With the exception of operative time, the surgical outcomes and incidence of complications of the single-port group were comparable to those of the four-port group. However, the operative time decreased in the single-port group with increasing experience.

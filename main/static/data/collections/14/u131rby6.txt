CONCLUSION Patients with risk factors including younger age, mastoiditis, external ear disease, treatment by older surgeons, and concomitant mastoidectomy should receive detailed management to minimize the probability of re-operation for chronic otitis media (COM). OBJECTIVES Although COM remains a common ear disease requiring surgical intervention, its re-operation risks are less well-documented. This study aimed to compare patients with COM who underwent re-operation and those patients with no re-operation, and identify the risks of re-operation. METHOD This retrospective cohort study analyzed the trend of COM surgery from 1999-2009, and identified the re-operation risks of 18 895 patients with COM who underwent surgery from 2002-2006 using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. RESULTS Among the study population, 129 patients underwent revision surgery during a 5.5 Â± 1.5 year follow-up period. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the re-operation rate was significantly higher in patients under 18 years of age, those with mastoiditis, disorders of external ear, treatment by surgeons of 50-64 years of age, use of a very high volume surgeon, and combined surgery with mastoidectomy. A multivariate analysis further limited the re-operation risk factors to younger patients, those with mastoiditis, external ear disorders, treatment by older surgeons, and concomitant mastoidectomy.

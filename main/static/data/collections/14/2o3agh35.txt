Haematological and immunological data of children with COVID-19 infection is lacking. Between 21(st) January and 20(th) March 2020, 244 children who were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and admitted to the Wuhan Children's Hospital, China were retrospectively reviewed. 193 children were considered as symptomatic, which was defined as having either the presence of clinical symptoms or the presence of CT thorax abnormalities. Their haematological and immunological profiles, including complete blood counts, lymphocyte subsets (T, B and NK cell counts), immunoglobulin (Ig) profiles (IgG, IgA and IgM) and cytokine profiles were analysed and compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The median values and the interquartile ranges were calculated. Comparison was made using the Mannâ€“Whitney U test. Children with symptomatic COVID-19 infection had significantly lower haemoglobin levels, but higher absolute lymphocyte and monocyte counts, IgG and IgA levels, as well as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma levels. The obtained data will be utilized for further studies in comparing children and adults with COVID-19 infections in other parts of the world and with different severity.

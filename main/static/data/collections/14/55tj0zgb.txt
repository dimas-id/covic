A summary is given of the mechanical characteristics of virus contaminants and the transmission via droplets and aerosols. The ordinary and partial differential equations describing the physics of these processes with high fidelity are presented, as well as appropriate numerical schemes to solve them. Several examples taken from recent evaluations of the built environment are shown, as well as the optimal placement of sensors.

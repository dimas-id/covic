Morbilliviruses are pathogens of humans and other animals. Live attenuated morbillivirus vaccines have been used to end endemic transmission of measles virus (MV) in many parts of the developed world and to eradicate rinderpest virus. Entry is mediated by two different receptors which govern virus lymphotropism and epitheliotropism. Morbillivirus transmissibility is unparalleled and MV represents the most infectious human pathogen on earth. Their evolutionary origins remain obscure and their potential for adaption to new hosts is poorly understood. It has been suggested that MV could be eradicated. Therefore it is imperative to dissect barriers which restrict cross species infections. This is important as ecological studies identify novel morbilliviruses in a vast number of small mammals and carnivorous predators.

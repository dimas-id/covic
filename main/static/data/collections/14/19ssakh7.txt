Severe COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thrombosis. We describe a patient with acute ischaemic stroke while suffering from COVID-19 and respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation. Deep sedation may delay diagnosis. LEARNING POINTS: A thrombotic stroke can complicate severe COVID-19. Prolonged deep sedation during mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients may delay the diagnosis of stroke. The hypercoagulability and a thrombo-inflammatory response in COVID-19 is characterized by an increase in D-dimers and fibrinogen.

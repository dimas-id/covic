In this chapter, a comprehensive overview of the most significant and interesting contributions published from 2000 until now, concerning the preparation of novel β-lactam structures is presented. Among the different synthetic strategies available, either novel or already known but efficient and versatile methodologies are covered. The simple modifications of one or more substituents linked to the nitrogen N-1, the C-3, and the C-4 carbon atoms of the β-lactam nucleus were considered as an alternative synthetic protocol of more complex and polyfunctionalized molecules. Indeed, it is well known and extensively reviewed that the biological activity of this strained four-membered heterocycle is strictly dependent on the nature of the substituent groups that affect the reactivity towards the molecular active sites, increasing or lowering the possibility of interaction with the substrates. Finally, a synthetic survey of the most significant biological and pharmacological applications of the 2-azetidinones is reported.

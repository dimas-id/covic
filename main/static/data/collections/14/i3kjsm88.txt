Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently recognised pandemic spreading rapidly from Wuhan, Hubei, to other provinces in China and to many countries around the world. The number of COVID-19-related deaths is steadily increasing. Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a disease with high morbidity and mortality rates, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention is usually recommended for the treatment. A patient with diabetes mellitus and hypertension for five years was admitted to the emergency unit with symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnoea. These symptoms were consistent with viral pneumonia and a COVID PCR test was performed, which tested positive three days later. The patient had chest pain on the eighth day of hospitalisation. On electrocardiography, simultaneous acute inferior and anterior STEMI were identified. High levels of stress and increased metabolic demand in these patients may lead to concomitant thrombosis of different coronary arteries, presenting with two different STEMIs.

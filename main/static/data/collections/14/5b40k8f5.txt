Purpose Gastric emptying may influence the quality of life of patients who undergo distal gastrectomy. Little is known, however, about gastric emptying after distal gastrectomy. The aim of our study was to investigate gastric emptying patterns after distal gastrectomy. Methods This gastric-emptying study investigated patients who underwent distal gastrectomy in the 6 months or more before May 2008 to July 2013 at Chungbuk National University Hospital with a study sample of 205 patients. We analyzed patterns of gastric emptying. Results Delayed gastric emptying was found in 109 of the 205 patients (53.2%). Food stasis was more frequent in a group with delayed gastric emptying. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for gastroparesis were laparoscopic operation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.731; P = 0.008) and duration of less than 24 months after distal gastrectomy (HR, 2.795; P = 0.001). Delayed gastric emptying tended to decrease with duration of the postoperative period. Conclusion Delayed gastric emptying is common in distal gastrectomy, and is related to laparoscopic operation and duration of the postoperative period. Food stasis was more frequent in a group with delayed gastric emptying.

The pandemic caused by SARS-COV2 Virus/COVID-19, which was initially reported in China in December 2019, has become a major global health concern. COVID-19 can manifest with cytokine storm - an exaggerated systemic inflammatory phenomenon due to over-production of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells that results in diffuse inflammatory lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may be complicated by septic shock and subsequent multi-organ failure. Based on the most recently published evidence, this article will review and discuss comprehensive information on its clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, potential therapeutics, and prevention guidelines.

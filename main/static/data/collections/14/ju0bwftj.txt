Equine standing surgery and laparoscopy are becoming increasingly important aspects of equine surgery. Laparoscopic advancements lag behind the human medical field, mainly due to decreased access to appropriate training and instrumentation. It is nearly impossible to cover the topic of equine standing surgery without discussing advances in laparoscopy, because without such advances, equine standing surgery lacks potential for forward progress. Although novel standing techniques continue to be published, the addition of minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques adds an entirely new dimension and provides a plethora of procedures to surgeons practicing equine standing surgery.

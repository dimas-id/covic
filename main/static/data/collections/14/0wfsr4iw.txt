Trends in influenza and pneumococcal vaccine coverage in Thai patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 2010-2018: Experience from a tertiary diabetes center in Bangkok BACKGROUND: Routine vaccination is an important part of preventive services in treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). There are no available data in temporal trends of vaccination coverage rates in both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines among Thai patients with T2DM. AIM: This study aimed to elucidate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination trends and to identify factors that affect vaccination rates in those patients. METHOD: A retrospective study of randomly medical records stratified by 13 diabetologists was conducted in patients with T2DM from 2010-2018 at Theptarin Hospital, a private multi-disciplinary diabetes center in Bangkok. Adherence to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations according to current guidance on adult immunization in Thailand had been studied. The rate of both vaccinations from each diabetologist had also been recorded. RESULTS: A total of 2,114 medical records (female 51.7%, mean age 65.2±12.8 years, BMI 26.5±4.6 kg/m(2), A1C 7.1±1.3%, median duration of diabetes 13 years) were retrospectively reviewed covering a 9-year period. We audited 3,554 selected outpatient visits for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations rates as key performance index in each year. The overall vaccination rate was 39.6% for influenza, 17.4% for the pneumococcal vaccine, and only 13.7%, for both vaccines. The trends of influenza vaccination rates increased from 32.9% in 2010 to 52.2% in 2018 but the trends of pneumococcal vaccination rates were relatively stable at less than 20%. The rate of both vaccinations varied considerably from 0-44% among our diabetologists. Age ≥ 65 years, duration of DM ≥ 15 years, the presence of chronic respiratory disease, and moderate to severe Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score were positively associated with both received vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: The completeness and timeliness of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were unsatisfactory in Thai patients with T2DM. More efforts are needed to increase both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates.

Pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine were recently identified by a machine learning model and demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Ebola virus (EBOV) and represent viable candidates for drug repurposing. These drugs were docked into the crystal structure of the ebola glycoprotein and then experimentally validated in vitro to generate Kd values for tilorone (0.73 μM) pyronaridine (7.34 μM), and quinacrine (7.55 μM). These are more potent than the previously reported toremifene (16 μM).

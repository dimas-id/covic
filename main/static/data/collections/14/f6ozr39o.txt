BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is rapidly gaining popularity as the practical alternative to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Although SILS achieves essentially the same goal as NOTES (a nearly invisible scar in the umbilicus), it does not carry the significant potential risks of a transluminal approach. The SILS approach has been most commonly described for cholecystectomy and appendectomy. The authors describe a novel application for this approach in the placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube. The described application for this technique is the first to be reported. METHODS The authors describe use of the technique for two intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring long-term postpyloric tube feeds. Access was obtained through the umbilicus with the SILS port. The selected loop of the jejunum was exteriorized through this incision, and the feeding tube was placed. The loop was returned into the abdomen, and the SILS port was replaced in the incision. Under laparoscopic visualization and guidance, the feeding tube was brought externally through a predetermined site in the left midabdomen. RESULTS Two patients underwent SILS jejunostomy tube placement. The average operating time was 42.5 min. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications occurred. Tube feedings were started on postoperative day 1 for both patients, with good bowel function. CONCLUSION The SILS technique for jejunostomy placement is a promising and feasible alternative to the current methods. It is less invasive than the open approach while providing complete intraabdominal visualization. It is less technically demanding than the direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) approach and avoids the risks and difficulties associated with it. The same benefits of other SILS procedures are evident in this application. The authors believe a series study will further highlight long-term benefits and any potential complications.

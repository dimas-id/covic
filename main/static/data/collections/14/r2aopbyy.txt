Non-adherence to multipharmacological treatment increases the risk of morbidity, mortality and hospitalization. We know little about the perspective of patients with chronic kidney disease regarding factors influencing medicine taking. This study aimed to synthesize findings from qualitative studies of patients' experiences of factors that facilitate and hinder adherence to medication. A systematic review of qualitative studies adhering to the Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research (ENTREQ) framework. Systematic searches were conducted in several databases. We used thematic synthesis and the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) approach to assess the confidence of the evidence. Nineteen studies involving 381 patients with chronic kidney disease were included. We identified three analytical themes; logistics, benchmarking the need for medication; and the quality of the patient-physician relationship, with seven descriptive sub-themes as factors influencing patients' adherence to medications. Helping patients to map their everyday activities and motivating them to associate medications with everyday activities may facilitate adherence to medications. Addressing patient beliefs about medications, supporting patients in coping with side effects of medications and eliciting patients' wishes for involvement in treatment decisions may also facilitate adherence. Barriers to adherence were the costs of buying medications, and lacking understanding of the indications and effects of medications. The findings in this synthesis resonate with previous research and extend the known literature by synthesizing and formally assessing confidence in the evidence.

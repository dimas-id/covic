INTRODUCTION Patients with coronary stents often undergo non-cardiac invasive procedures. These are often associated with thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic complications. The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention. RESULTS Among the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION Patients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.

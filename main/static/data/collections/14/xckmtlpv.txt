Cardiac amyloidosis is most commonly comprised of either a monoclonal immunoglobulin or transthyretin; however, in practice, detailing of the former beyond light chain restriction is not typically performed. We present briefly the case of an 80-year-old man with concern for cardiac amyloidosis and a subsequent endomyocardial biopsy revealing significant deposition of amorphous Congo red-positive material. By immunofluorescence microscopy, the amyloidogenic material showed positive expression for IgG heavy chain and kappa light chain, with negative staining for IgM and IgA heavy chains and lambda light chain supporting a diagnosis of heavy and light chain (AHL)-type amyloidosis. Immunofluorescence staining for the IgG heavy chain subclasses supported and further classified the patient's AHL-type cardiac amyloidosis as being IgG4/kappa restricted. The presented case is the first to illustrate AHL-type cardiac amyloidosis via sampling of heart tissue.

Respiratory tract viral infection continues to be among the most common reasons for emergency department visits and hospitalization of children, particularly infants younger than 1 year, in the United States. Throughout the years, clinicians have considered respiratory syncytial virus followed by influenza as the most common pathogens responsible. Over the past decade, new viruses have been discovered through both more specific testing and the finding of new agents causing infection. This includes human metapneumovirus, which leads to similar but often epidemiologically more severe clinical symptoms than respiratory syncytial virus. Other agents responsible for lower respiratory tract infection include Coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome), Bocavirus, and others. This review serves to focus on some of the recent literature on these agents and the clinical impact they have on pediatric lung infection.

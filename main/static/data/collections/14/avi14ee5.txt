• The European commission has developed an index for risk management named INFORM; • Two dimensions (vulnerability and lack of coping capacity) are relevant to COVID-19; • We examined if these dimensions were associated with COVID-19 pandemic control; • Higher vulnerability and poorer coping capacity were associated with poorer control; • Modifying these two dimensions might potentially mitigate COVID-19 pandemic control.

BACKGROUND Intravascular imaging can facilitate chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS We examined the frequency of use and outcomes of intravascular imaging among 619 CTO percutaneous coronary interventions performed between 2012 and 2015 at 7 US centers. Mean age was 65.4±10 years and 85% of the patients were men. Intravascular imaging was used in 38%: intravascular ultrasound in 36%, optical coherence tomography in 3%, and both in 1.45%. Intravascular imaging was used for stent sizing (26.3%), stent optimization (38.0%), and CTO crossing (35.7%, antegrade in 27.9%, and retrograde in 7.8%). Intravascular imaging to facilitate crossing was used more frequently in lesions with proximal cap ambiguity (49% versus 26%, P<0.0001) and with retrograde as compared with antegrade-only cases (67% versus 31%, P<0.0001). Despite higher complexity (Japanese CTO score: 2.86±1.19 versus 2.43±1.19, P=0.001), cases in which imaging was used for crossing had similar technical and procedural success (92.8% versus 89.6%, P=0.302 and 90.1% versus 88.3%, P=0.588, respectively) and similar incidence of major cardiac adverse events (2.7% versus 3.2%, P=0.772). Use of intravascular imaging was associated with longer procedure (192 minutes [interquartile range 130, 255] versus 131 minutes [90, 192], P<0.0001) and fluoroscopy (71 minutes [44, 93] versus 39 minutes [25, 69], P<0.0001) time. CONCLUSIONS Intravascular imaging is frequently performed during CTO percutaneous coronary intervention both for crossing and for stent selection/optimization. Despite its use in more complex lesion subsets, intravascular imaging was associated with similar rates of technical and procedural success for CTO percutaneous coronary intervention.

At the end of January 2020, a novel beta-coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), progressively spread in Italy. Patients with cancer are considered more prone to infections because of the immunosuppressive status due to both malignancy and anticancer treatments. From the first Italian government restrictions (23(rd) February), Modena Cancer Center adopted practical health vigilance recommendations in order to minimize the virus exposure risk without overlooking cancer management. From 23(rd) February to 31(st) March 2020, 1257 patients on active anticancer treatment for oncological or hematological malignancies, attended our Institution. All the staff activities were rescheduled following our practical COVID-19 guideline. During this period, we have tallied 9 cases of COVID-19 infection (0,71%) in cancer patients as well as 3 cases (1,66%) in health workers. The mortality rate of our cancer patients was 22%, consistent with the data reported in literature. In conclusion, following our practical health vigilance recommendations, physicians should be confident in maintaining life-saving anticancer treatment without exceedingly increasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection. The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screen for COVID-19 infection.

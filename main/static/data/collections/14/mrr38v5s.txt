PURPOSE NASHA Dx gel has been used extensively for treatments in the field of urology. This study was performed to evaluate NASHA Dx gel as an injectable anal canal implant for the treatment of fecal incontinence. METHODS Thirty-four patients (5 males, 29 females; median age, 61 years; range, 34 to 80) were injected with 4 x 1 ml of NASHA Dx gel, just above the dentate line in the submucosal layer. The primary end point was change in the number of incontinence episodes and a treatment response was defined as a 50 percent reduction compared with pretreatment. All patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS The median number of incontinence episodes during four weeks was 22 (range, 2 to 77) before treatment, at 6 months it was 9 (range, 0 to 46), and at 12 months it was 10 (range, 0 to 70, P = 0.004). Fifteen patients (44 percent) were responders at 6 months, compared with 19 (56 percent) at 12 months. No long-term side effects or serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS Submucosal injection of NASHA Dx gel is an effective treatment for fecal incontinence. The effect is sustained for at least 12 months. The treatment is associated with low morbidity.

Predominantly antibody deficiencies (PADs) are the most frequent forms of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Commonly accompanied with complications involving several body systems, immunoglobulin substitution therapy along with prophylactic antibiotics remained the cornerstone of treatment for PADs and related complications. Patients with respiratory complications should be prescribed an appropriate therapy as soon as possible and have to be adhering to more and longer medical therapies. Recent studies identified a gap for screening protocols to monitor respiratory manifestations in patients with PADs. In the present chapter, the pulmonary manifestations of different PADs for each have been discussed. The chapter is mainly focused on X-linked agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, activated PI3K-Î´ syndrome, LRBA deficiency, CD19 complex deficiencies, CD20 deficiency, other monogenic defects associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, immunoglobulin class switch recombination deficiencies affecting B-cells, transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, and selective IgA deficiency.

Since the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the use of convalescent plasma as a possible treatment has been explored. Here we describe our experience as the first US organization creating a COVID‐19 convalescent plasma program to support compassionate use through the single patient emergency IND, the National Expanded Access Program and multiple randomized control trials. Within weeks, we were able to distribute over 8000 products, scale up collections to over 4,000 units per week, meet hospital demand, as well as support randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment. This was through strategic planning, re‐deployment of staff, and active engagement of hospital, community, and public health partners. Our partners helped with donor recruitment, testing, patient advocacy, and patient availability. The program will continue to evolve as we learn more about optimizing the product. Remaining issues to be resolved are antibody titers, dose, and at what stage of disease to transfuse.

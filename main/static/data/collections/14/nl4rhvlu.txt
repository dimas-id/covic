Summary Objective Public health surveillance applications are central to the collection, analysis and dissemination of disease and health information. As these applications evolve and mature, it is evident that many of these applications must address similar requirements, such as policies, security and flexibility. It is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements. Methods We outline the requirements for a public health surveillance application, and define a set of common components to address these requirements. These components are configured to produce services used in the development of public health applications. Results A layered software architecture, the ALPHA architecture, has been developed to support the development of public health applications. The architecture has been used to build eleven surveillance applications for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the areas of disease surveillance, survey, distributed data collection and inventory management. Conclusions We have found that a software architecture that addresses requirements on policies, security and flexibility facilitates the development of configurable public health applications. By creating this architecture, key success factors, such as reducing cost and time-to-market of applications, adapting to changing surveillance targets and increasing user efficiency are achieved.

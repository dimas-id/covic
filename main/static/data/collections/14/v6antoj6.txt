Molecular biological testing has become a mainstay in the repertoire of infectious disease diagnostics like in no other field of medicine. Direct pathogen detection primarily relies upon two main methods: the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunochromatography â€“ often supplied as test strips or test cards. Alongside pathogen detection, the PCR method has the advantage that it can simultaneously analyze resistance determinants and/or virulence factors. In the age of multidrug-resistant (nosocomial) pathogens, rapid and reliable molecular biological differentiation is becoming increasingly important given the urgency indicated to effectively isolate affected patients at the earliest possible chance.

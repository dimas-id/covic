BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a life-threatening illness, which represents a challenge to all health care workers. Neurosurgeons worldwide are affected in different ways. OBJECTIVE: This is the first study regarding the readiness of neurosurgery residents for the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. The aim is to identify the level of knowledge and readiness and the impact of this virus among neurosurgery residents in different programs. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed in which 52 neurosurgery residents from different centers were selected to complete a questionnaire-based survey. The questionnaire comprised 3 sections and 27 questions that ranged from knowledge to impact of the pandemic on various features. RESULTS: The median knowledge score was 4 out of 5. The proportion of participants with a satisfactory level of knowledge was 60%. There was a statistically significant difference between the knowledge score and location of the program. Around 48% of the neurosurgery residents dealt directly with patients with COVID-19. Receiving a session about personal protective equipment was reported by 57.7%. Neurosurgery training at the hospital was affected. About 90% believed that this pandemic had influenced their mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery residents have a relatively good knowledge about COVID-19. The location of the program was associated with knowledge level. Most participants did not receive sufficient training about personal protective equipment. Almost all responders agreed that their training at the hospital had been affected. Further studies are needed to study the impact of this pandemic on neurosurgery residents.

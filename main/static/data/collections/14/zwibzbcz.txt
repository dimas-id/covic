Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is a biomarker for the early detection of renal diseases in humans. It is secreted along with cytotoxic oxidation products from proximal tubular epithelial cells under conditions of ischemia and/or oxidative stress. This study examined urinary L-FABP excretion under renal ischemia in feline acute kidney injury (AKI) model. L-FABP excretion increased immediately after renal ischemia/reperfusion, despite the absence of obvious structural damage to the kidneys, in the two AKI model cats studied. L-FABP was detected in the renal tubular lumen immediately after renal ischemia/reperfusion in the two cats, but not in a sham surgery cat. These results suggested that high L-FABP excretion is a pathophysiological response associated with antioxidant defense in proximal tubules with renal ischemia and/or oxidative stress in a feline model.

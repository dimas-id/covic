This chapter provides an overview of both benign and malignant pleural disorders, starting with the relevant anatomy and physiology. The focus is on the management of pneumothoraces and pleural effusionsâ€”conditions that are commonly encountered on a general thoracic surgery service. The pleural cavity is lined by parietal and visceral pleura, which are smooth membranes that are continuous with one another at the hilum and pulmonary ligaments. Parietal Pleura: innermost chest wall layer, divided into cervical, costal, mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleura.

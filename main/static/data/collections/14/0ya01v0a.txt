Abstract Atomic force microscope (AFM)-based nanomanufacturing, as a low-cost and easy-to-setup technique, enables high-resolution maskless nanofabrication processes for arbitrary nanopatterns, but there are strong needs to advance the nanopatterning processes. Thermal-mechanical AFM-based nanomachining process lower the normal forces to few hundreds of nanonewtons, but it requires special thermal probes. Vibration-assisted nanomachining process increases the tip lifetime but forces are still in the range of few hundreds of nanonewtons. We have innovated a system with both vibration and heated sample to achieve nanomachining process with lower normal forces. To provide cantilever selection guidance for this novel nanomachining system and to understand the effect of cantilever stiffness and sample temperature on feature dimensions, we used both soft and stiff probes for the nanomachining processes in this paper. We fabricated nanostructures with controllable shape dimensions were fabricated on 200 nm depth polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films by using both soft and stiff AFM probes with a few tens of nanonewtons normal forces in this novel AFM-based nanomachining system. Besides, we analyzed the effects of different machining parameters on the lithography performance, which helps to understand the machining parameters for fabricating nanopatterns of different dimensions. We also found that other than the setpoint force, the probe category and sample heating temperature significantly affect the dimensions of fabricated nanopatterns. And there is a statistically significant interaction effect between the spring constants of probes and the sample temperatures.

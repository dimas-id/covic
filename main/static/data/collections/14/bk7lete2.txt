Abstract Population genetic diversity plays a prominent role in viral evolution, pathogenesis, immune escape, and drug resistance. Different mechanisms are responsible for creating and maintaining genetic diversity in viruses, including error-prone replication, repair avoidance, and genome editing, among others. This diversity is subsequently modulated by natural selection and random genetic drift, whose action in turn depends on multiple factors including viral genetic architecture, viral demography, and ecology. Understanding these processes should contribute to the development of more efficient control and treatment strategies against viral pathogens.

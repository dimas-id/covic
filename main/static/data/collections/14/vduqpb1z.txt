Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a serious health problem. The obstacles for limiting this infection are the lack of public awareness on this issue, especially owing to the asymptomatic nature of CMV infections, the inefficacy of therapy, and the unsuccessful vaccine trials to date. It is therefore important to organize the current data to estimate the results and to report that the development of a vaccine against CMV must be of the highest priority.

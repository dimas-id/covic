Clinical progress in the field of HER2-positive breast cancer therapy has been dramatically improved by understanding of the immune regulatory mechanisms of tumor microenvironment. Passive immunotherapy utilizing recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), particularly trastuzumab and pertuzumab has proved to be an effective strategy in HER2-positive breast cancer treatment. However, resistance to mAb therapy and relapse of disease are still considered important challenges in clinical practice. There are increasing reports on the induction of cellular and humoral immune responses in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. More recently, increasing efforts are focused on using HER2-derived peptide vaccines for active immunotherapy. Here, we discuss the development of various HER2-derived vaccines tested in animal models and human clinical trials. Different formulations and strategies to improve immunogenicity of the antigens in animal studies are also discussed. Furthermore, other immunotherapeutic approaches to HER2 breast cancer including, CTLA-4 inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are presented.

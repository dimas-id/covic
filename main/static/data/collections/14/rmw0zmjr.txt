BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Although intracranial atherosclerotic disease is often encountered during endovascular treatment for acute vertebrobasilar occlusions, its clinical implication is not well-known. We aimed to evaluate whether intracranial atherosclerotic disease influences the clinical outcomes following endovascular treatment of acute vertebrobasilar occlusive stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-one patients with acute vertebrobasilar occlusive stroke were included. The onset-to-groin puncture time was â‰¤12 hours, and aspiration- or stent-based thrombectomy was used as the primary treatment method. Following primary endovascular treatment, intracranial atherosclerotic disease (IAD group) was angiographically diagnosed when a fixed focal stenosis was observed at the occlusion site, whereas embolism (embolic group) was diagnosed if no stenosis was observed. Clinical and treatment variables were compared in both groups, and IAD was evaluated as a prognostic factor for clinical outcomes. RESULTS The baseline NIHSS score tended to be lower (14 versus 22, P = .097) in the IAD group (n = 19) than in the embolic group (n = 32). The procedural time was longer in the IAD group (96 versus 61 minutes, P = .002), despite similar rates of TICI 2b-3 (89.5% versus 87.5%, P = 1.000). The NIHSS score at 7 days was higher (21 versus 8, P = .060) and poor outcomes (mRS 4-6 at 3 months) were more frequent in the IAD group (73.7% versus 43.8%, P = .038). IAD (odds ratio, 5.469; 95% CI, 1.09-27.58; P = .040) was independently associated with poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS An arterial occlusion related to IAD was associated with a longer procedural time and poorer clinical outcome. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the appropriate endovascular strategy.

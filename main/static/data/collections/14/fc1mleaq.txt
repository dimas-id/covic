INTRODUCTION More than 20% of patients are malnourished after hospitalisation. Malnutrition may negatively impact patients' outcomes as it increases the risk of complications, morbidity, mortality and loss of function. However, hospital-initiated transitional care can improve some outcomes in hospitalised adult patients. The objective of this scoping review is to map the literature that assesses the effectiveness of individualised nutritional care plans to reduce malnutrition during hospitalisation and for the first 3 months after discharge. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol is based on the framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley. The search strategy was developed by a medical librarian. We will search for relevant literature from the following databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Embase. We will also search the reference lists of included studies. Two independent reviewers will screen abstracts and full articles in parallel, from the included studies using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols checklist facilitated the preparation of this research protocol. The scoping review will provide a narrative account of the findings from the existing literature through thematic content analysis of the extracted literature. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Since all data will be obtained from publicly available materials, research ethics approval is not required for this scoping review. The research findings will be submitted for publication in a relevant open-access peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences.

Distemper and rabies vaccination are highly recommended because of the almost invariable fatal outcome of these conditions. Vaccination should constitute an important part of a ferret's preventative medicine program. With the current and anticipated development and licensing of new vaccines, practitioners are invited to gain awareness of the latest vaccine information. Establishment of a practice vaccination protocol with regards to the site of administration of rabies and distemper vaccines is paramount to document any future abnormal tissue reactions. Influenza is the most common zoonotic disease that is seen in ferrets. Although it generally is benign in most ferrets, veterinarians must take this condition seriously. The characteristic continuous antigenic variation of this virus may lead to more virulent strains; the recent emergence of avian influenza virus outbreaks; and the increased susceptibility of elderly, young, and immunosuppressed individuals.

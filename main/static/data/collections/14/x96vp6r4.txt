In patients with specific dermatologic disorders who are affected by new corona virus, we know little about disease course (underlying disease and new onset infection), and the most proper management strategies include both issues that are what this systematic review targets. Databases of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Medscape, and Centre of Evidence-Based Dermatology, coronavirus dermatology resource of Nottingham University searched completely up to May 15, 2020, and initial 237 articles were selected to further review and finally 9 articles (including 12 patients) entered to this study. From 12 patients with chronic underlying dermatologic disease treated with systemic therapies, only 1 patient required Intensive Care Unit admission, the others have been treated for mild-moderate symptoms with conventional therapies. The biologic or immunosuppressive/immunomodulator agents have been ceased during the course of disease. The course of coronovirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) and its management was as similar as normal populations. Their underlying dermatologic disease were exacerbating from mild to moderate. Their treatment has been continued as before, after the symptoms improved. Exacerbation of patients underlying dermatologic disease was mild to moderate. Discontinuing the treatment in the acute period of COVID and the restart after recovery may prevent severe recurrence and disturbing cytokine storms in these patients.

Cynomolgus macaques are widely used as a primate model for human diseases associated with an immunological process. Because there are individual differences in immune responsiveness, which are controlled by the polymorphic nature of the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, it is important to reveal the diversity of MHC in the model animal. In this study, we analyzed 26 cynomolgus macaques from five families for MHC class I genes. We identified 32 Mafa-A, 46 Mafa-B, 6 Mafa-I, and 3 Mafa-AG alleles in which 14, 20, 3, and 3 alleles were novel. There were 23 MHC class I haplotypes and each haplotype was composed of one to three Mafa-A alleles and one to five Mafa-B alleles. Family studies revealed that there were two haplotypes which contained two Mafa-A1 alleles. These observations demonstrated further the complexity of MHC class I locus in the Old World monkey.

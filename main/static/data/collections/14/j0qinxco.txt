Never in history has the fabric of African neurosurgery been challenged as it is today with the advent of the novel coronavirus identified in 2019 (COVID-19). Even the most robust and resilient neurosurgical educational systems in the continent have been brought to their knees with neurosurgical trainees and young neurosurgeons bearing the brunt. In the face of this new reality, and in order to limit the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, multiple programs have implemented physical distancing to reduce in-person interactions. In some cases, residents have been asked to stay home at least until they are instructed otherwise. This unfortunate event presents an innovative opportunity for neurosurgical education in Africa. Herein, we detail the framework of an online neurosurgical education initiative to advance the education of African residents and young neurosurgeons during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

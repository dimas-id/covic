In China, the patients with previously negative RT-PCR results again test positive during the post-discharge isolation period. We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of these recurrent-positive patients. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 15 recurrent-positive patients and 107 control patients with non-recurrent, moderate COVID-19 treated in Wuhan, China. Clinical data and laboratory results were comparatively analyzed. We found that recurrent-positive patients had moderate disease. The rate of recurrent-positive disease in our hospital was 1.87%. Recurrent-positive patients were significantly younger (43(35-54) years) than control patients (60(43-69) years) (P=0.011). The early LOS (length of stay in hospital before recurrence) was significantly longer in recurrent-positive patients (36(34-45) days) than in control patients (15(7-30) days) (P =0.001). The time required for the first conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative was significantly longer in recurrent-positive patients (14(10-17) days) than in control patients (6(3-9) days) (P =0.011). Serum COVID-19 antibody levels were significantly lower in recurrent-positive patients than in control patients (IgM: 13.69 {+/-} 4.38 vs. 68.10 {+/-} 20.85 AU/mL, P = 0.015; IgG: 78.53 {+/-} 9.30 vs. 147.85 {+/-} 13.33 AU/mL, P < 0.0001). Recurrent-positive patients were younger than control patients. The early LOS (length of stay in hospital before recurrence) was significantly longer in recurrent-positive group than that in control group. COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in recurrent-positive group than those in control group, which might explain why the virus RNA RT-PCR was positive after the initial clinical cure(with three times of virus RNA RT-PCR negative). The virus might not be fully eliminated because of the lower IgG level and their later replicating might result in recurrent-positive virus RNA RT-PCR.

Susceptibility to viral infection, development of immunity, response to treatment and patient clinical outcomes are all under the control of heritable factors in the host. In the context of the current SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, this review considers existing immunogenetic knowledge of virus-immune system interactions. A major focus is to highlight areas in which work is required in order to improve understanding of antiviral immune responses and to move towards improved patient management.

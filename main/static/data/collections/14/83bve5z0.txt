With the arrival of the coronavirus disease (SARS‐CoV‐2) in the United States, care practice paradigms have drastically changed. Data from China suggest that the new virus poses additional risks as case fatality of patients with cancer was higher at 5.6% compared to 2.3% of the general population. There are three proposed major strategies to address care for patients with cancer in this SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic with postponing treatment for those with stable cancer, increasing personal protection provisions for patients with cancer, and increasing monitoring if a patient becomes infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. In this present commentary, we discuss the unique mental health challenges and burdens of patients with head and neck cancer in the times of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and approaches to mitigate these stressors through telemedicine to reduce future burdens to the patient and the health care system.

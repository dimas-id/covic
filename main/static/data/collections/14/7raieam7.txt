Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 numerous antibody assays have become available, demonstrating different performance characteristics. This study focused on a quantitative correlation between different commercial assays and a neutralization test (NT). Comparative data is needed as a basis for the production of convalescent plasma and potential interpretations COVID-19 immunity. Sera of 100 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors were collected and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were characterized using three different IgG-ELISAs EUROIMMUN IgG and NCP-IgG ELISA, Wantai ELISA), two CLIA (Elecsys, LIAISON) and two lateral flow tests (MEDsan IgM/IgG-Rapid-Test, Wantai Rapid Test) and subsequently correlated to neutralization titers. The Wantai ELISA and the Elecsys provide the highest sensitivities in this sample (98 and 95 percent respectively). Titers with the best overall quantitative correlation to the NT titer were obtained with the Euroimmun IgG ELISA assay (Rho=0.759) and the Wantai ELISA assay (Rho=0.729). An infection without fever and negative or weakly positive reactions in the Wantai Rapid test were negative predictive factors for NT titers >1:200 (negative predictive value of 92% and 92% respectively, combination of both 100%). The Wantai ELISA titer could be a suitable substitute for NT. An adequate pooling strategy of plasma units additionally could compensate deviations of individual antibody titers.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the cerebral outcomes of patients underwent novel triple-branched stent graft implantation combined with the intraoperative monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation. METHODS One hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients who underwent the surgery of triple-branched stent graft implantation in our department were enrolled in this retrospective case-control study. The patients in group A received brain protection based on the intraoperative monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation and the patients in group B received conventional brain protection. The general clinical data, the types of corrective surgeries, the intraoperative situations, the postoperative complications, and the midterm outcomes of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS The incidence of postoperative cerebral dysfunction in the patients of group A was significantly lower than that in the patients in group B (3.2% vs 14.9%, P = .020). We found significant differences in the incubation times (30.3 ± 22.1 vs 42.3 ± 27.9 hours, P = .014), the lengths of intensive care unit stay (58.0 ± 54.3 vs 79.7 ± 55.5 hours, P = .004), and the hospital stays (19.3 ± 6.7 vs 24.9 ± 17.3 days, P = .045). A descending trend in the mortality rates was observed between the patients in the two groups based on the 20 months of observation; however, this trend was not statistically significant (1.6% vs 6.8%, P = .218). CONCLUSIONS The novel triple-branched stent graft implantation procedure combined with intraoperative monitoring of the regional cerebral oxygen saturation was an effective treatment for Stanford type A aortic dissection, with a relatively low incidence of postoperative cerebral dysfunction.

OBJECTIVES Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, all surgical activity that was not life threatening was cancelled , as well as most face-to-face consultations. Currently the beginning of the de-escalation phases that will led us to a new normal, forces us to establish some degree of priority in the interventions as well as in the medical consultations. Our objective is to establish some recommendation on Functional Urology office visits and surgical interventions that serve as a tool to facilitate decision-making. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experts in Functional Urology from different autonomous communities of Spain were contacted to design a strategy to reorganize the activity of both, diagnosis and treatment. A modified nominal group technique has been used due to the extraordinary restrictions of assembly and mobility during the COVID pandemic. The first signer (EMC) made the first draft with the measures adopted and the strategy to be followed during the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposal was sent to the rest of the authors, in order to unify criteria and experiences to reach a quick consensus on the relative priority of the different activities, problems and solutions. A final version was approved by all authors May 27, 2020. RESULTS: Tables of recommendation have been prepared for outpatient consultation, surgical and technical interventions, according to de-escalation phases proposed by the Spanish Associations of Surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: The change that COVID-19 Pandemich as involved in our clinical practice force us to seek alternative methods to treat our patients, some of which may already be established. Mean while, a consensusin decision making is necessary. Documents such as the current one, are intended to guide the management of patients with urological functional pathology in exceptional situations. Logically, it should be adapted to material and human availability, and to the idiosyncrasy of each Urology service.

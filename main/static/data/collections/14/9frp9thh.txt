Communication is an essential part of life in science. It is about explaining the importance of work to grant panels, funding agencies, and project reviewers; publishing research; and informing and educating the public. It is also involved in building relationships, bringing and keeping teams together, and becoming recognized. This chapter highlights the essentials of communication. The ability to communicate effectively is not an innate quality that one either does or does not possess. It is a set of skills that can be learned and developed, regardless of one's starting point. While some people seem more naturally adept than others, through conscious effort, practice, and constructive feedback, everyone can improve. Being able to speak knowledgeably and fluently is important for effective communication, especially at the beginning of any conversation or presentation because it sets the tone, and can positively influence self-confidence. An important strategy for increasing preparedness and effectiveness as a communicator is to commit to the continual development of skills. Another way to influence how to communicate successfully is to understand the audience—the “receivers” of the message—and to use the information to make the best “connection.”

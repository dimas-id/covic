ABSTRACT Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is responsible for the majority of morbidity, mortality, and production losses occurring in feedlots. This experiment evaluated the effects of BRD incidence on subsequent finishing performance, efficiency, carcass characteristics, and lung scores of steers. Crossbred steers (n = 516) were monitored daily for clinical signs of BRD (BRD attributed morbidity and mortality were 66.5 and 13.2%, respectively). A subset of calves (n = 174) were grouped by the number of times treated for BRD (BRDX) and randomly allocated to finishing pens. The BRDX experimental groups included never treated for BRD (0X; 8 pens) and treated 1 time (1X; 8 pens), 2 times (2X; 8 pens), or 3 or 4 times (3/4X; 8 pens). Arrival BW was not different among BRDX groups (P = 0.17); however, BRDX during the receiving period decreased performance, resulting in BW of 324, 316, 285, and 260 kg for 0X, 1X, 2X, and 3/4X, respectively, at the start of finishing (P < 0.001). Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common body composition (average days on feed = 182). With increasing BRDX, days on feed increased linearly (P = 0.002), whereas HCW, DP, rib eye area, QG, and unconsolidated lungs decreased linearly (P â‰¤ 0.03). These results suggest that with additional days on feed, calves treated multiple times for BRD are able to reach similar compositional endpoints as their untreated cohorts; however, it may not be possible for these calves to reach the same QG and carcass yield.

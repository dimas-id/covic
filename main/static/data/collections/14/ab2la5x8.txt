PURPOSE A persistent seroma located posterior to a mesh (PPS) remains a little known complication after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). The aim of this large case series was to analyse the prevalence and clinical course as well as identify related factors and independent predictors of PPS. METHODS All 1288 adult patients who underwent a LVHR with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (ePTFE) between January 2003 and July 2014 were reviewed. Those who underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan more than 3 months afterwards (n = 166) were included and their scans were analysed. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of a PPS and its characteristics. The secondary outcome measures were identification of significantly related factors and independent predictors of PPS. RESULTS A PPS was observed in 14 of 166 analysed CT scans (8.4%). Eleven patients were symptomatic; conservative treatment (wait-and-see policy) was successful in eight. Three underwent relaparoscopy with removal of a thick neoperitoneum. Several instances of tack and/or mesh detachment were identified on CT scans and during relaparoscopy. Independent predictors were: > 3 trocars (RR 5.0, 95% CI 1.6-15.8) and use of a mesh larger than > 300 cm2 (RR 9.9, 95% CI 1.9-51.2). CONCLUSIONS A PPS is a relatively common complication after LVHR with an ePTFE mesh of usually larger hernias. A "wait-and-see" approach seems justified in most cases. Some require laparoscopic excision of the thick neoperitoneum. A PPS can cause tack and mesh detachment but the clinical consequences are unclear. Recurrences have not been observed in this series.

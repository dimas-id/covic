Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a causative agent of respiratory and enteric diseases in cattle and calves. BCoV infection was also evident in captive wild ruminants. Recently, water deer are recognized as the most common wildlife to approach farmhouses and livestock barns in Korea. Therefore, we investigated 77 nasal swab samples from non‐captive wild water deer (Hydropotes inermis) between November 2016 and September 2017 and identified three samples positive for coronavirus, indicating potential for respiratory shedding. The full genomic sequences of the water deer coronavirus were closely related to BCoV (>98%). Therefore, effective biosecurity system in bovine farms would be necessary to prevent contact between farm ruminants and free‐ranging wild water deer.

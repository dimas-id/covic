The novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) continuous to spread around the globe causing high mortality, tremendous stress on healthcare systems and an unprecedented disruption of everyday life with unpredictable socioeconomic ramifications. The diseaseis typically affecting the respiratory system and some patients will develop refractory hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. The role of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or continuous positive airway pressure devices (C-PAP) in the treatment of the 2019 corona virus disease (COVID-19) is not yet clear. We hereby report a case of a 44-year-old COVID-19 positive male patient suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure that was successfully treated with high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in a negative pressure intensive care room. Although specific criteria for the use of high flow nasal canula devices COVID-19 are not available at this time, clinicians could use this non-invasive modality as analternative method of respiratory support in selected patients presenting with respiratory failure.

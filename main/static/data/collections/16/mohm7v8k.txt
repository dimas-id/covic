BACKGROUND Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a challenging complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJA), and the diagnostic criteria remains controversial. The 2018 new definition proposed in May 2018 consists of new diagnostic criteria for PJI. We conducted a retrospective study and demonstrated that the new definition could improve the diagnostic efficiency in Chinese patients. However, missing data led to bias in the previous retrospective study. Therefore, this prospective study is designed to further validate the feasibility of 2018 new definition (and its modified version) for Chinese patients. METHODS/DESIGN This is a single-centre, prospective diagnostic study with 1 year of follow-up. The patients enrolled in the trial will be divided into a PJI group and an Aseptic group based on the eligibility criteria. We will recruit at least 70 patients for each group from October 2019 to October 2020. Blood samples, synovial fluid samples and intraoperative variables of all the included patients will be collected to assess various indicators. We will integrate the results of the various tests and examine the diagnostic efficiency (sensitivity and specificity) of five diagnostic criteria. DISCUSSION We design the prospective study in the hope of reducing the bias caused by missing data. Therefore, the prospective study will further support the conclusion of our preceding retrospective study. The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION Through this prospective study, we will validate the feasibility of the 2018 new PJI definition (and its modified version) for Chinese patients and determine the optimal method of PJI diagnosis.

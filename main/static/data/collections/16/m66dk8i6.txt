We present a simple Prolog prover for intuitionistic modal logics based on nested sequent proof systems. We have implemented single-conclusion systems (Gentzen-style) and multi-conclusion systems (Maehara-style) for all logics in the intuitionistic modal IS5-cube. While the single-conclusion system are better investigated and have an internal cut-elimination, the multi-conclusion systems can provide a countermodel in case the proof search fails. To our knowledge this is the first automated theorem prover for intuitionistic modal logics. For wider usability, we also implemented classical normal modal logics in the S5-cube.

Abstract Feeding dairy cattle utilize the sciences of nutrition, biochemistry, and microbiology and combine them with animal husbandry. In this chapter, we will discuss the nutrients and how they are integral for dairy cattle performance (growth and milk production). We will evaluate the feeding of calves and heifers along with some brief practical feeding recommendations for dry and prepartum cows.

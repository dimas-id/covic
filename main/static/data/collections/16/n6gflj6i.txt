OBJECTIVES Hypercholesterolaemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Tocotrienols reportedly possess hypocholesterolaemic activity. This study examined the effect of tocotrienols (T3) in TOCOVIDTM Suprabio TM on serum lipids. Patients and Methods :A randomised (2:1), open-label study of patients with mild hypercholesterolaemia (= 5.18mmol/L to <7.77mmol/L) and one additional cardiovascular risk factor was carried out. Subjects received either tocotrienols (as TOCOVIDTM Suprabio TM ) (n=28) or vitamin E (a-tocopherol) 500mg daily (n=16). Fasting lipids were compared at baseline and after 4 weeks therapy. RESULTS Following 4 weeks therapy, mean +/- SD total cholesterol declined significantly in the tocotrienol group (from 6.10+/-0.66 to 5.47+/-1.16; P=0.02) compared to the a-tocopherol group (from 5.92+/-0.52 to 5.47+/-0.76; P>0.05). Mean LDL-C levels (mmol/L) were also significantly reduced in the tocotrienol group (3.82+/-0.85 to 3.24+/-1.26; P=0.04), but not in those on a-tocopherol (3.84+/-0.75 to 3.28+/-0.94; P>0.05). There were no significant changes in HDL-C and triglycerides in both groups. The tocotrienol group experienced a net decline in TG (7.1+/-31.4 %; P>0.05) while the a-tocopherol group had a net increase at week 4 (38.6+/-61.7%; P>0.05). CONCLUSION The study adds to existing evidence of the favourable effect of tocotrienols on total cholesterol and LDL-C. However, the results need further evaluation.

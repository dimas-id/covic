Abstract COVID19 shutdowns have impacted nursing education, particularly student clinical experiences. We discuss how we adapted an accelerated MSN nursing administration clinical course to meet the needs of our practicing students and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) standards in the context of the COVID19 pandemic. Resources available through the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) were utilized. Students reported a supportive, valuable learning experience they could apply in their future practice as nurse leaders. Considerations for future revisions to the course and to the AONL Guiding Principles are also presented.

SARS virus is a recently found coronavirus, which cause human atypical pneumonia through the binding of its spike protein to the receptor on human cells. By using the methods of immunoinformatics, we analyzed the virus surface protein and found that the epitopes, which can be recognized by human immune system, are strikingly changed or disappeared to compare with other common human coronavirus. This result may imply that the escape of SARS virus from human immune surveillance may be the causality plays a very of SARS virus infection. The immunoinformatics is a powerful fool for us to in screen the epitope specificial for SARS virus and identifying the candidate sites for peptide vaccine of SARS virus.

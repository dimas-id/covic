In this review on respiratory assistance, we aim to discuss the following recent advances: the optimization and customization of mechanical ventilation, the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, and the role of noninvasive ventilation. The prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury and diaphragmatic dysfunction is now a key aspect in the management of mechanical ventilation, since these complications may lead to higher mortality and prolonged length of stay in intensive care units. Different physiological measurements, such as esophageal pressure, electrical activity of the diaphragm, and volumetric capnography, may be useful objective tools to help guide ventilator assistance. Companies that design medical devices including ventilators and respiratory monitoring platforms play a key role in knowledge application. The creation of a ventilation consortium that includes companies, clinicians, researchers, and stakeholders could be a solution to promote much-needed device development and knowledge implementation.

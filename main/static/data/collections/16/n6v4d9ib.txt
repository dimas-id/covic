Education tools and programs using interactive digital content, distributed on the internet, are increasingly becoming an integral part of postgraduate medical education. The coronavirus pandemic and global lockdown hoisted a major challenge for traditional teaching courses. A timely solution is to focus attention and reinforce web-based teaching programs. For more than 15 years, the ILAE has been developing and managing a wide range of e-learning programs. This paper provides an overview on the e-learning portfolio of the ILAE, including tutored e-courses, self-paced interactive e-courses and online multimedia resources, all linked to the ILAE curriculum and learning objectives addressing specific levels of professional experience. All e-learning programs will become available through the new ILAE Academy platform (www.ilae-academy.org), in July 2020. E-learning is an important tool for reaching the global educational mission of the ILAE.

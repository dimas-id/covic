BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an emerging issue that has significant consequences on psycho-social well-being. METHODS: In this regard, a survey was conducted on a large group of adolescents in Italy. The survey investigated four items: concerns and fears, information on the pandemic, provisions of public authorities (e.g., lockdown), and impact on everyday life. RESULTS: Adolescents actively participated in the survey. COVID-19 affected emotions and lifestyle. COVID-19 influenced relationships with peers and parents. There were regional differences. CONCLUSIONS: The current research highlighted the remarkable, healthy, and certainly unexpected, emotional balance of the new generations in the face of a sudden, unpredictable phenomenon capable of jeopardizing life itself. While understanding the gravity of the phenomenon and willingly adapting to all the necessary precautions, the adolescents still seemed to express an excellent ability to manage situations of insecurity and to deal with unfavorable and adverse conditions by adapting to the new routine and finding alternative and innovative means of meeting their social and psychological needs.

Abstract Backgrounds The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a large outbreak of coronavirus disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China since December 2019. The COVID-19 soon spread to other regions of China and overseas. In Hong Kong, local mitigation measures have been implemented since the first imported case was confirmed on January 23, 2020. Here we evaluated the temporal variation of detection delay from symptoms onset to laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong. Methods A regression model is adopted to quantify the association between the SARS-CoV-2 detection delay and the calendar time. The association is tested and further validated by a Cox proportional hazard model. Findings The estimated median detection delay was 9.5 days (95%CI: 6.5−11.5) in the second half of January, and reduced to 6.0 days (95%CI: 5.5−9.5) in the first half of February 2020. We estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency improves at a daily rate of 5.40% (95%CI: 2.54−8.33) in Hong Kong. Conclusion The detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 was likely being improved substantially in Hong Kong since the first imported case was detected. The sustaining enforcement in timely detection and other effective control measures are recommended to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

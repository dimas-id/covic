This paper is a short narrative on how feminism helped me find a balance in my life and how this balance has been disrupted with the Covid‚Äê19 crisis. I reflect on how this crisis is showing our vulnerabilities as human beings. This crisis reflects how our bodies depend on each other, moving away from the dominant patriarchal ontology that perceives bodies as being independent (Butler, 2016). I reflect on how this crisis is letting the most vulnerable in situations of survival because the infrastructures (Butler, 2016) that support our bodies are not functioning. At the same time, this crisis is providing visibility to certain occupations that are dominated by issues of race, class and gender. These occupations are being at least temporarily rehabilitated to their central position in society. We are living a time where we could show, through our teaching, possible resistance to the neoliberal ontology that captured humanity.

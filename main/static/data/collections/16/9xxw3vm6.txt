Introduction: There has been little systematic exploration of what affects timeliness of epidemic response, despite the potential for earlier responses to be more effective. Speculations have circulated that exposure to major epidemics helped health systems respond more quickly to COVID-19. This study leverages organizational memory theory to test whether health systems with any, more severe, more recent exposure to major epidemics enacted timelier COVID-19 policy responses. Methods: A dataset was constructed cataloguing 719 policies across 177 health systems in total, 12 of which had major epidemics within the last twenty years. Hypotheses testing used cluster robust regressions with WHO region fixed effects, controlling for several health system expenditure and political variables. Results: Results show that exposure to any major epidemics was nearly significant (p = 0.07) with approximately 20 days earlier response. As the number of total cases from major epidemics increase by one, this was associated with 0.0028 day earlier response (p < 0.001). A decrease of one year from last major epidemics was also associated with 0.4020 day earlier response (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that health systems do learn from past major epidemics. Policymakers ought to institutionalize lessons from COVID-19 to prevent erosion of organizational memory, and learn from other more severely affected health systems. Future studies can examine specific generalizable lessons and whether timelier responses correlated with lower health and economic impacts.

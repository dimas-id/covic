The novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) has limited traditional consultation and minimized healthcare access. Teledermatology has come to the rescue in this situation by extending consultation for non‐essential conditions to the comfort of patient's homes. This limits the risk of exposure of both doctors and patients to SARS‐Cov‐2. And while there is a reported increase in teleconsultations during the ongoing pandemic, there are some demerits that avert the shift to virtualized healthcare. The authors conducted an online survey to further understand the hesitancy, limitations, merits and the demographic of dermatologists who were conducive to teledermatology and this data was analysed and presented in this article. While teledermatology might never replace physical consultation, it definitely serves an adjunctive role in the post‐COVID‐era, provided adequate regulatory measures are in place.

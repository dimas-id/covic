The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to worldwide research aiming to identify the risk factors for developing critical illness and mortality caused by COVID-19. It quickly became apparent that besides older age, obesity is one of the most important risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19, although the mechanisms remain largely unknown [1-3]. Notably, with respect to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI), evidence is mounting that obesity is a risk factor for ARDS/ALI, but among people with ARDS/ALI, obesity is associated with better outcome, a phenomenon which has been called the "obesity paradox" [4,5].

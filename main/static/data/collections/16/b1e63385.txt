In the face of COVID-19 and necessary shifts in service delivery for behavior analysts, caregiver involvement in behavioral interventions will likely increase. Resources that caregivers can consume and implement independently are critical in helping them manage behavior in their homes. This article includes antecedent and consequent behavior-management strategies that correspond with provided written instructions and video tutorials designed for caregivers. The materials presented within this article were originally produced and found effective in aiding caregivers managing behavior in their homes within the Alabama foster care system. Although individuals within this system are at a higher risk of abuse and neglect and may engage in higher levels of aberrant behavior, we are distributing this document in hopes it will help behavior analysts working across a variety of populations as they navigate changes in service delivery and adopt resources for continued care and caregiver training.

BACKGROUND THUNDERBEAT® (TB) (Olympus Medical Systems Corp., Tokyo, Japan) is a dynamic energy system device that simultaneously delivers ultrasonically generated frictional heat energy and electrically generated bipolar energy. TB is being routinely used in various operative procedures, however, less is known about its utility in liver resection. We, herein, report our early experience of using TB in open liver resection particularly in patients with normal or near-normal liver parenchyma. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics, and evaluated the perioperative outcome of twenty-eight patients who underwent liver resection with TB, and twenty-four patients who underwent liver resection with basic procedure in our institution. The resection type was stratified into: major hepatectomy; resection of 3 or more than 3 Couinauds segments, and minor hepatectomy; resection of less than 3 Couinauds segments. RESULTS Liver resection time (mean ± SD) in TB group with major hepatectomy was significantly shorter: 16.7 ± 8.8 compared to 62.8 ± 39.4 min in basic procedure group (P < 0.0001). Accordingly, the liver resection time (mean ± SD) in TB group with minor hepatectomy was also significantly shorter, 8.3 ± 2.9 min compared to 45.2 ± 23.9 min in liver resection with basic procedure (P < 0.001). No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of intraoperative blood transfusion ratio, postoperative complication and postoperative liver dysfunction. CONCLUSION TB as a new energy device can offer a safe, reliable and substantially rapid liver resection particularly in patients with normal or near-normal liver parenchyma.

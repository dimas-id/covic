Mathematical predictions in combating the epidemics are yet to reach its perfection. The rapid spread, the ways, and the procedures involved in containment of a pandemic demand the earliest understanding in finding solutions in line with the habitual, physiological, biological, and environmental aspects of life with better computerised mathematical modeling and predictions. Epidemiology models are key tools in public health management programs despite having a high level of uncertainty in each one of these models. This paper describes the outcome and the challenges of SIR, SEIR, SEIRU, SIRD, SLIAR, ARIMA, SIDARTHE, etc models used in prediction of spread, peak, and reduction of Covid-19 cases.

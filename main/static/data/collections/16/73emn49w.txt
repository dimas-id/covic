The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), the COVID-19 disease cases stemming from it, and the resulting pandemic have imposed severe, distressing, physical, and psychological challenges on communities worldwide. The stressful situation faced by Chinese overseas students (COSs) has been particularly acute. With this population as the focus, the current study evaluated the psychological state of COSs abroad during the initial phases of the pandemic. Participants (N = 182) were recruited to complete an online survey (during April 7-14, 2020) assessing their physical and social circumstances, and sense of wellbeing. Results showed COSs experienced high levels of anxiety primarily stemming from discrimination from the media, fear of COVID-19, and mixed messages from their social connections. Feeling entrapped in a double bind (DbB) situation with their close relations significantly increased anxiety. Perceived social support negatively correlated with anxiety, and those experiencing a DbB felt the greatest stress, particularly those unable to effectively differentiate the opposing messages. Findings of the study, limitations, and implications are discussed.

The use of medicine in adults has been assessed by some population-based studies in Brazil, but to date there has been no overall estimate of the prevalence of drug consumption. We therefore aimed to estimate the prevalence of medicine use as measured in previously reported cross-sectional studies among Brazilian adults. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, searching in MEDLINE, Embase among others to a date ending January 2017. Two researchers selected the studies, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of those chosen for inclusion. The consumption prevalence were combined in meta-analyses, the heterogeneity measured by I2 and investigated by subgroup analyses and meta-regression. The search identified 4,005 publications, of which 14 were ultimately included in the study. Most studies (12/14) measured the consumption over the previous 15 days, finding a consumption prevalence of 49.1% (95% CI: 48.5-49.6%, I2 = 100%). The recall period explains part of the heterogeneity found (R2 = 23%, p = 0.048), however the subgroup analysis did not allow for more homogeneous results. The use of medications occurs among almost half of all Brazilian adults. Appropriate pharmaceutical assistance and care are necessary to ensure the rational use of these technologies.

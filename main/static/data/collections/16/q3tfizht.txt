During routine investigations on fish, a virus (isolate DF 24/00) with novel morphological features and hitherto undescribed morphogenesis was isolated from a white bream (Blicca bjoerkna L.; Teleostei, order Cypriniformes). Cell-free virions consist of a rod-shaped nucleocapsid (120-150x19-22 nm) similar to that seen in baculoviruses. The virion has a bacilliform shape (170-200x75-88 nm) reminiscent of rhabdoviruses with an envelope containing coronavirus-like spikes (20-25 nm). DF 24/00 replicated well in various fish cell lines. Inhibitor studies with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine indicated that the viral genome consists of RNA and chloroform sensitivity correlated with ultrastructural demonstration of enveloped virions. The buoyant density of the virus determined in sucrose was 1.17-1.19 g/ml. Preliminary biochemical characterization revealed the presence of six antigenic glycoproteins, three of which contain sugars with concanavalin-A specificity. Ultrastructurally, morphogenesis of virus progeny was detected only in the cytoplasm. Nucleocapsids were observed to bud through membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus into dilated vesicles. Egress of mature virions occurs primarily by exocytosis and, only very rarely, by budding directly at the plasma membrane. Morphologically similar viruses had previously been isolated from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), blue crab (Callinectis sapidus), European shore crab (Carcinus maenas) and shrimp (Penaeus monodon). To date, none of them has been classified. In summary, the first characterization of a new virus that might represent a member of a novel virus family that has morphological features resembling those found in rhabdo-, corona- and baculoviruses is presented.

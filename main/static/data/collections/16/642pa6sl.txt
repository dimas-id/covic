Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a secondary complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, resulting from uncontrolled high blood sugar. 30â€“40 % of diabetic patients develop DN associated with a poor life expectancy and end-stage renal disease, causing serious socioeconomic problems. Although an exact pathogenesis of DN is still unknown, several factors such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and proteinuria may contribute to the progression of renal damage in diabetic nephropathy. DN is confirmed by measuring blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and proteinuria. Clinical studies show that intensive control of hyperglycemia and blood pressure could successfully reduce proteinuria, which is the main sign of glomerular lesions in DN, and improve the renal prognosis in patients with DN. Diabetic rodent models have traditionally been used for doing research on pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic strategies, but have limitations for translational research. Diabetes in animal models such as rodents are induced either spontaneously or by using chemical, surgical, genetic, or other techniques and depicts many clinical features or related phenotypes of the disease. This review discusses the merits and demerits of the models, which are used for many reasons in the research of diabetes and diabetic complications.

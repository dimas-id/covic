Aim: To study the immunisation rates of veterans and war widows aged 70 years and above in New South Wales and Queensland, as part of the Preventive Care Trial. Method: A trained health care worker assessed subjects at home regarding health, illness and immunisation status. Results: Suboptimal immunisation rate for influenza (72%) and poor rates for pneumococcus (14%) and tetanus (43%) were detected. Conclusion: Subjects in this study were not immunised according to recommended guidelines. Further education campaigns are warranted to improve immunisation rates in older people.

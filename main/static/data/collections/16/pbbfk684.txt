PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gaining momentum in general surgery but it is essentially unstudied for laparoscopic colectomy. The aim of our study was to compare outcomes for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy with laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy were prospectively entered into an institutional review board-approved database. Those that underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy were case matched for sex, age, disease, surgery, body mass index, previous surgeries, and surgeon with patients undergoing LAC. RESULTS Twenty-nine single-incision laparoscopic segmental colectomies were performed for polyps (4), adenocarcinoma (12), diverticulitis (6), and Crohn's disease (7) and were case matched to laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for the same indications. Mean body mass index was 28.8 ± 3 kg/m². Operative time was longer for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (134.4 ± 40 vs 103.8 ± 54 min; P = .0002). Four single-incision laparoscopic colectomies were converted to LAC requiring either one extra port (2) or 2 extra ports (2), and there was one conversion to laparotomy. Extraction scar length (millimeters) was similar (38 ± 6.0 vs 45 ± 6.2; P = .746). Postoperative morbidity (5/29 vs 7/29; P = .284) and length of stay (day) (3.7 ± 1.1 vs 3.9 ± 1.1; P = .445) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is feasible and safe but takes more time than laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. Although results approximate those for laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, an additional learning curve is involved, and extra incisions are sometimes required. Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy requires further prospective validation so that the cost of the device can be justified by an improved clinical outcome.

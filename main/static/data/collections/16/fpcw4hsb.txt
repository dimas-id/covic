Research on crisis management has accumulated a vast body of knowledge that has assisted us with comprehending complex business and management phenomena. Yet, the existing studies have not paid sufficient attention to global challenges and sustainable development. We join the current conversation being conducted from the global challenges perspective of crisis management by suggesting that investigating global challenges and sustainable development can advance our collective understanding of crisis management in important ways. This article has three general objectives. First, we show that crisis management has been a long-standing issue in business and management research and provide an overview of the puzzles that informed and motivated this focussed issue. Second, we highlight the key insights and contributions made by the papers included in this focussed issue by reviewing their theoretical underpinnings, methodological approaches, and findings. Finally, we invite scholars to join the debate in order to move this important crisis management research agenda forward by tackling global challenges with the goal of achieving sustainable development.

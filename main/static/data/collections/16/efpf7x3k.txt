PURPOSE Patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) are living longer due in part to changing treatment patterns. It is important to understand how changing treatment patterns affect patients' lives beyond extending survival. Research suggests that direct patient report is the best way to capture information on how patients feel and function in response to their disease and its treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize evidence of patients' experience collected through patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in RRMM patients, and to explore PRO reporting quality. METHODS We conducted a systematic search to identify manuscripts reporting PROs in RRMM and summarized available evidence. We assessed PRO reporting quality using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO Extension checklist. RESULTS Our search resulted in 30 manuscripts. Thirteen unique PRO measures were used to assess 18 distinct PRO domains. Pain, fatigue, and emotional function were commonly assessed domains though reporting formats limited our ability to understand prevalence and severity of PRO challenges in RRMM. Evaluation of PRO reporting quality revealed significant reporting deficiencies. Several reporting criteria were included in less than 25% of manuscripts. CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence provides a limited window for understanding the patient experience of RRMM and is further limited by suboptimal reporting quality. Observational studies are needed to describe prevalence, severity and patterns of PROs in RRMM overtime. Future studies that incorporate PROs would benefit from following existing guidelines to ensure that study evidence and conclusions can be fully assessed by readers, clinicians and policy makers.

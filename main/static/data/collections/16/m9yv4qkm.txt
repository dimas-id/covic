Abstract In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, there is a growing need and demand for diagnostic tools that are complementary and different from the RT-PCR currently in use. Multiple serological tests are or will be very soon available but need to be evaluated and validated. We have thus tested 4 immunochromatographic tests for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR. We observed great heterogeneity in antiboy detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections. Thus, immunochromatographic tests for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have their place for the diagnostic panel of COVID-19.

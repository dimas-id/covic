The global emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has suddenly changed how we communicate with families in all the CoViD-19 care settings, due to the obligation to maintain complete social isolation. Healthcare workers are isolated from their families, and must manage the consequences of this isolation just like the patients. They and their families perceive the personal attitudes, closeness and psychological support from the care teams. This perception of genuine participation by the healthcare workers during isolation is especially important when a patient dies, and it may influence the process of grief. This document is intended for all healthcare professionals caring for CoViD-19 patients, particularly those in more severe clinical conditions and it is aimed to help the care team to communicate with families distanced from the patient. The document consists of three parts: 1) presentation of the statements for communicating with patients family members during isolation; 2) discussion of key points as a theoretical framework for the statements; 3) instructions for telephone communication, with a checklist and a worksheet. The document was written by authors from different disciplines (doctors, nurses, psychologists, legal experts) and was then reviewed by a group of experts comprising professionals, people who have experienced ICU hospitalization, and their families. Finally, the document was approved by the National Boards of the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SIAARTI), Italian Association of Critical Care Nurses (Aniarti), Italian Society of Emergency Medicine (SIMEU), and Italian Society of Palliative Care (SICP).

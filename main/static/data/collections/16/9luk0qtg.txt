Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide; they are mainly due to vascular obstructions which, in turn, are mainly caused by thrombi and atherosclerotic plaques. Although a variety of removal strategies has been developed for the considered obstructions, none of them is free from limitations and conclusive. The present paper analyzes the physical mechanisms underlying state-of-art removal strategies and classifies them into chemical, mechanical, laser and hybrid (namely chemo-mechanical and mechano-chemical) approaches, while also reviewing corresponding commercial/research tools/devices and procedures. Furthermore, challenges and opportunities for interventional micro/nanodevices are highlighted. In this spirit, the present review should support engineers, researchers active in the micro/nanotechnology field, as well as medical doctors in the development of innovative biomedical solutions for treating vascular obstructions. Data were collected by using the ISI Web of Knowledge portal, buyer's guides and FDA databases; devices not reported on scientific publications, as well as commercial devices no more for sale were discarded. Nearly 70% of the references were published since 2006, 55% since 2008; these percentages respectively raise to 85% and 65% as regards the section specifically reviewing state-of-art removal tools/devices and procedures.

BACKGROUND: A remarkably high incidence of VTE has been reported among critically ill patients with COVID-19 assisted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). However, VTE burden among non-ICU patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that receive guideline-recommended thromboprophylaxis is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of VTE among non-ICU patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that receive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: We performed a systematic screening for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by lower limb vein compression ultrasonography (CUS) in consecutive non-ICU patients hospitalized for COVID-19, independently of the presence of signs or symptoms of DVT. All patients were receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with either enoxaparin or fondaparinux. RESULTS: The population that we screened consisted of 84 consecutive patients, with a mean age of 67.6±13.5 years and a mean Padua Prediction Score of 5.1±1.6. Seventy-two patients (85.7%) had respiratory insufficiency, required oxygen supplementation, and had reduced mobility or were bedridden. In this cohort, we found 10 cases of DVT, with an incidence of 11.9% (95% CI 4.98-18.82). Of these, 2 were proximal DVT (incidence rate 2.4%, 95% CI -0.87-5.67) and 8 were distal DVT (incidence rate 9.5%, 95% CI 3.23-5.77). Significant differences between subjects with and without DVT were D-dimer >3,000 µg/L (P<0.05), current or previous cancer (P<0.05), and need of high flow nasal oxygen therapy and/or non-invasive ventilation (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: DVT may occur among non-ICU patients hospitalized for COVID-19, despite guideline-recommended thromboprophylaxis.

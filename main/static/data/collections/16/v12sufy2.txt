We aim to describe the prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in individuals admitted to a single centre with COVID-19. We identified 218 individuals hospitalised with COVID-19, of these four fulfilled criteria for DKA (4/218, 1.8%). We conclude DKA is common and severe in individuals hospitalised with COVID-19.

PURPOSE The safety and efficacy of the compression anastomosis ring (CAR™ 27) had been demonstrated by animal studies. This study was designed to evaluate clinical validity of the CAR™ 27 anastomosis in laparoscopic surgery for patients with left-sided colonic neoplasm. METHODS Intracorporeal anastomosis using the CAR™ 27 (CAR group) was performed in 66 patients (male 35; median age, 64.5 years), and short-term results were compared with consecutive 116 patients (male 70; median age, 64 years) where the anastomosis was constructed by double stapling technique using a circular stapler for the same indications (stapled group). RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, age, and distribution of pathologic lesion. The laparoscopic procedures, pathologic diagnosis/stage, and length of operation time and postoperative hospital stay were comparable between the two groups. Conversion rate in the CAR and stapled group was 3% and 6%, respectively. There was no surgical mortality in either group. No intraoperative complications associated with the CAR™ 27 anastomosis were encountered. One patient in the CAR group was complicated by anastomotic leakage and none in the stapled group (p = 0.36). There was intestinal obstruction in two patients, in whom one required re-operation for entrapped small bowel adhesions within pelvis. No patient in either group showed symptomatic anastomotic stricture. CONCLUSIONS The anastomosis using the CAR™ 27 is an innovative technique. The CAR™ 27 anastomosis in patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy for left-sided colonic tumor proved to be a safe and efficacious alternative to the standard double stapling technique.

Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in January, 2020, the fever of unknown origin (FUO) emergency department has become the first station for disease prevention and identification in hospitals Establishing a standardized FUO emergency department within a short period of time has become the key to preventing and controlling COVID-19 in densely populated Chinese cities Methods: Based on the lean management model, the research group established a process of less-link visits, which sees reduced contact between patients and physicians during diagnosis and treatment, and zero-contact consultation through lean workflow and value stream analysis Three steps were implemented to improve the operations of the FUO emergency department: the rapid establishment of an isolation zone, the refinement of duty and protection configuration, and the use of Internet and technology to establish a full-process follow-up consultation system Results: (I) Tests related to COVID-19 screening are all completed in the FUO emergency department;(II) 12 new isolated observation rooms have been built;(III) hospital visiting time, waiting time for consultation, and the time from pre-examination to virus screening has been shortened from 18 to 8 hours, from 2 hours to 10 minutes, and from 34 to 3 hours, respectively;(IV) the transfer distance has been shortened from 450 to 20 m, and the observation time has been shortened from 72 to 26 hours The median waiting time for image examination has been reduced from 40 to 3 minutes, and the moving distance has been shortened from 800 to 10 m;(V) the diagnosis and treatment process is facilitated by 5G, achieving zero contact between doctors and patients Conclusions: Through the implantation of information technology, the local transformation of the site, the rational allocation of medical teams and the planned distribution of protective equipment, in a short period of time, individual medical institutions can set up a safe FUO emergency department to provide 24-hour screening and detention services Establishing an FUO emergency department with lean management and realizing the management approach of combining daily operation with prevention and control could help China and other countries to handle the outbreak of fulminant infectious diseases

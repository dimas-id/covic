This guidance document is a brief consensus document covering the range and breadth of nuclear medicine practice in the UK, and identifies a few steps individual nuclear medicine practitioners and departments can take in the best interests of their patients. This guidance document should be used to inform local practice and does not replace local Trust policies or any relevant legislation. At all times, the best interests of the patients should be paramount. Please read this guidance in conjunction with previous editorial (COVID-19- Nuclear Medicine Departments, be prepared! by Huang HL, Allie R, Gnanasegaran G, Bomanji. J Nucl Med Commun 2020; 41:297-299). Although some aspects of this guidance are time-sensitive due to the nature of the global emergency, we believe that there is still sufficient information to provide some key guiding principles.

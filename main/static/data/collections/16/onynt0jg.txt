Introduction-Aim: Newer methods, such as infrared digital pupillometry and electrodermal activity (EDA) measurement have been suggested as good alternatives for analgesia monitoring in critically ill patients. This study analyzed EDA changes due to pain stimulus in sedated adult critical care patients Methods: Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, Bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime in an adult ICU. 4h-Measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level of the patients: Group A - Ramsay Sedation Score 2-4 and Group B - Ramsay Sedation Score of 5-6. Selected recordings before and after pain stimulus were performed. The stimulus chosen was the pressure applied to nail bed for 10 sec, which was performed routinely during neurological examination. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed by 2 independent observers via Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Adult Non Verbal Pain Score (ANVPS) Results: In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than other monitoring parameters: more in Group A than in Group B. Yet, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION EDA measurements are greater to pain stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. These encouraging results suggest that, further studies are needed to better define EDA role in ICU.

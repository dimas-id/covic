BACKGROUND Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is preferred as the initial ventilatory support to treat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) may be an alternative method; however, the effects of HFNC in hypercapnic COPD are not well known. This preliminary study aimed at assessing the physiologic effects of HFNC at different flow rates in hypercapnic COPD and to compare it with NIV. METHODS A prospective physiologic study enrolled 12 hypercapnic COPD patients who had initially required NIV, and were ventilated with HFNC at flow rates increasing from 10 to 50 L/min for 15 min in each step. The primary outcome was the effort to breathe estimated by a simplified esophageal pressure-time product (sPTPes). The other studied variables were respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and transcutaneous CO2 pressure (PtcCO2). RESULTS Before NIV initiation, the median [interquartile range] pH was 7.36 [7.28-7.37] with a PaCO2 of 51 [42-60] mmHg. sPTPes per minute was significantly lower with HFNC at 30 L/min than 10 and 20 L/min (p < 0.001), and did not significantly differ with NIV (median inspiratory/expiratory positive airway pressure of 11 [10-12] and [5-5] cmH2O, respectively). At 50 L/min, sPTPes per minute increased compared to 30 L/min half of the patients. Respiratory rate was lower (p = 0.003) and SpO2 was higher (p = 0.028) with higher flows (30-50 L/min) compared to flow rate of 10 L/min and not different than with NIV. No significant differences in PtcCO2 between NIV and HFNC at different flow rates were observed (p = 0.335). CONCLUSIONS Applying HFNC at 30 L/min for a short duration reduces inspiratory effort in comparison to 10 and 20 L/min, and resulted in similar effect than NIV delivered at modest levels of pressure support in hypercapnic COPD with mild to moderate exacerbation. Higher flow rates reduce respiratory rate but sometimes increase the effort to breathe. Using HFNC at 30 L/min in hypercapnic COPD patients should be further evaluated.

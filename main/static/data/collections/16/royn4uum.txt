We manifested by analyzing 35 early coronavirus cases of India, that virus introduction in India, occurred from Italy, Iran and China and population demography apparently revealed a rapid population expansion after the outbreak with a present steady growth. We depicted nucleotide substitutions in structural genes, drove for the adaptive selection and plead for sequencing more genomes to facilitate identification of new emerged mutants, genetic evolution and disease transmission caused by coronavirus.

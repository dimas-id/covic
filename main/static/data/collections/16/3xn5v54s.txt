Monoclonal antibodies to group A rotavirus Vp6 protein were prepared and used for verification of three blocking enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) modifications to detect rotavirus A. Selected competitive blocking ELISA (CB‐ELISA) and electron microscopy (EM) were used for examination of 194 field faecal samples of piglets affected with diarrhoea. Rotavirus was detected in 43 samples (22.2%) by CB‐ELISA method, whereas in 26 (13.4%) samples by EM examination. However, of 26 samples positive by EM, rotavirus A was detected by CB‐ELISA in 19 (73.1%) samples; indicating the share of group A rotavirus in all cases of gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus. The sensitivity and specificity of the CB‐ELISA was verified both by inclusion of control samples containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in each analysis and by comparative examination of samples with the commercial ELISA kit. The CB‐ELISA sensitivity was positively affected by examination of samples in the presence of chelating agent.

Although the number of viruses associated with foodborne outbreaks is relatively small in comparison to their bacterial counterparts, they represent a significant threat to global public health. Moreover, the emergence of novel viruses in food with a greater potential to cause morbidity and mortality suggests that control at the retail level is important. Due to the ability of viruses to persist in the environment and resist many disinfection methods, only a few options are currently viable, yet recent advancements suggest other options may be available in the future. This chapter will provide an overview of the viruses known and postulated to be potential sources of foodborne infection at the retail level, their routes of spread, current regulatory mechanisms in place to prevent infection, as well as explore both proven and new methods for control.

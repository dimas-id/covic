The crown-like projections on the surface of the particles permits differentiation of coronaviruses from other riboviruses and their individualization as a distinct family. Recognition of their role in the aetiology of respiratory, enteral and encephalitic infections has promoted investigations for the finding of preventive vaccines. Selection of the strains showed that their immunogenicity depends upon the density and salience of the crown-like projections, the antigenic relationship of the projections determining cross serologic reactions between different species. At present experiments are being carried out on animals with vaccines prepared with antigenically related heterologous cornavirus species, not pathogenic for the host, and with subunitary vaccines prepared from the projections of the homologous species. The Coronaviridae family established on morphologic criteria is thus confirmed by the immunologic relationship and specificity of its members.

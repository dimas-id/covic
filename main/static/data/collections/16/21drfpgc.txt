BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with pancreatic cancer are underrepresented in clinical trials, resulting in a lack of evidence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare treatment and overall survival (OS) of patients aged &#8805; 70 years with stage I-II pancreatic cancer in the EURECCA Pancreas Consortium. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of the Belgian (BE), Dutch (NL), and Norwegian (NOR) cancer registries. The primary outcome was OS, while secondary outcomes were resection, 90-day mortality after resection, and (neo)adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy. RESULTS: In total, 3624 patients were included. Resection (BE: 50.2%; NL: 36.2%; NOR: 41.3%; p < 0.001), use of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (BE: 55.9%; NL: 41.9%; NOR: 13.8%; p < 0.001), palliative chemotherapy (BE: 39.5%; NL: 6.0%; NOR: 15.7%; p < 0.001), and 90-day mortality differed (BE: 11.7%; NL: 8.0%; NOR: 5.2%; p < 0.001). Furthermore, median OS in patients with (BE: 17.4; NL: 15.9; NOR: 25.4 months; p < 0.001) and without resection (BE: 7.0; NL: 3.9; NOR: 6.5 months; p < 0.001) also differed. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were observed in treatment and OS in patients aged &#8805; 70 years with stage I-II pancreatic cancer, between the population-based cancer registries. Future studies should focus on selection criteria for (non)surgical treatment in older patients so that clinicians can tailor treatment.

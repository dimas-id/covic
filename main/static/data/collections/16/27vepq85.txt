BACKGROUND Moderate therapeutic hypothermia (TH) initiated within 6 h of life reduces adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants after perinatal hypoxic ischaemic insult. For infants born in non-tertiary centres, TH may be initiated manually en route to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, both over- and undercooling is reported with this strategy, precluding some infants from the benefits of TH. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of a region-wide educational programme on the safety and efficacy of manual cooling administered by the Wellington Neonatal Transport Service (NeTS). METHODS Clinical records of infants with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) retrieved by the Wellington NeTS for TH between January 2012 and June 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Temperature outcomes of infants retrieved before and after the education programme were compared. RESULTS A total of 101 infants were cooled manually by Wellington NeTS for TH during the study period. Education and training significantly reduced the rate of overcooling to ≤32.0°C (4/43 [9%] vs. 0/58, p = 0.02). However, there was no difference in the proportion of infants who achieved target rectal temperature within 6 h of life (29/43 [65%] vs. 35/58 [60%], p = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS Introduction of a region-wide educational programme may have improved the safety of manual cooling during neonatal transport but it had a negligible impact on its efficacy. The use of servo-controlled cooling during transport should therefore be considered to improve access to the optimal neuroprotective benefits of TH for outborn infants with HIE.

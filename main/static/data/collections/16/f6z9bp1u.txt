Although young adults familiar with digital technology join the workforce and bring in more advanced digital competences, the demand for digital competences in many industries increases even faster. In this study, we place the focus on the banking industry in the United Kingdom and aim for exploring those digital competences that are required for junior financial analysts. For this purpose, we apply a qualitative research approach which consists of two steps. First, we analyze job advertisements and code the identified competences by using the DigComp 2.0 framework. Second, we conduct interviews to validate and discuss our findings from the previous step. Our analysis reveals that the most important required competence categories are information and data literacy, followed by digital content creation. This paper contributes to the research field of digital competences and provides relevant insights for, amongst others, applicants, HR professionals, and training and education providers.

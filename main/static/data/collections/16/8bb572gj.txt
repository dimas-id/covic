Diseases caused by microbial infections are present throughout human evolution. Large proportions are the result of virus infections. A commonly cited example of resurgent or recurrent disease is the yearly appearance of new antigenically different influenza viruses. These new variants are able to evoke disease in their host while causing the centuries-old symptoms of influenza. However, conventional virological techniques have failed to identify the agent, even though evidence suggested non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) is caused by a blood-borne, small enveloped virus, readily transmissible to chimpanzees. Modern molecular biology techniques are used to identify completely new viruses. These viruses can be associated with a new disease or associated with a well-characterized disease present in humans for many years. In identifying an emerging virus, one is often presented with epidemiological data and clinical specimens that have no reactivity with diagnostic reagents available for known pathogens. The primary aim therefore is to identify any new infectious agent and build a body of data to support the existence of a causal link between organism and disease.

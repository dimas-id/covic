INTRODUCTION Compared with healthy older adults, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have reduced capacity and increased symptoms during leg and arm activities. While the mechanisms underlying limitations and symptoms during leg activities have been investigated in detail, limitations and symptoms during arm activities are not well understood, and the potential differences between physiological responses of leg and arm activities have not been systematically synthesised. Determining physiological responses and symptoms of arm activities compared with physiological responses and symptoms of leg activities will help us understand the mechanisms behind the difficulties that people with COPD experience when performing physical activities, and determine how exercise training should be prescribed. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to compare the physiological responses and symptoms during activities involving the arms relative to activities involving the legs in people diagnosed with COPD. METHODS AND ANALYSES This protocol is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols. Potentially relevant studies will be identified from CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PubMed databases. The Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes, and Study characteristics framework will be used to systematise the process of selecting and extracting data from relevant studies. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies will be done by using the 14 most relevant components from the checklist by Downs and Black. The result will be presented with a narrative synthesis, and if appropriate with meta-analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as this study is a systematic review. It is our intention to submit the results of our review for peer-reviewed publication. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42017074476.

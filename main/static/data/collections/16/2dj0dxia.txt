This study compared effects of isoflurane inhalation (ISO) and propofol-remifentanil combined total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) on oxygenation during thoracoscopic lung lobectomy with 30-min one-lung ventilation (1LV). Thoracoscopic right middle lung lobectomy was performed in ten dogs divided into ISO and TIVA groups, and cardiopulmonary parameters were measured with blood gas analysis. Throughout the study, isoflurane was inhaled up to 1.5%, and the infusion rates of propofol and remifentanil were 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg/min and 6 to 11 Âµg/kg/h, respectively. Cardiac index was not affected in the ISO group, but it increased during 1LV in the TIVA group. There were significant alterations in arterial oxygen pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, oxygen content, and shunt fraction associated with 1LV in each group. However, oxygen delivery did not decrease significantly due to open chest condition, 1LV, or surgical maneuver in either group, rather it increased during 1LV in the TIVA group. All parameters showed no significant difference between groups. Pulmonary vascular resistant index was unaffected in both groups, and there was no difference between groups except in re-ventilation phase. Accordingly, the effect of both anesthetic regimens on oxygenation was not different between groups and can be used with short-term 1LV for thoracoscopic lung lobectomy in dogs.

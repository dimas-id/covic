Background and Aims Reduced inhalational anaesthetic requirement in end-stage liver disease during living donor orthotopic liver transplantation (LD-OLT) is due to increased endogenous opioids. This study evaluated the changes in bi-spectral index (BIS) monitored end-tidal desflurane (ETDes) requirements during 'dissection', 'anhepatic', and 'neohepatic' phases of LD-OLT. Methods This prospective, cohort study included 40 adults undergoing LD-OLT under general anaesthesia (GA). All patients received BIS-guided desflurane GA. ETDes requirements in three phases of LD-OLT (primary objective); relationship between inhalational anaesthetic requirements and severity of liver disease; and effect of changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body temperature on ETDes concentration for all three phases were also evaluated. Results ETDes during the 'dissection' phase (2.92 ± 0.65%) was > 'anhepatic' (2.68 ± 0.85%, P = 0.049) and 'neohepatic' phases (2.58 ± 0.71%, P = 0.005). Patients with model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score < 20 returned significantly greater ETDes than those with MELD score ≥20 during the 'dissection' (MELD <20: 3.11 ± 0.49%; MELD ≥20: 2.58 ± 0.77%, P = 0.01) and 'anhepatic'(MELD <20: 2.96 ± 0.76%; MELD ≥20: 2.17 ± 0.79%, P = 0.003) phases. A positive correlation was observed between ETDes(r = 0.584, P = 0.001) and temperature in the 'dissection' phase only. Conclusion In patients undergoing LD-OLT, BIS monitoring guidance of depth of desflurane GA suggests lower desflurane requirements during 'anhepatic' and the 'neohepatic' phase of surgery. Also, the desflurane requirement is greater in patients with lesser severity of liver disease.

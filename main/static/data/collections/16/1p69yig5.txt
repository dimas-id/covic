INTRODUCTION Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic groin hernia repair has been shown to significantly reduce postoperative pain. However, chronic pain remains a problem with the laparoscopic approach, affecting approximately 10% of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes following the use of Parietex ProGripâ„¢ (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) self-gripping mesh during laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal groin hernia repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected prospectively from 145 male and 15 female patients with 235 inguinal hernias. All patients underwent repair by the laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach using Parietex ProGrip mesh. During follow-up ranging from 5 to 24 months, complications, pain score, patient satisfaction, and recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS All patients were discharged on the day of surgery or the next morning. There were no immediate complications or returns to the operating room. Delayed postoperative complications included minor bruising to the genital region (3 cases), hematoma/seroma (1 case), and wound infection (1 case). The mean follow-up was 15 months, at which time there were no reports of hernia recurrence and 99% of patients were satisfied with their hernia repair. One patient (0.63%) reported severe pain (numeric rating scale score of >7), and 4 patients (2.5%) reported intermittent mild pain on exertion. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that the use of a self-gripping mesh during the laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach is a promising and effective technique for repairing both primary and recurrent inguinal hernias.

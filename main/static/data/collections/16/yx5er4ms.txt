INTRODUCTION Gastric diverticula are a rare condition characterized by a pouch protruding from the gastric wall. It is commonly asymptomatic and managed without surgery. Gastric diverticulotomy is indicated in the case of symptomatic or complicated diverticula. CASE The authors report the case of a 67 year-old man presenting with heartburn and dyspepsia with no response to proton pump inhibitors. The patient was diagnosed with a gastric diverticula and a little hiatal hernia, which was subsequently successfully treated with a laparoscopic gastric diverticulectomy and Nissen fundoplication. CONCLUSION Gastric Diverticula have to be evoked in the absence of response of Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease to therapy or in atypical symptoms. Laparoscopic resection of GD can be safe with resolution of symptoms.

Abstract Hepatitis E virus is a small, nonenveloped RNA virus that is feco-orally transmitted and causes viral hepatitis in humans. A virus-like particle (VLP) expressed and purified from insect cells shares several properties with the virion but can be manipulated quite extensively through genetic engineering or chemical modification. This has exciting implications for exploiting the VLP as a nanocarrier for foreign epitopes or encapsulated deliverables. By exhaustively studying the structure of the virus, we have been successful in designing and synthesizing chimerized VLPs that either carry foreign epitopes, are capable of encapsulating foreign DNA, or both. Preliminary studies show that these particles provide specific and strong immune responses in mice when orally delivered. To appreciate the full potential of HEV VLPs, we have highlighted various properties of the virus with a strong focus on the VLP structure and the key features that make it suitable for oral delivery.

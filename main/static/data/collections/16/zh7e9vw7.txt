The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities throughout the United States and worldwide. While the implications of the concomitant economic downturn for older adults are just beginning to be recognized, past experience suggests that the consequences could be devastating for many. Analyses indicate that more than one out of five Americans aged 65 years or older live in counties where high infection rates and high economic insecurity risks occur simultaneously. These findings highlight the overlap between current infection patterns and subsequent challenges to economic security that are impacting older people. Strategies and supports for getting people back to work must take into account the large segment of older people who rely on earnings well into later life. Social Security serves as the foundation of economic security for older adults across the income continuum, but it is frequently insufficient in and of itself, let alone during a crisis. Recognizing the importance of cost of living in shaping economic security highlights the need for the federal and state governments and municipalities to take older people into account in the economic recovery effort.

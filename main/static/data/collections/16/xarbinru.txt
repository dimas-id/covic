Summary Prevalence of severe acute asthma can be evaluated through mortality statistics, hospitalization rates and epidemiological studies. Risk factors include personnal characteristics (age, socio-economic status, disease denial, depression, medical features associated with increased severity), environment factors as life events and exposure to specific (allergens) and as non-specific factors (viral or microbial infections, passive smoking, air polluants) and the health care system (care delivery, quality of medical management). Such factors are inter-related. Their knowledge should allow a better management leading to a lower incidence of severe acute asthma attacks.

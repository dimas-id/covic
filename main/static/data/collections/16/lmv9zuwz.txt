As the group of organisms living most closely with humans, the relationship between microbes and humans is a very tight and intimate one. They live in nearly every possible ecological niche in or on the human body and play diverse and important roles in human health; some microbes influence our ability to digest food, some help protect the human body against pathogens, and some may become the cause of disease. As disease states caused by diverse members of various microbial communities have been identified, microbial genomes have been paid a lot of attention, and scientists have uncovered a notably high individual level of microbial diversity that promises increasing relevance to personalized medicine.

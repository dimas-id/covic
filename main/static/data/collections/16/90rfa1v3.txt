BACKGROUND Gastric leak after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a serious complication. Currently, the literature lacks long-term outcomes in LSG and leak rates after reinforcement of the staple line. The aims are two-fold: to present leak rates from using staple line reinforcement and six year outcomes of LSG in relation to resolution of obesity-related comorbidities and long-term weight loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a single-institution, retrospectively reviewed study of 204 patient case files. Data from all patients undergoing LSG between December 2007 and May 2013 was collected. RESULTS The total complication rate was 6.9% (14/204), with no recorded staple line leaks. The mean postoperative Body Mass Index (BMI) at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, and 6 years was 39.3 ± 8, 38.7 ± 8, 40.4 ± 9, 40.5 ± 10, 43.0 ± 10, and 42.4 ± 7, respectively. The mean % excess weight loss at 1 year, 3 years, and 6 years was 48.4 ± 19, 51.7 ± 28, and 41.0 ± 21, respectively. There were no significant differences between follow-ups at year 1 and 3 (p > 0.05), and between year 3 and 6 (p > 0.05) for the mean % excess weight loss. The resolution rates for all patients were 74%, 61%, 79%, and 90% for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2 and obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. CONCLUSION The synthetic bioabsorbable reinforcement material shows no staple line leaks making it safe to use. LSG as a procedure had a high resolution of obesity-related comorbidities as well as sustainable long-term weight loss.

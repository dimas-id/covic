Respiratory infections are the most frequent cause of athletesâ€™ visits in medical practices. Simultaneously, contradictory beliefs are generally held regarding influence of repeated exercise on immunity reflected in susceptibility to infections. Many tend to claim that exercise weakens the immunity and renders regular exercisers more prone to develop airway infections. On the other hand, voices are heard in favor of the possible beneficial influence of regular exercise on immune system efficiency. This chapter focuses on the associations of various kinds of exercise with respiratory infection susceptibility. Influence of exercise, in particular associated with competitive performance, on selected innate and acquired immune response mechanisms is also addressed.

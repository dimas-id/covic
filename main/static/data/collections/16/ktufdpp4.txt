Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) aims to eliminate multiple port incisions. Although general operative principles of SILS are similar to conventional laparoscopic surgery, operative techniques are not standardized. This review aims to evaluate the current use of SILS published in the literature by examining the types of operations performed, techniques employed, and relevant complications and morbidity. This review considered a total of 94 studies reporting 1889 patients evaluating 17 different general surgical operations. There were 8 different access techniques reported using conventional laparoscopic instruments and specifically designed SILS ports. There is extensive heterogeneity associated with operating methods and in particular ways of overcoming problems with retraction and instrumentation. Published complications, morbidity, and hospital length of stay are comparable to conventional laparoscopy. Although SILS provides excellent cosmetic results and morbidity seems similar to conventional laparoscopy, larger randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this novel technique.

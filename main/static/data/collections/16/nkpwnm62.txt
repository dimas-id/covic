The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can exponentially replicate a target DNA sequence, has formed the basis for the sensitive and direct examination of clinical samples for evidence of infection. During the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, PCR not only offered a rapid way to diagnose SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, but also made the molecular analysis of its genomic sequence possible. Sequence variations were observed in the SAR-CoV obtained from different patients in this epidemic. These unique viral genetic signatures can be applied as a powerful molecular tool in tracing the route of transmission and in studying the genome evolution of SARS-CoV. To extract this wealth of information from the limited primary clinical specimens of SARS patients, we were presented with the challenge of efficiently amplifying fragments of the SARS-CoV genome for analysis. In this chapter, we will discuss how we managed to accomplish this task with our optimized protocols on reversetranscription, nested PCR amplification, and DNA cycle sequencing. We will also discuss the sequence variations that typified some strains of SARS-CoV in the different phases during this epidemic. PCR amplification of the viral sequence and genomic sequencing of these critical sequence variations of re-emerging SARS-CoV strains would give us quick insights into the virus.

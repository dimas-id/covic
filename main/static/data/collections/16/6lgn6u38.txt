The incidences of nosocomial infections (NIs) are increasing throughout the world, especially for those airborne diseases caused by pathogens or air particulates that float in air. In this study, we designed and manufactured a desk for clinic consultation room air purification and air isolation between doctor and patient. The air isolation and purification (AIP) desk has a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter on the tope and several primary efficiency filters on the sides for air purification. The air circulating between inlet and outlet forms a wind-curtain between doctor and patient. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to calculate the speed of the air flow and the angle of sampler. We tested the air purification function of the AIP desk in rooms sized about 3.6 × 2.8 × 2.8 m (L × W × H) and found that the AIP desk could significantly remove the tested air pollutants like smoke particulates and microorganisms like Staphylococcus albus (S. albus)and human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5). The wind-curtain can significantly block the exhale air of patient being transmitted to the respiratory area of doctor setting in the opposite of AIP desk. Thus, the AIP desk can be used in hospital setting to reduce the risk of NIs and protect both doctors and patients.

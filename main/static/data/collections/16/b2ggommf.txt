Abstract Houttuynia cordata Thunb. has been used traditionally as immune stimulant and anticancer agent. An aqueous extract of H. cordata tea showed high radical scavenging activity determined by off-line DPPH assays. Then, it was screened for its antioxidant components via an on-line DPPH radical scavenging technique coupled with a liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (LC–ESI–MS). Based on their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns; the antioxidant compounds were identified as quinic acid derivative, caffeic acid derivatives, procyanidin B, neo-chlorogenic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, crypto-chlorogenic acid and quercetin hexoside. LC–MS/MS in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode was used to quantify these antioxidant compounds. Chlorogenic acid was found to be a major component in H. cordata tea.

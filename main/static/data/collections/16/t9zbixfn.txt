Aim:In the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique is often used. We evaluated the compatibility of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kits containing different gene targets during the pandemic. Materials and methods: Samples were tested by Bio-Speddy (RdRp gene) and Diagnovital (RdRp+E genes). The correlation between two assays were determined by Deming regression and chi-square heatmap analyses. Results: Diagnovital PCR kit showed in a constricted range and conveniently exponential amplification curves than Bio-Speedy PCR kit. While the correlation increased when a secondary biomarker was added to the kit. Conclusion: In an unknown sample, using together different PCR kits that target different genes during the pandemic situation may provide a more accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

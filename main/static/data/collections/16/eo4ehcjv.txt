In contrast with adults, children infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) develop milder clinical symptoms. Because of this, it is speculated that children vaccinated with various childhood vaccines might develop cross immunity against SARS-CoV. Antisera and T cells from mice immunised with various vaccines were used to determine whether they developed cross reactivity against SARS-CoV. The results showed no marked cross reactivity against SARS-CoV, which implies that the reduced symptoms among children infected by SARS-CoV may be caused by other factors.

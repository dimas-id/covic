Assessment of brain connectivity has revealed that the structure and dynamics of large-scale network organization are altered in multiple disease states suggesting their use as diagnostic or prognostic indicators. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms, organization, and alteration of large-scale brain networks requires a homologous animal model that would allow neurophysiological recordings and experimental manipulations. The current study presents a comprehensive assessment of macaque resting-state networks based on evaluation of intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen-level-dependent signal using group independent component analysis. Networks were found underlying multiple levels of sensory, motor, and cognitive processing. The results demonstrate that macaques share remarkable homologous network organization with humans, thereby providing strong support for their use as an animal model in the study of normal and abnormal brain connectivity as well as aiding the interpretation of electrophysiological recordings within the context of large-scale brain networks.

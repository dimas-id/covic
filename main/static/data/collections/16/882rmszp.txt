Scant attention has been paid to intersecting vulnerabilities experienced by Black, Latinx, and older adults of color (BLOAC) that increase COVID-19 related risks. Structural inequities have resulted in disproportionate rates of chronic conditions and limited access to care. Media coverage, focused on COVID-19 mortality among institutionalized older adults (OA), has overlooked community-dwelling OA, leaving their unique risks unaddressed in research and intervention efforts. Key vulnerabilities impacting noninstitutionalized BLOAC exacerbating adverse health outcomes during COVID-19 are discussed, and recommendations are given for gerontological social work (GSW) education, training, and practice to meet the needs of BLOAC during the COVID-19 pandemic.

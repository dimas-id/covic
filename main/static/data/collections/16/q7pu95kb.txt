PURPOSE The treatment of pain in bone metastases is currently multidisciplinary. Among the various therapies, local radiotherapy is the gold standard for pain palliation from single metastasis, even though the maximum benefit is obtained between 12 and 20 weeks from initiation. In carefully selected patients, several ablation therapies achieve this objective in 4 weeks. The purpose of this study was to assess the technical success, effectiveness and possible complications of percutaneous ablation therapies in patients with symptomatic bone metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS From November 2003 to May 2008, ten ablation treatments were performed in ten patients with acute pain from metastatic bone lesions. Patient selection and choice of the most appropriate ablation treatment was made based on lesion characteristics. Three patients were treated with radiofrequency, one with plasma-mediated radiofrequency, two with plasma-mediated radiofrequency and cementoplasty, three with radiofrequency and cementoplasty and one with microwave. RESULTS Assessments were based not only on imaging but also on the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for determining pain and on changes in morphine-equivalent doses. In both cases, 3-month follow-up showed a statistically significant reduction of pain. In no case did local complications occur either during or after treatment. Only one patient treated with radiofrequency (1/9, 11%) developed low-grade fever and general malaise during the 6 days following the procedure, compatible with a post-radiofrequency syndrome, which was treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) only and resolved on day 7. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous ablation therapies represent a safe and valuable alternative for treating localised pain from single bone metastasis, providing rapid (4-week) relief of symptoms and a significant reduction in morphine doses. This contributes to improving the quality of life of patients with metastatic disease.

Infections with bovine viral diarrhoea virus continue to plague the cattle industry worldwide. The wish to control the negative effects of the virus has lead to the development of numerous vaccines, but also of eradication schemes. In this paper, a comprehensive overview on BVDV is given: the virus and its clinical manifestations, its occurrence and economic impact, the different routes of transmission, as well as diagnostic methods and objectives. Furthermore, the two major options for BVDV control--eradication and vaccination--are discussed as well as the risk for reintroduction of BVDV after eradication.

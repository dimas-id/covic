BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicate racial disparities in the rates of infection and mortality from the 2019 novel coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). The aim of this study was to determine whether disparities exist in the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) related to COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed data from 1216 adults in the March 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation ‘Coronavirus Poll’, to determine levels of KAPs across different groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of KAPs. RESULTS: In contrast to White respondents, Non-White respondents were more likely to have low knowledge (58% versus 30%; P < 0.001) and low attitude scores (52% versus 27%; P < 0.001), but high practice scores (81% versus 59%; P < 0.001). By multivariate regression, White race (odds ratio [OR] 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70–5.50), higher level of education (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.46–2.23) and higher income (OR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.58–2.70) were associated with high knowledge of COVID-19. Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status and political views were all associated with KAPs. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and socioeconomic disparity exists in the levels of KAPs related to COVID-19. More work is needed to identify educational tools that tailor to specific racial and socioeconomic groups.

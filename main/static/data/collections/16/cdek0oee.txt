OBJECTIVES: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) are immunosuppressive viruses in cats that increase their susceptibility to zoonotic pathogens. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of one or both viruses, the risk factors associated with infection, and to develop further recommendations. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Veterinary Faculty of Eduardo Mondlane University, Mozambique, between March and December 2017, in 145 cats. From each of 145 cats, we took 1.5 ml of blood by jugular puncture for detection of antibodies to FIV and FeLV antigens in whole blood using a commercial test kit, DFV Test FeLV/FIV. RESULTS: We found an overall prevalence of 11.0% and 14.5% for FIV antibodies and FeLV antigens, respectively, with four (2.8%) cats coinfected by both pathogens. Male cats were more likely to be infected with FIV (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3–4.0) compared with female cats. Clinically ill cats were more likely to have a positive result for FeLV antigen infection (OR 18.8, 95% CI 5.2–68.3). Moreover, cats living in suburban areas have a greater chance of a positive result for FeLV infection (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4–9.6) compared with cats living in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: FIV and FeLV occur in cats from Maputo and possibly all over the country. Further studies should be conducted in Mozambique and other African countries to define the burden of both pathogens in cats, coinfection with other zoonotic pathogens and the possible role played by the cats on the transmission of zoonotic and opportunistic diseases to humans.

Benzalkonium salts are widely used as disinfectants, biocides and detergents,among a variety of other applications. The cationic surface-activity of these salts determines their potential to act as a biocide on both target and non-target organisms. In this study, a quick synthesis of a complete set of the benzalkonium salts differing in the length of an alkylating chain (from C(2) to C(20)) is described. Moreover, their (1)H-NMR, HPLC-MS, TLC and HPLC analysis were recorded.

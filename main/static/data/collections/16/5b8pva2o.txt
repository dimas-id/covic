1. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs)were detected in 2.5% of 2982 local children hospitalised for acute respiratory infections in 2005 to 2007. 2. Using the 'pancoronavirus' reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay, detection rates were 0.6% for HCoVNL63,1.2% for HCoV-OC43,0.5% for HCoV-HKU1, and 0.2% for HCoV-229E. Notably, HCoV-NL63 infections were significantly more common among children hospitalised in 2006/2007 (1.2%) than in 2005/2006 (0.3%).3. The peak season for HCoVNL63 infection was autumn(September to October). 4. HCoV-NL63 infection was associated with younger age,croup, febrile convulsion, and acute gastroenteritis. Such disease associations were not found with the other three HCoVs. 5. Most local HCoV-NL63 isolates were closely related to the prototype strain in Netherlands(NL496), but a few were phylogenetically distinct from the major cluster.

It is known that while it is possible to convert between many different representations of irrational numbers (e.g., between Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences), it is in general not possible to do so subrecursively: conversions in general need to perform unbounded search. This raises the question of categorizing the pairs of representations between which either subrecursive conversion is possible, or is not possible. The purpose of this paper is to prove the following positive result: for a number of well-known representations (Beatty sequences, Dedekind cuts, General base expansions, Hurwitz characteristics, and Locators) conversion between the representations can be performed effectively and with good subrecursive bounds.

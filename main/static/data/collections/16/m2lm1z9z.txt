BACKGROUND Condylar hyperplasia is a rare bone disease characterised by excessive development of mandibular condyle, which can lead to the development of asymmetric facial deformity together with malocclusion, mandibular deviation, TMJ and masticatory musculoskeletal system dysfunction. There is not a treatment protocol universally accepted. In order to determine the correct management, treatment and intervention timing of these patients, morphological examinations should be coupled with functional assessments. CASE REPORT In the present case report, morphological (bone scintigraphy; orthopantomography; posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms; 3D facial photographs) and functional (surface electromyography of masseter and temporalis muscles) quantitative data of a 20-year-old male patient affected by unilateral condylar hyperplasia are presented. The patient underwent a surgical treatment with high unilateral condylectomy associated to a maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy; as well as orthodontic treatment before and after surgery. Facial morphology and masticatory muscles activity were assessed before surgery and followed-up 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Twenty-four months after surgery, all electromyographic values were normal, and soft-tissue facial asymmetry was negligible at 3D assessment. CONCLUSION Surface electromyography joins a set of clinical and morphological diagnostic tests that help the surgeon in planning the operation and managing the post-surgical patient.

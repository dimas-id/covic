Five cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with typically elevated EB- virus-antigen-titer were studied by light- and electron microscopic methods. Within the cytoplasm corona viruses in different forms, regular capsid-like particles with a diameter of 60 nm, tubuloreticular aggregates, and pathologic alterations of the membranes of the endoplasmatic reticulum could be found. The nuclei of the tumor cells often showed particles within the nucleoplasm with an average diameter of 100 nm containing a central core; the appearance of the particles is similar to that of herpes viruses as shown in the literature concerning EB-viruses. Atypic mitoses are common as well as free nucleoplasma-like condensates within the ground cytoplasm. Multiple doubling of the membranes of the endoplasmatic reticulum are characteristic for the tumor cell cytoplasm. Myelin figures are often situated within the enlarged tubules of the E. R., within mitochondria and within the nuclei. The results are discussed concerning the possible viral etiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We do not believe that the particles found within the nucleoplasm have a relation to nuclear pores. The arguments are discussed.

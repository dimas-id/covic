The purpose of this study was to determine if exercise training of 12-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats could reverse the resistance to insulin-induced glucose uptake that has been shown to occur in these animals. Twelve-month-old rats were trained to run 1½ miles/day in motorized exercise wheel cages, and the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in these rats was compared with values observed in two groups of similar aged sedentary rats — one fed rat chow ad libitum and the other a calorie-restricted diet for 4 months. Body weight increased and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake decreased as rats fed chow ad libitum grew from 12 to 16 months of age. In contrast, 4 months of either exercise training or calorie restriction prevented weight gain and loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Thus, the intensity of exercise training attained in this study did not result in an improvement in insulin action in older rats above and beyond that related to the reduction in rate of body weight gain

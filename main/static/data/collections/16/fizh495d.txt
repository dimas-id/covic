BACKGROUND: Due to the change of HIV disease from an acute life-threatening disease to a chronic infection, it is more psychosocial rather than therapeutic aspects that have become of interest in scientific investigations. The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate emotional distress, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cognitive performance. The diagnosis of HIV was considered a life event that may lead to post-traumatic stress syndrome. METHOD: We recruited 37 HIV-positive outpatients and assessed the frequency of depressive (BDI) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) due to the diagnosis of HIV (IES), HRQoL (SF-36) and cognitive performance (SKT). Further, the new diagnostic concept of adjustment disorder as a stress response syndrome according to Maercker was considered. RESULTS: Of the 37 Patients, 67.6% (n=25) of the sample had a post-traumatic stress syndrome. The HIV-related PTSS was considered adjustment disorder using the concept proposed by Maercker. Fourteen patients (37.8%) suffered from a depressive syndrome, and 27% (n=10) showed cognitive deficits (minimal: n=8; mild: n=1; moderate: n =1). HIV-positive patients with PTSS had significantly unfavourable values in the SF-36 domains general health (p=0.003), vitality (p=0.007), social functioning (p=0.000), role-emotional (p=0.016) and mental health (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: HIV-infected patients may face a major risk of HIV-related PTSS in the sense of adjustment disorder according to Maercker, depression and cognitive dysfunction. The presence of emotional distress is associated with impairments in quality of life. We therefore suggest an early and comprehensive bio-psycho-social assessment and therapy of HIV-infected patients.

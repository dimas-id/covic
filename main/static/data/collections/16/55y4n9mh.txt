BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to systematically analyze the randomized trials comparing tacker mesh fixation with glue mesh fixation (GMF) in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). METHODS Standard electronic database were searched to retrieve relevant randomized trials comparing tacker mesh fixation with GMF in LIHR, which were analyzed systematically using RevMan. RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials encompassing 1,001 patients were retrieved from the electronic databases. In a random-effects model, operating time, postoperative pain, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and risk for hernia recurrence were statistically comparable between the 2 techniques of mesh fixation in LIHR. However, GMF was associated with a reduced risk for developing chronic groin pain. CONCLUSIONS GMF in LIHR does not increase the risk for hernia recurrence and reduces the risk for developing chronic groin pain. It is comparable with tacker mesh fixation in terms of operation time, postoperative pain, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and risk for hernia recurrence.

With respect to reopening the economy as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions, governmental response and messaging have been inconsistent, and policies have varied by state as this is a uniquely polarizing topic. Considering the urgent need to return to normalcy, a method was devised to determine the degree of progress any state has made in containing the spread of COVID-19. Using various measures for each state including mortality, hospitalizations, testing capacity, number of infections and infection rate has allowed for the creation of a composite COVID -19 Reopening Readiness Index. This index can serve as a comprehensive reliable and simple-to-use metric to assess the level of containment in any state and to determine the level of risk in further opening. As states struggle to contain the outbreak and at the same time face great pressure in resuming economic activity, an index that provides a data-driven and objective insight is urgently needed.

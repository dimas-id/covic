PURPOSE OF REVIEW: While the Zika virus (ZIKV) has been noted for its distinct neurotropism and identified as a significant cause for a congenital infection syndrome, there has been increased recognition of the importance to better understand the clinical impact of non-congenital ZIKV infection in infants and children. This article reviews reports of perinatal and breast milk transmission of ZIKV and summarizes current clinical outcome data of pediatric non-congenital ZIKV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Perinatal transmission and presence of infective ZIKV particles in breast milk have been reported. Most symptomatic non-congenital ZIKV infection in infants and children is mild and self-limited, but long-term follow-up studies are lacking. SUMMARY: The mechanism and impact of perinatal and breast milk transmission is unclear. The current WHO infant feeding guidelines in areas of ZIKV transmission support breastfeeding. Unless any scientific data raise concern regarding transmission via breastfeeding, the current guidelines should continue to be followed. Prospective population-based cohort studies to investigate maternal, perinatal, infant, and child outcomes are needed.

Myelolipomas represent 3-7% fromthe primary tumors of the adrenal gland. Most often they are incidental findings. In most cases are asymptomatic, rarely they present symptoms (pain, abdominal discomfort, hematuria or signs of internal hemorrhage). Histologically benign, this variety of tumor requires only local excision, in symptomatic forms. Their dimensions are generally up to 4-5 cm, so the laparoscopic approach seems the most appropriate. We present the case of a 65 years old patient, electively operated for a right adrenal tumor formation.Alaparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed using an anterior transabdominal approach. No ligatures, clips or sutures were used. The intervention was accomplished with the Ligasure Maryland forceps and the Force Triad platform (Covidien Medtronic-USA). The postoperative evolution was favorable and the pathological examination highlighted an adrenal myelolipoma with intratumoral hemorrhage.

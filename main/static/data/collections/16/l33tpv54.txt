Abstract Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C proteinase is a picornaviral cysteine proteinase that is essential for cleavage of the initially synthesized viral polyprotein precursor to mature fragments and is therefore required for viral replication in vivo. Since the enzyme generally recognizes peptide substrates with l-glutamine at the P1 site, four types of analogues having an azaglutamine residue were chemically synthesized: hydrazo-o-nitrophenylsulfenamides A (e.g. 16); frame-shifted hydrazo-o-nitrophenylsulfenamides B (e.g. 25–28); the azaglutamine sulfonamides C (e.g. 7, 8, 11, 12); and haloacetyl azaglutamine analogues 2 and 3. Testing of these compounds for inhibition of the HAV 3C proteinase employed a C24S mutant in which the non-essential surface cysteine was replaced with serine and which displays identical catalytic parameters to the wild-type enzyme. Sulfenamide 16 (type A) showed no significant inhibition. Sulfenamide 27 (type B) had an IC50 of ca 100μM and gave time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme due to disulfide bond formation with the active site cysteine thiol, as demonstrated by electrospray mass spectrometry. Sulfonamide 8 (type C) was a weak competitive inhibitor with an IC50 of approximately 75μM. The haloacetyl azaglutamine analogues 2 and 3 were time-dependent irreversible inactivators of HAV 3C proteinase with rate constants k obs/[I] of 680M−1 s−1 and 870M−1 s−1, respectively, and were shown to alkylate the active site thiol. ©

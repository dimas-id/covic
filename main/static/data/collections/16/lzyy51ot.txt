Because the radioulnar ligament attaches to the ulnar fovea and base of the ulnar styloid, foveal detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) induces severe distal radioulnar joint instability. This article describes both an arthroscopic and open repair technique to reattach the TFCC to the fovea. Both techniques reanchor the detached TFCC to the fovea. Both techniques are reliable and promising techniques in the repair of a foveal detachment of the TFCC.

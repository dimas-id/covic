We read with great interest the report by Fernand√©z-Ruiz and colleagues on the outcome of 18 transplant recipients1 with COVID-19, showing a higher case fatality rate than that reported in the general population. Unlike them, we did not observe higher mortality in transplant setting compared to our overall mortality. We collected data of 13 consecutive solid organ transplant recipients admitted to our Center for COVID-19 between February 21st and April 26th, 2020, with a median follow up of 36 days (IQR 25-41). Our patients were younger (median age 59 versus 71 years) and with a shorter median interval from transplantation (5.3 versus 9.3 years) compared to the Spanish case series. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (54%) and diabetes (31%).

Novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV is a danger to the world and is spreading rapidly. Very little structural information about 2019-nCoV make this situation more difficult for drug designing. Benzylidenechromanones, naturally occurring oxygen heterocyclic compounds, having capability to inhibit various protein and receptors, have been designed here to block mutant variety of coronavirus main protease enzyme (SARC-CoV-2 Mpro) isolated from 2019-nCoV with the assistance of molecular docking, bioinformatics and molecular electrostatic potential. (Z)-3-(4'-chlorobenzylidene)-thiochroman-4-one showed highest binding affinity to the protein. Binding of a compound to this protein actually inhibits the replication and transcription of the virus and, ultimately, stop the virus multiplication. Incorporation of any functional groups to the basic benzylidenechromanones enhances their binding ability. Chloro and bromo substitutions amplify the binding affinity. ADME studies of all these compounds indicate they are lipophilic, high gastro intestine absorbable and blood-brain barrier permeable. The outcome reveals that the investigated benzylidenechromanones can be examined in the case of 2019-nCoV as potent inhibitory drug of SARC-CoV-2 Mpro, for their strong inhibition ability, high reactivity and effective pharmacological properties.

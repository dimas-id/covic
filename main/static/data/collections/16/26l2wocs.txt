OBJECTIVES In spite of recommendations advocating conservative best medical treatment, many patients with infrainguinal intermittent claudication (IC) are treated by invasive open and endovascular methods. This study aims to evaluate the incidence and 1-year results of all such treatments during 2009 in Sweden. METHODS The design was a one-year follow-up through the Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) of all 775 patients from the Swedish population of 10 million inhabitants in whom 843 invasive infrainguinal procedures (796 index procedures and 47 secondary procedures) were performed for IC in 2009. Index procedures were open surgery in 290 (37%) patients, bilateral in nine cases, giving a total of 299 limbs, endovascular treatment in 447 (58%) patients, bilateral in 10, giving a total of 457 limbs, and hybrid treatment in 38 (5%) patients, bilateral in two cases, giving a total of 40 limbs. Data were analysed both with regard to the number of patients (775) and the number of procedures (843). Clinical outcome was calculated from patient-reported leg function (unchanged, improved, deteriorated) and whether amputation had been necessary or death had occurred. Patent reconstruction at 1 year was also counted as improvement. RESULTS Improvement at 1 year was seen in 567 (73.2%) patients, (225 [77.6%] in the open surgery group, 320 [71.6%] in the endovascular treatment group, and 22 [57.9%] in the hybrid treatment group). No significant difference was found between the open surgery and endovascular treatment groups comprising 737/775 patients (p = .350). Hybrid treatment gave significantly worse results (p = .046). Fifty-seven (7.3%) patients reported unchanged limb function and 32 (4.1%) patients reported deterioration. Within 30 days two patients died and one patient underwent amputation. Within 1 year 10 patients underwent 11 amputations: five (1.7%) in the open surgery group, three (0.6%) in the endovascular treatment group, and two (7.5%) in the hybrid treatment group; one underwent bilateral amputation (p = .07). Twenty-two patients died: 10 (3.4%) in the open surgery group, 12 (2.7%) in the endovascular treatment group and none in the hybrid treatment group (p = .465). CONCLUSIONS Reported improvement at 1 year was 73.2% in patients invasively treated for infrainguinal IC. Patients reporting an unchanged or deteriorated clinical state are a considerable clinical challenge. Further studies to determine whether or not invasive treatment of infrainguinal IC is appropriate are justified.

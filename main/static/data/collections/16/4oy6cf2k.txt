Recently, there are several routes for COVID-19 vaccine research, yet their weaknesses lie in low efficiency, tolerability, immune adaptability and safety. We describe a new approach to COVID-19 based on engineered human mesenchymal stem cells(hu-MSC), which is like a small protein antigen response device, but will be gradually cleared and degraded by bodyâ€™s immune system among recognization process. The antibody response results show that this is effective and fast. Furthermore, after several antibody response tests, we obtained an injection of a set of cocktail-like modified human mesenchymal stem cell line. This strategy opened a new avenue for vaccine design against COVID-19.

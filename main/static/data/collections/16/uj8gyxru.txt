Background: A new pathogenic disease named COVID-19 became a global threat, first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The number of affected cases growing exponentially and now, more than 210 countries confirmed the cases. Objective: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate risk factors, the prevalence of comorbidity, and clinical characteristics in COVID-19 death patients compared to survival patients that can be used as a reference for further research and clinical decisions. Methods: PubMed, Science Direct, SAGE were searched to collect data about demographic, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities of confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 1, 2020, to May 17, 2020. Meta-analysis was performed with the use of Review Manager 5.3 Results: Eighty-five studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 67,299 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Males are severely affected or died than females (OR = 2.26, p < 0.00001; OR = 3.59, p < 0.00001) are severely affected, or died by COVID-19 and cases with age [≥]50 are at higher risk of death than age <50 years (OR=334.23). Presence of any comorbidity or comorbidities like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, liver disease, malignancy significantly increased the risk of death compared to survival (OR = 3.46, 3.16, 4.67, 2.45, 5.84, 2.68, 5.62, 2.81,2.16). Among the clinical characteristics such as fever, cough, myalgia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, fatigue, sputum production, chest tightness headache and nausea or vomiting, only fatigue (OR = 1.31, 95%) and dyspnea increased the death significantly (OR= 1.31, 4.57). The rate of death of COVID-19 cases is 0.03-times lower than the rate of survival (OR = 0.03). Conclusion Our result indicates that male patients are affected severely or died, the rate of death is more in the age [≥]50 group, and the rate of death is affected by comorbidities and clinical symptoms.

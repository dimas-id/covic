INTRODUCTION: Recently, the use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for adult patients with severe acute respiratory failure has increased. We previously investigated the optimal return cannula position; however, the optimal drainage cannula position has not yet been fully clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal drainage cannula position. METHODS: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed in four adult goats (mean body weight 59.6 ± 0.6 kg). The position of the drainage cannula was varied among the right atrium, the upper inferior vena cava, and the lower inferior vena cava, whereas the position of the return cannula was fixed in the superior vena cava. The recirculation fraction and arterial oxygen saturation and pressure (SaO2, PaO2) were measured in all drainage cannula positions. RESULTS: In the lower inferior vena cava drainage cannula position, the recirculation fraction was the lowest. In the lower inferior vena cava, upper inferior vena cava, and right atrium drainage cannula positions at 3 L/min, SaO2 and PaO2 after 20 min were 92.9% ± 4.9% and 75.1 ± 26.0 mm Hg, 99.5% ± 0.5% and 113.8 ± 20.9 mm Hg, and 93.8% ± 6.2% and 91.9 ± 17.7 mm Hg, respectively. CONCLUSION: With respect to blood oxygenation, the optimal position for the drainage cannula was the upper inferior vena cava. These findings suggested that blood from the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and hepatic vein was most efficiently drained in the upper inferior vena cava cannula position.

Host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns generated by invading viruses and initiate a series of signaling cascades that lead to the activation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and subsequent induction of type I interferons (IFNs). Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin plays an essential role in mediating or regulating the virus-triggered PRRs-mediated signaling. Deubiquitination is the reversible process of ubiquitination and its role in regulating PRRs-mediated signaling has recently been explored. In this review, we first summarize the ubiquitination events in PRRs-mediated signaling that is triggered by viral nucleic acid and then focus on host and viral deubiquitinating enzymes-mediated regulation of virus-triggered signaling that modulates the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB and subsequent induction of type I IFNs.

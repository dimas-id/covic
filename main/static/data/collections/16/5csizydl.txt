An inexpensive, disposable, integrated, polymer-based cassette for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of target nucleic acids was designed, fabricated, and tested. The LAMP chamber was equipped with single-use, thermally actuated valves made with a composite consisting of a mixture of PDMS and expandable microspheres. The effect of the composite composition on its expansion was investigated, and the valveâ€™s performance was evaluated. In its closed state, the valve can hold pressures as high as 200 kPa without any significant leakage. Both the LAMP chamber and the valves were actuated with thin film heaters. The utility of the cassette was demonstrated by carrying out LAMP of Escherichia coli DNA target and reverse transcribed loop meditated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) of RNA targets. The amplicons were detected in real time with a portable, compact detector. The system was capable of detecting as few as 10 target molecules per sample in well under 1 h. The portable, integrated cassette system described here is particularly suited for applications at the point of care and in resource-poor countries, where funds and trained personnel are in short supply.

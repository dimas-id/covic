Various PCR-based assays for rabbit viruses have gradually replaced traditional virologic assays, such as virus isolation, because they offer high-throughput analysis, better test sensitivity and specificity, and allow vaccine and wild-type virus strains to be fully typed and differentiated. In addition, PCR is irreplaceable in the detection of uncultivable or fastidious rabbit pathogens or those occurring in low quantity in a tested sample. We provide herein an overview of the current state of the art in the molecular detection of lagomorph viral pathogens along with details of their targeted gene or nucleic acid sequence and recommendations for their application. Apart from the nucleic acids-based methods used for identification and comprehensive typing of rabbit viruses, novel methods such as microarray, next-generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) could also be employed given that they offer greater throughput in sample screening for viral pathogens. Molecular methods should be provided with an appropriate set of controls, including an internal amplification control, to confirm the validity of the results obtained.

Coronoviraus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over two million people worldwide and the number keeps growing every day. While the pulmonary complications of COVID-19 are obvious, the effect of the virus on the other organs and the chronicity of the organ dysfunction remain unknown. The virus causes a debilitating infection with multiorgan injury and has a high mortality rate estimated to be around 3.70%. Several hypotheses are formulated to explain the liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients which include collateral damage from cytokine storm, drug-induced liver injury, viral-induced hepatitis and hypoxia-induced damage. Through this case series, we would like to highlight that liver enzyme abnormalities are often seen in COVID-19 patients and would like to highlight that physicians need to serially monitor biochemical testing until the liver enzymes return to baseline. Physicians also need to be vigilant of liver enzyme abnormalities in these patients, especially before starting new medications.

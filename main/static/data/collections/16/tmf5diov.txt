Botrytis cinerea is a polyphagous fungal pathogen causing gray mold disease. Moreover, it is one of the most destructive infections of small fruit crops such as pepper (Capsicum annnum L.). C. sativum is a species belonging to the Solanaceae family and Turkey is one of the main producers in the World. In the present work, aiming to obtain information useful for pest management, fifty B. cinerea isolates collected from Turkey and a reference isolate (B05.10) were characterized using molecular markers and fungicide resistance genes. Morphological and molecular (ITS1-ITS4) identification of B. cinerea isolates, the degree of virulence and mating types were determined. Since one or several allelic mutations in the histidine kinase (Bos1) and Î²-tubulin genes generally confer the resistance to fungicides, the sequences of these target genes were investigated in the selected isolates, which allowed the identification of two different haplotypes. Mating types were also determined by PCR assays using primer specific for MAT1-1 alpha gene (MAT1-1-1) and MAT1-2 HMG (MAT1-2-1) of B. cinerea. Twenty-two out of 50 isolates (44%) were MAT1-2, while 38% were MAT1-1. Interestingly, out of whole studied samples, 9 isolates (18%) were heterokaryotic or mixed colonies. In addition, cluster and population structure analyses identified five main groups and two genetic pools, respectively, underlining a good level of variability in the analysed panel. The results highlighted the presence of remarkable genetic diversity in B. cinerea isolates collected in a crucial economical area for pepper cultivation in Turkey and the data will be beneficial in view of future gray mold disease management.

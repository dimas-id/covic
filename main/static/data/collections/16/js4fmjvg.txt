INTRODUCTION Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a novel area of minimally invasive surgery using a single incision. The end result is a lone incision at the umbilicus for a perceived scarless abdomen. We report our early experience using the SILS technique for appendectomies in the pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on our first patients to undergo SILS appendectomy (SILS-A) or laparoscopic appendectomy (LAP-A) during the same period at a freestanding children's hospital. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were reviewed. Nineteen patients underwent SILS-A (8.7 +/- 0.76 [SEM] years old), and 20 patients underwent LAP-A (10.5 +/- 0.87 years old, 2-17). Ages were 19 months to 14 years in the SILS-A group, with 21% (4 patients) not older than 6 years. Median weight for SILS-A was 32 kg (14.5-80.3). Twelve patients had acute nonperforated appendicitis (62%). Mean duration of operation was 58 +/- 5.6 (30-135) minutes vs 43 +/- 3.6 (30-85) minutes for standard LAP-A. Two patients were converted to a transumbilical appendectomy, one for inability to maintain a pneumoperitoneum and one for extensive adhesions. Postoperative complications consisted of one wound seroma. No wound infections, hernias, readmissions, or difference in length of stay were noted. CONCLUSION The SILS approach for acute appendicitis is feasible in the pediatric population even in patients as young as 19 months. Operating room times are somewhat longer than with LAP-A, but should decrease with improved instrumentation and experience. Larger studies and further technical refinements are needed before its widespread implementation.

Data on the serological response towards SARS CoV-2 in 16 recent reports were analyzed and a high degree of variability was shown. IgM responses were either found earlier than IgG, or together with IgG, later than IgG or were missing. Therefore, clear distinctions between early, intermediate and past infections are obviously not possible merely on the basis of IgM and IgG determinations. The review of publications on the serology of other virus groups shows that variable IgM responses can be found as well and therefore are not specific for SARS CoV-2 infections. A model to explain this variability is proposed. The inclusion of avidity determination into regular diagnostic procedures has allowed to resolve such "atypical" serological constellations. The potential use of avidity determination for the diagnosis of Covid-19, for risk assessment, epidemiological studies, analysis of cross reactions, as well as for the control of vaccination programs is suggested and discussed.

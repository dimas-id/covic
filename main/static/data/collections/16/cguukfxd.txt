Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a complex illness involving the activation of multiple pathways leading to lung injury, resolution and repair. Since the first description of ALI, a great deal of effort has been devoted to exploring the roles of individual pathways in humans and animal models. These have led to a much greater understanding of the complexity of ALI and the links between ALI and systemic multiorgan failure. Despite progress in many areas, we still do not have an integrated understanding of the initiating factors, the key steps in the progression of ALI, and the central processes involved in repair. Although animal models have suggested a range of new hypotheses for study, the major need is for a better understanding of how pathways interact to explain the complexity of the human ALI syndrome and how complementary treatments can be used simultaneously or sequentially to modify the onset, severity and outcome of ALI in humans.

The use of direct electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy for the identification of bovine coronavirus and type A rotavirus were examined. Two hundred and forty-nine samples from diarrheic calves and winter dysenteric cattle from seven geographic areas in Quebec were examined for the presence of viruses by direct electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations. In addition, all the samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and a random selection of 47 samples were also analyzed by protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy. Thirty-nine percent of samples examined by direct electron microscopy contained viral particles; bovine coronavirus and type A rotavirus were the most common viruses involved. Overall agreement between any two of the methods used compared favorably with results obtained by others using similar methods. The presence of coronavirus and rotavirus in fecal samples obtained from neonatal calves and the presence of coronavirus in samples from winter dysenteric adult cattle suggested their etiological roles in the respective diseases. Furthermore, results from protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy of coronavirus-like particles implied that a different coronavirus or some other viruses might be involved in these diseases. Finally, the efficiency of direct electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy as diagnostic tools is discussed.

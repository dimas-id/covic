The SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic poses major challenges for the entire medical care system. Especially in maximum care clinical facilities, a higher exposure to potentially infectious patients or positively tested COVID-19 patients is to be expected. A hospital facility concept was developed in the Department of Ophthalmology, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany with the aim of achieving maximum patient safety with maximum employee protection. The current infection control hygiene recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the leading specialist association, were taken into consideration along with the existing hospital hygiene plan of the University Hospital Frankfurt am Main. Incorporated into the developmental process were the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene, the occupational medical service department and the board of the University Hospital Frankfurt am Main. The operational concept with individualized measures ensures that (i) the care of outpatients; (ii) the performance of outpatient operations; (iii) and the care of admitted patients and patients undergoing surgery are also guaranteed during the COVID-19 pandemic. All measures have been documented in writing in the clinic’s internal quality manual and are thus accessible to all employees. The concept is regularly checked for functionality, so-called stress tests and hygiene inspections are carried out and improvements are made as necessary.

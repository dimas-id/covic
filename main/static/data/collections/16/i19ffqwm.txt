The comparative analysis of five completely sequenced Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes demonstrated that their diversification was achieved by a combination of DNA recombination events and an accumulation of point mutations. The five phages included lytic and temperate phages, both pac site and cos site, from three distinct geographical areas. The units of genetic exchange were either large, comprising the entire morphogenesis gene cluster, excluding the putative tail fiber genes, or small, consisting of one or maximally two genes or even segments of a gene. Many indels were flanked by DNA repeats. Differences in a single putative tail fiber gene correlated with the host ranges of the phages. The predicted tail fiber protein consisted of highly conserved domains containing conspicuous glycine repeats interspersed with highly variable domains. As in the T-even coliphage adhesins, the glycine-containing domains were recombinational hot spots. Downstream of a highly conserved DNA replication region, all lytic phages showed a short duplication; in three isolates the origin of replication was repeated. The lytic phages could conceivably be derived from the temperate phages by deletion and multiple rearrangement events in the lysogeny module, giving rise to occasional selfish phages that defy the superinfection control systems of the corresponding temperate phages.

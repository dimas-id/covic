A castrated male Shih-Tzu dog was presented for evaluation of urine leakage after urethrotomy. A fistula with urine leakage was identified in the perineal region. On retrograde urethrography, the contrast extravasated from the penile urethra into the subcutaneous tissue of the perineum. Urine leakage with urethrocutaneous fistula was diagnosed. During surgery, the disrupted urethra wall and two urethral defects were identified. A fascia lata autograft was used, rather than primary repair of the urethra. Two pieces of fascia lata were harvested and sutured to the urethral defects. The fistula was treated with debridement and drainage. No evidence of urine leakage and dysuria was noted 6 months postoperatively. Thus, this case report describes successful urethral reconstruction using a fascia lata autograft.

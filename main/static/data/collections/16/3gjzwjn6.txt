The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased dramatically over the past two decades, mostly due to an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients.1â€“4 Patients who undergo chemotherapy for a variety of diseases, patients with organ transplants, and patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome have contributed most to the increase in fungal infections.5 The actual incidence of invasive fungal infections in transplant patients ranges from 15% to 25% in bone marrow transplant recipients to 5% to 42% in solid organ transplant recipients.6,7 The most frequently encountered are Aspergillus species, followed by Cryptococcus and Candida species. Fungal infections are also associated with a higher mortality than either bacterial or viral infections in these patient populations. This is because of the limited number of available therapies, dose-limiting toxicities of the antifungal drugs, fewer symptoms due to lack of inflammatory response, and the lack of sensitive tests to aid in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.1 A study of patients with fungal infections admitted to a university-affiliated hospital indicated that community-acquired infections are becoming a serious problem; 67% of the 140 patients had community-acquired fungal pneumonia.8

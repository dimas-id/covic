Diagnostic tests for respiratory viral infections use traditionally either nasopharyngeal washes or swabs. Sputum is representative of the lower respiratory tract but is used rarely for viral testing. The aim of this study was to compare the detection rates of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum using a multiplex real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Adults who were admitted or presented to the clinics of Gil Medical Center with acute respiratory symptoms were recruited from 1 November 2012 to 31 March 2013. Paired specimens of nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were obtained from 154 subjects, and RNA was extracted and tested for 16 different respiratory viruses using the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The positive rate was 53% (81/154) for nasopharyngeal swabs and 68% (105/154) for sputum (P < 0.001). One hundred thirty‐four viruses were identified for 107 illnesses. Influenza A virus, RSV A, HRV, coronavirus OC43, and adenovirus were detected more frequently in sputum samples than in nasopharyngeal swabs (P < 0.001). Importantly, 12 of 44 (27%) influenza A infections and 11 of 27 (41%) RSV infections were positive in only sputum samples. The detection rates of respiratory viruses from sputum samples were significantly higher than those from nasopharyngeal swabs in adults using real‐time multiplex RT‐PCR. These findings suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of respiratory viruses by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in patients who produce sputum. Further studies are needed to establish standardized RNA extraction methods from sputum samples. J. Med. Virol. 86:2122–2127, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Objective The treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis is a major therapeutic challenge. Various treatments include observation, medical management, and surgical management. The most effective surgical management is resection and reconstruction. To the authors' knowledge, no reports have described the use of xenogenic acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for laryngotracheal stenosis. Methods A 27-year-old man presented with hemoptysis of the neck due to a traffic accident. Emergency orotracheal intubation was performed. Tracheostomy was then performed under local anesthesia. Computed tomography revealed fractures of the right thyroid cartilage and posterior arc of the cricoid cartilage and stenosis of the subglottis and first and second tracheal rings. We used a composite hyoid-sternohyoid osseomuscular flap with xenogenic ADM and a straight silicone tube as a lumen stent to reconstruct the laryngotracheal stenosis. Results Surgical recovery was uneventful. The tracheotomy opening was changed to a metal tube 5 days postoperatively. Four months postoperatively, the silicone tube was endoscopically removed under local anesthesia. The patient was decannulated 20 days later. The patient satisfied with his voice, respiration, and deglutition at the 16-month postoperative follow-up. Conclusion The use of ADM for laryngotracheal stenosis may reduce the growth of granulation tissues and promote the repair process.

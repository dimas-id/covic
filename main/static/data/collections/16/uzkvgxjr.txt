OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of rhinovirus infection in hospitalized young infants with acute bronchiolitis. METHODS Hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis admitted to the Hospital SÃ£o Lucas/PUCRS between May and September 2002 were selected prospectively. Nasopharyngeal samples were assayed for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, influenza and adenovirus by immunofluorescence. For rhinovirus test a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for picornavirus was used, followed by hybridization with rhinovirus specific probes. RESULTS Forty-five patients were selected for the study. The median age of the subjects studied was 2 months. Positive samples for respiratory viruses were found in 35/45 (77.8%) subjects and 7/35 (20%) patients had dual infection. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 33/35 (94%) cases. Rhinovirus was detected in 6/35 patients (17%). CONCLUSIONS Rhinovirus was the second most common agent detected in nasal secretions from young infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis.

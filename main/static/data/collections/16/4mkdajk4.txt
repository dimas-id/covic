OBJECTIVES Sepsis is characterised by the frequent presence of organ failure and marked immunologic alterations. We studied the association between the extent of organ failure and the transcriptomic response of septic patients. METHODS Gene expression profiles in the blood of 74 surgical patients with sepsis were compared with those of 30 surgical patients with no sepsis. Differentially expressed genes were assessed for their correlation with the sequential organ failure (SOFA) score. RESULTS The expression levels of a group of genes participating in the cell cycle (HIST1H1C, CKS2, CCNA2, CDK1, CCNB2, CIT, CCNB1, AURKA, RAD51), neutrophil protease activity (ELANE, ADORA3, MPO, MMP8, CTSG), IL-1R and IL-18R response correlated directly with SOFA and mortality. Genes involved in T cell (LCK, CD3G, CD3D, ZAP70, ICOS, CD3E, CD28, IL2RB, CD8B, CD8A, CD40LG, IL23A, CCL5, SH2D1A, ITK, CD247, TBX21, GATA3, CCR7, LEF1, STAT4) and NK cell immunity (CD244, KLRK1, KLRD1) were inversely associated with SOFA and mortality. CONCLUSIONS The extent of organ failure in sepsis correlates directly with the existence of imbalanced innate and adaptive responses at the transcriptomic level. Quantification of the expression levels of the genes identified here could contribute to the simultaneous assessment of disease severity and immunological alterations in sepsis.

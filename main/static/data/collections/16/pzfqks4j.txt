Grape juice is a source of polyphenols, as catechin, anthocyanidins, resveratrol, and others. Some health benefits have been attributed to these compounds (e.g., antioxidant and antitumorigenic properties). In this study, we investigated the possible antioxidant activity of two different grape juices: organic purple grape juice and conventional purple grape juice. The antioxidant activity of both grape juices was evaluated by an animal model of three groups: control and organic and conventional juices. After 30 days, all animals were sacrificed, and blood and liver were collected to evaluate lipid peroxidation level (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS] assay), protein oxidative level (carbonyl assay), and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. The group treated with organic grape juice showed the highest SOD and CAT activities in both plasma and liver when compared with the conventional and control groups (P < .05). In plasma, we observed a positive correlation among SOD and CAT activities, resveratrol, and all anthocyanin contents, suggesting that these polyphenols may be, at least in part, responsible for this increased antioxidant defense. The grape juices were capable of reducing carbonyl and lipid peroxidation levels in plasma and liver. However, in plasma, the organic group showed lower carbonyl and TBARS levels when compared to the conventional grape juice group (P < .05). Our findings suggest that the intake of purple grape juice, especially of organic juice, induces a better antioxidant capacity when compared to conventional juice and that this may be an important issue for further investigations in the area of biochemical functional foods.

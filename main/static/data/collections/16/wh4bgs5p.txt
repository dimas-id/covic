Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) requires an intentional perforation of a hollow lumen to pass an endoscope into an otherwise inaccessible body cavity with diagnostic or therapeutic intent. The limitations of current flexible instruments for this purpose are outlined, including the unsuitability for NOTES of current flexible needle knives, guidewires, balloons, overtubes, grasping forceps, and scissors. The development of novel suturing instruments, trocars, articulating instruments, flexible bipolar forceps, flexible clips, magnetic devices, and staplers as well as the advent of manual mechanical manipulators for flexible accessories is outlined. New instrument solutions for endosurgery are described, such as articulating flexible accessories for gastroscopes, novel "platforms" that can be rigidized, and unconventional scope arrangements. Debatably, the greatest current benefit of NOTES is that it may lead to further development of better instrumentation for endosurgery.

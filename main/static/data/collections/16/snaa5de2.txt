BACKGROUND: Clinically meaningful endpoints for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) treatment trials are lacking for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We evaluated supplemental oxygen use among HCT recipients with RSV infection. METHODS: Subjects were grouped according to the presence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) without lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), URTI progressing to LRTI, and LRTI at presentation. LRTI was defined as a positive lower respiratory tract sample with or without radiographic abnormality (defined as proven or probable LRTI, respectively) or a positive upper respiratory tract sample with radiographic abnormality (possible LRTI). Supplemental oxygen–free days were defined as any day while alive after diagnosis of RSV infection during which ≤2 L of supplemental oxygen per minute was received. RESULTS: Among 230 patients, supplemental oxygen use by day 28 after the first diagnosis of RSV infection was lowest in patients presenting with URTI (31 of 197 [16%]). Supplemental oxygen use was lower in patients with possible LRTI (12 of 45 [27%]) than in those with proven/probable LRTI (29 of 42 [69%]). Patients presenting with proven/probable LRTI had a median of 16 fewer supplemental oxygen–free days than those presenting with URTI (P < .0001). Death only occurred among patients with proven/probable LRTI (11 of 42 [26%]). CONCLUSIONS: Confirmation of RSV infection in the lower respiratory tract provides prognostic information that may help prioritize therapies. Supplemental oxygen–free days as a clinical endpoint may allow smaller sample sizes for trials evaluating RSV antivirals.

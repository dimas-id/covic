Abstract Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) have attracted growing attention from transportation industry because of their superior performance over metal counterparts. The thermoforming process has been invented for mass-production of CFRP parts. This thermoforming process involves multiple steps and numerous parameters, and one of the most important process parameters is the initial blank geometry. To optimize blank geometry in thermoforming and minimize trimming work for the final part, an innovative approach integrating automatic mesh adjustment and FEA modeling method for preforming is developed as foundation of design and reported in this paper. Preliminary trial-and-error optimization algorithm demonstrates that this newly-developed approach can accurately design blank geometry under various typical process conditions.

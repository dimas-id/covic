The cell surface membrane is the boundary between a cell and its environment. In case of polarized epithelial cells, the apical plasma membrane is frequently the boundary between an organism and its environment. The plasmalemma possesses the elements that endow a cell with the capacity to converse with its environment. Plasmalemmal receptor and transducer proteins allow the cell to recognize and respond to various external influences. Membrane-associated proteins anchor cells to their substrata and mediate their integration into tissues. Many properties of a given cell type may be attributed to the protein composition of its plasma membrane. Most cells go to large lengths to control the nature and distribution of polypeptides that populate their plasmalemmas. Cells regulate the expression of genes encoding plasma membrane proteins. Proteins destined for the insertion into the plasma membrane pass through a complex system of processing organelles prior to arriving at their site of ultimate functional residence. Each of these organelles makes a unique contribution to the maturation of these proteins as they transit through them. This chapter discusses the postsynthetic steps involved in the biogenesis of plasma membrane proteins. The chapter discusses some of the events common to all plasmalemmal polypeptides, with special emphasis on those that contribute directly to the character of the cell surface. The chapter then discusses the specializations, associated with cell types, possessing differentiated cell surface sub-domains. The chapter highlights some of the important and fascinating questions confronting investigators interested in the cell biology of the plasma membrane.

Respiratory disease due to infectious disease is one of the most common presentations in rats but the cause is in many cases multifactorial. Predisposing factors are generally related to poor husbandry and diet. Respiratory disease is caused primarily by infectious agents such as Mycoplasma pulmonis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium kutscheri, cilia associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus, Sendai virus and coronavirus. Other causes are cardiovascular diseases, neoplastic diseases and trauma of the upper and lower respiratory tract. A presumptive diagnosis can be made by good history and physical examination. However, many diagnostic tests are best performed under general anaesthesia. Medical treatment generally includes oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, analgesia and administration of antibiotics, the use of mucolytic agents and bronchodilators and supportive care. Medications can be administrated orally, parentally or via nebulisation.

The enteric nervous system (ENS) derives from the neural crest and innervates the gastrointestinal system, in which it is essential for gut function throughout life. A new paper in Development uses zebrafish to investigate the poorly understood process of post-embryonic ENS neurogenesis, in both development and injury contexts. To find out more, we met the paper's two authors, Wael Noor El-Nachef, Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine at UCLA, and Marianne Bronner, Albert Billings Ruddock Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering at Caltech.

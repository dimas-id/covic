BACKGROUND: Infection related to Coronavirus-19 (CoV-2) is pandemic affecting more than 4 million people in 187 countries worldwide. By May, 10 2020 it caused more than 280.000 deaths all over the world. Preliminary data reported a high prevalence of CoV-2 infection and mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related to CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in kidney transplanted patients (KTRs). Nevertheless, the outcomes and the best treatments for SARS-CoV-2 affected KTRs remain unclear. METHODS: In this report we describe the clinical data, the treatments and the outcomes of 5 KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our hospital in Ancona, Marche region, Italy, from March, 17 to present. Due to the severity of SARS-CoV-2, immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites and mTOR-inhibitors were stopped at the admission. All KTRs were treated with low-dose steroids. 4/5 KTRs were treated with hydroxychloroquine. All KTRs received tocilizumab up to one dose. RESULTS: Overall, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs in the Marche region was 0.85%. 3/5 were admitted in ICU and intubated. One developed AKI with the need of CRRT with Cytosorb. At present 2 patients died, 2 patients were discharged and one is still inpatient in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The critical evaluation of all cases suggests that the timing of the administration of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, could be associated with a better efficacy when administered in concomitance to the drop of the oxygen saturation. Thus, in SARS-CoV-2 affected KTRs a close biochemical and clinical monitoring should be set up to allow physicians to hit the virus in the right moment such as a sudden reduction of the oxygen saturation and/or a significant increase of the laboratory values such as D-Dimer.

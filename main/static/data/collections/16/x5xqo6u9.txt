This study analysed the transport behaviour of the glycoprotein E2 of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) expressed from recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV). E2 protein was found to be retained at an intracellular compartment. A chimeric protein containing the membrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail of the VSV G protein, E2-G(MT), was transported to the cell surface. Only the latter protein was incorporated into rVSV particles in significant amounts. A soluble form of E2 lacking the membrane anchor, E2(MTdel), appeared to be affected in conformational stability. In contrast to both membrane-anchored forms of E2, expression of the soluble form was detectable only by immunofluorescence microscopy but not by Western blotting. These results are in agreement with reports of intracellular retention of the E2 protein due to a retention signal in the membrane anchor. However, in another analysis of E2 expressed from rVSV, E2 protein was reported to be transported to the cell surface and incorporated into VSV particles [Grigera, P. R., Marzocca, M. P., Capozzo, A. V. E., Buonocore, L., Donis, R. O. & Rose, J. K. (2000). Virus Res 69, 3-15]. Reasons for these contradictory results are discussed.

With a view to detecting infections and carriage of human respiratory viruses in wild birds, 349 serum samples collected from 21 bird species -- sedentary ones and birds with large or limited migration areas -- were investigated. The following antigens were used: influenza virus A/Hong Kong 1/68 (H3N2)), A2 England 42/73 (H3N2), A2 Victoria 3/75 (H3N2), A/New Jersey 8/76 (HswN1), B/Hong Kong 5/72; parainfluenza virus type I Sendai and type II, coronavirus OC/43. An elevated incidence of antibodies to A2 Victoria 3/75 (H3N2) and parainfluenza type I virus was detected in herons (Ardea cinerea, Nyctycorax myctycorax). The high incidence of antibodies to B/Hong Kong 5/72 (30.7% of the samples exhibited significant titers) found in the crow (Corvus corone sardonius) is ascribed to the fact that this bird is carnivorus, feeding on corpses of mammals.

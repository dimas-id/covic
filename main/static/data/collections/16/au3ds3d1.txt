COVID-19 is associated with a high prevalence of activation of the coagulation cascade. It has been suggested that this so-called COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is predictive of a poor outcome and of mortality. Consensus documents on how to manage patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are based on the limited number of mainly retrospective studies that is currently available, and for this reason the recommendations are not always consistent with one another. In this article, we review the first studies into COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and give the most important do's and don'ts for diagnostics and the daily management of coagulopathy and the prevention of complications in patients with, or with strongly-suspected, COVID-19 in Dutch clinical practice.

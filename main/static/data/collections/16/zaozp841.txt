Due to the outbreak of COVID‐19, many healthcare providers face the problem of lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) including face shields.(1‐3) However, we need to protect ourselves using standard PPE and continue to perform necessary endoscopic procedures. Skamnelos et. al reported a method to handmake face shields by attaching a sponge and an elastic band to an A4‐size OHP transparent sheet.(4) Yet, preparing such materials in large numbers can be difficult. To solve this problem, we present an alternate, easy method to make face shields with low‐cost materials along with the A4‐size OHP transparent sheet.

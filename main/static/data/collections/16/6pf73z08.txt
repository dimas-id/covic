The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2- SARS-CoV-2), has greatly burdened the global healthcare system and led it into crisis in several countries Lack of targeted therapeutics led to the idea of repurposing broad-spectrum drugs for viral intervention In vitro analyses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)'s anecdotal benefits prompted its widespread clinical repurposing globally Reports of emerging cardiovascular complications due to its clinical prescription are revealing the crucial role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a target receptor for SARS-CoV-2 In the present settings, a clear understanding of these targets, their functional aspects and physiological impact on cardiovascular function are critical In an up-to-date format, we shed light on HCQ's anecdotal function in stalling SARS-CoV-2 replication and immunomodulatory activities While starting with the crucial role of ACE2, we here discuss the impact of HCQ on systemic cardiovascular function, its associated risks, and the scope of HCQ-based regimes in current clinical settings Citing the extent of HCQ efficacy, the key considerations and recommendations for the use of HCQ in clinics are further discussed Taken together, this review provides crucial insights into the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-led cardiovascular activity, and concurrently assesses the efficacy of HCQ in contemporary clinical settings

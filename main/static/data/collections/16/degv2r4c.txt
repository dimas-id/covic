In vitro studies on glial cell changes in canine distemper virus (CDV) infection could be useful for the understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelination in vivo in this disease. Mixed glial cell cultures derived from neonatal mice and dogs were infected with CDV and examined using immunocytochemical techniques demonstrating specific oligodendroglial and astroglial cell markers. Astrocytic changes were similar in both murine and canine cultures and consisted of loss of processes, cell fusion, and cell necrosis. Marked oligodendroglial lesions were apparent in the canine brain cultures and were characterized by focal perikaryal protrusions, swelling and loss of cell processes, and cell necrosis. Fusion between oligodendrocytes was not observed. Fusion between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes could not be documented with double labeling techniques. In contrast to the canine cultures, murine oligodendrocytes remained relatively unaffected by the infection. These findings were discussed with respect to cell pathology and mechanisms of demyelination in vivo. The exact nature of the canine oligodendroglial lesions in vitro needs to be studied in further experiments.

The translation frame-monitoring mechanism has been suggested earlier, based on transient complementary contacts, between mRNA and rRNA. Recent studies related to the frame-monitoring mechanism are reviewed. The mechanism is well supported by both new experimental and sequence analysis data. Experiments are suggested for further elucidation of the structural details of the mRNA-rRNA interaction in the ribosome.

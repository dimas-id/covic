Abstract A series of heterocyclic compounds were designed as potential nonnucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Although the compounds ultimately proved inactive against HIV, during the course of the synthesis, a new and highly facile method to realize N-phenylacetamides was developed. Notably, the new route avoids the intractable workups and byproducts previously reported procedures have been associated with, thereby making this approach highly attractive to adaptation with other heterocyclics.

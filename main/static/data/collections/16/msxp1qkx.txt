Background: Identification of prognostic factors in COVID-19 remains a global challenge. The role of smoking is still controversial. Objective: To evaluate the rate of daily smokers in patients with COVID-19. Methods: COVID-19 in-and outpatients from a large French university hospital were systematically interviewed for their smoking status, use of e-cigarette and nicotinic substitutes. The rates of daily smokers in in-and outpatients were compared to those in the 2019 French general population, after standardization for sex and age. Results: The inpatient group was composed of 340 patients, median age 66 years: 203 men (59.7%) and 137 women (40.3%), median age for both 66 years, with a daily smokers rate of 4.1 % CI95% [2.3-6.9] (5.4% of men, 2.2% of women). The outpatient group was composed of 139 patients, median age 44 years: 62 men (44.6%, median age 43 years), and 77 women (55.4%, median age 44 years). The daily smoker rate was 6.1 % CI 95% [2.7-11.6] (5.1% of men, 6.8% of women). In the 2019 French population, the daily smoker rate was 24.0% (27.5% of men, 20.7% of women). Among inpatients, daily smokers represented 2.2% and 3.4% of the 45 dead patients and of the 29 patients transferred to ICU, respectively. The rate of daily smokers was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients, as compared to that in the French general population after standardization by age and sex, with Standardized Incidence Ratios of 0.24 [0.12-0.48] for outpatients and 0.24 [0.14-0.40] for inpatients. Conclusion: Daily smokers rate in patients with symptomatic COVID-19 is lower as compared to the general population

Abstract Cathepsins, endosomal acid proteases, are transported from the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). We have previously demonstrated that some rotavirus strains, like UK, Wa, WI61, DS-1, and YM, require the cation-dependent (CD-) M6PR and cathepsins to enter from late endosomes to the cytoplasm in MA104 cells, while other strains, like the simian strain RRV, which enter cells from maturing endosomes, do not. However, the role of other trans-Golgi network-late endosome transporters, such as the cation-independent (CI-) M6PR and sortillin-1, has not been evaluated. In this work, we found that several rotavirus strains that require the CD-M6PR for cell entry are also dependent on CI-M6PR and sortilin-1. Furthermore, we showed that the infectivity of all these rotavirus strains also requires cathepsins to enter not only MA104 cells, but also human intestinal Caco-2 cells. This study identifies sortilin-1 as a novel cell factor necessary for the infectivity of a virus; in addition, our results strongly suggest that cathepsins could be common cell factors needed for the infectivity of most rotavirus strains.

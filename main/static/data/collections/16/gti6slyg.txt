PURPOSE Lichtenstein repair has been the gold standard in inguinal hernia surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of mesh fixation in terms of postsurgical chronic pain and recurrence. METHODS Sixty patients with primary inguinal hernias were treated between March 2007 and December 2008. Thirty patients underwent conventional Lichtenstein repair while a self-adhesive mesh was used for the second group. The primary outcome parameters were the rate of recurrence and chronic pain. The operating time, postoperative pain, complications, and time when patients returned to work were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-one patients completed the survey. Early pain scores were lower in the self-adhesive mesh group. The main advantage of the self-adhesive mesh was the shorter operating time (23.70 ± 5.57 vs 36.90 ± 11.36, P = 0.006). Both techniques were almost identical in terms of long-term chronic pain (P = 0.294), and the rates of recurrence at the end of a median of 31 months' follow-up were identical. CONCLUSION Self-adhesive mesh repair of inguinal hernias is superior to the conventional Lichtenstein method in terms of shorter operative time and less pain in the early postoperative period. The rates of chronic pain and recurrence are similar with the suture-fixed repairs.

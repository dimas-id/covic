Camelids (llamas, alpacas, vicu√±as, guanacos) are important for the economy of South America and Eimeria infections are important as cause of mortality in camelids. Of the five most prevalent species of Eimeria in South American camelids, Eimeria macusaniensis, Eimeria lamae, Eimeria alpacae, Eimeria punoensis, and Eimeria ivitaensis, E. macusaniensis is considered the most pathogenic. There is considerable confusion concerning the endogenous developmental stages of Eimeria spp. in camelids. Many papers on camelid coccidiosis were published in local Peruvian journals, not easily accessible to wider audience. The objective of the present paper is to summarize information on history, validity of Eimeria species, life cycle, pathogenicity, prevalence, epidemiology, diagnosis, and control of coccidiosis in camelids.

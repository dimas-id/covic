Abstract In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an overwhelming number of clinical trials have been registered to test a variety of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as comprehensively summarized by Lythgoe and Middleton [1]. Under such an urgent circumstance, the quality of these clinical studies is inevitably of serious concerns. Here, we propose applying prospective meta-analysis approaches to maximize their values, and to minimize research waste and bias of the ongoing and future COVID-19 trials.

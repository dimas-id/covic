The results of detection and identification of Bacillus anthracis strains in loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) reaction performed under optimized conditions with original primers and thermostable DNA polymerase are presented. Reproducible LAMP-based detection of chromosomal and plasmid DNA targets specific for B. anthracis strains has been demonstrated. No cross reactions with DNA from bacterial strains of other species of the B. cereus group were detected. The development of tests for anthrax-pathogen detection based on the optimized reaction of loop isothermal DNA amplification is planned. These tests will be convenient for clinical studies and field diagnostics due to the absence of requirements for sophisticated equipment.

Influenza‐like‐illness can be caused by a wide range of respiratory viruses. The etiology of influenza‐like‐illness in developing countries such as Papua New Guinea is poorly understood. The etiological agents associated with influenza‐like‐illness were investigated retrospectively for 300 nasopharyngeal swabs received by the Papua New Guinea National Influenza Centre in 2010. Real‐time PCR/RT‐PCR methods were used for the detection of 13 respiratory viruses. Patients with influenza‐like‐illness were identified according to the World Health Organization case definition: sudden onset of fever (>38°C), with cough and/or sore throat, in the absence of other diagnoses. At least one viral respiratory pathogen was detected in 66.3% of the samples tested. Rhinoviruses (17.0%), influenza A (16.7%), and influenza B (12.7%) were the pathogens detected most frequently. Children <5 years of age presented with a significantly higher rate of at least one viral pathogen and a significantly higher rate of co‐infections with multiple viruses, when compared to all other patients >5 years of age. Influenza B, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were all detected at significantly higher rates in children <5 years of age. This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses are circulating and contributing to the presentation of influenza‐like‐illness in Papua New Guinea. J. Med.

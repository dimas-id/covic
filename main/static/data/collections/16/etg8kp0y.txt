Transplantation has become a valid therapeutic option for an increasing number of patients with end-stage organ disease. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection and associated disease (COVID-19) has alarmed the transplant community, since recommendations for adequate follow-up of organ transplant recipients during the acute phase of a pandemic are limited. Furthermore, treatment options against COVID-19 disease and adequate adjustment of immunosuppression in at risk patients remain a concern. This review summarizes current knowledge on the incidence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with solid organ transplantation. It also discusses therapeutic strategies and provides general recommendations on how to proceed with transplantation programs in a time when health care resources may become scarce.

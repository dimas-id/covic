Through the analysis of the engineering management training system, we know that the courses in the system can be divided into theoretical, practical and experimental courses. We aims to develop an examination management system by restructuring the evaluation process of the three types of courses. And the organizational structure, hardware architecture, and software architecture of the test management system are designed to be applied in the entire process of system development, operation and maintenance. Besides, under the influence of “the pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus, COVID-19” on education, we wish that the examination management system is more suitable for the needs of the macro environment, and the results can be used to the training and evaluation of other professionals.

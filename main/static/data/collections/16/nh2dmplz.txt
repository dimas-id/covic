BACKGROUND Leiomyosarcomas typically originate in smooth muscle cell. Leiomyosarcoma potentially arising from the adrenal gland is an extremely rare mesenchymal tumors associated with delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION A 34-year-old man visited our department complaining of right hypochondriac pain. Computed tomography demonstrated a solid mass measuring 5.2 cm in diameter above the right kidney, corresponding to the right adrenal gland, and a lymph node mass, which appeared to have invaded the IVC wall. Right adrenalectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed. A microscopic examination revealed primary adrenal leiomyosarcoma with lymph node metastasis. No adjuvant therapy was performed, and the patient remains recurrence-free at 10 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS We experienced a very rare case of primary adrenal leiomyosarcoma. Aggressive surgical resection including vascular reconstruction may be associated with improved survival.

OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV infection, and sexual risk behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jiangsu Province, China. DESIGN : The authors conducted a cross-sectional study. METHODS : From February to July 2003, men who attended 10 participating gay bars in five cities in Jiangsu Province were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire, including measures of alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors. Blood samples and urethral swabs were taken to examine the presence of STDs, including HIV infection. RESULTS : A total of 144 men were recruited in the study. Forty-six percent of men reported unprotected anal intercourse with their male sexual partners in the past 3 months. No one was found to be HIV-infected, but the prevalence of STDs was high: gonorrhea 2.7%, chlamydial infection 8.0%, nonchlamydial nongonococcal urethritis 27.7%, active syphilis 6.9%, hepatitis B virus infection 9.1%, herpes simplex virus-2 infection 7.8%, and genital warts 13.2%. CONCLUSIONS : Given that HIV prevalence among MSM in some other parts of China has been as high as 3%, STDs facilitate the transmission of HIV, and high prevalence of STDs and sexual risk behaviors among MSM exist in Jiangsu Province, the potential for the future spread of HIV is of concern, and it is urgent to provide MSMs with STD healthcare services and HIV/AIDS/STD prevention education and intervention.

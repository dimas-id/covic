A significant challenge facing the field of rheumatology is the projected gap between the growing demand for rheumatologists and the available workforce. In order to improve access to care, augmenting the rheumatology workforce is required. Herein we discuss potential solutions to the anticipated workforce shortage, including 1) expanding the training of rheumatology physicians; 2) increasing nurse practitioner, physician assistant and pharmacist utilization in rheumatology practice; 3) growing the use of telemedicine; and 4) reducing burnout in order to retain practicing rheumatologists. Building on the existing literature in these areas, we propose a multifaceted approach to addressing the rheumatology workforce shortage.

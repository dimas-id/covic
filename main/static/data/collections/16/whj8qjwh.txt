We have read with great interest the paper by Leung et al. published in European Respiratory Journal [1], the correspondence by Russo et al. [2] and also the subsequent comment by the first group [3]. Both research teams are reporting increased ACE-2 expression in airways of current smokers and those with COPD with important implications for COVID-19 patients. Since ACE-2 has been shown to be the main receptor utilised by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells [2], the authors conclude that nicotine is a risk factor for COVID-19 pandemic. Russo et al. [2] have shown that nicotine up-regulates ACE-2 through alpha7 nAChRs which are present in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Leung et al. [3] provided further evidence in support of this hypothesis and propose the repurposing of alpha7-nAChR antagonists for the pandemic (e.g. methyllycaconitine, alpa-conotoxin), expecting that such treatment will alter ACE-2 expression and prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry.

BACKGROUND: There is little information about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with underlying chronic renal pathologies. CASES REPORT: From March until April 15, 2020, 16 children with chronic renal pathologies were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Spain. Of these, 6 had end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (3 transplant recipients and 3 on chronic hemodialysis). The severity of symptoms was mild in all the patients, with little radiological involvement. Three patients were asymptomatic. Fever and upper respiratory symptoms were the most frequent findings. Basal glomerular filtration worsened in 3 patients; however, recovery was rapidly achieved with rehydration and drug dose adjustment. In 2 patients diagnosed with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, COVID-19 provoked a disease relapse. None required oxygen therapy, and 7 could be managed as outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 disease appears to have a similar clinical course in children with underlying chronic renal pathologies, even in immunosuppressed cases, as in healthy children of the same age; however, special attention must be paid to fluid management and drug dose adjustment.

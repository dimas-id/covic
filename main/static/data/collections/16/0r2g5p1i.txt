PCV3 capsid protein (Cap) is an important antigen for diagnosis and vaccine development. To achieve high-level expression of recombinant PCV3 Cap in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the gene of wild-type entire Cap (wt-eCap) was amplified from clinical samples, and three optimized entire Cap (opti-eCap) and one optimized Cap deleted nuclear location signal (NLS) (opti-dCap) gene fragments encoding the same amino acid sequence with wt-eCap were synthesized based on the codon bias of E. coli. Those gene fragments were inserted into the pET30a expression vector. One recombinant strain with the highest expressed soluble eCap from four entire Cap (one wt-eCap and three opti-eCap) and one recombinant strain expressed opti-dCap were selected for further purification. The purified eCap and dCap were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a large number of round hollow particles with a diameter of 10 nm virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in eCap, whereas irregular aggregation of proteins observed in dCap. After formation the VLPs were applied as a coating antigen to establish an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) for detection of PCV3-specific antibody in swine serum. 373 clinical swine serum samples from China collected in 2019 were tested utilizing the VLP-based I-ELISA method under optimized conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of self-assembly into VLPs of PCV3 recombinant Cap. Our results demonstrated that the VLP-based I-ELISA will be a valuable tool for detecting the presence of PCV3 antibodies in serum samples and will facilitate screening of large numbers of swine serum for clinical purposes.

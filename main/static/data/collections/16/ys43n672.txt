Today’s laboratory mouse, Mus musculus, has its origins as the ‘house mouse’ of North America and Europe. Beginning with mice bred by mouse fanciers, laboratory stocks (outbred) derived from M. musculus musculus from eastern Europe and M. m. domesticus from western Europe were developed into inbred strains. Since the mid-1980s, additional strains have been developed from Asian mice (M. m. castaneus from Thailand and M. m. molossinus from Japan) and from M. spretus which originated from the western Mediterranean region.

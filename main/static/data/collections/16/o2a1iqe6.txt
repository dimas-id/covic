A 65-year-old man presented to the general surgical outpatients with an incarcerated left inguinal hernia. Initial investigations revealed an iron deficiency anaemia that was investigated with a colonoscopy and gastroscopy. This revealed a sigmoid cancer and the staging CT scan confirmed a tumour incarcerated in the sac of the left inguinal hernia. We proceeded with a laparoscopic high anterior resection using the inguinal hernia as the extraction site. The hernia was repaired using Permacol mesh. No postoperative complications occurred.

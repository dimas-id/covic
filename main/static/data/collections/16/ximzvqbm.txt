Evolutionary selective pressures sometimes act to preserve nucleic acid features at the expense of encoded proteins. That this might occur in the case of nucleic acid secondary structure was noted in Chapter 5. That this might also apply to the species-dependent component of the base composition, (G+C)%, was shown by Sueoka in 1961 [2]. The amino acid composition of the proteins of bacteria is influenced, not only by the demands of the environment on the proteins, but also by the (G+C)% of the genome encoding those proteins.

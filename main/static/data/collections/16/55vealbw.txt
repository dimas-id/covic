There are known 3 likely mechanisms of virus conveyance into the central nervous system (CNS). These include hematogenic penetration, spread along the peripheral nerves, and the olfactory pathway which begins from the infected olfactory neuroepithelial cells. The possibility of viral spread into CNS via the olfactory pathway was shown for the representatives of togaviruses, herpesviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and for some others. This study suggests that the olfactory pathway of viral conveyance into CNS may be blocked by specific mucosal antibodies in the nasal mucosa. The recombinant TK- variant of WR vaccinia strain with inserted genes coding structural and nonstructural proteins of TBE virus is accumulated in the branches of the respiratory tract only while the parenteral vaccinia strain is detected in the brain regions, spleen, respiratory tract, and in blood. The protective activity of recombinant strain and inactivated TBE vaccine after mice immunization by escarification or intranasally, or subcutaneously was comparatively studied. The findings indicate that intranasal immunization by recombinant strain is the most protective against intraperitoneal challenge by TBE virus. The mucosal and humoral immune response that was induced by intranasal immunization seems to provide the highest levels of protection, which was experimentally observed.

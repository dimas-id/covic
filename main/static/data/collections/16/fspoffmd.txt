Viral culture is the historical gold standard for detection of most viruses that cause respiratory tract infections. Viral culture remains valuable because it is reasonably sensitive for most respiratory viruses, and it is cheaper and less technically demanding than nucleic acid amplified tests. The disadvantages of conventional viral culture using multiple tubes of cell lines are that it is labor intensive, moderately expensive, and slow. Advances in viral culture include the introduction of new cell lines, which can be more sensitive or convenient than previously used cell lines, and the use of shell-vial culture for respiratory viruses. Shell-vial culture is as sensitive as conventional culture for most respiratory viruses and it has a much shorter turn-around time. The shorter turn-around time increases the clinical utility of these cultures.

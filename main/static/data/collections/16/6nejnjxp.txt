The aim of the paper is to describe two models of Covid-19 infection dynamics. For this purpose a special class of branching processes with two types of individuals is considered. These models are intended to use only the observed daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the infection and to give a prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the infected individuals. Similar problems are considered also in the case when the processes admit an immigration component. This is a serious advantage in comparison with other more complicated models where the officially reported data are not sufficient for estimation of the model parameters. In this way the specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered also for all countries as it is given in the specially created site http://ir-statistics.net/covid-19 where the obtained results are updated daily.

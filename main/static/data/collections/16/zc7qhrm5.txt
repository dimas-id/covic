AIMS To present our experience of modified laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) and to evaluate the surgical outcomes and complications. METHODS Women with benign gynaecologic tumours that underwent a modified LAVH at the Samsung Medical Centre were analysed retrospectively. The technique is primarily a vaginal hysterectomy with a minor component of the laparoscopic procedures (stage 2 laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH)) and had two modifications (vaginal anterior colpotomy and McCall culdoplasty) from the standard technique. RESULTS A total of 2012 LAVH procedures were performed from January 2000 to May 2008. The mean duration of the operations and the uterine weight were 102±32 min and 305±168 g, respectively. In 196 (9.7%) cases, the uterine weight was more than 500 g. Conversion to laparotomy was needed in 97 cases. Major intraoperative complications occurred in 45 cases (2.2%): bladder injury, 26 (1.29%); bowel injury, nine (0.45%); haemorrhage of major vessels, nine (0.45%); and ureteral injury, one (0.05%). Major long-term complications occurred in three cases: one fistula and two trocar site herniations. CONCLUSIONS Stage 2 LH combined with modified vaginal anterior colpotomy and modified McCall culdoplasty is safe and effective for benign gynaecologic tumours and the prevention of post-LAVH vaginal prolapse.

Abstract Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious swine disease that is responsible for economic losses worldwide. Protein kinase R (PK)R is an important protein in the host viral response; however, the role of PKR in CSFV infection remains unknown. This issue was addressed in the present study using the PK-15 swine kidney cell line. We found that CSFV infection increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2α and its kinase PKR. However, the expression of viral proteins continued to increase. Furthermore, PKR overexpression enhanced CSFV replication, while PKR inhibition resulted in reduced CSFV replication and an increase in interferon (IFN) induction. In addition, PKR was responsible for eIF2α phosphorylation in CSFV-infected cells. These results suggest that the activation of PKR during CSFV infection is beneficial to the virus. The virus is able to commandeer the host cell's translation machinery for viral protein synthesis while evading innate immune defenses.

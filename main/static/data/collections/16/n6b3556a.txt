OBJECTIVE to evaluate attributes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) surveillance system in Brazil, 2014-2016. METHOD this was an evaluation study conducted according to United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data from the Influenza Web information system notified for the period 2014-2016 were used. The simplicity, completeness, inconsistency, timeliness, acceptability, representativeness, positive predictive value (PPV) of the SARS case definition attributes and usefulness were evaluated. RESULTS a simple structure was found with good completeness (100% for required variables; >95% for optional variables); low inconsistency (3.2%); lack of timeliness (68.2%); low acceptability (average of 70.4%); representative of the territory (capable of analyzing risk groups); high PPV (29.1%); useful (fulfils system objectives). CONCLUSION the attributes evaluated indicate that the system is capable of providing complete, representative and useful information about influenza, adequate for guiding national health responses.

BACKGROUND The ribcage and diaphragm are mechanical barriers for laparoscopic access during hepatectomy. Here, we introduce the varied application of intercostal trans-diaphragmatic ports during laparoscopic hepatectomy, and describe the management of intercostal ports with key technical points. METHODS From January 2013 to December 2017, 180 patients underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy. In 32 of these patients (17.8%), intercostal ports (31 right and one left) were applied, and we analyzed the feasibility and safety of intercostal ports during laparoscopic hepatectomy. RESULTS The main tumor location was segment VII and VIII (78%). The major type of laparoscopic hepatectomy was partial hepatectomy (91%). In the majority of cases (66%) the number and size of intercostal trocars was a single 5-mm port. The median operative time and blood loss were 232 min and 50 mL, respectively. A chest drain was placed via the hole of the intercostal port on the chest wall in two cases (6.3%). The median duration of the post-operative hospital stay was 6 days. There was no conversion, and a pure laparoscopic hepatectomy was achieved in all cases. There was no mortality. As for complications due to the application of intercostal ports, an asymptomatic pneumothorax was detected in only one case, and it was cured by conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS The ribcage and diaphragm could be overcome as barriers to laparoscopic access by the placement of intercostal ports with minimal access during laparoscopic hepatectomy. The use of an intercostal port and proper management allows for a feasible approach and safe resection during laparoscopic hepatectomy.

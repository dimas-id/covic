The role of naturally occurring autoantibodies (NAbs) in homeostasis and in disease manifestations is poorly understood. In the present chapter, we review how NAbs may interfere with the cytokine network and how NAbs, through formation of complement-activating immune complexes with soluble self-antigens, may promote the uptake and presentation of self-molecules by antigen-presenting cells. Both naturally occurring and disease-associated autoantibodies against a variety of cytokines have been reported, including NAbs against interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, macrophage chemotactic protein-1 and IL-21. NAbs against a variety of other self-antigens have also been reported, and using thyroglobulin as an example we discuss how NAbs are capable of promoting uptake of immune complexes via complement receptors and Fc-receptors on antigen-presenting cells and thereby regulate T-cell activity. Knowledge of the influence of NAbs against cytokines on immune homeostasis is likely to have wide-ranging implications both in understanding pathogenesis and in treatment of many immunoinflammatory disorders, including a number of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases.

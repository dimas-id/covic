This paper presents a theoretical research about the relationship between weak negations and adjoint negations. Adjoint negations are a generalization of residuated negations built from the implications of an adjoint triple. Specifically, this work shows how to build adjoint triples on the unit interval such that their adjoint negations coincide with a given weak negation. Moreover, the algebraic structure formed by these adjoint triples is also investigated.

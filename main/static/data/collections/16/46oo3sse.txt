OBJECTIVES: To examine one health system's response to the essential care of its hip fracture population during the COVID-19 pandemic and report on its effect on patient outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Seven musculoskeletal care centers within New York City and Long Island. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-eight recent and 115 historical hip fracture patients. INTERVENTION: Patients with hip fractures occurring between February 1, 2020, and April 15, 2020, or between February 1, 2019, and April 15, 2019, were prospectively enrolled in an orthopaedic trauma registry and chart reviewed for demographic and hospital quality measures. Patients with recent hip fractures were identified as COVID positive (C+), COVID suspected (Cs), or COVID negative (C−). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Hospital quality measures, inpatient complications, and mortality rates. RESULTS: Seventeen (12.2%) patients were confirmed C+ by testing, and another 14 (10.1%) were suspected (Cs) of having had the virus but were never tested. The C+ cohort, when compared with Cs and C− cohorts, had an increased mortality rate (35.3% vs. 7.1% vs. 0.9%), increased length of hospital stay, a greater major complication rate, and a greater incidence of ventilator need postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a devastating effect on the care of patients with hip fracture during the pandemic. Although practice patterns generally remained unchanged, treating physicians need to understand the increased morbidity and mortality in patients with hip fracture complicated by COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of Levels of Evidence.

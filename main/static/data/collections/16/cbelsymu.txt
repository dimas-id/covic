Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Influenza vaccine is recommended for people aged 65 years and older and those in long term care. Currently only 30% of high risk persons are vaccinated. Vaccination generally stimulates an adequate immune response, is well tolerated and is to be encouraged. Prophylactic amantadine 100 mg/day should be given for 2 weeks with influenza vaccine in the aged population when they have not been previously immunised. Broad application of these preventive measures would have a significant impact on reducing influenza prevalence in the elderly and other high risk groups.

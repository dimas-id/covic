Dysregulation of mRNA translation is a frequent feature of neoplasia. Many oncogenes and tumour suppressors affect the translation machinery, making aberrant translation a widespread characteristic of tumour cells, independent of the genetic make-up of the cancer. Therefore, therapeutic agents that target components of the protein synthesis apparatus hold promise as novel anticancer drugs that can overcome intra-tumour heterogeneity. In this Review, we discuss the role of translation in cancer, with a particular focus on the eIF4F (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F) complex, and provide an overview of recent efforts aiming to 'translate' these results to the clinic.

The objective of this study was to evaluate postoperative outcome and efficacy of a hydrogel tissue sealant for prevention of alveolar leakage after open lung resections. 20 consecutive patients were enrolled in the PleuraSeal sealant group (PSG) and case matched with 20 retrospective controls (CG) with standard treatment. Assessment of postoperative air leakage was performed until chest tube removal. Patients were followed until 30 days after discharge. At end of surgery, 100% in the PSG and 0% in the CG were air leak free (p < 0.001). Duration of postoperative chest tube suction was shorter in PSG (p < 0.001), and air leak chest tube was removed earlier (p = 0.03). Limitation for chest tube removal due to a pulmonary leak was 35% in CG and 5% in PSG (p = 0.04). Patients remaining air leak free thru discharge was 95% and 15% for PSG and CG (p < 0.001). The study demonstrated a superior efficacy of PleuraSeal sealant compared with standard surgical treatment for sustained sealing of postoperative air leakage and causes shorter air leak chest tube duration.

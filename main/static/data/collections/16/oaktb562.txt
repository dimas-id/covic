BACKGROUND Coronaviruses (CV) are ARN-containing agents that are responsible for mild upper respiratory tract infections in adults and children. Their pathogenicity in neonates is not wellknown. POPULATION AND METHODS Eighty five samples of tracheal or nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained from January to October 1991 from 53 children (29 less than 1 month of age; 19 from 1 month to 1 year; five older than 1 year). They were examined for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, myxovirus influenza and parainfluenza and coronavirus by immunofluorescence (IF). RESULTS Nineteen samples from nine newborns and three infants were positive for coronavirus. The mean birth weight of the nine neonates was 2100 +/- 840 g; their mean gestational age was 34 +/- 5 weeks and their mean age at diagnosis was 21 +/- 9 days. Apnea and bradycardia were the main symptoms in this group. Blood C-reactive protein was not elevated and blood cultures were sterile. One infant was admitted for near-miss; the two others were admitted at birth because they suffered from chronic lung disease (pulmonary hypoplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia). An acute episode of pulmonary deterioration occurred at the time of coronavirus infection. Both died one at 4 months and the other at 10 months. CONCLUSION Coronaviruses seem to be responsible for respiratory tract infections in hospitalized neonates and chronically ventilated infants.

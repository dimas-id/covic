CASE DESCRIPTION A 15-year-old neutered male domestic shorthair cat was examined for treatment of a recurrent neoplastic mass in the left upper eyelid that had been excised 6 months earlier by the referring veterinarian. CLINICAL FINDINGS An apparently nonpainful firm cutaneous mass (approx 2 Ã— 2 mm) was located on the lateral third of the left upper eyelid near the scar from the previous surgical excision. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Approximately one-third of the left upper lip was used as a subdermal plexus (lip-to-lid) flap to cover the defect created by en bloc excision of the eyelid mass. A bridge incision between the donor and recipient sites was used so that the eyelid could be reconstructed in 1 procedure. Histologic evaluation confirmed that the mass had been completely excised. Both the donor and recipient flap sites healed well without complications. The procedure resulted in excellent functional and cosmetic results with no recurrence of the mass at 14 months after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The described lip-to-lid technique was a simple 1-stage method for reconstructing an upper eyelid of a cat following radical tumor resection that provided excellent functional and cosmetic results.

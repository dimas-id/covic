The acute diarrhea is a wide-spread disease. The prescription of enterosorbents is appropriate as a primary measure for the treatment of the acute diarrhea for effective prevention of the fluid and electrolyte loss, as well as method for symptom relief of the attack of the disease. Aim of the study - the antidiarrheal efficacy and safety study of high-dispersion silicon dioxide enterosorbent in tablet dosage form in patients with acute diarrhea. This was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-center study. Acute diarrhea was defined as three and more episodes of watery stool per day either during 48 hours or less before study entry in the patients having normal stool recently. It has been postulated that symptoms and signs of acute diarrhea have to be caused by direct infection of the gastrointestinal tract and did not associated with moderate-to-severe systemic states. 144 patients with established acute diarrhea were randomized into treatment group (enterosorbent “Carbowhite”, n = 120) or placebo group. Date collection including severity diarrhea, systemic symptoms was performed at baseline and daily during 7 days. Stool examination and serological assay were performed at baseline. The primary end points were declared as time to complete recovery from acute diarrhea. It has been found that the use of the siliceous enterosorbent (“Carbowhite”) allowed to reduce (p < 0.001) the treatment period averagely for 0.9 days (95% confidence interval 0.5–1.2 days) in comparison with placebo. Data of safety monitoring has revealed that both patient groups had negative stool culture, while initiation of antibiotic treatment was run more frequently in placebo group (8.3%) compared to investigational product group (4.1%, P = 0.044). The siliceous enterosorbent “Carbowhite” was well tolerated and reduced the recovery time of the acute episode of the diarrhea in the clinically significant form.

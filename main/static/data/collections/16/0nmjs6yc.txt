Viral infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following renal transplantation. Although cytomegalovirus is the most common opportunistic pathogen seen in transplant recipients, numerous other viruses have also affected outcomes. In some cases, preventive measures such as pretransplant screening, prophylactic antiviral therapy, or post transplant viral monitoring may limit the impact of these infections. Recent advances in laboratory monitoring and antiviral therapy have improved outcomes. This review will summarize the major viral infections seen following transplant and discuss strategies for prevention and management of these potential pathogens.

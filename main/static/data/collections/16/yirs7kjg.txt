The polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) have recently been discovered in specimens from patients with respiratory tract infections. To analyze the frequency and clinical impact in a cohort of pediatric patients in a German University Childrenâ€™s Hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of 229 children with acute respiratory tract infection were screened for KIPyV and WUPyV using polymerase chain reaction-based methods. KIPyV was detected in 2 (0.9%) and WUPyV in 1 (0.4%) patients, without co-infections with other respiratory viruses but with co-detection of CMV, EBV and HHV 6 in one immunocompromised patient. Only a very small proportion (1.3%) of positive samples for KIPyV and WUPyV was documented in this study; the clinical relevance of these viruses remains unclear and requires further evaluation.

Influenza A H7N9 virus has caused five outbreak waves of human infections in China since 2013 and posed a dual challenge to public health and poultry industry. There is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to reduce its pandemic potential. In the present study, we evaluated the biochemical characteristics and immunogenicity of two H7 virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the matrix 1 (M1) and hemagglutinin of wild-type (HA-WT) or hemagglutinin of whose transmembrane domain replaced by that from H3N2 subtype (HA-TM). H7 VLPs-WT and H7 VLPs-TM could assemble and release into the supernatant of Sf9 cells and they had similar morphological characteristics. However, compared to H7 VLPs-WT, H7 VLPs-TM had more trimeric HA proteins and could better resist thermal changes. In mice H7 VLPs-TM induced higher titers of HI, IgG, IgG2a and IFN-Î³, and provided better protection against homologous and heterologous H7N9 viruses (no matter belonging to Yangtze River Delta or Pearl River Delta) challenge with less weight loss and higher survival rate. In summary, H7 VLPs-TM represents a potential strategy for the development of H7N9 vaccines.

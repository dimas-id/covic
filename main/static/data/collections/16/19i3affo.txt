The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is essential in regulating myriad aspects of protein functions. It is therefore a fundamentally important regulatory mechanism that impacts most if not all aspects of cellular processes. Indeed, malfunction of UPS components is implicated in human diseases such as neurodegenerative and immunological disorders and many cancers. The success of proteasome inhibitors in cancer therapy suggests that modulating enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade would be clinically important for therapeutic benefits. In this review, we summarize advances in developing inhibitors of a variety of UPS components. In particular, we highlight recent work done on the protein engineering of ubiquitin as modulators of the UPS, a novel approach that may shed light on innovative drug discovery in the future.

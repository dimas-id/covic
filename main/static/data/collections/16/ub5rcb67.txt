PURPOSE Surgical procedures are mentally and physically demanding, and stress during surgery may compromise patient safety. We investigated the impact of surgical experience on surgeons' stress levels and how perioperative sleep quality may influence surgical performance. METHODS Eight experienced and 8 inexperienced surgeons each performed 1 laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Questionnaires measuring perioperative mental and physical strain using validated visual analog scale and Borg scales were completed. Preoperative and postoperative sleep quality of the surgeon was registered and correlated to perioperative strain parameters. RESULTS Preoperative to postoperative frustration among experienced surgeons was significantly reduced and this was not found in the inexperienced surgeons (visual analog scale: preoperative 13 (2-65) mm, postoperative 4 (0-51) mm vs. preoperative 5(0-10) mm, postoperative 5(1-46) mm; P=0.04). Physical strain was significantly induced in both groups in the upper extremities. Preoperative and postoperative sleep quality was significantly correlated to postoperative mental strain parameters. CONCLUSIONS Perioperative frustration levels were different among inexperienced and experienced surgeons. Perioperative sleep quality may influence postoperative mental strain and should be considered in studies examining surgeons' stress.

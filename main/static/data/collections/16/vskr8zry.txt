Abstract A story from long ago reminds us of the importance of quality in our practices, of taking ownership of our patients, and of our role as physicians. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted our practices. Before the pandemic, many practices were stretched thin by the amount of work that needed to be done. The work stoppage in many locations brought an unwelcome pause but gives us time to reflect on our practices. How can we maintain quality when high volumes return? The role of artificial intelligence, and our role in its development, needs to be considered. At the same time, we need to take more ownership of the patient and be more help to our referring providers. Our own ACR staff are great examples of taking ownership. Finally, we must recognize that patients and their families are important for optimal patient care. Making that connection is significant. Let us we start where we beganâ€”in the service of our patients as their physicians. This role is rewarding and, together with a focus on quality and taking ownership, can lead to successful practices that are good for everyone, including ourselves.

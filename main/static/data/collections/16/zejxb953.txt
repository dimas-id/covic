Contact tracing is an important control measure in the fight against infectious disease. Healthcare workers deduce potential disease pathways and propose corresponding containment strategies from collecting and reviewing patientsâ€™ contact history. Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides healthcare workers with a network approach for integrating and analyzing all collected contact records via a simple network graph, called a contact network. Through SNA, they are able to identify prominent individuals in disease pathways as well as study the dynamics of disease transmission. In this chapter, we review the role of SNA in supplementing contact tracing and present a case study of the Taiwan SARS outbreak in 2003 to demonstrate the usefulness of geographical contacts to disease investigation.

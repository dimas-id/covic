Middle esophageal diverticulum is rare, but can result in bronchoesophageal fistula. Previous reports have described open surgical techniques to treat esophageal diverticula, but few have evaluated the effectiveness of a videothoracoscopy approach. We report a case of middle esophageal diverticulum associated with bronchoesophageal fistula, managed successfully with videothoracoscopy. We also review the relevant literature.

Stringent measures have been taken to contain COVID-19 spread, limiting access only for urgent visits, surgery procedures, or hospitalizations and using teledermatology services for non-urgent cases. Management of oncological patients affected by chemo-, immune-, and radiotherapy-related cutaneous and mucosal adverse events is a challenge. Firstly because of the differential diagnosis of cutaneous rash (e.g., drug-related rash or paraviral exanthema). Secondly, oncological patients can suffer from xerosis, pruritus, and mucositis that contribute to cutaneous and mucosal barrier lesions, thus becoming vulnerable site for viral or bacterial colonization. These lesions can also be aggravated by the use of protective mask and gloves. Here, we report also our results of a teledermatological survey on 87 oncological patients, where the health status of oncological patients referred to our dedicated clinic was assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is fundamental that oncological patients are followed up by their dermatologists even if the clinics are closed. Teledermatology represents a crucial means of communication. Patients can contact the dermatological staff by emails and telephone, 24 h a day, 7 days a week, for video calls and dermatological consultations.

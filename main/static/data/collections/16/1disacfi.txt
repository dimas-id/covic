Hand eczema, also known as hand dermatitis, often results from a combination of causes, including genetics (atopic constitution), irritating substances and contact allergens. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through contaminated hands, the World Health Organization recommends frequent handwashing with soap and water, or hand-rubbing with an alcohol based hand rub.

A 67-year-old man presented with abdominal distention and vomiting.Computed tomography revealed bowel obstruction due to a cecal tumor.We performed laparoscopic ileocecal resection after decompression with an ileus tube. Intraoperative findings included multiple disseminated nodules on the mesenterium surrounding the cecal tumor.The histopathologic diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, which consisted of glandular proliferation of atypical epithelial cells and dispersed infiltration of goblet cells. Immunohistochemistry showed positively stained neuroendocrine markers, such as CD56, chromogranin, and synaptophysin.The patient was diagnosed with goblet cell carcinoid of the appendix and treated with combination chemotherapy of bevacizumab, fluorouracil, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin.He remained free from progression for over 1 and half years with this treatment.Subsequent chemotherapy was ineffective, and he passed away.There is no established chemotherapy regimen for goblet cell carcinoid, which has the aspects of both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors.However, the present case suggested the efficacy of the mFOLFOX6 regimen in combination with bevacizumab for appendiceal goblet cell carcinoid.

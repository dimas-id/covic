The novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. The increasing sequencing data have shown abundant single nucleotide variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, it is difficult to quickly analyze genomic variation and screen key mutations of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we developed a visual program, named BioAider, for quick and convenient sequence annotation and mutation analysis on multiple genome-sequencing data. Using BioAider, we conducted a comprehensive genome variation analysis on 3,240 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Herein, we detected 14 substitution hotspots within SARS-CoV-2 genome, including 10 non-synonymous and 4 synonymous ones. Among these hotspots, NSP13-Y541C was predicted to be a crucial substitution which might affect the unwinding activity of NSP13, a key protein for viral replication. Besides, we also found 3 groups of potentially linked substitution hotspots which were worth further study. In particular, we discovered a SR-rich region (aa 184-204) on the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 distinct from SARS-CoV, indicating more complex replication mechanism and unique N-M interaction of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the quantity of SRXX repeat fragments in the SR-rich region well reflected the evolutionary relationship among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related animal coronaviruses, providing further evidence of its animal origin. Overall, we developed an efficient tool for rapid identification of mutations, identified substitution hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and detected a distinctive polymorphism SR-rich region in N protein. This tool and the detected hotspots could facilitate the viral genomic study and may contribute for screening antiviral target sites.

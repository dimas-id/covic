Objective: We undertook this study to explore the role of important determinants affecting global COVID-19 incidence and mortality taking multifactorial disease dynamics into consideration. Design: Secondary data as on March 28, 2020 were obtained for 97 countries. Association of COVID-19 cumulative incidence and mortality measures were assessed with ten indictors representing health system characteristics, climate, demography, promptness of international travel restriction and population movement using Generalized Linear Modelling. Main outcome measures: Country-specific COVID-19 cumulative incidence, cumulative cause-specific mortality and case fatality rate. Results: Significant inter-country variation in incidence and mortality rates were observed. Five variables were found to be associated with cumulative incidence: testing rate per 1000 population ({beta} = 0.119, p < 0.01), UHC index ({beta} = 0.043, p = 0.04), percentage elderly population ({beta} = 0.122, p < 0.01), percentage below-poverty line population ({beta} = -0.048, p < 0.01) and disability adjusted life years due to NCDs ({beta} = -0.013, p < 0.01). Case fatality rate was observed to be associated with testing rate per 1000 population ({beta} = -0.058, p = 0.03) and population density ({beta} = 0.002, p = 0.02), while the cumulative cause-specific mortality was associated with only percentage elderly population ({beta} = 0.096, p = 0.04) in the country. Conclusions: Health system response, population susceptibility and demography were the most important factors determining the progression. Policy response should focus towards increasing testing, primarily targeting high population density areas. Health system strengthening and reduction in population risk factors should be long term goals for a better response to such epidemics.

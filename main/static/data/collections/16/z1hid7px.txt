The term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to describe multiple idiopathic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. As many as one-quarter of patients with IBD initially present in childhood or adolescence. Multiple methods can be used to diagnose IBD in this age group, including computed tomographic (CT) enterography, magnetic resonance (MR) enterography, small bowel follow-through examination, ileocolonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy. However, CT enterography and MR enterography have become the imaging modalities of choice due to their exquisite image quality, rapid acquisition time, lack of need for bowel preparation, and ability to help diagnose the extraintestinal complications of IBD. In addition to being radiation free, MR enterography can help evaluate peristalsis, has high contrast resolution, and allows the use of diffusion-weighted imaging. The authors discuss the use of CT enterography and MR enterography in the context of pediatric IBD in terms of advantages and disadvantages, protocol, and imaging findings.

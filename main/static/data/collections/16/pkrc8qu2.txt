Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is a new technique for the local excision of rectal neoplasia. This platform employs ordinary laparoscopic instruments to achieve high-quality local excision. The TAMIS platform, however, is quite versatile. Described here are applications of TAMIS beyond local excision, ranging from repair of a rectourethral fistula to reverse proctectomy.

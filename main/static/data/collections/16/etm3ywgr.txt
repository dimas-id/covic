Abstract. Background. Several RT-qPCR kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, some of them with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA, but most of them lacking of proper evaluation studies due to covid19 emergency. Objective. We evaluated Viasure RT-qPCR kit (CerTest Biotec, Spain) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using CDC FDA EUA kit as gold standard. Results. Although we found the lack of RNA quality control probe as the main limitation for Viasure kit, the sensitivity was up to 97.5% and specificity was 100%. Conclusions. Viasure RT-qPCR kit is a reliable tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis but improvement of an alternative RT-qPCR reaction for RNA extraction quality control as RNaseP is recommended.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), including H5N6 strains, pose threats to the health of humans and poultry. Waterfowl play a crucial role as a reservoir of HPAIVs. Since current influenza vaccines induce poor antibody titres in waterfowl, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient vaccine against H5N6 infection. In this study, we constructed two H5N6 virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of matrix-1 (M1) and haemagglutinin of wildtype (HA-TM) or haemagglutinin with transmembrane domain replacement (HA-TMH3) (designated as H5N6 VLPs-TM and H5N6 VLPs-TMH3). Biological characteristics of the composed H5N6 VLPs were compared including localization, expression, contents of HA trimers, thermal stability, morphology and immunogenicity in Muscovy ducks. Our results indicate that the H5N6 VLPs-TMH3 contained more HA trimers and presented better thermal stability. Moreover, Muscovy ducks immunized with H5N6 VLPs-TMH3 produced higher titres of HI antibody and IFN-Î³ compared with those immunized with the same dose of H5N6 VLP-TM, thus providing a promising approach for the development of influenza virus vaccines for waterfowl. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS H5N6 VLPs-TMH3 had more HA trimers and resisted higher temperature than H5N6 VLPs-TM H5N6 VLPs-TMH3 induced higher titre of HI than H5N6 VLPs-TM in Muscovy ducks.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic gastrectomy has been used as a superior alternative to open gastrectomy for the treatment of early gastric cancer. However, the application of laparoscopic D2 lymphadenectomy remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. RESULTS Between May 2016 and May 2018, twenty-five consecutive patients with gastric cancer underwent laparoscopic D2 gastrectomy: eighteen patients (72%) underwent distal gastrectomy, four patients (16%) underwent total gastrectomy, and three patients (12%) underwent proximal gastrectomy. The median number of lymph nodes retrieved was 18 (5-35). A positive proximal margin was detected in 2 patients (8%). The median operative time and amount of blood loss were 240 min (200-330) and 250 ml (200-450), respectively. Conversion to an open procedure was performed in seven patients (28%). The median hospital stay period was 8 days (6-30), and the median time to start oral fluids was 4 days (3-30). Postoperative complications were detected in 4 patients (16%). There were two cases of mortality (8%) in the postoperative period, and two patients required reoperation (8%). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy can be carried out safely and in accordance with oncologic principles.

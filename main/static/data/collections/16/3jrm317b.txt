Infections with mouse coronavirus (also known as mouse hepatitis virus, MHV) are common and prompt concern because the adverse research effects of infection have been well documented. The animal facility we describe had contained an enzootic infection of mouse coronavirus for more than a decade. Eradication of the virus had been tried with limited success in the past. With an increase in the populations of immune-compromised and transgenic animals elsewhere in the facility, eradication of the virus became a high priority. The affected animals were in multiple breeding colonies comprising more than 4000 mice representing more than 50 site-specific strains, lines, and sublines. A task force designed to ensure representation of all interested parties developed a multi-phase approach which included (a) culling of nonessential animals, (b) cessation of breeding, (c) testing and culling of individual animals, and (d) cross-fostering to clean dams. To date, all of the strains, lines, and sublines manipulated through this multi-phase eradication approach continue to test negative for mouse coronavirus. This multi-phase approach may be useful for other institutions attempting to eradicate mouse coronavirus.

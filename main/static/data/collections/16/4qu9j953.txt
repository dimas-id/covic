The discovery of a previously unknown coronavirus as the causative agent of the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 stimulated a large number of studies into the molecular biology of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and related viruses. This research has provided significant new insight into the functions and activities of the coronavirus replicase–transcriptase complex, a multiprotein complex that directs coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis to replicate and transcribe the large coronavirus genome, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of ~30 kb. In this chapter, we review our current understanding of the expression and functions of key replicative enzymes, such as RNA polymerases, helicase, ribonucleases, ribose-2′-O-methyltransferase and other replicase gene-encoded proteins involved in genome expression, virus–host interactions and other processes. Collectively, these recent studies reveal fascinating details of an enzymatic machinery that, in the RNA virus world, is unparalleled in terms of the number and nature of virally encoded activities involved in virus replication and host interactions.

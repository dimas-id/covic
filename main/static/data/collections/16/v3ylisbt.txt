Respiratory infections in animal species are as ubiquitous as they are in humans. Species that may be affected include mammals, birds, and reptiles. In these animal species some viruses primarily infect the respiratory tract, while other viruses infect non-respiratory organs. Viruses are generally classified according to the type of their nucleic acid, their protein structure, and whether or not they have a lipid-containing envelope surrounding the viral particle. In general, most viruses gain entry into the lungs via the conducting airways. In nonprimate mammalians these infections are most prominent in the cranioventral lung lobes because of their horizontal position. Table 24.1 lists some of the major viruses that cause pneumonia and other lung diseases in animals.

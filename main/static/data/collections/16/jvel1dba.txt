Significant progress regarding hygiene, nutrition, and antimicrobial treatment as well as immunizations have lead to a significant decline of morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases in the recent past. Furthermore, immunizations are one of the most cost-effective tools for prevention. However, lack of perception of the substantial risks of complications associated with infectious diseases cause doubts about the necessity of immunizations today. This development is highly worrisome and needs to be adequately addressed by informing physicians and the public about the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases, efficiency, safety and benefits of available vaccines, as well as providing convincing arguments justifying current immunization recommendations. These activities are indispensable for successful implementation and continuation of current immunization programs.

Abstract Very limited evidence has been reported on host T cell responses to the pandemic H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) infection in humans. Therefore, we investigated the proportions of peripheral T cell subsets and analyzed the relationship of T helper subset changes with T cell activation during this infection. We found that these S-OIV-infected patients exhibited rapid lymphopenia, T cell activation and preferential loss of Th17 subset at the early stage of acute infection. Statistical analysis indicated that CD4 depletion and loss of Th17 cells, rather than Th1 or Treg cells, were correlated with CD4 T cell activation. More importantly, up-regulated IFN-Î± likely contributed to the functional loss of Th17 cells. Thus, rapidly generalized lymphopenia, preferential loss of Th17 population and T cell activation presented as characteristics of the early immune response in S-OIV-infected patients. These findings, therefore, may be helpful for an earlier diagnosis and further studies of immune pathogenesis of S-OIV infection.

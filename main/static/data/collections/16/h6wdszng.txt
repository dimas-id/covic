Wine has historically been associated with religious rights, used as a salubrious beverage, employed as a medication as well as a medicinal solvent, and consumed as a food accompaniment. It is the latter that is most intimately associated in the minds of most modern consumers. Despite this, there is little flavor commonality on which pairing could be based. The first section of the chapter examines this feature, and wine’s primary role as a palate cleanser and food condiment. The synergistic role of food and wine in suppressing each other’s least pleasant attributes is also explained. The final section deals with the latest evidence relating to the many beneficial health effects of moderate wine consumption, shortfalls in the data, headache induction, dental erosion, and conditions under which wine intake is contraindicated.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been described as the first step of a two-step laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) in extremely obese patients. It has also been used as an independent bariatric procedure. Recently a banded sleeve gastrectomy using human dermis was published. Gastric sleeve dilatation is one of the unfavorable postoperative courses that may limit weight loss. Our technique of a banded sleeve gastrectomy using the GaBP Ring Autolock(TM) System to calibrate the sleeve and prevent distal sleeve dilatation is described in this article.

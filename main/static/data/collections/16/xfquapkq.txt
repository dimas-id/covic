The influence of the pH of urine on the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) by the shell vial assay was evaluated. The pH values of 295 urine specimens ranged from 4.7 to 8.5 (mean 6.3) and were not significantly different in culture-positive versus culture-negative samples. None of the urine specimens appeared to be toxic for the cells used in the shell vial assay. We recommend inoculation of urine specimens into shell vials without adjustment of pH.

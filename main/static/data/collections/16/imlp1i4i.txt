The technique of TransAnal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) was pioneered in 2009 as a hybrid approach to endoluminal resections of appropriately selected rectal lesions. There are, however, limitations to performing this type of resection. Robotic TAMIS is a novel, experimental technique and in this study was performed in a cadaveric model at a surgical education center. Various tasks were carried out using robotic TAMIS, including full-thickness sharp and cautery excision of rectal wall, as well as intra-luminal suturing of the surgical defect. It was found that for the da Vinci-trained surgeon, these tasks were simple to perform and accomplished with greater precision when compared to standard TAMIS. Our initial results indicate that robotic TAMIS overcomes the limitations of standard TAMIS and that it is a feasible platform for transanal surgery. The cost, however, of performing robotic TAMIS may limit its application to special cases in which standard TAMIS or transanal endoscopic microsurgery resections may prove difficult. Further study is necessary to validate these preliminary findings before robotic TAMIS is performed on live patients.

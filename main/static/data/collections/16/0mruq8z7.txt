A cell culture virus isolation procedure for infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) in the epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line (EPC) is described. Ovarian fluid samples were collected from fish and tested for IHNV at 9 farms. The samples were inoculated in parallel on 24 h old EPC cell monolayers and in freshly trypsinized cells. The titre of the initial virus isolation and of first passages were compared using the 2 methods for each sample. Titres were consistently higher in suspended cells and this method also proved more sensitive for isolation of IHN virus from ovarian fluids of infected fish.

Vaccinia virus has been studied extensively since its discovery as a smallpox vaccine in 1798. Its use as a smallpox vaccine documented its safety profile. It was later found that its large size and ability to accept large fragments of DNA combined with its natural tumor affinity make it an attractive agent for cancer therapy. This chapter discusses the history of the vaccinia, the various strains available, the biology of the virus as well as the steps in creating recombinants. The various clinical and safety considerations will be addressed. We will also discuss the various methods used to treat cancer using the vaccinia virus and will review the recent clinical trials using vaccinia in the treatment of cancer.

Tyler Littlefield, a software developer who is blind with only light perception, has created a fully accessible tracker of COVID‐19 statistics as a resource for those who are blind or visually impaired. The majority of information regarding ongoing statistics and updates about the spread of COVID‐19 in the United States is conducted graphically, which can be a problem for the blind or visually impaired. The tracker, called CVStats, converts statistics about COVID‐19 from a graphical to a text format, making it easier for those who work exclusively with screen readers to access the information.

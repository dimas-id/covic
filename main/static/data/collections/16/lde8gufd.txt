Potential risks of COVID-19 spread during minimally invasive procedures caused several concerns among surgeons, despite the lack of high-level evidence. Urological robotic and laparoscopic surgery is performed in elective setting in almost all occasions, thus allowing adequate planning and stratification. Two high-volume urological centers in Italy performed 77 robotic and laparoscopic surgeries during the "lockdown" period and adopted various strategies to prevent contamination. First of all, all patients were tested negative with nasopharyngeal swab before the surgical intervention. Patients and personnel were provided adequate personal protective equipment and intraoperative strategies to prevent smoke formation and pneumoperitoneum spread were adopted. No patients nor staff members tested positive for COVID-19 during a 15-day follow-up period. In conclusion, minimally invasive urologic surgery can be safely performed during the pandemic period with adequate planning. We believe that renouncing the benefits of it would be counterproductive, especially in a scenario of long-lasting cohabitation with the virus.

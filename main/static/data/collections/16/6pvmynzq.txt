The chapter will review early and more recent seminal contributions to the discovery and characterization of heparanase and non-anticoagulant heparins inhibiting its peculiar enzymatic activity. Indeed, heparanase displays a unique versatility in degrading heparan sulfate chains of several proteoglycans expressed in all mammalian cells. This endo-Î²-D-glucuronidase is overexpressed in cancer, inflammation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, nephropathies and other pathologies. Starting from known low- or non-anticoagulant heparins, the search for heparanase inhibitors evolved focusing on structure-activity relationship studies and taking advantage of new chemical-physical analytical methods which have allowed characterization and sequencing of polysaccharide chains. New methods to screen heparanase inhibitors and to evaluate their mechanism of action and in vivo activity in experimental models prompted their development. New non-anticoagulant heparin derivatives endowed with anti-heparanase activity are reported. Some leads are under clinical evaluation in the oncology field (e.g., acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, pancreatic carcinoma) and in other pathological conditions (e.g., sickle cell disease, malaria, labor arrest).

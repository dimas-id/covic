Emergency management is a relatively new research field in China. The severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 caused research and papers on emergency management to increase by leaps and bounds. This review summarises the progress of hospital emergency management research in China, highlights trends and challenges, and discusses likely solutions for research improvement. Articles were identified from a systematic search of Wanfang Med Online and PubMed, from reviews of bibliographic reference lists and by consultation with experts in the field. The search identified 2548 articles potentially involving hospital emergency management. By reviewing the titles and abstracts, we narrowed the list to 253. Reading the texts resulted in the inclusion of 85 articles in the review. Two additional articles were included from the references cited in articles that were reviewed. Research progress was summarised in terms of basic concepts and principles, system development, emergency response plan, preparedness and response, training and exercise, and management evaluation. Based on this study we suggest that hospital emergency management research in China should make efforts to (1) establish a universally accepted theory framework and terminology, (2) create a structure for further studies, (3) integrate research of different disciplines, and (4) avoid or minimise confusion. More attention should be paid on the evolvement mechanism of main public health incidents and disasters, and the key functional systems related to hospital's emergency response resiliencies. Focus should also be placed on practical guidelines and tools.

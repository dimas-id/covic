BACKGROUND Recently, novel intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy using a linear stapler after laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) was reported and termed as the overlap method. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of the overlap method for esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy after LTG or laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG), respectively. METHODS Twenty-five patients underwent anastomosis using a linear stapler during esophagojejunostomy and esophagogastrostomy after LTG and LPG, respectively. Clinicopathological data and surgical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS The average surgical duration for LTG was 236.8 min compared with 224.1 min for LPG. Postoperative complications were observed in four patients (16.0%); these included a wound infection, an intestinal obstruction, an afferent loop syndrome, and a reflux symptom. The average postoperative hospital stay of the patients was 12.5 days. There was no case of conversion to open surgery, anastomotic leakage or stenosis, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The overlap method for esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy after LTG or LPG is safe and feasible and does not require an additional minilaparotomy, which may result in less pain and favorable cosmetic outcomes.

Forensic histopathology is the application of histological techniques and examination to forensic pathology practice. It is a unique and specialised aspect of pathology practice. This chapter highlights several differences in forensic histopathology practice compared to clinical and surgical histopathology practice. The various roles of microscopic tissue examination in forensic pathology practice are categorised and discussed. These are in relation to definitive pathological diagnosis, confirmation of equivocal and occult pathology, serving as a form of permanent record, and providing invaluable material for education and research. Case examples are included to illustrate the impact of routine histological examinations, special stain techniques, as well as immunohistochemistry where appropriate, towards relevant pathological diagnoses, which may or may not be directly relevant to the establishment of the cause of death. Lastly, the chapter also aims to highlight some recent advances as well as the challenges ahead in this field.

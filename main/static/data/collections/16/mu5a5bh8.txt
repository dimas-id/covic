Measurements of the number of copies of DNA or mRNA with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) have transformed the drug development process. This transformation is driven by the information these measurements have contributed for a better understanding of the molecular definition of disease and of the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity for new drugs. As this information is translated into accurate genomic biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity, drug development processes supported by these measurements are becoming more efficient. This transformation is exemplified in the conversion of P450 enzyme activity measurements to gene expression in drug metabolism studies, the measurement of cytokine and chemokine genomic expression levels as clinical markers, and the identification and evaluation of genomic biomarkers of nephrotoxicity. A good understanding of factors affecting qPCR measurements can simplify their implementation, as will high‐throughput platforms for these assays. Drug Dev.

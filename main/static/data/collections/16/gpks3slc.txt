Within VECMAtk platform we perform Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for multiscale fusion plasmas simulations. The goal of VECMAtk is to enable modular and automated tools for a wide range of applications to archive robust and actionable results. Our aim in the current paper is to incorporate suitable features to build UQ workflow over the existing fusion codes and to tackle simulations on high performance parallel computers.

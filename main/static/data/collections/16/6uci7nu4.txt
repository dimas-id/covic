We have developed a reverse-transcriptase loop mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) method targeting genes encoding the Spike (S) protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. The LAMP assay achieves the same limit of detection as commonly used RT-PCR protocols based on artificial targets, recombinant Sindbis virus, and clinical samples. Clinical validation of single target LAMP (N=108) showed a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 33/34 (97.1%) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 73/74 (98.6%) compared to reference RT-PCR. Dual target RT-LAMP achieved a PPA of 11/11 (100%) and NPA 13/13 (100%) when including discrepant samples. The assay can be performed without a formal extraction procedure, with lyophilized reagents that do need cold chain, and is amenable to point-of-care application with visual detection.

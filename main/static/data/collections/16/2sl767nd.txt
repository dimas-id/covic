Growing healthcare expenditure is a major concern for policy makers and calls for effective cost containment measures. For the decentralized Swiss healthcare system, ranking second among OECD countries in healthcare spending, a group of experts has proposed budgetary targets as key measure. In order to substantiate this proposal, we review the literature and analyse experiences with budgetary targets in comparable social health insurance systems, such as Germany and the Netherlands. Budgetary targets raise the cost responsibility and prompt providers to give greater weight to cost-benefit considerations. Our analysis suggests that the involvement of all principal healthcare players and clear decision-making and negotiating structures are key to successful implementation. Risks of rationing, lower quality incentives or conservation of structures have to be countered with taking into account age-related morbidity and medical progress when setting the budgetary targets. Accompanying measures such as incentive-compatible remuneration schemes and quality monitoring are of paramount importance.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare work is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES: To review risk mitigation strategies in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Risk mitigation strategies to maintain ophthalmology care, to prevent collateral damage from care disruption, and to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are summarized based on the example of a tertiary referral center in Germany. RESULTS: Clinical management strategies included restricted access to buildings, triage systems, telemedicine approaches, strategies for rapid treat and release, and transparent communication strategies. Strategies to protect patients and staff relied on both standard hygiene precautions and the use of personal protective equipment for prevention of droplet infections. Physical barriers supported risk mitigation strategies. CONCLUSION: To maintain ophthalmological care during the COVID-19 pandemic, a coordinated, multifaceted approach using risk mitigation strategies to protect staff, patients, and the public was initiated.

BACKGROUND Single port access (SPA) surgery is a new procedure for minimal invasive surgery using one multichannel port. The authors adapted this technique for transanal surgery as an improvement of the transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). METHODS A total of 3 patients underwent SPA modified TEM using the SILS port (Covidien) under CO(2) insufflation. This port allows insertion of 2 laparoscopic instruments and a telescope. RESULTS The operation was completed successfully in all cases. The transanal placement of the SILS port was easy to perform; a prior dilatation of the anal sphincter was not necessary. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications as verified by postoperative observation, rectoscopy, and anal ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS Transanal single port microsurgery is a feasible and new technique for less invasive and more gentle transanal surgery. By using this new multichannel device TEM surgery was changed in a modified way while preserving the anal sphincter.

Emerging pathogenic viruses such as Ebola and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause acute infections through the evasion of the host's antiviral immune responses and by inducing the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. This immune dysregulation, termed a cytokine storm or hypercytokinemia, is potentially fatal and is a significant underlying factor in increased mortality of infected patients. The prevalence of global outbreaks in recent years has offered opportunities to study the progression of various viral infections and have provided an improved understanding of hypercytokinemia associated with these diseases. However, despite this increased knowledge and the study of the infections caused by a range of emerging viruses, the therapeutic options still remain limited. This review aims to explore alternative experimental strategies for treating hypercytokinemia induced by the Ebola, avian influenza and Dengue viruses; outlining their modes of action, summarizing their preclinical assessments and potential clinical applications.

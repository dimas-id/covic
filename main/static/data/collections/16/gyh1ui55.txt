The outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 pathogen and corresponding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had an enormous impact on both global health and the daily lives of billions of people worldwide. With a proven vaccine at least a year from being fully tested for safety and efficacy, there may be an opportunity to rapidly repurpose existing drugs in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and improve outcomes for patients already infected with COVID-19. At present, more than 40 different drugs are being explored for efficacy against COVID-19, including antivirals and immune modulating compounds. Unfortunately, many of these drugs are associated with side effects that limit their use to the most severe cases and thereby prevent their use as prophylactics. This commentary describes drug formulation strategies that can be used to maintain the efficacy of these drugs through controlled release, targeted delivery, and non-viral nucleic acid delivery. If successful, these approaches could enable the expanded use of drugs to reduce the mortality of this devastating disease and equip healthcare providers with the tools to accelerate our recovery from this pandemic and improve our response to the next outbreak of a novel pathogenic virus.

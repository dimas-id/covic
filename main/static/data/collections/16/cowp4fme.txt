The recommendation of conducting pulmonary function tests (PFTs) from different societies during and after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was rated by the experts of the Turkish Thoracic Society (TTS) and presented as the TTS experts consensus report. Information about the topic has been provided.Globally, as of mid-May 2020, there have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. There are two main routes of transmission of COVID-19: respiratory droplets and contact transmission. PFTs are non-invasive tests that are commonly performed in routine assessment and follow-up of patients in the pulmonology units. However, PFTs may generate aerosols and require sharing common surfaces. With regard to the high prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the community, PFTs should not be performed routinely in confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic. Because of the risk of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, PFTs should be restricted to a small patient population with selected indications. Triage for COVID-19 should be performed prior to testing. Only essential PFTs such as spirometry, diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), arterial blood gas analysis, or pulse oximetry should be performed in the selected cases. Tests should be scheduled to allow sufficient time for donning and doffing of the technical personnel with the full personal protective equipment (PPE) (gown, a filtering respirator mask, goggles or full-face shield, and disposable gloves), ventilation of the room, and application of post-test cleaning and disinfection procedures of the equipment and the testing room.

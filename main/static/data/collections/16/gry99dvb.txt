Abstract The infraclass Palaeognathae includes the flightless ratites (ostrich, emu, rhea, cassowary, kiwi) and the tinamous, a group of related, flighted birds. This chapter focuses on unique anatomy and important non-infectious and infectious diseases of these groups of birds. Notable among these are management-related diseases such as gastrointestinal tract impactions, OIE reportable viral diseases including those cause by the avian influenza and eastern equine encephalitis viruses, and a range of species-specific endo- and ectoparasites virus infections.

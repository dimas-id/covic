Abstract Objective To test the efficacy of an innovative COVID-19 preoperative triage protocol as a way to gradually reopen and ramp-up elective surgeries, we studied our experience and results with 103 non-elective neurosurgical surgeries performed at our institution from March 26th to April 22nd. Patients and Methods We reviewed clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data for all patients that underwent surgery within the neurosurgery department from March 26th to April 22nd 2020. We collected demographic information, comorbidities, pre-operative COVID-19 test result, whether COVID-19 respiratory or other symptoms were developed during hospitalization, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, and result of post-operative COVID-19 test. Results Using a combination of both preoperative outpatient COVID-19 drive-through and inpatient testing to obtain surgical clearance with selected telemedicine evaluations, 103 non-elective neurosurgical procedures were performed on 102 patients. No patients tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 testing obtained 48h prior to surgery. None of the patients developed any COVID-19 symptoms during their hospitalization or were re-admitted to our ED postoperatively for COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions We describe a multi-faceted preoperative triage protocol for safely performing non-elective neurosurgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could help other neurosurgical departments and hospitals minimize coronavirus exposure for patients and healthcare workers. We believe this triage strategy could be implemented at other centers to gradually restart a process towards elective surgeries in a safe way.

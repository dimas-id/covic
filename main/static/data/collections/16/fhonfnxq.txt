Abstract Endocrine therapy is a systemic therapy and has become the main treatment strategy for patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen resistance has become an insurmountable clinical challenge and the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we explored the roles of CXCR4 in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer and tamoxifen resistance. Based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, high expression of CXCR4 was found to be associated with worse overall survival (HR = 4.646, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 4.480, p < 0.001) in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer. CXCR4 was also positively correlated with the level of AKT phosphorylation and the resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer. AMD3100 is a CXCR4 antagonist and was found to decrease p-AKT levels of tamoxifen-resistant cells. The reversal effect of AMD3100 on tamoxifen resistance was also confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that CXCR4 could be a potential prognostic biomarker for tamoxifen-treated breast cancer and the combination of AMD3100 with tamoxifen could be a more efficacious therapeutic strategy for the treatment of tamoxifen resistance.

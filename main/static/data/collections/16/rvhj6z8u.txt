BACKGROUND Laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) might have greater clinical benefits for elderly patients as less invasive surgery; however, there is still little evidence to support its benefit. We evaluated the surgical outcomes of elderly patients in a nationwide prospective cohort study. METHODS One hundred and sixty-nine participating institutions were identified by stratified random sampling, and were adjusted for hospital volume, type and location. During 1 year from 2014 to 2015, consecutive patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled. 'Elderly' was defined as ≥ 75 years of age, based on the prevalence of comorbidities and the activities of daily living of patients of this age. We compared the surgical outcomes of LG to those of open gastrectomy (OG) in non-elderly and elderly patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe morbidities (Grade ≥ 3). RESULTS Eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven patients were enrolled [non-elderly, n = 6090 (OG, n = 2602; LG, n = 3488); elderly, n = 2837 (OG, n = 1471; LG, n = 1366)]. Grade ≥ 3 complications occurred in 161 (10.9%) patients who underwent OG and 98 (7.2%) who underwent LG (p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, we confirmed that laparoscopic surgery was not an independent risk factor (odds ratio = 0.81, 0.60-1.09). OG was associated with a significantly longer median length of postoperative stay in comparison to LG (16 versus 12 days, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other postoperative comorbidities. CONCLUSION The safety of LG in elderly patients was demonstrated. LG shortened the length of postoperative hospital stay.

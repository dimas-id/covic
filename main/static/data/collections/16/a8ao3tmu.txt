Older patients with combined psychiatric, physical and cognitive health problems - patients who need double care - benefit from integrated medical and psychiatric care. The characteristics of these patients, as well as the problems that may exist in offering them adequate integrated care, are illustrated on the basis of a case description. Improvement of existing regional arrangements, premised on a collaborative care model, and involving hospital care, mental health services, nursing home care and community care services, is recommended. In settings that offer 24 hour long-term residential care and treatment, the expertise of mental health services and nursing homes must be structurally combined.

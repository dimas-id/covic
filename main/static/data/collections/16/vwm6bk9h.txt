Histopathology of the ocular and periocular tissues submitted for diagnosis and research is still incipient in Brazil, in contrast to veterinary clinical ophthalmology. In this study, ocular and periocular tissues from domestic and wild animal species, mainly from the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were evaluated between February 2012 and September 2015. The samples were analyzed grossly and microscopically. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were performed on some of the samples. The frequency, type of ocular alteration, affected animal species, and affected ocular or periocular tissues were recorded. One hundred eighty-eight ocular and periocular tissues from domestic and, occasionally, wild animals were examined. Nine animals presented two concurrent alterations, adding up to 197 alterations. Proliferative lesions were the most frequent (92), followed by traumatic (43), inflammatory (37), degenerative (18), developmental (4) and vascular/hemorrhagic diseases (3). The globe was the most affected structure (112), followed by eyelids (52), third eyelid (17), bulbar conjunctiva (14) and retrobulbar region (2). Neoplasms arising from periocular tissues were the most frequent alteration (60), possibly related to a more active surgical service and histopathologic evaluation request. Many animals presented ocular lesions that reflected systemic diseases, which were diagnosed by necropsy and examination of other organs. Particularly in cases of neoplasia, early detection and surgical treatment can prevent systemic involvement. Ocular histopathologic evaluation can provide better characterization and prognosis of the clinical-pathological condition of the patient as well.(AU)

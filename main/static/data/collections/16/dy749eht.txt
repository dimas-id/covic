Cell surface proteoglycans, such as syndecans and glypicans, regulate molecular interactions that mediate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Through these activities, surface proteoglycans modulate critical biological processes of development, inflammation, infection, tissue repair, and cancer metastasis. Proteoglycans are unique glycoproteins comprised of one or several glycosaminoglycans attached covalently to core proteins. Glycosaminoglycans mediate the majority of ligand-binding functions of proteoglycans. Accumulating evidence indicates that surface proteoglycans regulate the onset, progression, and outcome of lung diseases, including lung injury, infection, fibrosis, and cancer. This article will review key features of surface proteoglycan biology in lung health and disease.

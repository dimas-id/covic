With numerous prosthetic options and a changing landscape of prosthetic development, a systematic approach to choosing a prosthetic is more sensible than trying to memorize all the details of each prosthetic. The surgeon should hone a single technique for the vast majority of inguinal hernia repairs to maximize proficiency. This limits the number of prosthetics to those suitable for that technique. Narrowing the choice further should be based on the likelihood that a given prosthetic will achieve the preoperative goals of the hernia repair. For alternative clinical scenarios, the surgeon should know one to two additional techniques, which may require a different prosthetic. The surgeon should use existing experimental and clinical data to estimate long-term benefits of any new prosthetic.

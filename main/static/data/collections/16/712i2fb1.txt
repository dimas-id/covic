Air embolism is a rare complication of computed tomography (CT)-guided preoperative marking of peripheral pulmonary nodules. Here, we describe a new CT-guided marking method, which allows the quick intraoperative identification of peripheral pulmonary nodules and avoids this complication. This method does not require piercing of the pulmonary parenchyma and uses an 18-gauge indwelling catheter and a central venous catheter with a guidewire. Between July 2009 and January 2013, 16 patients underwent this procedure and could be intraoperatively diagnosed without any air embolisms. No postoperative complications were observed in this series. We believe that this simple technique is effective and will not cause severe complications.

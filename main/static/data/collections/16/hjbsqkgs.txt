Cytokines play a critical role in the development of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we investigated whether IL-27 was elevated in patients with ALI/ARDS and its potential clinical significance. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum samples were obtained from 58 ALI/ARDS patients, and 25 control healthy volunteers. IL-27 and other inflammatory mediators were measured in BAL and serum by ELISA. Besides, a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced lung inflammation/injury was established, and serum, BAL fluid and tissues were collected for analyses in the presence or absence of IL-27 neutralizing antibodies. BAL IL-27 was found to be significantly higher in patients with ALI/ARDS than that in controls, particularly of pulmonary origin; serum IL-27 was also significantly higher. Increased IL-27 was associated with markers of inflammation, and correlated with disease severity of patients in ALI/ARDS. In a mouse model of CLP-induced lung inflammation/injury, elevated IL-27 levels were observed in the lung, serum, and BAL fluids. IL-27 neutralizing antibody treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and lung injury and improved mouse survival in response to CLP. Therefore, IL-27 is a critical cytokine in ALI/ARDS and inhibition of IL-27 may open a promising approach for ALI/ARDS patients.

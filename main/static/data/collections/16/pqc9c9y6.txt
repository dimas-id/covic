Multiple myeloma (MM) is a haematological malignancy arising from monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow, resulting in the presence of paraproteins or M-protein in serum. The involvement of paraproteins produced by malignant plasma cells in the development of hyperlipidaemia and low-HDL cholesterol has been described, as has an association with MM and obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance, that is, features of the metabolic syndrome (MS). There is an association between MS components, inflammatory cytokines, and the development of MM, and some drugs used in the treatment of MS such as statins and metformin may improve outcomes in MM.

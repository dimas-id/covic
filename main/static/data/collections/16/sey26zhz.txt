The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has created an unparalleled health crisis. Besides the acute respiratory infection, CoVs are neuroinvasive causing additional inflammation and neurodegeneration. This is likely also true of SARS-CoV-2 given reports of neurological manifestations in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive patients. Older adults > 65 years of age constitute a high-risk group prone to severe infection and death. Despite the higher mortality rate, a majority of cases are expected to recover and survive from this viral outbreak. But, the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection are unknown. We discuss these potential chronic changes to the central nervous system (CNS) in relation to accelerated brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

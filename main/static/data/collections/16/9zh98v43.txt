BACKGROUND: The aim of study was to evaluate the retinal layers and macular capillary network with OCTA in acromegaly patients, to compare with healthy population. METHODS: In this prospective, observational, and comparative study, 40 acromegaly patients and 40 healthy control participants were included. Serum IGF-1 levels and disease duration of all patients were noted. Macular layers and angiography scanning was performed with a Zeiss Cirrus 5000 OCTA system. Macular thickness, RNFL, and GC-IPL values were obtained. For central vessel and perfusion density, central 6 mm was obtained and was evaluated by dividing into three groups (inner, outer, full). FAZ parameters were evaluated dividing into three groups (area, perimeter, circularity index). Analysis of the data was performed with the SPSS for Windows. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the patient group and the control group in terms of age, gender, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), intraocular pressure (IOP), and axial length (AL). The mean follow-up period after diagnosis was 11.0 Â± 5.5 years. Central and mean macular thicknesses were also significantly higher in the acromegaly group (p < 0.05). Superior, inferior, and average RNFL thicknesses were also significantly thinner in the acromegaly group (p < 0.05). When OCTA parameters were compared between groups, there was a significant decrease in central vessel density (CVD) and central perfusion density (CPD) values in all regions in acromegaly group compared with controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings with OCTA show that acromegaly causes a significant capillary network decrease according to the healthy subjects.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Multiple single-port or single-incision techniques have been successfully implemented for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in adults and children. These techniques require either a large multichannel port or a larger skin incision to accommodate multiple ports or instruments. Inspired by a first generation single-port instrument, we developed a safe and effective technique for a single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy with virtually scarless results. METHODS Over a 14-mo period, 20 patients (19 females, 1 male) underwent the hybrid single-port cholecystectomy. A straight 10-mm Storz telescope with inbuilt 6-mm working channel in combination with 2 portless 2.3-mm percutaneous graspers was used. The dissection is carried out with 43-cm bariatric length instruments. The cystic artery and duct are sealed with WECK Hem-o-lok clips or the Harmonic scalpel. RESULTS Range (mean) age: 7.7 y to 19.5 y (15.5), BMI: 11.6kg/m(2) to 42.3kg/m(2) (27), operative duration 48 min to 120 min (79), postoperative length of stay: 5 h to 78 h (24). DIAGNOSIS 13 patients cholecystolithiasis, 7 patients biliary dyskinesia. Conversion to conventional 4-port cholecystectomy was required in 2 patients. No intra- or postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION The hybrid single-port technique is easy to master. It provides traditional anatomical exposure and allows application of conventional laparoscopic principles.

OBJECTIVE: An outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December, 2019. Facing this largescale infectious public health event, everyone is under great psychological pressure. The aim was to investigate the psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: The online cross-sectional study involving 922 participants (656 medical staff and 266 general population) was conducted in China between February and March, 2020. The psychological status was evaluated using the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90). Linear and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effect in the study. RESULTS: Of the 922 participants, approximately 18.3% had psychological health problems. The score of the SCL-90 was significant higher in medical staff (mean = 1.49) than that in general population (mean = 1.36). In addition, the participants enrolled in March were less likely to have psychological health problems than in February (odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.59). Female had a 1.44-fold risk of psychological health problems than male (95% CI = 1.01 to 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, 18.3% had psychological health problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. With the remission of the epidemic, the psychological health status of participants has been improved. Medical staff were likely to have higher SCL-90 scores than general population and female had more psychological problems than male. Our findings can be used to formulate psychological interventions for improving the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.

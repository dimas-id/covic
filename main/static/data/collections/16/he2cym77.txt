Abstract Healthcare workers run the risk of contracting COVID-19 during the course of their work if required precautions and usage of appropriate personal protective equipment is not adhered to In the transfusion testing laboratory, indirect exposure to COVID-19 may result from environmental contamination that may occur through surface contact or be airborne Handling of potentially contaminated surfaces such as sample tubes and sample packaging, and subsequent self-inoculation through the mucous membranes of mouth, nose and eyes may occur Information on the risk of indirect contact transmission of COVID-19 from such surfaces is limited When risk assessments are conducted in the laboratory, assumptions often need to be based on studies derived from other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses such as HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Influenza The other mode of potential indirect transmission is through aerosols generated from certain laboratory processes The risk of inhaling aerosolized blood containing COVID-19 viral RNA is unresolved Laboratories need to perform risk assessment of their activities before appropriate decisions can be made with regards to COVID-19 exposure risk reduction or elimination

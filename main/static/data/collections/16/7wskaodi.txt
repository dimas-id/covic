STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare the postoperative decrease in ovarian reserve between hemostasis by bipolar coagulation and suture during laparoendoscopic single-site cystectomy (LESS-C) for ovarian endometriomas. DESIGN Prospective comparative study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1). SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS One hundred twenty-five patients with ovarian endometriomas. INTERVENTIONS Patients with endometrioma were managed by hemostasis with either bipolar coagulation (n = 62) or suturing (n = 63) during LESS-C. We evaluated the impact of surgery on ovarian reserve using serum anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) levels, which were measured before surgery and 3 months after surgery in all patients. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline characteristics such as age, bilaterality of endometriomas, and preoperative AMH levels were similar between the 2 study groups. There were also no differences between the 2 groups in surgical outcomes, such as operative time, operative blood loss, or operative complications. In both study groups, postoperative AMH levels were lower than preoperative AMH levels (p < .001). The decline rate of AMH levels was significantly greater in the bipolar coagulation group than in the suture group (42.2% [interquartile range, 16.5%-53.0%] and 24.6% [interquartile range, 11.6%-37.0%], respectively, p = .001). CONCLUSION Hemostasis by bipolar coagulation after stripping of the endometrioma during LESS-C reduces ovarian reserve more than suturing does, as determined by serial AMH levels. Therefore, suturing may be a better hemostatic choice after stripping ovarian endometriomas.

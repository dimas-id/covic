Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the primary hospital-acquired infection contracted by critically ill patients who receive mechanical ventilation. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of a multifaceted VAP prevention protocol in an adult trauma population. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined according to the National Healthcare Safety Network (2009) criteria. The number of days to onset of VAP in the postprotocol period was longer than the preprotocol period despite a concomitant increase in the number of mechanical ventilation days.

Over one million cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been confirmed worldwide, with the death toll exceeding 50,000 people. An important issue to be addressed concerns the exposure of health professionals to this new virus. The first reports from Wuhan province, China, described infection rates of up to 29% among healthcare professionals before the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was fully regulated. There are several protocols on the correct use of PPE during aerosol-generating procedures. However, there is no specific guidance on how to proceed in cases of need for chest tubes in patients with positive COVID-19 active air leak. The objective of this work is to assist surgeons of the most diverse specialties during the chest drainage of a patient with COVID-19 and to avoid a risk of contamination to the professional and the environment.

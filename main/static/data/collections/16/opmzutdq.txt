An interdisciplinary working group from the German Society of Hospital Hygiene (DGKH) and the German Society for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (DGAI) worked out the following recommendations for infection prevention during anesthesia by using breathing system filters (BSF). The BSF shall be changed after each patient. The filter retention efficiency for airborne particles is recommended to be >99% (II). The retention performance of BSF for liquids is recommended to be at pressures of at least 60 hPa (=60 mbar) or 20 hPa above the selected maximum ventilation pressure in the anesthetic system. The anesthesia breathing system may be used for a period of up to 7 days provided that the functional requirements of the system remain unchanged and the manufacturer states this in the instructions for use. The breathing system and the manual ventilation bag are changed immediately after the respective anesthesia if the following situation has occurred or it is suspected to have occurred: Notifiable infectious disease involving the risk of transmission via the breathing system and the manual bag, e.g. tuberculosis, acute viral hepatitis, measles, influenza virus, infection and/or colonization with a multi-resistant pathogen or upper or lower respiratory tract infections. In case of visible contamination e.g. by blood or in case of defect, it is required that the BSF and also the anesthesia breathing system is changed and the breathing gas conducting parts of the anesthesia ventilator are hygienically reprocessed. Observing of the appropriate hand disinfection is very important. All surfaces of the anesthesia equipment exposed to hand contact must be disinfected after each case.

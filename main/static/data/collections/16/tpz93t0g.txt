Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) potently inhibits entry of diverse enveloped viruses by trapping the viral fusion at a hemifusion stage, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that recombinant IFITM3 reconstituted into lipid vesicles induces negative membrane curvature and that this effect maps to its small amphipathic helix (AH). We demonstrate that AH: (i) partitions into lipid-disordered domains where IAV fusion occurs, (ii) induces negative membrane curvature, and (iii) increases lipid order and membrane stiffness. Additionally, replacing the IFITM3 AH with AH from an unrelated protein did not compromise its antiviral activity. These effects on membrane properties correlate with the fusion-inhibitory activity, as exogenous addition of AH to insulin-producing cells reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our results thus imply that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion by imposing an unfavorable membrane curvature and increasing the order and stiffness of the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes.

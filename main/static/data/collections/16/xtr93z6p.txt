Inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMi) is a syndrome, not an etiological disease entity. The infective etiology and the immunopathology can be best determined through endomyocardial biopsy with a complete work-up by light microscopy, immunohistology, and polymerase chain reaction for microbial agents. This review focuses on the methodological advances in diagnosis in the past few years and exemplifies the importance of an etiology-orientated treatment in different case scenarios. In fulminant nonviral myocarditis, immunosuppressive treatment together with hemodynamic stabilization of the patient via mechanical circulatory support (e.g., microaxial pumps, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, left ventricular assist device) can be life-saving. For viral inflammatory cardiomyopathy, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment can resolve inflammation and often eradicate the virus.

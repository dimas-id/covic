BACKGROUND Most hepatic resections are currently performed using an open approach. Robotic surgery might enable the transition of these procedures to minimally invasive surgery. METHODS Pre-, peri- and post-operative data of all patients who underwent a liver resection from 2009/2012 to 2001/2015, were collected prospectively. All robotic resection patients were matched 1:1 to patients who underwent open surgery. Pre- and perioperative data, up to 30 days, were analyzed. RESULTS Sixteen robotic and open hepatic resections were identified. Fewer complication events and shorter lengths of stay (LOS, 7.9 versus 11 days, P = 0.0603) were observed for robotic resections. Length of stay in the intermediate care unit (IMC) was shorter after the robotic procedure (10 h vs 16.6 h, P = 0.0699). Operating room (OR) time was significantly longer in the robotic resection cohort (352.8 vs 239.6 min, P = 0.0215). All tumor margins were negative. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary comparison demonstrates the general feasibility of minor robotic liver resection in selected cases.

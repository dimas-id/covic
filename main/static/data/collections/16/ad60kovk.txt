China produced huge amount medical wastes due to large population. Through a decade, medical waste centralized disposal sector rapidly developed with both incineration and non-incineration technology. With fully consideration advanced foreign technology, a set of Best Available Technology system of China gradually formed suitable for Chinese national conditions.

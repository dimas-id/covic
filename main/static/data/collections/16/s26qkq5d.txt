It is important to consider lower gastrointestinal endoscopies (LGIE) as aerosol-generating procedures. Thus, it may be better to protect room environments by ensuring patients wearing peri-procedure diapers (PPD) to contain infectious colorectal gas expulsions because fecal SARS-CoV-2 has been detected among COVID-19 patients even after they have undetectable nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2. Summarily, PPD among LGIE patients can potentially evolve as standard barrier modality.

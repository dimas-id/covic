Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by novel SARS‐CoV‐2, leads to significant mortality and morbidity with increasing evidence for inflammatory pathways being implicated in the lung damage it causes. (1,2) Severe COVID‐19 patients present with increased inflammatory markers, akin to secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), that have been shown to predict mortality. (3,4) There is emerging evidence for the use of an interleukin 6 (IL‐6) inhibitor, tocilizumab (TCZ), for suppression of the inflammatory cytokine storm in this context. (5–7) Ruxolitinib (RXB), a JAK‐STAT inhibitor, has also been shown to have proven efficacy in the treatment of sHLH. (8) Both agents appear to be promising in the fight against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, (9,10) leading to an increasing number of trials being registered with their use. (11,12) Until this point, no single agent has shown a survival benefit against SARS‐CoV‐2 and it is possible that monotherapy may not suppress inflammation enough to overcome the COVID‐19 related cytokine storm and hyper‐inflammation.

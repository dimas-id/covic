The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of porcine parvovirus (PPV), Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV) in selected wild boar populations in Germany (n = 1,221). Commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used for serological monitoring. The serosurvey revealed seroprevalence rates of 64.28%, 11.26%, 7.87%, 7.84%, 3.82% and 1.59% for PPV, ADV, PRCV, SIV, PRRSV and TGEV, respectively. The seroprevalence rates differed between populations and age classes with the highest number of antibody-positive wild boars in older animals (>1 year old). No antibodies to TGEV were found in Baden–Wuerttemberg and in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania (investigation period 1997/1998). In addition, sera collected in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania in 1997/1998 were negative for SIV. Even though the seroprevalence rates established for these viruses, except for PPV, were relatively low, wild boars may act as a reservoir for pathogens and a source of infection for domestic pigs and humans. Based on the epidemiological situation, no risk of a spread of these viruses should emanate from wild boars, neither for wildlife nor for livestock. However, effective and science-based disease monitoring programmes should continuously be carried out in wild boar populations.

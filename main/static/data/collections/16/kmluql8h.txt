Necrotizing enterocolitis, a severe gastrointestinal disease in the neonatal period, affects primarily premature infants. Perinatal complications that predispose the neonate to systemic hypoxia are frequent in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis. Ischemia of the intestinal mucosa may facilitate the invasion of enteric microorganisms in stressed low birth weight infants. Geographical and temporal clustering of outbreaks of the disease and the termination of epidemics by standard infection control underline the importance of infectious agents in the development of this disease. Several studies have established the immunoprotective effect of orally administered antibodies against infection of the gastrointestinal mucosa in children and adults. Anecdotal evidence suggested that feeding of human immune globulin might have a positive effect on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. This paper reviews a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of the efficacy of an oral immune globulin preparation (published in detail in theNew England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 319, pp. 1â€“7, 1988) and discusses the pathogenic role of infection in necrotizing enterocolitis.

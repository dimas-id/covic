The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread have created a global health emergency. The resemblance with SARS-CoV in spike protein suggests that SARS-CoV-2 employs spikeâ€“driven entry into angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells. From a stem cell perspective, this review focuses on the possible involvement of ACE2(+) stem/progenitor cells from both the upper and lower respiratory tracts in coronavirus infection. Viral infection-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury occur because of dysregulation of the immune response. Mesenchymal stem cells appear to be a promising cell therapy given that they favorably modulate the immune response to reduce lung injury. The use of exogenous stem cells may lead to lung repair. Therefore, intervention by transplantation of exogenous stem cells may be required to replace, repair, remodel, and regenerate lung tissue in survivors infected with coronavirus. Ultimately, vaccines, natural killer cells and induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes may offer off-the-shelf therapeutics for preventing coronavirus reemergence.

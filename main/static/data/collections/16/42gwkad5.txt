Here we choose the sábalo Prochilodus lineatus, to answer the following questions: How the otolith length and weight are correlated to fish measurements (length and weight)? How reliable are the otoliths measurements to predict the length and age of P. lineatus? Finally, we propose predictive equations of the length and weight of the fish using length and weight of the otolith. The otoliths were sampled from individuals collected in the Upper Paraná River floodplain during 2012 and 2013 years. The relationships among the otolith measurements and both length and weight of the fish were performed using linear regressions. To test whether the length and weight of the otolith differ between the sampled sites, Variance Analysis was performed. Finally, we made analysis of Kruskal-Wallis to verify if the measurements obtained through the otoliths could be used to distinguish the age of the fish. We demonstrate that the length and weight of the otolith are good proxies to predict the length and weight of the fish. Although some ages were statistically different, this result does not support the idea that the age of the fish can be accurately inferred only using otolith measures.(AU)

Genetic information is passed with high accuracy from the parental organism to the offspring and its expression governs the biochemical and physiological tasks of the cell. Although different types of cells exist and are shaped by development to fill different physiological niches, all cells have fundamental similarities and share common principles of organization and biochemical activities. This chapter gives an overview of general principles of the storage and flow of genetic information. It aims to summarize and describe in a broadly approachable way, from the point of view of molecular biology, some general terms, mechanisms and processes used as a base for the molecular computing in the subsequent chapters.

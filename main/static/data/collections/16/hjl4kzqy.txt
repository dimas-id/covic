AIM To report the clinical experience of transumbilical single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TUSPLC), using a homemade laparoscopic access port composed of two inexpensive and common pieces of equipment readily available in the operating room. METHODS Fifty consecutive patients with gallstones, including ten patients (20%) with acute cholecystitis, underwent single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using a homemade single port composed of a segment of corrugated breathing tube and a pair of surgical gloves. The port was inserted into the umbilicus for simultaneous placement of multiple conventional instruments into the abdominal cavity. All patients underwent dome-down LC using traditional instruments with manually angulated shafts; dissection was done using electrocautery or harmonic scalpel. RESULTS All but two procedures were completed uneventfully. Two patients with acute cholecystitis due to dense adhesions in the triangle of Calot necessitated conversion to two- and four-port laparoscopic procedures, respectively. Operative time averaged 73 ± 2 min for chronic cholecystitis and 95 ± 5 min for acute cholecystitis. There were no perioperative port-related or surgical complications, except for two patients who developed wound seroma and recovered after conservative treatment. We found that healing of the umbilical wound left virtually no scar in all patients. CONCLUSION The homemade umbilical port reported in this study is useful for multiple instrument access and allows TUSPLC to be performed safely, with its inherent cosmetic and cost advantages. Further studies of this technique are ongoing.

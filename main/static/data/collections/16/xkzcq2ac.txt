From the clustered occurrence of numerous cases of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns, it was possible to associate this disease significantly with infection due to coronavirus-like agents. Prematurity or low birth weight did not seem to affect the development of the disease, at least during the present epidemic. However, associated gas-producing bacteria could influence its severity and play a role in the appearance of pneumatosis. In many aspects the human disease is reminiscent of experimental necrotizing enterocolitis obtained by infection of germ-free newborn animals, as reported in the literature.

Developing safety-critical systems requires to consider safety and real-time requirements in addition to functional requirements. Event-B is a formalism that is visualised by iUML-B and supports the development of functional aspects having rich verification and validation tools. However, it lacks well-established support for timing analysis. UPPAAL Timed Automata (UTA), on the other hand, address timing aspects of systems, and enable model checking reachability and timing properties. By integrating iUML-B and UTA, we combine the best verifying and validating practices from the two methods achieving a formal development of systems. We present the mapping for translating iUML-B constructs to UTA. The novel aspect is the use of a multi-process trigger-response pattern to address the modelling and verification of reachability properties of complex systems with concurrent processes. The approach is demonstrated on an airport control system, where timing, fairness, as well as liveness properties play a vital role in proving safety requirements.

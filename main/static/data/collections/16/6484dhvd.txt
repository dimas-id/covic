INTRODUCTION One third of cancer deaths are related to poor diet, physical inactivity and obesity. The high healthcare costs of cancer treatment and its repercussions on the quality of life have led the scientific community to investigate a variety of other interventions. METHODS Review of experimental and observational studies of the last 5 years, including adult subjects surviving colorectal cancer, subjected to lifestyle interventions of a minimum duration of 12 weeks. The review was guided by the PRISMA statement (data extraction from PubMed, Science Direct and EBSCO: Medline Complete). The selection of the studies was completed using the Covidence platform. RESULTS There are positive associations between physical activity level and quality of life; on the other hand, in survivors of colorectal cancer, inverse relationships between time of sedentary attitude and quality of life are evidenced. CONCLUSION Lifestyle interventions generate an increase in quality of life indicators in survivors of colorectal cancer.

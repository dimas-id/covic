The worldwide epidemic of three coronaviruses and one influenza virus in 21(st) century have seriously threatened human health. Infection with these viruses can cause respiratory symptoms. The patients with lung cancer are more susceptible to viral infection and have a worse prognosis due to the advanced age and the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy itself and the anticancer treatments. In addition, without sufficient clinical awareness, a missed diagnosis of viral pneumonia may occur due to the fever and respiratory symptoms caused by lung cancer and its secondary diseases. Furthermore, control measures against viral outbreaks may interfere with routine diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients. Therefore, scientific protection and individualized management of lung cancer patients are particularly important during virus epidemic prevention and control. Here, we systematically reviewed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of viral pneumonia, its impact on patients with lung cancer and the differential diagnosis of lung cancer-related respiratory manifestations, aiming to provide guidance for the individual management of lung cancer patients during the prevention and control of viral pneumonia epidemic.

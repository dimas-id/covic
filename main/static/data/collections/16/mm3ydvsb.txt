Innovation follows discovery. If the 20th century was a golden age of discovery in the biomolecular biosciences, the current century may be remembered by the explosion of beneficial devices and therapies conceived by the bioengineers of the era. Much as the development of solid-state electronic components made possible the information revolution, the rational combining of millions of basic molecular control modules will enable the development of highly sophisticated biomachines that will make today's smartphones appear rudimentary. The molecular toolbox is already well-stocked, particularly in our ability to manipulate DNA, control transcription, generate functionally novel hybrid proteins, and expand the genetic code to include unnatural amino acids. This review focuses on how RNA-based regulatory modules that direct alternative readings of the genetic code can be employed as basic circuit components to expand our ability to control gene expression.

Janibacter hoylei has previously been isolated only from an air sample in the upper atmosphere and clinical significance of J. hoylei was not yet established. Herein, we report a case of bacteremia caused by J. hoylei. An 8‐week‐old previously healthy male infant presented to the emergency room with fever. Blood culture yielded growth of Gram‐positive bacilli and this microorganism could not be identified with conventional phenotypic methods. The isolate was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the patient was successfully treated with vancomycin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the recovery of J. hoylei in humans. This case shows that J. hoylei can be a potential pathogen in young children.

Abstract Isogrid structure is a grid stiffening structure formed by partially hollowing out triangular shapes to produce rib features on the surface of the plate. These features are widely used in the aerospace industry for producing lightweight with efficient structures. These structures are usually expensive to manufacture using conventional subtractive manufacturing processes. Therefore, this work involves checking the feasibility of design optimization for additive manufacturing(AM) of Isogrid and Non-Isogrid structure-based structural components subjected to impact loads. Izod impact test, as per ASTM D256, on seven specimens, were performed to check the energy that the material is capable of withstanding for the samples made using various AM parameters(layer height=0.2mm, feed rate 1800mm/min, bed temperature=70◦C, Nozzle temperature= 210 ◦C). Analysing the results of Izod impact test, the projectile velocity of impact for a trivial plate such as of 5mm thickness was used. The results from a trivial case impact test were used to predict the velocity of impact on the identical volume samples. The identical volume samples such as plate, plate stiffened by Isogrid without H-ribs, plate stiffened by Isogrid with H-ribs were used. Also, these results were correlated with simulations, and it was found that Isogrid stiffened plate with H-ribs was more stable.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in new challenges for clinicians, head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and carers. There is evidence that the current crisis is affecting the management of HNC patients. Most healthcare systems have introduced remote consultations to decrease the risk of coronavirus infection to patients, carers and clinicians. At present, HNC patients may be anxious and due to logistical issues, may not be adequately prepared for their treatment. To ensure that patients have a thorough understanding of their treatment and expected outcome during the current COVID-19 crisis there may be merit in the use of the HaNC-AD PCI.

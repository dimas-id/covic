Abstract Background There is accumulating evidence that human rhinovirus (HRV) causes acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI). Recently, HRV-C was identified as a new species of HRV, but its spectrum of clinical disease is not well understood. Objectives We investigated the molecular epidemiology, demographic and clinical characteristics of HRVs among hospitalized children with ALRIs. Study design One hundred and sixty-five nasopharangeal aspirates taken from children <5 years hospitalized with ALRTIs in Serdang Hospital, Malaysia, were subject to reverse transcriptase-PCR for HRV. Phylogenetic analysis on VP4/VP2 and 5â€²-NCR regions was used to further characterize HRV. Other respiratory viruses were also investigated using semi-nested multiplex RT-PCR assay. Clinical parameters were analyzed between HRV, RSV and IFV-A mono-infections and between HRV species. Results HRV was detected in 54 (33%) patients for both single (36 samples) and multiple (18 samples) infections, 61.1% (22/36) represents HRV-A strains while the remaining 14 HRV-C. Strain P51was the first reported representative of HRV98. The majority of the single HRV cases were in the second half of infancy; HRV-C occurred among older children compared with HRV-A. HRV children were admitted significantly earlier and less febrile than RSV and IFV-A infection. HRV-C infected children were more likely to have rhonchi and vomiting as compared to HRV-A. Pneumonia was the most common discharge diagnosis followed by bronchiolitis and post-viral wheeze in HRV patients. Conclusion Our study showed high prevalence of HRVs and detection of HRV-C among hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Malaysia. Analysis of clinical parameters suggested specific features associated with HRVs infections and specific HRV groups.

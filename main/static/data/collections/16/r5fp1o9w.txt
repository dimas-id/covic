Using immunoenzyme histochemical analysis, we retrospectively examined lung tissue specimens obtained at autopsy from 118 patients with cancer who had received chemotherapy and 20 patients who had died after myocardial infarction. Respiratory viral antigens were demonstrated in lung tissue specimens from eight of 118 cancer patients and two of 20 myocardial infarction patients. Most of the patients with demonstrable viral antigens were febrile and had signs of pulmonary infection, but in no case was pulmonary viral infection considered clinically. The following viral antigens were demonstrated: influenza A virus (6 patients), respiratory syncytial virus (2), influenza B virus (1), and parainfluenza virus type 1 (1).

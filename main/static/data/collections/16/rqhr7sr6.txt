Large-scale, inter-basin water diversion projects have been developed to relieve water scarcity crisis and water pollution problems. Environmental status and ecosystem impacts are largely unknown for the Wanjiazhai Yellow River Diversion Project (YRDP-WJZ), a water body critical in northern China. In the current study, twelve hydrochemical indices (including Mn, Cu, Zn, Hg, Pb, NH3-N, COD-Mn, DO, BOD5, COD, TP, and TN) were collected from 2008 to 2017 based on multiple analytical approaches to understand environmental status and ecological risks. Human health risk and threats to aquatic organisms from heavy metals were assessed. Heavy metals have no regular spatial distribution. Biochemical parameters and nutrients pollute seriously in midstream and downstream, respectively. Hydrochemical indices suggested high levels of pollution in the midstream section. Water quality improved downstream of the Fenhe Reservoir, but total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the downstream section increased in recent years. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CWQI) suggested midstream water quality was poor in general, and 80% of annual calculations had a marginal grade. For aquatic organisms, ecological risks of Cu and Zn were high. For local residents, drinking water was generally safe, but continued monitoring is critical due to ongoing threats to water quality in these areas.

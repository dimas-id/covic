INTRODUCTION: In adults and children with RSV infection, a polymorphism in the IL-6 promoter at position −174 predicted illness magnitude. Also, polymorphisms in the IL-10, TNFα and INFγ genes were associated with immune responsiveness and the frequency of complications. Here, the effect of these polymorphisms on illness and seroconversion during infection with rhinovirus type 39 (RV39) was evaluated. METHODS: Seventy-two adults were genotyped for the selected polymorphisms, experimentally exposed to RV39 and followed for infection, seroconversion and symptoms/signs of illness. Regression analysis was used to determine if these polymorphisms predicted seroconversion and illness magnitude in 57 infected subjects. RESULTS: The low production IL-6 (−174, C/C) phenotype was associated with greater symptom magnitudes and the INFγ (+874) phenotype predicted the frequency of seroconversion. No relationship between the IL-10 or TNFα polymorphisms and any measured outcome was documented. IL-6 protein measured in nasal wash fluids of 51 subjects was positively correlated with symptom magnitude but was independent of the IL-6 (−174) genotypes representing high and low production phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results document significant associations between the IL-6 (−174) and INFγ (+874) gene polymorphisms and specific responses to experimental RV39 infection. For the IL-6 (−174) polymorphism, the results replicate those for RSV infection.

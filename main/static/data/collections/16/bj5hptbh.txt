Abstract Infections of the upper respiratory tract represent an important source of morbidity and potentially of life-threatening complications. This group of infections represents one of the most frequent outpatient consultations; and includes a range of clinical syndromes that may go from a self-limited common cold, to acute rhinosinusitis, otitis media, to life threatening condition such as epiglottitis. Importantly, acute respiratory illness account for approximately 75% of the total number of antibiotic prescriptions per year; an often many of these conditions are of viral origin. When acute pharyngitis is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, it is important to consider treatment to prevent transmission, reduce symptoms, and prevent its associated suppurative and nonsuppurative complications. Acute bacterial sinusitis can be associated with severe complications. Upper respiratory infection can also lead to life-threatening infections of the peripharyngeal and deep fascial spaces of the head and neck.

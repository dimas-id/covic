Currently, the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has unprecedentedly captivated its human hosts by causing respiratory illnesses because of evolution of the genetic makeup of novel coronavirus (CoV) known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2). As much as the researchers are inundated for the quest of effective treatments from available drugs, the discovery and trials of new experimental drugs are also at a threshold for clinical trials. There has been much concern regarding the new and targeted drugs considering the comprehensive ambiguity regarding the mechanism and pathway of the drug action with respect to the new and unpredictable structural and nonstructural proteins (NSPs) of SARS CoV-2. This study was aimed to discuss functional pathways related to NSPs in CoVs with updated knowledge regarding SARS CoV-2, mechanisms of action of certain approved and investigational drugs for correct orientation regarding the treatment strategies, including nucleotide analog mechanism, receptor analog mechanism, and peptide-peptide interactions, along with the impact of COVID-19 on a global scale. Although there is a dire need for targeted drugs against SARS CoV-2, the practical achievement of its cure is possible by only using effective drugs with appropriate mechanisms to eliminate the disease.

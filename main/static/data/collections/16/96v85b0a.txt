The rapid spread of avian influenza H5N1 in Asia in late 2003 has moved the world to a new state of pandemic alert. The risk of further human cases will persist, as will opportunities for a pandemic virus to emerge. Therefore, Canada has taken a number of steps to strengthen national pandemic preparedness. Coordination has been fostered through the development of a national pandemic preparedness plan and ongoing development of systems and processes for national health emergency management. Specific areas of advancement include: enhancement of rapid surveillance and communication capacity, the pandemic vaccine strategy, acquisition of an antiviral stockpile, research prioritization, international collaboration, and an international meeting of Ministers of Health (October 2005) to enhance global cooperation and coordination in advance of a possible influenza pandemic. Key next steps include: publication of the 2005 edition of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan; conducting emergency exercises to help strengthen planning at all levels and across health care, emergency management and NGO sectors; developing H5N1 vaccine and clinical trials; evaluating the need to supplement national antiviral stockpile; and undertaking public and key stakeholder consultations to provide further input into planning strategies and activities.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains is a major health problem worldwide. There is an urgent need for novel strategies to combat bacterial infections caused by MDR strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Quorum sensing (QS) is a critical communication system in bacterial community controlling survival and virulence. The awareness of the importance of QS in bacterial infections has stimulated research to identify QS inhibitors (QSIs) to defeat microbes. In this study, four FDA-approved drugs (besides azithromycin as positive QSI) were tested for potential QS inhibition against clinical A. baumannii isolates and P. aeruginosa (PAO1) standard strain. The inhibitory effect of these drugs on virulence factors of both microbes has been investigated. The studied virulence factors include biofilm formation, twitching and swarming motilities, proteolytic enzyme production, and resistance to oxidative stress. The four tested drugs (erythromycin, levamisole, chloroquine, and propranolol) inhibited QS in Chromobacterium violaceum by 84, 72, 55.1, and 37.3%, respectively. They also significantly inhibited virulence factors in both PAO1 and A. baumannii at sub-inhibitory concentrations. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR and mice mortality test, where tested drugs highly repressed the expression of abaI gene and showed significantly improved mice survival rates. In addition, molecular docking studies against AbaI and AbaR proteins of QS system in A. baumannii revealed the potential inhibition of QS by tested drugs. Beside their known activities, the tested drugs could be given new life as QSIs to combat A. baumannii nosocomial infections (alone or in combination with antimicrobials).

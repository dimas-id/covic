OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of cervical cancer and the age-specific survival from small cell cervical carcinoma in Taiwan. DESIGN Retrospective study. Setting. Taiwan. POPULATION Women diagnosed with cervical cancer from 1991 to 2005. METHODS Analysis of data from the National Cancer Registration System and National Death Certification System. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence and age at diagnosis of cervical carcinoma and age-specific and overall survival from small cell cervical carcinoma. RESULTS During the study period, 36 122 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 81.8% had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). For the periods 1991-1995, 1996-2000 and 2001-2005, the mean age at diagnosis increased from 53.9 ± 13.3 to 55.0 ± 14.9 and then to 56.7 ± 14.7 years, respectively. The incidence of SCC decreased from 1991 to 2005. During the same period, non-significant increases of adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma were noted. For SCC, occurrence peaked in 1991-1995 in patients 50-59 years of age. From 1996 to 2005, it peaked in patients 40-49 years of age. For cervical adenocarcinoma, occurrence peaked in patients 40-49 years of age, with a steady increase in this age group from 1991 to 2005. Occurrence of small cell cervical carcinoma peaked in the period 1991-1995 in patients 30-39 years of age. During the 15 years of the study, the overall mortality rate of the 198 patients with small cell cervical carcinoma was 65.7%. CONCLUSIONS In Taiwan, the incidence of small cell cervical carcinoma and adenocarcinoma tended to increase, but the incidence of squamous cell cervical carcinoma significantly decreased during the period 1991-2005.

OBJECTIVES This systematic review of contemporary literature sought to better understand racial and ethnic minority patients' shared decision-making (SDM) preferences, challenges and facilitators. METHODS Data sources were PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science databases for publications between 2011 and 2016. Publications were included if they studied SDM during the clinical encounter for minority adults in clinical care in the United States. We conducted a narrative, descriptive synthesis of each study. RESULTS From over 5000 publications identified through the search strategy, 18 met eligibility criteria following an abstract and full text (n = 685) review in Covidence. Studies focused on SDM in developing treatment plans (n = 10), and were conducted in primary care (n = 6) or hospital/health system settings (n = 6). Patients' decision preferences ranged from physician-driven altogether or initially, to patient-driven style. A comprehensive list of SDM facilitators and barriers was developed. CONCLUSION Despite strong policy and research SDM support to increase patient communication and a growing published literature, results suggest lack of representation of minority populations in contemporary literature. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Provider training may be needed to facilitate patient-provider transition from a passive toward a more active SDM engagement over time while confidence, trust and rapport is established.

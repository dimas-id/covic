Abstract Besides the classical individual stroke risk factors a new class has appeared, the environmental risk factors. After a review of the evidences demonstrating that air pollution is a potent risk factor (Part 1), we propose an update of other physical, chemical, and biological factors, now considered as risk factors (Part 2). One of the challenges is to precise their specific roles as they can be combined in their noxious impacts (traffic air pollution+noise+weather+infections). This knowledge has practical consequences; From now on, medical advices cannot be limited to individual recommendations but must also deal with environmental public health issues.

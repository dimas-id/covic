Since December 2019, Wuhan city of Hubei Province has been the center of a number of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). People are susceptible to be infected. The infection has spread to newborn and small infants, and severe cases of children have now occurred. Cases of infection in children have drawn great attention from the society. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is unclear, and there is no specific drug for treatment, which brings great difficulties to epidemic prevention and clinical treatment. In this paper, we try to understand COVID-19 in children from different perspectives of TCM and western medicine. We also try to analyze the etiology, epidemic characteristics, disease development characteristics and treatment measures of COVID-19 in children. At the same time, we try to explore the etiology, pathogenesis, syndrome differentiation and treatment of COVID-19 in children with TCM. It is hoped that the combination of TCM and western medicine can better understand the new coronavirus pneumonia in children and its pathological basis, analyze the current trend of the epidemic situation, so as to find out safe and effective prevention and control measures and provide reference for clinical prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in children.

We replicate recent experiments attempting to demonstrate an attractive hypothesis about the use of the Fisher kernel framework and mixture models for aggregating word embeddings towards document representations and the use of these representations in document classification, clustering, and retrieval. Specifically, the hypothesis was that the use of a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher (VMF) distributions instead of Gaussian distributions would be beneficial because of the focus on cosine distances of both VMF and the vector space model traditionally used in information retrieval. Previous experiments had validated this hypothesis. Our replication was not able to validate it, despite a large parameter scan space.

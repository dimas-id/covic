Research studies have highlighted both physiological and pathological evidence to incriminate surfactant abnormality and/or deficiency in many neonatal respiratory diseases. Data from animal models and clinical studies support the concept that surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) may have a role to play in such problems. There is now, therefore, a need to perform further randomized controlled trials to assess the appropriate clinical application of SRT in non-respiratory distress syndrome neonatal respiratory disease.

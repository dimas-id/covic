An increasing number of oncologic patients are presenting to the intensive care unit with complications from both their chronic disease states and cancer therapies due to improved survival rates. The management of these patients is complex due to immunosuppression (from the malignancy and/or treatment), metabolic complications, and diverse medication regimens with the potential for significant drug-drug interactions and overlapping adverse effects. This chapter will provide clinicians with an overview of non-chemotherapy medications frequently encountered in the critically ill oncologic patient, with a focus on practical considerations.

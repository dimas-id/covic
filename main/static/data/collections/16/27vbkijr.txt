Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has rapidly been adopted as a primary surgical procedure in bariatric patients. The technique of multiport sleeve gastrectomy is described using 4 to 6 ports and an additional port for a liver retractor. A technique of single-port sleeve gastrectomy has been described, the principal advantages of which appear to reduced postoperative pain and an improved cosmetic outcome. In this paper we describe a novel, and easily reproducible technique for the performance of a sleeve gastrectomy using only 3 ports that does not compromise the procedure and may offset the disadvantages of a multiport technique.

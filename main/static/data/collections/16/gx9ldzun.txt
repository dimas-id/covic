Coronavirus, with a 31-kb RNA genome, replicates its own RNA and transcribes subgenomic mRNAs by complex mechanisms. Viral RNA synthesis is regulated by multiple RNA regions, which appear to interact either directly or indirectly. Multiple cellular proteins bind to these regions and may undergo additional protein-protein interactions. These findings suggest that coronavirus RNA synthesis is carried out on a ribonucleoprotein via a mechanism that involves both viral and cellular proteins associated with viral RNA, similar to DNA-dependent RNA transcription. This mode of RNA synthesis may be applicable to most RNA viruses.

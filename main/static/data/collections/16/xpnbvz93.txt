OBJECTIVE To develop a novel technique for left paralumbar laparoscopic bilateral ovariectomy in standing, sedated mares. STUDY DESIGN Prospective descriptive clinical study. ANIMALS Twelve client-owned mares. METHODS Healthy mares with normal ovarian palpation and ultrasonographic appearance were enrolled. Horses were restrained in standing stocks and administered a variable rate infusion of sedation. A left paralumbar bilateral ovariectomy was performed with 1 laparoscopic and 3 instrument portals. Access to the right ovary was facilitated by retracting the descending colon and associated mesentery with a fan retractor. Ovaries were removed with traumatic forceps, and a blunt tip vessel sealing device. A laparoscopic portal within the 17th intercostal space provided good visualization of the right ovary and reduced interference between instrumentation. Complications were recorded during hospitalization. In addition, an owner follow-up questionnaire was used to determine complications after discharge from the hospital. RESULTS Left paralumbar bilateral ovariectomy was successful in all 12 mares, with a mean surgical time of 76 Â± 8 minutes. Postoperative complications occurred in 4/12 (33%) mares and included fever, mild colic, incisional swelling, and azotemia. Complications resolved and mares returned to full activity, with complete owner satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral ovariectomy can be successfully achieved with minimal morbidity in standing mares with normal ovarian ultrasonographic appearance via left paralumbar laparoscopy.

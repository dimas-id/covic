Onyx reflux into the parent artery is a rare and sometimes significant complication in the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We report a patient who presented with Onyx reflux into the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during embolization of a right temporal AVM. The refluxed Onyx cast was successfully removed by a mechanical thrombectomy device using a self-expandable and fully retrievable Solitaire AB stent.

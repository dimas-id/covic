Tibiopedal artery access is being used with increasing frequency as an alternative access to facilitate procedural success in lower extremity arterial intervention. This technique is usually employed in the setting of critical limb ischemia and tibial artery intervention, but it may offer potential practical advantages for popliteal artery and even superficial femoral artery intervention in unique situations. As in all cases of lower extremity arterial intervention, consideration of access is important not only for initial approach to any obstructing lesion but also for exit strategy. The dorsalis pedis artery and posterior tibial artery can be readily accessed if necessary owing to their relatively superficial position in the foot or the ankle, yet their normal diameter and the presence of significant calcification (a common finding in patients with tibial occlusive disease and critical limb ischemia) can pose difficulties as well. In addition, the peroneal artery in the lower leg can be accessed percutaneously; however, its size and depth may present additional challenges. Meticulous attention to detail is paramount in avoiding complications in what may be the only distal vessel supplying the foot. This article describes common techniques in using tibiopedal artery access as a means of alternative access for successful infrainguinal intervention.

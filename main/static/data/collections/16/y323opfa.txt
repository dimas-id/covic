During the initial spring wave of novel influenza pH1N1 (2009), several North American cities experienced localized epidemics that served as a harbinger of the larger second Fall wave of infection. The city of Winnipeg, the capital of the province of Manitoba in central Canada, was one of the first in North America to deal with a rapid presentation of large numbers of patients requiring critical care services resulting from pandemic (pH1N1) 2009 influenza-associated respiratory failure. Mexico City, Orlando, FL, and Salt Lake City, UT, were other Northern Hemisphere sites of heavy disease activity during the spring wave of the pandemic. This article is written in a narrative format that allows the reader to understand the problems (both major and mundane, anticipated and unexpected) experienced by healthcare workers in these sites during this pandemic. Descriptions cover a range of issues and difficulties that caused significant stress to the operations of intensive care units in these cities. We hope to offer some insight into potential pitfalls and problems that may be experienced by other centers and provide some potential approaches to addressing these issues.

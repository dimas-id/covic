Porcine astroviruses (PoAstV) are found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy and diseased pigs worldwide. However, their role in causing enteric disease in pigs and other animals has not been elucidated. In the present report, we describe for the first time in Italy, the identification and genetic characterization, through whole genome sequencing, of a PoAstV2 in pigs in Northeast Italy in 2015. This instance is the first detection of PoAstV2 in pigs in Italy. The phylogenetic analysis of the complete ORF2 segment highlights the high similarity of this virus to those circulating that same year in Japan. There are very few full astrovirus genomes available, and the present data represent an important contribution towards a better understanding of the characteristics and evolution of these viruses.

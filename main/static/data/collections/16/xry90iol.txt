Bi-linderone (1) was isolated as racemate from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Lindera aggregata. The structure elucidation of bi-linderone was reported on the basis of extensive analysis of NMR spectra and crystal X-ray diffraction. Bi-linderone has an unprecedented spirocyclopentenedione-containing carbon skeleton and showed significant activity against glucosamine-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells at a concentration of 1 microg/mL.

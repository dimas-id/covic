The new pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected children, including neonates, who mostly comprise of approximately 2% of total confirmed cases. Most children are asymptomatic or have mild disease and much lower mortality compared to adults for yet unknown reasons. Recovery from illness has largely been universal and <2% have severe disease requiring intensive care. Standardised guidelines from initial studies are now available for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Treatment is mostly supportive with no recommendations for any specific drugs so far. As the pandemic evolves, it is expected that more children will be diagnosed and treated with evolving newer regimens. Research should now focus on early diagnosis, better drugs for children, intensive care modalities, and a universal vaccine. New developments will help in better prevention asides from the other precautionary measures already being practiced.

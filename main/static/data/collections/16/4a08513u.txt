PURPOSE To report a transnasal snare technique for retrograde primary jejunostomy placement after surgical gastrojejunostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two patients underwent the transnasal snare technique for retrograde primary jejunostomy placement. Patients included two females, age 58 and 62. In both patients, a gooseneck snare was inserted in a transnasal fashion. After insertion of the snare into the jejunum, the location was confirmed with ultrasound. The snare was then targeted using a Chiba needle through which a 0.018-inch wire was advanced and snared through the nose. The wire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch Amplatz wire over which the tract was serially dilated followed by insertion of the jejunostomy catheter through a peel-away sheath. Technical success, complications, and follow-up were recorded. RESULTS Primary jejunostomy placement was technically successful in both patients. No minor or major complications occurred. Both patients received enteral nutrition the day following placement. Follow-up was at 54 and 38 days for patients 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSION The transnasal snare technique provides a novel alternative for primary jejunostomy insertion allowing for targeting of the jejunum with improved procedural success and no complications.

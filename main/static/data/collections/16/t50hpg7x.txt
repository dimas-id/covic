OBJECTIVE To report on a case of intravesical explosion during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) which was managed laparoscopically and to review the relevant literature. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION During TURP, a loud explosion was heard, and a jolt was felt in the abdomen. A bladder tear was seen endoscopically. Systematic laparoscopic exploration showed no injury to abdominal organs apart from the irregular large bladder tear which was repaired laparoscopically. The patient had an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSION Bladder explosion during TURP is an extremely rare and serious complication. It should be considered as a blast injury and systematic exploration of abdominal organs and vessels should be performed. The severity and urgency of the condition should not preclude the use of laparoscopy for exploration and repair.

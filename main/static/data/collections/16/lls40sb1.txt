Available information on chest Computed Tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is constantly evolving. Ground glass opacities and consolidation with bilateral and peripheral distribution were reported as the most common CT findings, but also less typical features could be identified. All radiologists should be aware of the imaging spectrum of the COVID-19 pneumonia and imaging changes in the course of the disease. Our aim is to display the chest CT findings at first assessment and follow-up through a pictorial essay, to help in the recognition of these features for an accurate diagnosis.

BACKGROUND esophageal diverticula are classified as 2 types: true diverticula and pseudodiverticula. These disorders result in clinical manifestations such as dysphagia and esophageal reflux. In this study, we evaluated the results of surgical treatment for diverticula. METHODS all patients suffering from symptomatic esophageal diverticulum, who underwent surgical treatment in Ghaem Hospital from 2000 to 2012 and were followed up for at least for one year, were included in the study. Age, sex, clinical manifestations, location, surgical approach, and mortality were evaluated. There were 25 patients (15 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 41 Â± 8.3 years. RESULTS the most common site of involvement was inferior (epiphrenic diverticulum). Barium swallow was diagnostic. After surgical treatment, complications occurred in 4 (16%) patients, comprising anastomosis site leakage, hoarseness, atelectasis, and wound infection; all were treated medically. There was no postoperative mortality. All patients experienced an improvement in symptoms during one year of follow-up. CONCLUSION due to the good results and minimal complications postoperatively, surgical treatment is recommended for patients with symptomatic esophageal diverticulum.

The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic in December 2019 has highlighted issues with hospital biosafety capacitation in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, although the epidemic has been controlled now. This study examined the primary issues, including an absence of hospital emergency system, inadequate management and control of nosocomial infection, limited hospital laboratory capacity, and poor hospital admission capacity. Accordingly, the study put forward the following countermeasures and suggestions for hospitals to deal with future biosecurity events, such as a major epidemic: first, there is a need to build biosecurity management systems and emergency response mechanisms in hospitals; second, the investment and guarantee mechanisms for hospital biosecurity construction should be improved; third, the capacity building of biosecurity incident treatment needs attention in general hospitals; and fourth, comprehensive plans need to be developed for the integrated construction of medical treatment and prevention facilities through disease-control systems.

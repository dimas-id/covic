Plastic surgeons desire more efficient methods of processing lipoaspirate when performing fat grafting procedures. We compared, in a preclinical study, the quantity and quality of lipoaspirate processed by a novel Poloxamer Wash, Absorption, mesh filtration System (PWAS) to a frequently used Ringer's Lactate wash, Decant, and mesh filtration System (RLDS). Methods Lipoaspirate from 10 patients was processed with the RLDS and PWAS systems. The processed lipoaspirate from each device was centrifuged to quantify the amount of fat, free oil, and aqueous components remaining in the fat graft. A trypan blue dye exclusion test assessed cell viability. The processing time for the lipoaspirate was also measured. Results The 10-patient average fat volume processed and available for grafting was similar using both systems. The adipose volume fraction of PWAS was greater (89% ± 3%) than RLDS (76% ± 10%, P = 0.02). The trypan blue exclusion values and processing time were similar for both systems. Oil was efficiently removed from the lipoaspirate, and both systems processed fat efficiently. Conclusion The PWAS effectively cleans lipoaspirate with increased fat concentration.

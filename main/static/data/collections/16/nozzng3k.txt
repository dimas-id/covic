Because it is minimally invasive, laparoscopic surgery is preferred over open surgery. However, it is often difficult to maintain an adequate surgical field during the procedure. As in open laparotomy, securing an adequate surgical field is important for adequate visualization. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the Endoractor, an organ retraction sponge that can be inserted through a 12-mm trocar to secure a surgical field in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. The Endoractor, a 100% cellulose compressed sponge, can be expanded using physiologic saline solution, with the result that the swollen sponge displaces organs away from the surgical field. Between October 2009 and April 2010, we used the Endoractor in 24 patients, placed in a Trendelenberg position, during laparoscopic surgery. In no patients, even with return to a horizontal position, did the intestines fall into the pelvis, and surgery was easily performed. Mean (SD; 95% CI) operative time was 92.7 (44.5; 74.0-111.6) minutes, and blood loss was 54.1 (73.1; 22.9-82.1) mL. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 3. Even with the patient in a horizontal position without use of the Trendelenberg position, the Endoractor enables a good surgical field to be secured. It remains to be seen whether this device works as well in obese patients.

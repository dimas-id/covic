BACKGROUND: In children, the infection with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, tends to be clinically inapparent more often or less severe than in adults. The spread of this infection from children poses a danger to vulnerable adults. Therefore, child care institutions and schools currently are widely closed. METHODS: Since the status of infection tends to be congruent in mothers and their children, we tested 401 mothers of children between 1 and 10 years in the city of Rostock (State of Mecklenburg-Westpomerania, northeast of Germany), for the presence of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, and of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. RESULTS: In none of the mothers tested, RNA of this virus was detected in the throat swab. In the ELISA test, IgG antibodies were positive in one serum sample, IgA antibodies were positive in 11, and borderline in 3 serum samples. All 401 sera were negative in the indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) with FITC-labeled IgG, IgA, und IgM antibodies. CONCLUSION: At the time of this study, neither SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nor specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in the mothers tested in Rostock.

Abstract Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) is a commensal of the mucous membranes and skin of animals, notably equine, and is associated with various infections in animals and humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of respiratory disease in a cattery, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report of S. zooepidemicus infection in cats. Clinical disease was characterized firstly by abundant purulent nasal discharges and cough, progressing to sinusitis, dyspnea, symptoms of pneumonia and death. Pathological examination revealed different degrees of inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. S. zooepidemicus was the main bacteria isolated. Sequencing of the V2 fragment of the 16S gene revealed that the isolates were distributed in two previously described genogroups.

Objective@#To investigate the role of epidemiological history in the screening of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in fever clinic, to improve the efficiency in fever clinic and reduce the incidence of cross infection.@*Methods@#This is a retrospective study. Patients who were admitted to the fever clinic in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 23th, 2020 to February 11th, 2020 included the study. According to epidemiological history, the patients were divided into epidemiological history group (the experimental group) and no epidemiological history group (the control group). The two groups of patients were admitted and treated separately. The clinical data, NEWS score, etiology results, viral pneumonia showed on CT, time of visit, COVID-19 patient ratio, and admission composition ratio were compared between the two groups. The measurement data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and the numeration data were expressed as ratio or constituent ratio. The measurement data of normal distribution between the two groups were compared by independent sample t test. The measurement data of skewed distribution are expressed by the median (interquartile range), and the comparison between the two groups is tested by non-parameter. The differences between enumeration data were assessed by chi-square test. A P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.@*Results@#A total of 2423 patients were included, including 927 patients in the experimental group and 1296 patients in the control group. There were no significant differences in gender, NEWS score and clinical symptoms between the two groups (P&gt; 0.05). The age (35.00 ± 12.80 vs 38.13 ± 15.57 years) , the proportion of fever patients (28.80% vs 32.75%) and waiting time (31.72 vs 58.08 min) of the experimental group were lower than the control group, the difference was statistically significant (P &lt;0.05). The CT examination ratio (37.54% vs 20.39%), viral pneumonia ratio showed on CT (9.77% vs 2.95%), ratio of examined COVID-19 nucleic acid test (85.44% vs 56.75%), and the admission ratio (16.72% vs 9.63%) of the experimental group were higher than the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P &lt;0.05); There was no significant difference in the positive rates of influenza virus and rhinovirus between the two groups (P&gt; 0.05).@*Conclusion@#It is necessary to adjust the management mode of fever clinic during the Corona Virus Disease 2019, and to manage the patients according to the epidemiological history which can improve the screening efficiency and reduce the risk of cross infection.

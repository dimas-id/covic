Neuraminidase (NA) thermostability of influenza A and B viruses isolated from birds, swine and humans was measured to evaluate its variability associated with host body temperature. The highest 50% inactivation temperature (IT(50)) was observed with H3N8 avian influenza virus (74 째C), and the lowest IT(50) was observed with the seasonal human H3N2 virus (45.5 째C). The IT(50) values of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 56.4-58.5 째C were statistically higher than that of the prepandemic strain A/Solomon Islands/03/06 (52.5 째C). An analysis of Ca(2+) binding sites revealed the correspondence of amino acid changes to NA thermostability. This study demonstrates that changes in NA thermostability correspond to differences in host body temperature.

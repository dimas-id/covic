ABSTRACT: A series of diethyl 2-(4,5-dimethoxycarbonyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)alkylphosphonates was synthesised from ω-azidoalkylphosphonates and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and was further transformed into the respective diamides, dihydrazides, and 5,6-dihydro-1H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyridazine-4,7-diones as phosphonate analogues of acyclic nucleosides having nucleobases replaced with substituted 1,2,3-triazoles. All compounds containing P–C–C–triazole or P–C–C–CH(2)–triazole moieties exist in single conformations in which the diethoxyphosphoryl and substituted 1,2,3-triazolyl or substituted (1,2,3-triazolyl)methyl groups are oriented anti. All phosphonates were evaluated in vitro for activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity. They were not cytostatic at 100 μM.

Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19 outbreak. Sewage Epidemiology or Waste Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach has been successfully used to track and provide early warnings of outbreaks of pathogenic viruses such as Hepatitis A, Poliovirus and Norovirus. In untreated wastewater COVID-19 (excreted via faeces then introduced to wastewater) can survive from hours to days. Detection of COVID-19 can be carried out with nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, used for confirmation of COVID-19 patients around the globe. New cheaper and faster monitoring tools are being developed to detect Covid-19 in wastewater by biosensors, ELISA, or paper-based indicator methods. This will allow to reveal true scale of Covid-19 outbreak associated with population link to a specific wastewater treatment plant.

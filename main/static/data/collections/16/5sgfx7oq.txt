The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic It was initially thought to spare children and adolescents as significantly smaller number of cases have been reported in the pediatric population in comparison to adults Here, we report the case of a 16-month-old female infant from Lebanon who presented with fever and severe diarrhea and tested positive for COVID-19 Her symptoms started six days prior to presentation with no cough, rhinorrhea, or other respiratory manifestations reported Chest radiography showed lobar consolidation and bronchial infiltrates Blood culture was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae Stool and urine cultures were negative She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole Her RT-PCR test was negative after five days of treatment, suggesting that children can clear the virus faster than adults The patient likely contracted the virus from her parents, who because of the fear of social stigma hide recent history of respiratory illness These findings serve as a practical reference for the clinical diagnosis and medical treatment of children with COVID-19

Two children with different digestive diseases were admitted to the gastroenterology department of a children's hospital in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, in May 2010. They manifested successively acute lower respiratory tract infection symptoms during their stay in the hospital. The epidemiologic and experimental evidence supports that one child acquired nosocomial coinfection with measles virus and human metapneumovirus from another child while they shared the same ward.

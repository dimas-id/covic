BACKGROUND Ileorectal anastomosis is an important surgical option for patients with Crohn's colitis with relative rectal sparing. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to audit outcomes of ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's and factors associated with proctectomy and reoperation. DESIGN This retrospective study involved a chart review and contacting patients. SETTINGS Patients with Crohn's colitis who had an ileorectal anastomosis were identified from the Mount Sinai Hospital Inflammatory Bowel Disease Database. PATIENTS Demographics, operative and perioperative outcomes, and reoperative data were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Five- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for survival from proctectomy and Crohn's-related revisional surgery. Cox proportional hazards models were used to model the hazards of proctectomy and Crohn's-related revision on the clinical characteristics of patients. RESULTS Eighty-one patients had an ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's disease from 1982 to 2010. The most common indications for surgery were failed medical management (60/81, 74.1%) and a stricture causing obstruction (14/81, 17.3%). Seventy-seven percent (n = 62) had a 1-stage procedure, whereas 23% (n = 19) had a 2-stage procedure (colectomy followed by ileorectal anastomosis). The overall anastomotic leak rate was 7.4% (n = 6). Fifty-six patients had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis at the time of follow-up. At 5 and 10 years, 87% (95% CI: 75.5-93.3) and 72.2% (95% CI: 55.8-83.4) of individuals had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis. Eighteen patients required proctectomy for poor symptom control, whereas 11 patients required a small-bowel resection plus redo-ileorectal anastomosis. The mean time to proctectomy from the original ileorectal anastomosis was 88.3 months (SD = 62.1). Smoking was associated with both proctectomy (HR 3.93 (95% CI: 1.46-10.55)) and reoperative surgery (HR 2.12 (95% CI: 0.96-4.72)). LIMITATIONS : This study was retrospective. CONCLUSIONS Ileorectal anastomosis is an appropriate operation for selected patients with Crohn's colitis with sparing of the rectum. However, patients must be counseled that the reoperation rate and/or proctectomy rate is approximately 30%.

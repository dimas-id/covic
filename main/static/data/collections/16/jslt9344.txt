Robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy represents actually an emerging procedure for robot-assisted surgery. Considering complexity, extensive dissection, and difficult restoration of the digestive continuity, it remains a challenge for surgeons. The embedded video (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLE/A146) reports our standardized technique for robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy. In conclusion, robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy is feasible and can be safely performed. Further evaluation with clinical trials is required to validate its real benefits.

The prevalence of human rhino‐, entero‐, and coronaviruses was investigated by RT‐PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 107 children without concurrent respiratory symptoms. The children were admitted to the hospital for elective surgery. The parents filled a questionnaire about the occurrence of respiratory symptoms four weeks before and two weeks after the surgery. The rate of viral detection was 45% in children with related past or recent respiratory infection whereas 20% of the samples taken from children without any related past or recent respiratory infections were positive for picornavirus RNA, P = 0.008. Thirty‐one (29%) of the nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for viral RNA, 18% for rhinovirus, and 11% for enterovirus RNA. Coronavirus RNA was not found in any of the children. Fifty‐five percent of the children with virus‐positive samples had an infection‐related diagnosis. In addition, 81% of the children with virus‐positive samples had had previously respiratory symptoms or there were concurrent respiratory symptoms in other family members. Only four of the 31 virus‐positive samples were from children without infection‐related diagnosis or recent past (or immediate future) respiratory symptoms. J. Med.

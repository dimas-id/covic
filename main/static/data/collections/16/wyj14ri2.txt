Viral infections during pregnancy can have devastating consequences on pregnancy outcomes, fetal development, and maternal health. In this review, we examine fetal and maternal immune defense mechanisms that mediate resistance against viral infections and discuss the range of syndromes that ensue when such mechanisms fail, from fetal developmental defects to establishment of chronic infection. Further, we highlight the role of maternal immune activation, or uncontrolled inflammation triggered by viral infections during pregnancy, and its potential downstream pathological effects, including tissue damage and fetal demise. Insights into the respective contributions of direct viral toxicity versus fetal and maternal immune responses that underlie the pathogenesis of congenital disease will guide future treatment strategies.

Abstract The application of innovative diagnostic technologies for the detection of animal pathogens at an early stage is essential in restricting the economic loss incurred due to emerging infectious animal diseases. The desirable characteristics of such diagnostic methods are easy to use, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific, coupled with the high-throughput detection capabilities. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society. Therefore, this chapter primarily describes and discusses in detail the serological, molecular, novel high-throughput, and POC assays to detect pathogens affecting farm and companion animals.

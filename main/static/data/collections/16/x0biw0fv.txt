Moral distress is the psychological distress that is experienced in relation to a morally challenging situation or event. Although it was first observed within nursing, caregivers across all disciplines-including physicians, respiratory therapists, social workers and chaplains-experience moral distress. In this consult, we discuss 5 types of moral distress using examples of changes to clinical practice that have occurred due to COVID-19. We also provide suggestions for responding to moral distress and outline the resources available at Cleveland Clinic.

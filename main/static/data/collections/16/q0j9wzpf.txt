Air‐space disease is typical in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and may be indistinguishable from pneumonia of other causes. In the majority of patients, ground glass opacities on chest radiographs progress rapidly to focal, multifocal or diffuse consolidation. Unilateral involvement is common in the early acute phase, becoming bilateral at maximal lung involvement. Generally, radiographic opacities peak between 8 and 10 days after onset of illness, with radiographic scores reflecting temporal changes in clinical and laboratory parameters such as oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and liver transaminases. Pleural effusions, cavitating consolidation and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are not typical radiographic features. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces are complications that are associated with extensive disease, with or without assisted ventilation. The utility of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and CT scans lies in the confirmation of airspace opacities in cases with normal initial chest radiographs that have strong contact history and signs and symptoms highly suspicious of SARS during the outbreak, allowing early treatment and prompt isolation. The characteristic HRCT feature in the acute phase is ground‐glass opacities with smooth interlobular septal thickening, sometimes with consolidation in a subpleural location, which progress rapidly to involve other areas of the lungs. Temporal lung changes documented on HRCT suggest that some residual opacities found may not be reversible.

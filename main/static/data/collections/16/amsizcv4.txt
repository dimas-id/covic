Two electrochemical DNA hybridization biosensors (genosensors) for the detection of a 30-mer sequence unique to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus are described in this work. Both genosensors rely on the hybridization of the oligonucleotide target with its complementary probe, which is immobilized on positively charged polylysine modified screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs), through electrostatic interactions. In one design, a biotinylated target is used and the detection of the hybridization reaction is monitored using alkaline phosphatase labeled streptavidin (S-AP). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate 3-indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) to indigo, which is then solubilized to indigo carmine and detected by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). In the other design, the target is labeled using an Au(I) complex, sodium aurothiomalate, and the duplex formation is detected by measuring, for first time, the current generated by the hydrogen evolution catalyzed by the gold label. Using 30 min of hybridization time, a detection limit of 8 pM is calculated for the enzymatic genosensor. Although this good sensitivity cannot be reached with the metal label (0.5 nM), the use of this label allows a considerable decrease of the analysis time. Both genosensors do not require the modification of the oligonucleotide probe and using stringent experimental conditions (60 min of hybridization time and 50% formamide in the hybridization buffer) can discriminate between a complementary oligonucleotide and an oligonucleotide with a three-base mismatch.

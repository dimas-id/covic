During the first pandemic wave Covid-19 reached Latin America cities. Aim: To report clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe and critical cases. Methods: Cases were identified by a compatible clinical picture associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied. Results: 21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients [≥]60 years old predominated (57.1%). Hypertension (61.9%), obesity (57.1%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1%) were prevalent but 19% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing were limited (19% at 1st week; 42.9% at 2nd week). Nine patients (42.9%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values. One pregnant woman required urgent cesarean section given birth to a premature neonate without vertical transmission. Two patients died (in-hospital mortality 9.5%) and length of stay was equal or higher than 14 days in 57.9% of patients. Conclusion: In our regional Center, Covid 19 was associated to known risk factors, had a prolonged stay and in-hospital mortality. Tachypnea [≥]30/min is predictive of transfer to ICU.

Although endovascular or surgical treatment has been performed for preventing the rupture of saccular cerebral aneurysms (sCA), in some patients, the aneurysms may recur and require retreatment. We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of treating recurrent sCA. We retrospectively evaluated the data of 52 patients with 60 recurrent sCAs who were retreated and 1534 patients with 1817 sCAs who received initial treatment. The primary outcome was a recurrence of the aneurysm. Secondary outcomes were an additional treatment, rupture after treatment, and a neurological worsening, which was defined as an increase of 1 or more scores using the modified Rankin Scale at 12-month. Safety outcomes included postoperative ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. We compiled the 120 (60 each) propensity score-matched cohort based on a propensity score for the treatment of recurrent sCA. In the propensity score-matched cohort, recurrence after treatment was observed in 25% and 6.7% of cases in the retreatment and initial treatment groups, respectively. The odds ratio of recurrence after treatment was 4.7 (95% CI, 1.4-15; P = 0.011). The secondary and safety outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. This study showed that the treatment of recurrent sCA was a risk factor for recurrence after treatment but not for additional treatment, rupture after treatment, or neurological worsening. Although decision-making regarding the treatment varies depending on the institutional protocols and personal experience of the physicians, endovascular or surgical retreatment could be performed without hesitation.

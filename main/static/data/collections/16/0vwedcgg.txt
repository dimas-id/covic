AIM: To investigate the prevalence of insomnia among frontline nurses fighting against COVID-19 in Wuhan, China and analyze its influencing factors. BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important factor that can affect the health and work quality of nurses. However, There is a lack of big-sample studies exploring factors that affect the insomnia of nurses fighting against COVID-19. METHOD: This cross-sectional study using the Ascension Insomnia Scale, Fatigue Scale-14, and Perceived Stress Scale took place in March 2020. Participants were 1,794 frontline nurses from four tertiary-level general hospitals. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among participants was 52.8%. Insomnia was predicted by gender, working experience, chronic diseases, midday nap duration, direct participation in rescue of patients with COVID-19, frequency of night shifts, professional psychological assistance during the pandemic, negative experiences (such as family, friends, or colleagues being seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19), the degree of fear of COVID-19, fatigue, and perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The level of insomnia among participants was higher than the normal level. Interventions based on influencing factors should be implemented to ensure nurses' sleep quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: An in-depth understanding of the influencing factors of insomnia among frontline nurses can help nurse managers develop solutions to improve frontline nurses' sleep quality, which will enhance the physical and mental conditions of nurses and promote the quality of care.

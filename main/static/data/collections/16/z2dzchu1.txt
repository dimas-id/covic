INTRODUCTION There are worldwide concerns of an impending avian influenza outbreak, with nations formulating infection control strategies to prepare for such an event. Little evidence exists for how infection control measures impact on the provision of cancer services, or how patient experience would be affected. Our aim was to compare patient satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction, during and following a period of infection control measures. METHODS We measured patient satisfaction using a validated 29-question instrument for two weeks during the implementation of strict infection control measures as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (T1), and compared results with a two-week period after measures had been lifted (T2). RESULTS A total of 296 patients were surveyed, 149 at T1 and 147 at T2. Most patients indicated overall satisfaction, with 92.3 percent and 86.9 percent satisfied at T1 and T2, respectively (p-value is not significant). Mean satisfaction index was 3.02 and 3.04 out of 4 at T1 and T2, respectively (p-value is not significant). However, the responses for several individual questions did differ significantly between time points. At T1 more patients indicated satisfaction for understanding the doctor's plans (p-value is 0.001), while at T2, more patients indicated satisfaction for being told how to care for their condition (p-value is 0.04). CONCLUSION The study demonstrated high patient satisfaction at both time points. Similar levels of satisfaction despite infection control measures may be due to patients being more tolerant of problems in doctor-patient interactions during the outbreak due to media campaigns. This research may facilitate those healthcare services planning to minimise the impact of infection control measures on patient care.

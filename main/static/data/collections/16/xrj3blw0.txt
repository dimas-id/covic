Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most commonly reported chronic pain syndromes experienced in the United States. Treatment guidelines for OA recommend acetaminophen for first-line pharmacotherapy for these patients; however, this strategy is rarely effective as monotherapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the next step in therapy and have accumulated a large body of data to support their efficacy for OA. Unfortunately, this class of agents is not without the potential for significant adverse effects. In an effort to capture the efficacy of NSAIDs while decreasing their side effect burden, many clinicians are turning to the topical administration of these agents. Localized pain and smaller, superficial joints may be especially amenable to the topical administration of NSAIDs. Numerous commercially available topical NSAID formulations have been shown to be efficacious in patients with OA. This review focuses on the topical delivery of NSAIDs for the treatment of OA.

Evidence accumulates suggesting that environmental factors including viral and risk factors associated with pregnancy and birth-giving, may increase the incidence of hypokinesia/parkinsonism in early life, or PD in later life. Such environmental pre-, peri- or postnatal stress may lead to disturbances in the developing brain and malformations in regions of particular interest and associated with PD. Genetic predisposition to hypoactivity plus environmental effects may lead to reorganization of brain circuitry including changes in monoaminergic and/or EAA systems, leading to a subtype of PD, i.e. genetic, drug induced, viral, developmental and other possible subtypes. The spectrum disorder of PD is going to be further substantiated into various etiopathologically verifyable subgroups.

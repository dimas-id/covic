Medicaid provides essential coverage for health care and long-term services and supports (LTSS) to low-income older adults and disabled individuals but eligibility is complicated and restrictive. In light of the current public health emergency, states have been given new authority to streamline and increase the flexibility of Medicaid LTSS eligibility, helping them enroll eligible individuals and ensure that current beneficiaries are not inadvertently disenrolled. Though state budgets are under increased pressure during the economic crisis created by the coronavirus, we caution states against cutting Medicaid LTSS eligibility or services to balance their budgets. These services are critical to an especially vulnerable population during a global pandemic.

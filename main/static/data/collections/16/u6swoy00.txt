The most important and frequent major complication after gastric bypass is the appearance of a leak, which can result in death of a patient. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the incidence of a postoperative leak, to propose a classification and to evaluate the results of conservative or surgical treatment. All patients submitted to gastric bypass either laparotomic or laparoscopic were included in a prospective protocol. In all radiological evaluation at 4(th) day after surgery was performed. The presence of a leak was evaluated according to the day of appearance, its location and its severity. Results of medical or surgical treatment were analyzed. From 1764 patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 60 had a postoperative leak (3.4%). This leak appeared early after surgery (before 4 days) in 20%. It was a localized subclinical leak in 20% and clinical - septic in 80%. There were 7 possible anatomic location of a leak, being the gastrojejunal anastomosis the most frequent location (53%) followed by gastric pouch. The highest mortality was associated to the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. Conservative treatment was employed in near 65% of the patients: The mean time of closure of a leak was 34 days. The appearance of a postoperative leak is a major and serious complication. It can be classified according to the day of appearance, its severity and its location. Conservative or surgical treatment can be employed properly if these 3 parameters are carefully evaluated.

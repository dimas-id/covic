The global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease has had a tremendous psychological impact on individuals around the world. Individuals with obesity are susceptible to distress and psychological sequalae secondary to this pandemic, which can have detrimental effects on obesity management. In particular, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery could experience increased emotional distress, resulting in increased eating psychopathology, mental health exacerbation, and difficulties with self‐management. Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches to redefining psychosocial care before and after bariatric surgery. Emerging evidence suggests that the remote delivery of care using virtual care models, including mobile and online modalities, could extend the reach of psychosocial services to individuals after bariatric surgery and mitigate weight regain or impairment in quality of life. Because of this pandemic, the rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care in bariatric surgery programs to address patients’ needs will create new opportunities for clinical and implementational scientific research.

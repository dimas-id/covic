We designed a discrete-choice experiment to quantify the extent to which US adults would accept greater risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in return for lifting social-distancing restrictions and diminishing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 5953 adults representing all 50 states had 4 distinctly different preference patterns. About 37% were risk minimizers reluctant to accept any increases in risk of contracting the virus. Another group (26%) was primarily concerned about time required for economic recovery, accepting increases in COVID-19 risk levels up to 16% to shorten recovery from 3 to 2 years. The remaining two groups diverged on the relative importance of reopening nonessential businesses. The larger group (26%) strongly preferred delaying reopening while the smaller group (13%) would accept COVID-19 risks well beyond 20% to avoid a delay in reopening. Political affiliation, race, household income and employment status were predictive of group membership.

In 2020 the world faces an unprecedented challenge consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. Soccer, arguably, one of the most globalized industries, has reacted to the event by closing down much of its operations. This paper reviews the speed and breadth of such closures and compares it to another major event in history: The Second World War. During the latter, soccer continued operations despite the apparent difficulties. Total closures were, for the most part, temporary, and the sport was practiced whenever possible. The way that soccer operated during the war contrasts with how it has responded to the COVID-19 crisis. In record time, virtually all leagues in the world stopped operations, and for the first time since its foundation, with but a few exceptions, there were no games anywhere in the world.

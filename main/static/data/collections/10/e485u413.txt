Chemokines interact with hepatic resident cells during inflammation and fibrosis. CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 20 has been reported to be important in inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. We hypothesized that visfatin, an adipocytokine, could play a role in hepatic fibrosis via CCL20. We investigated the effect of visfatin on CCL20 in THP-1 human promonocytic cells and examined the molecular mechanisms involved. Following treatment of THP-1 cells with visfatin, CCL20 expression and secretion were assessed. We assessed the intracellular signaling molecules IKK/NF-&#954;B, JAK2/STAT3, MAPKs, and MKK3/6 by western blotting. We treated THP-1 cells with visfatin and signaling inhibitors, and examined CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. To investigate the effect of visfatin-induced CCL20 expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), LX-2 cells were co-cultured with the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells with or without anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibodies, and fibrosis markers were examined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. In THP-1 cells, visfatin increased the CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. visfatin increased the activities of the NF-&#954;B, p38, and MLK3/6 signaling pathways but not those of the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK pathways. Visfatin treatment together with an NF-&#954;B, p38, or MLK3 inhibitor reduced the mRNA and protein levels of CCL20. The visfatin-induced CCL20 increased the expression of fibrosis markers and CCR6 in HSCs. Following neutralization of CCL20, the levels of fibrosis markers and CCR6 were decreased. Visfatin increases the expression of CCL20 via the NF-&#954;B and MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathways in macrophages, and visfatin-induced CCL20 expression promotes the fibrosis markers in HSCs.

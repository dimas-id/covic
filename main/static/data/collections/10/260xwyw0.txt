Infection control is an essential component of health care. The literature generally suggests that most health professionals’ knowledge of infection control principles and standards is poor or, at the very least, inadequate. There is a paucity of research examining paramedic knowledge of infection control principles and standards, particularly in the Australian pre-hospital context. The purpose of this study was to determine paramedic knowledge of standard infection control definitions and principles in an Australian emergency medical system (EMS). A confidential and anonymous mail survey was distributed to all paramedics working in a State-wide Australian ambulance service (n=2274) A total of 1258 surveys were returned - a response rate of 55.3%. Only 46.2% (n=581) of the participants identified the correct components of the ’chain of infection’. Correct identification of the definition of ’nosocomial’ was made by 27,9% (n=347) of participants. Less than one-fifth (17.2%, n=217) of participants identified 'standards and additional precautions’ as the current system of infection control. Less than half (41.6%, n=523) of the sample correctly identified hand washing as the primary’ infection control strategy’ to prevent cross-infection. This study suggests knowledge of fundamental principles and standards of infection control among paramedics is poor in this jurisdiction and recommends the introduction of comprehensive in-service education programmes in infection control. Further research is required to investigate if, and how, these results may be realised in practice.

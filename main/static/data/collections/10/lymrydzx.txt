We experienced an extremely rare case of a thymoma in the middle mediastinum. A 42-year-old woman presented with a 4-cm-sized abnormal mass in the middle mediastinum by chest computed tomography. To resect this tumor, we performed surgery using the thoracoscopic lateral approach from the right side subsequently followed by a median sternotomy. After the resection of this tumor, the intraoperative quick pathological examination diagnosed this tumor as a thymoma. An extended thymectomy was performed additionally.

BACKGROUND: Androgen‐sensitive prostate cancer cell‐line LNCaP‐FGC and androgen‐resistant line LNCaP‐r constitute a model for development of androgen resistance in prostate cancer. METHODS: Proteins differently expressed in the two cell‐lines were identified by two‐dimensional (2‐D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. HSP60, more abundant in LNCaP‐r, was studied by RT‐PCR and immunohistochemistry in specimens of human prostate cancer. RESULTS: HSP60 was upregulated in LNCaP‐r, nm23 in LNCaP‐FGC, and titin (two isoforms) in either LNCaP‐r or LNCaP‐FGC. In non‐malignant prostate, HSP60‐staining was in the glandular compartment, particularly basal epithelial cells. In prostate cancer, most epithelial cells showed moderate‐strong staining without apparent correlation between staining intensity and Gleason grade. CONCLUSIONS: The LNCaP‐FGC/LNCaP‐r model, characterized by 2‐D electrophoresis, reveals distinct proteomic alterations. With HSP60, results from cell‐lines correlated with clinical results, indicating that this model can be used for dissection of mechanisms involved in transformation to androgen resistance and assignment of protein markers in prostate cancer.

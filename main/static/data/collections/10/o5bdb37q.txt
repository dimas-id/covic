Faecal specimens from 60 patients (under six years old), most of whom were Maoris and Pacific Islanders admitted to Auckland Hospital with gastroenteritis during the months of June and July 1977, were examined for the presence of faecal viruses, bacterial pathogens and parasites. Faecal specimens from 18 non-diarrhoeal control patients were also examined, of which three contained rotavirus. Forty-three (72 per cent) gastroenteritis patients had rotavirus detectable in stools by electron microscopy or immune electron microscopy. Of the remainder, 17 patients were regarded as having non-rotavirus diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic Esch. coli. was isolated from seven patients of whom six yielded stable toxin producers (ST+), four labile toxin producers (LT+) and two dual toxigenic strains (ST+/LT+). All ST+ isolates appeared to be of low enterotoxigenicity as indicated by low gut weight/carcass weight ratios in the infant mouse assay. Rotavirus was the commonest aetiological agent (72 per cent), bacterial pathogens (alone) accounted for only five per cent and no enteric pathogens were found in 15 per cent of cases. Non-agglutinable rotavirus, presumably a different serotype, was seen in both gastroenteritis and control patients. Rotavirus ‘satellite’ particles previously undescribed were demonstrated in a number of stool samples.

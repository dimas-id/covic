PURPOSE: The trauma centre of the Wuerzburg University Hospital has integrated a pioneering dual-room twin-CT scanner in a multiple trauma pathway. For concurrent treatment of two trauma patients, two carbon CT examination and intervention tables are positioned head to head with one sliding CT-Gantry in the middle. The focus of this study is the process of trauma care with the time to CT (tCT) and the time to operation (tOR) as quality indicator. METHODS: All patients with suspected multiple trauma, who required emergency surgery and who were initially diagnosed by the CT trauma protocol between 05/2018 and 12/2018 were included. Data relating to time spans (tCT and tOR), severity of injury and outcome was obtained. RESULTS: 110 of the 589 screened trauma patients had surgery immediately after finishing primary assessment in the ER. The ISS was 17 (9–34) (median and interquartile range, IQR). tCT was 15 (11–19) minutes (median and IQR) and tOR was 96.5 (75–119) minutes (median and IQR). In the first 30 days, seven patients died (6.4%) including two within the first 24 h (2%). There were two ICU days (1–6) (median and IQR) and one (0–1) (median and IQR) ventilator day. CONCLUSION: The twin-CT technology is a fascinating tool to organize high-quality trauma care for two multiple trauma patients simultaneously.

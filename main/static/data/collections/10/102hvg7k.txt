Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization ProteinChip technology, has been widely used in obtaining the quantitative profiles of tissue proteomes, particularly plasma proteomes. Its high-throughput nature and simplicity in its experimental procedures have allowed this technology to become a popular research tool for biomarker discovery in the past 5 years. After accumulating more research experiences, researchers now have a better understanding of the characteristics and limitations of this technology, as well as the pitfalls in biomarker research, by undertaking a comparative proteomic approach. This review provides an overview of the surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, discusses its limitations and provides some possible solutions to help apply this technology to biomarker research.

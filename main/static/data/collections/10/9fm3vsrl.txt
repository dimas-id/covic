The contribution of DRAK2 [death-associated protein kinase (DAPK)-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 2] to anti-viral memory T cell responses following infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was examined. DRAK2 is a lymphoid-enriched serine/threonine kinase that is an important regulatory molecule involved in modulating T cell responses. Memory T cells derived from MHV-immunized Drak2(-/-) mice exhibited amplified proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion following stimulation with viral epitopes. Transfer of Drak2(-/-) memory T cells into Rag1(-/-) mice infected intracerebrally with MHV resulted in accelerated clearance of virus from the brain. Thus, DRAK2 may be a novel target for stimulating protective immunity to viral pathogens.

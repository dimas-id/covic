PURPOSE Brazil is the fifth most populous country in the world with widespread regional and social inequalities. Regional disparities in healthcare are unacceptably large, with the remote and poor regions of the north and northeast having reduced life expectancy compared to the south region, where life expectancy approaches that of rich countries. We report our experience of a humanitarian surgery mission to the Amazonas state, in the northwest part of Brazil. METHODS In August 2014, a team of seven consultant surgeons, and two trainees with the charity 'International Hernia', visited three hospitals in the Amazonas state to provide hernia surgery and training. RESULTS Eighty-nine hernias were repaired in 74 patients (female = 22, male = 52) with a median age of 44 years (range 2-83 years). Nine patients underwent more than one type of hernia repair, and there were 9 laparoscopic inguinal and ventral incisional hernia repairs. Local doctors were trained in hernia repair techniques, and an International Hernia Symposium was held at the University of the State of Amazonas, Manaus. CONCLUSION The humanitarian mission provided hernia surgery to an underserved population in Brazil and training to local doctors, building local sustainability. Continued cooperation between host and international surgeons for future missions to Brazil will ensure continuing surgical training and technical assistance.

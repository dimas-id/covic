The DNA sequence that encodes the first 406 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of yellow head virus (YHV) protein gp116, namely N/2 gp116deltaTM, and the DNA sequence that encodes the next 392 amino acid residues at the C-terminus of gp116 (without the transmembrane region), namely C/2 gp116deltaTM, were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 plasmid and expressed in E. coli. Both recombinant proteins were expressed, purified by SDS-PAGE and used to immunize mice. The mouse anti-recombinant N/2 gp116 and C/2 gp116 antisera bound specifically to both the recombinant proteins and to natural gp116 protein in YHV-infected haemolymph as shown by Western blotting and in tissues as shown by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical localization of YHV using anti-gp116 antiserum or monoclonal antibodies specific to gp116 (V3-2B), gp64 (Y18) and p20 (Y19) revealed similar immunoreactivity patterns for all these reagents in muscle and mandibular tissue in shrimp showing gross signs of yellow head disease. However, in gill, hepatopancreas, lymphoid organ and thoracic ganglion tissues from experimental YHV-infected shrimp (Penaeus vannamei and Palaemon serrifer) that did not show signs of disease, immunoreactivity to gp116 was reduced or absent while that for gp64 and p20 remained intense. Thus, some shrimp species were able to selectively inhibit the synthesis of gp116 in a manner that was associated with absence of gross signs of disease.

High-throughput immunosequencing allows re-constructing the immune repertoire of an individual, which is an exceptional opportunity for new immunotherapies, immunodiagnostics, and vaccine design. Such immune repertoires are shaped by past and current immune events, for example infection and disease, and thus record an individual’s state of health. Consequently, immune repertoire sequencing data may enable the prediction of health and disease using machine learning. However, finding the connections between an individual’s repertoire and the individual’s disease class, with potentially hundreds of thousands to millions of short sequences per individual, poses a difficult and unique challenge for machine learning methods. In this work, we present our method DeepRC that combines a Deep Learning architecture with attention-based multiple instance learning. To validate that DeepRC accurately predicts an individual’s disease class based on its immune repertoire and determines the associated class-specific sequence motifs, we applied DeepRC in four large-scale experiments encompassing ground-truth simulated as well as real-world virus infection data. We demonstrate that DeepRC out-performs all tested methods with respect to predictive performance and enables the extraction of those sequence motifs that are connected to a given disease class.

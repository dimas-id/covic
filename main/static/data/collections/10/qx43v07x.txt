Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is commonly used to follow up patients after endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms. Magnetic resonance artefacts from coil constructs may impair image quality and jeopardise the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment and review of adjacent vasculature. We present here a technical note on the usage of Barricade coils recently introduced at our institution. The MRA artefacts associated with these coils may make it impossible to ascertain aneurysm closure and anatomy. Hence these patients would need to be recalled for digital subtraction angiograms for a complete neuroradiological follow-up.

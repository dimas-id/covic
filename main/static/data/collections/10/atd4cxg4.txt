Visualization techniques have proven to be useful tools to support decision making and to cope with increasing amount of data. In order to help analyzing the progression of number of COVID-19 cases, we propose a new visual analytic tool. We use $k$-nearest neighbors of cities to mimic regions and allow analysis of COVID-19 dissemination based on the comparison of a city under consideration and its neighborhood, moreover, such analysis is performed based on periods of time, which facilitates assessment of isolation policies. We validate our tool by analyzing the progression of COVID-19 in regions of S\~ao Paulo state, Brazil.

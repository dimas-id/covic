Abstract Since 2010, outbreaks of variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have swept across the world causing substantial economic losses. The development of new, more effective vaccines has been hampered by difficulties in isolating strains and viral genome manipulation. In the present study, we successfully isolated a highly pathogenic field strain AH2012/12, from a pig farm reporting severe diarrhea in China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new isolate belongs to group G2, which represents epidemic and pandemic field strains. Furthermore, we constructed an infectious cDNA clone of the newly isolated strain, rAH2012/12, and the rescued virus displayed phenotypic properties identical to the parental virus in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the rescued virus displayed similar pathogenicity to the parental isolate, causing high mortality rates in suckling pigs. This study provided a strong basis for the development of live attenuated vaccines and for research into the pathogenic mechanisms of this virus.

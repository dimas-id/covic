Abstract We report the sudden death of a 33-month-old child owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome due to human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection. Of 30 children attending the same day care centre, 26% and 59% had hMPV and multiple infections, respectively; three of six children with pneumonia had a diagnosis of hMPV. hMPV infection is common in childhood viral co-infections but it can cause sudden death.

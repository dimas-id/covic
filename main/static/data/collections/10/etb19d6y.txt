The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the population and throughout the cells within our body has been developing. Another major cycle of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is expected in the coming fall, could be even more severe than the current one. Therefore, effective countermeasures should be developed based on the already obtained clinical and research information about SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review was to summarize the data on the empirical treatment of COVID-19 acquired during this SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle; this would aid the establishment of an appropriate healthcare policy to meet the challenges in the future. The infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by common cold along with hypersensitivity reaction. Thus, in addition to treating common cold, it is essential to minimize the exposure of cells to the virus and to mitigate the uncontrolled immune response. A proper combination of antiviral agents, immune modulators such as prednisolone, and anticoagulants such as heparin and anti-C5a antagonists could be employed to minimize lung damage and prevent systemic involvements. Finally, strategies to achieve population immunity against SARS-CoV-2 should be developed through understanding of the interaction between the immune system and the virus.

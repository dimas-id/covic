By sampling 100 encoding proteins from SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV, NC 004718) and other six coronaviruses and selecting 23 variables through stepwise multiple regression (SMR) from 172 variables, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model was established with good results of the quantitative modelling correlation coefficient R (2) = 0.645 and the cross-validation correlation coefficient R (CV)(2) = 0.375. After removing 4 outliers, the quantitative modelling and cross-validation correlation coefficients were R (2)= 0.743 and R (CV)(2) = 0.543, respectively.

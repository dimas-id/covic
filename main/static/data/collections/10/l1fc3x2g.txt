Providing evidence on mental disorders in indigenous adolescents is critical to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The prevalence of symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder symptoms were estimated for 2082 adolescents aged 14-20 years in Chiapas, Mexico. Mental disorders were assessed using the 9-item Patient-Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. Among the adolescents evaluated, 35.8% suffered from depression or generalized anxiety disorder. Of those, 6.1% reported a previous diagnosis. 32.1% of adolescents with both mental disorders reported having attempted suicide. Gender, substance use, adverse living experiences and living conditions were correlated to the presence of depression and/or generalized anxiety disorder. It is mandatory for Mexican health authorities to develop effective instruments aiming to screen and diagnose mental health conditions in adolescents, as well as to provide timely treatment in primary health-care units.

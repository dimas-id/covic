We describe the creative ways that virologists are leveraging experimental cross-species infections to study the interactions between viruses and hosts. While viruses are usually well adapted to their hosts, cross-species approaches involve pairing viruses with species that they do not naturally infect. These cross-species infections pit viruses against animals, cell lines, or even single genes from foreign species. We highlight examples where cross-species infections have yielded insights into mechanisms of host innate immunity, viral countermeasures, and the evolutionary interplay between viruses and hosts.

UNSTRUCTURED: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has a tremendous impact on global health, the economy, and the whole society. Various measures are being taken to respond to the pandemic, while digital media playing a pivotal role, especially in the use of visual data to disseminate information, mobile health to coordinate medical resources, social media to promote public health campaigns, and digital tools to assist population management and disease tracing. However, digital media also faces some challenges like misinformation, lack of guidance, and information leakage. We encourage the increased use of digital media with the focus on improving trust, building social solidarity, reducing chaos, educating the public for prevention measures, and reducing the medical burden in facility-based sites.

The study and the control of milk synthesis are required to decipher the mechanisms of gene expression, to improve milk production, to modify milk composition, to induce a resistance to diseases in the mammary gland and to produce recombinant proteins of pharmaceutical interest. Transgenesis has become a mandatory tool to reach these goals. The use of transgenesis is still limited by the difficulty of adding foreign genes in farm animals and mainly by replacing genes by homologous recombination. Transgene expression is also often ill-controlled. The present paper summarizes the current progress in this field with a particular emphasis on expression vectors for transgenes.

International travel may facilitate the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The study describes clusters of COVID-19 cases within Chinese tour groups travelling in Europe January 16-28. We compared characteristics of cases and non-cases to determine transmission dynamics. The index case travelled from Wuhan, China, to Europe on January 16, 2020, and to Shanghai, China, on January 27, 2020, within a tour group (group A). Tour groups with the same outbound flight (group B) or the same tourism venue (group D), and all Chinese passengers on the inbound flight (group C) were investigated. The outbreak involved 11 confirmed cases, 10 suspected cases, and 6 tourists who remained healthy. Group A, involving 7 confirmed cases and 6 suspected cases, consisted of familial transmission followed by propagative transmission. There was less pathogenicity with propagative transmission than with familial transmission. Disease was transmitted in shared outbound flights, shopping venues within Europe, and inbound flight back to China. The novel coronavirus caused clustered cases of COVID-19 in tour groups. When tourism and travel opens up, governments will need to improve screening at airports and consider increased surveillance of tour groups - particularly those with older tour members.

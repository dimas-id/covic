We have tested sera from patients with multiple sclerosis, matched controls, and those with other neurological diseases, as well as sera from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and controls and patients with tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and controls for antibody to human T‐lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV‐I), HTLV‐II, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian T‐lymphotropic virus type III, or simian retrovirus type I by immunofluorescent activity test, and for HTLV‐I and HIV by the ELISA method. Sera from patients with multiple sclerosis and matched controls, and from patients with optic neuritis and Parkinson's or other neuromuscular diseases did not have antibody to any of the retroviruses tested. Specimens from TSP patients and some controls contained HTLV‐I antibody. We conclude from our study that only TSP patients had serological evidence of infection with one of the retroviruses studied.

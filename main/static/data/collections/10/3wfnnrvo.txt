In the past few months, several works were published in regards to the dynamics and early detection of COVID-19 via mathematical modeling and Artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this work is to provide the research community with comprehensive overview of the methods used in these studies as well as a compendium of available open source datasets in regards to COVID-19. In all, 61 journal articles, reports, fact sheets, and websites dealing with COVID-19 were studied and reviewed. It was found that most mathematical modeling done were based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) and Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models while most of the AI implementations were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on X-ray and CT images. In terms of available datasets, they include aggregated case reports, medical images, management strategies, healthcare workforce, demography, and mobility during the outbreak. Both Mathematical modeling and AI have both shown to be reliable tools in the fight against this pandemic. Several datasets concerning the COVID-19 have also been collected and shared open source. However, much work is needed to be done in the diversification of the datasets. Other AI and modeling applications in healthcare should be explored in regards to this COVID-19.

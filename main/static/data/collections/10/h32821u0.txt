Human Middle East respiratory syndrome is a zoonotic respiratory disease caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) originating from camels in the Arabian Peninsula. While there are a large number of camels in East Africa, often traded to the Arabian Peninsula, no autochthonous human MERS-CoV case is reported in East Africa. Furthermore, there is limited information of MERS-CoV in East Africa. In this study, MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from Ethiopia was detected using RT-qPCR. Next-generation sequencing was used to obtain the full genome of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV antibodies were also detected through MERS-spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay. Phylogenetic analysis of full-genome sequences and spike-genome antibodies indicates that MERS-CoV in East Africa is genetically distinct from those in the Arabian Peninsula. The results from this study show that MERS-CoV circulating in dromedary camels in East Africa are genetically distinct from those in the Arabian Peninsula. Further studies are needed to evaluate the risk of zoonotic transmission in East Africa.

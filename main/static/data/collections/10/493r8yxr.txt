COVID-19 is a pandemic with clinical and emotional implications, sometimes invisible to gastroenterologists. Although dying is part of life, the risk for some doctors may be greater. Specifically, gastroenterologists are affected by the fear of restarting medical check-ups and endoscopic procedures. Amid a sea of information –even with contradictions between different experts— following the guidelines of the Colombian Associations of the Digestive Tract could help reassure doctors and patients. Although the pathologies will continue to appear, the fear of the population to be infected can generate consequences such as delaying the treatment of digestive tract cancers. Physical self-care through protection strategies and the emotional care, are important to help our immune system. Adapting to function during the pandemic, using tele-orientation through digital platforms, is a creative way to reduce collective anxiety.

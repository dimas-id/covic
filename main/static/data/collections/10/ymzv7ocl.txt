This is the 22nd President’s column I am writing since I penned my first column in October 2016 Over the past four years I have proudly seen EUPHA grow from strength to strength This is definitely in part due to the fact that EUPHA gives space to individuals of all ages, nationalities and disciplines to participate The only requisite is to be passionate about improving health and well-being for all—be it through research, policy, practice or education and training This openness has allowed us to draw the best talent and most highly motivated individuals in European Public Health to contribute on a voluntary basis to take forward analysis, advocacy and action for the future of health and humanity EUPHA is now in a strong position and well recognized as a credible partner by key supranational organizations including the World Health Organization and the European Commission Having established a Brussels-based office, developed new sections, grown the conference into the largest and most important public health event in Europe and leaving a vibrant office and community of engaged young persons, augurs well for the sustainability of the organization This could not have happened at a more significant moment in the history of public health As the world follows with interest and intensity the international public health emergency posed by the novel corona virus #COVID19, we are starkly reminded of the importance and role of public health and health systems This outbreak is a convergence of an infectious disease epidemic triggered through zoonotic transmission, abetted by an epidemic of misinformation having a marked social, economic and political impact It is a watershed in the history of global health and after this nothing will ever else be the same in European and global public health Whilst lessons are still being learned and much will eventually be written, this outbreak has underlined the interdependence of nations through economic global interconnectedness, the value of science and the importance of democracy, transparency and respect for human rights as issues that merit a new approach and a new order For months now, I have written about the dangers of complacency when it comes to health policy in Europe and about the risks of considering health as having been well achieved in the developed world due to the spectacular increases in life expectancy achieved over the past decades This outbreak has confirmed without any doubt the need to continue to invest in science and research, but also in strong health systems and in new areas of scholarly endeavour based on anthropological and social science No doubt the World Congress of Public Health being organized in Rome in October 2020 comes at a most timely manner and is well placed to discuss what needs to be done no holds barred to prevent and manage public health emergencies not only linked to infectious disease but also other health ‘emergencies’ including climate change, air pollution, mental health, obesity, diabetes and cancer On a personal note, this column is the last one I shall be writing as EUPHA President The Executive Council has accepted my proposal to move slightly earlier than originally planned into the role of past President since I have assumed a temporary position in the Transition Team of Dr Hans Kluge, the incoming WHO Regional Director for the European Region This is the moment for me to thank all those who have supported EUPHA and myself personally over the past 4 years To my colleagues in the Executive Council, Conference Foundation and Section Council—thank you for walking with me in this journey to continue to build EUPHA into a strong, visible and credible actor for public health in the European region To the wonderful EUPHA office staff working with the incredible Director Dineke Zeegers Paget—thank you for working tirelessly to make our thoughts, dreams and projects come true To our partner organizations on the European Public Health scene and to colleagues working in supranational organizations—thank you for working with us particularly on the European Public Health conferences and the European Public Health Week—these would not happen without your joint participation! Finally, I wish to close by thanking my past Presidents, friends and mentors Martin McKee and Walter Ricciardi for having encouraged, advised and supported me over these years I am wishing my successor Dr Iveta Nagyova every success during her tenure as EUPHA President Under her leadership, I am convinced that EUPHA will continue to flourish and play an important role in European Public Health

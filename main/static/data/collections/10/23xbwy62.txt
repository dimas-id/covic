CFTR protein malfunction results in thick, copious mucus, causes poor mucociliary clearance and, ultimately, structural lung damage such as bronchiectasis. All of these manifestations of cystic fibrosis contribute to a rich milieu for lower respiratory pathogens in patients affected by the disease. CF patients are, therefore, highly susceptible to chronic colonization with many pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They are also uniquely prone to acute infections with respiratory pathogens, which tend to persist longer and cause more impairment in lung function than in patients without CF. Tailored strategies for managing infectious complications of CF patients include chronic prophylactic antibiotics, use of systemic as well as inhaled antibiotics, mechanical assistance with mucus clearance, and scrupulous infection control measures.

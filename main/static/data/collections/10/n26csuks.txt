Two specific and sensitive, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) utilizing a protein G-peroxidase conjugate were developed to detect antibodies to the pseudorabies virus (PRV) and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in pig sera. Sera from 5,337 pigs, obtained from various abattoirs in South Africa, were tested with both ELISAs. No serological evidence of infection with either PRV or TGEV was found in any of the pigs tested.

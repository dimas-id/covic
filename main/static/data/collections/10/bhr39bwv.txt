This report presents a detailed update to our 2008 publication on the tissue engineering (TE) and stem cell industry. Data are reported through mid 2011 showing an almost three-fold growth in commercial sales over the past 4 years. In addition, the number of companies selling products or offering services has increased over two-fold to 106, and they are generating a remarkable $3.5 billion in sales. Overall, the TE and stem cell sector is spending $3.6 billion and employing almost 14,000 employees. These data suggest the TE and stem cell industry has stabilized and is on a path pointing toward continued success.

There are various diffusion models for S shaped processes like virus diffusion and these models are typically not nested. In this note it is proposed to combine the forecasts using a simple Bayesian forecast combination algorithm. An illustration to daily data on cumulative Covid-19 cases in the Netherlands shows the ease of use of the algorithm and the accuracy of the thus combined forecasts.

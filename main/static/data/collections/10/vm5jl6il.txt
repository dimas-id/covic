YAGO is one of the large knowledge bases in the Linked Open Data cloud. In this resource paper, we present its latest version, YAGO 4, which reconciles the rigorous typing and constraints of schema.org with the rich instance data of Wikidata. The resulting resource contains 2 billion type-consistent triples for 64 Million entities, and has a consistent ontology that allows semantic reasoning with OWL 2 description logics.

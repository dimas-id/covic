The heteroleptic calcium amide [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{N(SiMe(3))(2)}(THF)] (Ar = 2,6‐diisopropylphenyl) and the homoleptic heavier alkaline earth amides, [M{N(SiMe(3))(2)}(2)(THF)(2)] (M = Ca, Sr and Ba) are reported as competent pre‐catalysts for the hydroamination of 1,3‐carbodiimides. Whilst the reaction scope is currently limited to reactions of aromatic amines with 1,3‐dialkylcarbodiimides, in most cases preparations in hydrocarbon solvents proceed rapidly at room temperature with catalyst loadings as low as 0.2 mol‐% and the guanidine reaction products crystallize directly from the reaction mixture. Initial studies are consistent with the intermediacy of heavier group‐2 guanidinate complexes.(© Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2008)

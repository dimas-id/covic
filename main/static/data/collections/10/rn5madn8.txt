CoVID-19 is currently one of the biggest threats to mankind. To date, it is the reason for infections of over 35 lakhs and the death of over 2 lakh human beings. We propose a procedure to detect CoVID-19 affected localities using a sewage mass testing and pooling mechanism which has gained ground in recent times. The proposed method named Sewage Pooling Algorithm tests wastewater samples from sewage systems to pinpoint the regions which are affected by maximum chances of the virus spread. The algorithm also uses a priority-based backtracking procedure to perform testing in sewage links depending on the probability of infection in the sub-areas. For places with very rare CoVID cases, we present a gradient-based search method to prune those areas. The proposed method has less human intervention and increases the effective tests/million people over current in-place methods.

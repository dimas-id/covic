MOTIVATION: As the COVID-19 pandemics is spreading around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving with mutations that potentially change and fine-tune functions of the proteins coded in its genome. RESULTS: Coronavirus3D website integrates data on the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations with information about 3D structures of its proteins, allowing users to visually analyze the mutations in their 3D context. AVAILABILITY: Coronavirus3D server is freely available at https://coronavirus3d.org.

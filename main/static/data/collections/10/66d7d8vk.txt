The concept of immune privilege of the central nervous system (CNS) has dominated the study of inflammatory processes in the brain. However, clinically relevant models have highlighted the innate pathways that limit pathogen invasion of the CNS and that adaptive immunity mediates control of many neural infections. Because protective responses can result in bystander damage there are regulatory mechanisms that balance protective and pathological inflammation but which may also allow microbial persistence. The focus of this review is to consider the host-pathogen interactions that influence neurotropic infections and to highlight advances in understanding of innate and adaptive mechanisms of resistance as key determinants of the outcome of CNS infection. Advances in these areas have broadened our comprehension of how the immune system functions in the brain and can readily overcome immune privilege.

The tail of the bacteriophage P22 is composed of multiple protein components and integrates various biological functions that are crucial to the assembly and infection of the phage. The three-dimensional structure of the P22 tail machine determined by electron cryo-microscopy and image reconstruction reveals how the five types of polypeptides present as 51 subunits are organized into this molecular machine through twelve-, six- and three-fold symmetry, and provides insights into molecular events during host cell attachment and phage DNA translocation.

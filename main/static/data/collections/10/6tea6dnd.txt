Improvement of the methods included in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals and addition of novel techniques are dependent on the continual development and evaluation of both new and existing methods. Although conventional isolation and characterisation techniques for the diagnosis of many diseases still remain the methods of choice there is the potential to make significant progress in the development of rapid methods that will enhance the diagnosis of disease in aquatic animals. For example, serology, rapid kits based on immunochromatography, Luminex xMAP technology, adaptations of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), polygenic sequencing and micro-array technology are all methods that merit validation. Each of the technologies has advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered. This is not a definitive list, and new methods being developed (or that are developed in the future) should continue to be validated if they provide potential benefit to the diagnosis of disease in aquatic animals.

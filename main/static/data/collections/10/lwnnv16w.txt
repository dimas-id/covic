OBJECTIVES To evaluate changes in cuff pressure and position of tapered-cuff and cylindrical-cuff tracheal tubes (TTs) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy; to compare the frequency of endobronchial intubation and airway complaints with the two types of TT. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to intubation with a TT with a cylindrical cuff (group C) or a tapered cuff (group T). Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, O(2) and N(2)O after intubation. TT cuffs were inflated to 20 cm H(2)O; changes in cuff pressure and volume were measured up to 30 min after the start of N(2)O use. Distance between the TT tip and the carina was measured before and after pneumoperitoneum and position change. Frequency of sore throat, dysphagia and hoarseness in the two groups was recorded. RESULTS Cuff volume and pressure were significantly lower in group T than in group C (n = 32 per group). Cuff pressure and volume significantly increased 30 min after start of N(2)O use in both groups. Distance from the TT tip to the carina decreased during surgery in both groups. There were no cases of endobronchial intubation, and there were no between-group differences in the frequency of airway complaints. CONCLUSIONS The tapered cuff was associated with a smaller change in cuff pressure during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than the cylindrical cuff, and therefore may be associated with increased preservation of tracheal mucosal perfusion.

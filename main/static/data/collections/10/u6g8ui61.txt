The present work emphasize the great diversity of the viral species encountered in pregnant women (Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Adenovirus, Poliovirus, Coxsackievirus). In each of the different regions studied, one or two viral types are usually predominant. In Man (West Ivory Coast) region for instance, Rotaviruses and Coronaviruses were mainly encountered; in Bouaké, Polioviruses and Adenoviruses were predominant whereas in Bondoukou and Odienné respectively Coxsackieviruses and Adenoviruses were predominantly identified. Multiple viral infections were also evidenced: Rotaviruses + Coronaviruses, Rotaviruses + Polioviruses, Coronaviruses + Polioviruses, Polioviruses and Adenoviruses. The greatest number of multiple infections was found in Man (8 cases). Inapparent infections were mainly detected in Man where the prevalence for at least one viral type is very high 91.6%; in Bouaké, prevalence of at least one viral type is around 36%. The least level of prevalence was recorded in Bondoukou (East of Ivory Coast) and Odienné (North-West) respectively 17% and 20%.

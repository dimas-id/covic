In this study, we investigated humoral and cellular immune responses in mice to DNA vaccines containing individual S or M genes of a new type of reovirus (nRV) isolate from a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient in Beijing, China. Mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with 100 μg of S1, S2, S3, S4, M1, M2, and M3 DNA vaccine each 4 times in 2-week intervals and assayed for humoral IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG2b antibodies by ELISA and for cellular immune response, particularly IFN-γ induction by ELISpot assay. Moreover, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assayed by flow cytometry. We found that all DNA vaccines induced IgG antibodies, predominantly of the IgG2a class and S3 DNA vaccine was the strongest inducer. M2 and S3 DNA vaccines elicited Th1- and Th2-based immune responses, respectively, while S1 and M3 DNA vaccines induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response. M1, S2, and S4 DNA vaccines were poorly immunogenic. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing mammalian reovirus DNA vaccines applied to a mouse model.

A woman in her forties who was hospitalised after a three-week history of respiratory tract infection, developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Nasopharyngeal swabs taken on days 1 and 3 after admission were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while bronchoalveolar lavage tested positive. We assume this is because the patient had stopped viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract because of the long time between symptom onset and testing.

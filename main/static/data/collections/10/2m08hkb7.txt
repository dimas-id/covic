With the ongoing pandemic of infectious disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-C0V-2), prevention of infection and spread is critical in preventing morbidity and mortality. Prophylaxis, specifically chemoprophylaxis, is particularly critical to breaking the spread and rapid rate of increase of SARS-CoV-2. Pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis are both required components of this public health measure. As the use of anti-malarial agents, specifically the 4-aminoquinolones, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is now being reported, attention must be turned to their role in the chemoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2. In a search of the peer-reviewed medical literature (using MEDLINE and cross-referenced literature), this report is first peer-reviewed publication to present the use of these anti-malarial agents as prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. The ophthalmic consideration of the use of these drugs is highlighted in this report.

In December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were successively reported in multiple hospitals in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The pathogen is a novel coronavirus, which can lead to novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and even threaten the patients' lives. In the following, the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in many provinces and cities. It is particularly important to summarize and analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients and to optimize the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment strategies. Therefore, we organized Chinese experts in the field of organ transplantation to draft this article according to the characteristics of lung infection of SOT recipients and the characteristics of current COVID-19 by referring to relevant guidelines and specifications at home and abroad, aiming to provide reference for transplant physicians in China. This management strategy will be revised at any time with the deepening understanding of the COVID-19 infection.

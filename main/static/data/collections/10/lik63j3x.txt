PURPOSE To evaluate clinical outcomes of simultaneous bilateral carotid artery stenting (sbCAS) compared with unilateral CAS (uCAS). METHODS The database in our institution was queried to identify all patients treated with CAS from January 2005 to December 2012. In this time frame, 120 (18.8%) patients (mean age 64.9 ± 7.7 years; 96 men) underwent sbCAS and 517 (81.2%) patients (mean age 65.7 ± 7.7 years; 421 men) received uCAS. The primary endpoint was the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 30 days or any ipsilateral stroke within 1 year. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the rates of the primary endpoint between the sbCAS and uCAS groups (6.7% vs 4.6%, p=0.358). The rates of the primary endpoint among symptomatic patients was 8.0% in the sbCAS group and 5.0% in the uCAS group (p=0.299) and 3.1% and 4.0%, respectively (p=0.821) among asymptomatic patients. During the 30-day periprocedural period, the rates of the primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the sbCAS and uCAS groups among all patients (5.8% vs 4.4%, p=0.479), symptomatic patients (6.8% vs 5.0%, p=0.594), or asymptomatic patients (3.1% vs 3.5%, p>0.999). After this period, the incidences of any ipsilateral stroke were similarly low (0.8% and 0.2%, respectively; p=0.342). CONCLUSION The study showed that simultaneous bilateral CAS had no more adverse events than unilateral CAS during the periprocedural period or within 1 year. This 1-stage strategy may become a valuable alternative in the treatment of patients with severe bilateral carotid stenosis.

In this paper a geometrical model for simulation of the nerve impulses inside the presynaptic bouton is designed. The neurotransmitter flow is described by using partial differential equation with nonlinear term. The bouton is modeled as a distorted geosphere and the mitochondrion inside it as a highly modified cuboid. The quality of the mesh elements is examined. The changes of the amount of neurotransmitter during exocytosis are simulated.

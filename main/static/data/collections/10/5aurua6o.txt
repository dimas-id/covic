Abstract The study investigates the ability of subtype A Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) to accept foreign genes and be used as a vector for delivery of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) QX genes to chickens. Initially the GFP gene was added to AMPV at all gene junctions in conjunction with the development of cassetted full length DNA AMPV copies. After recombinant virus had been recovered by reverse genetics, GFP positions supporting gene expression while maintaining virus viability in vitro, were determined. Subsequently, either S1 or nucleocapsid (N) genes of IBV were positioned between AMPV M and F genes, while later a bivalent recombinant was prepared by inserting S1 and N at AMPV MF and GL junctions respectively. Immunofluorescent antibody staining showed that all recombinants expressed the inserted IBV genes in vitro and furthermore, all recombinant viruses were found to be highly stable during serial passage. Eyedrop inoculation of chickens with some AMPV-IBV recombinants at one-day-old induced protection against virulent IBV QX challenge 3 weeks later, as assessed by greater motility of tracheal cilia from chickens receiving the recombinants. Nonetheless evidence of AMPV/IBV seroconversion, or major recombinant tracheal replication, were largely absent.

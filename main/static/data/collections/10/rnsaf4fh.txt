Noroviruses are recognized as emerging enteric pathogens of humans and have been identified in recent years in a number of mammalian species. The role of noroviruses as pathogens in immune-competent animals and under natural conditions remains uncertain, although both homologous and heterologous animal models are now available to investigate the pathogenesis, the immune response, and the molecular mechanism regulating norovirus infection. Recently, evidence has been gathered that noroviruses may also circulate in domestic carnivores. The zoonotic implications of these novel viruses deserve more attention, due to the strict social interactions between humans and pets.

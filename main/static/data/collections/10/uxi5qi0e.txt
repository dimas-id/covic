Movement and activity patterns are important components of life history, being central to resource acquisition and defense, mating behavior, and individual survival and fitness. Here, we present results from the 1st systematic radiotracking study of the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), a widespread viverrid found in subtropical and tropical forests of Asia. From June 2004 to November 2007, we radiotracked 12 masked palm civets (5 males and 7 females) in central-south China. Mean individual home-range size based on 95% minimum convex polygons was 192.6 ha ± 42.6 SE (range = 64–451 ha). Although males had larger mean home-range sizes than females (276.8 and 136.5 ha, respectively), these differences were not statistically significant. Males also exhibited greater daily movement distances and extents than females, but we found no evidence of sexual dimorphism in body size. Masked palm civets were predominantly nocturnal, but were active intermittently during the day. No significant seasonal (monthly) differences in daily activity patterns were apparent. We did, however, observe reduced hours of activity—but not continuous inactivity—during winter; consequently, we concluded that our study animals did not hibernate or semihibernate. We speculate that our observations of home-range overlap among individuals may indicate group living in the masked palm civet.

COVID-19 is currently a pandemic in the world, can invade multiple systems, and has a high morbidity and mortality. So far, no cases of acute cerebrovascular disease have been reported. This article reports the clinical features of a COVID-19 patient whose first symptom was cerebral hemorrhage. More importantly, after the craniotomy, the patient had high fever and it was difficult to retreat. After cerebrospinal fluid testing, it was determined that an intracranial infection had occurred. After anti-infection and plasma infusion of the recovered person, the patientâ€™s symptoms gradually improved. This case suggests that COVID-19 may infringe on cerebral blood vessels and cause cerebral hemorrhage. Transfusion of plasma from rehabilitation patients is effective for critically ill patients.

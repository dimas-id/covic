In this chapter we focus on the bioinformatics strategies for translating genome-wide expression analyses into clinically useful cancer markers with a specific focus on breast cancer with a perspective on new diagnostic device tools coming from the field of nanobiotechnology and the challenges related to high-throughput data integration, analysis, and assessment from multiple sources. Great progress in the development of molecular biology techniques has been seen since the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the implementation of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. This started a new era of research on the structure of nucleic acids molecules, the development of new analytical tools, and DNA-based analyses that allowed the sequencing of the human genome, the completion of which has led to intensified efforts toward comprehensive analysis of mammalian cell struc ture and metabolism in order to better understand the mechanisms that regulate normal cell behavior and identify the gene alterations responsible for a broad spectrum of human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and others.

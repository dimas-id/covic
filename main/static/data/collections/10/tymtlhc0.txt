Endovascular embolization is a frequently used adjunct to operative resection of meningiomas. Embolization may decrease intraoperative blood loss, operative time, and surgical difficulty associated with resection. The specific clinical applications of this treatment have not been defined clearly. Procedural indications, preferred embolic agent, and latency until tumor resection all differ across operators. It is clear that strategic patient selection, comprehensive anatomic understanding, and sound operative technique are critical to the success of the embolization procedure. This article reviews the management and technical considerations associated with preoperative meningioma embolization.

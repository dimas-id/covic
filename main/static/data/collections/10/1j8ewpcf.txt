Attention to cardiac arrest in a highly contagious situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic may condition some focused measures, on the one hand, prior and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) action, in the other hand an adequate protection and safety of rescuers, patients and the environment. From the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Working Group of the Spanish Society of Cardiology, after analyzing the current situation, we have decided to prepare this document in order to summarize in a practical way the main recommendations in the context of CPR during the COVID-19 pandemic. These recommendations may be subject to subsequent changes, as a result of the progression of the evidence and the learning that we have acquired at this stage.

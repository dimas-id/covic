Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first recognized in 2012 and since then has resulted in cases in 23 countries in four continents. The majority of these cases were reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The disease caused a spectrum of illness, from asymptomatic to severe and possibly fatal disease. Recent studies showed that the transmission of MERS-CoV among family contacts remains relatively low. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics for MERS-CoV.

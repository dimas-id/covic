The difference noted in Rotavirus vaccine efficiency between high and low income countries correlates with the lack of universal access to clean water and higher standards of hygiene. Overcoming these obstacles will require great investment and also time, therefore more effective vaccines should be developed to meet the needs of those who would benefit the most from them. Increasing our current knowledge of mucosal immunity, response to Rotavirus infection and its modulation by circadian rhythms could point at actionable pathways to improve vaccination efficacy, especially in the case of individuals affected by environmental enteropathy. Also, a better understanding and validation of Rotavirus entry factors as well as the systematic monitoring of dominant strains could assist in tailoring vaccines to individualâ€™s needs. Another aspect that could improve vaccine efficiency is targeting to M cells, for which new ligands could potentially be sought. Finally, alternative mucosal adjuvants and vaccine expression, storage and delivery systems could have a positive impact in the outcome of Rotavirus vaccination.

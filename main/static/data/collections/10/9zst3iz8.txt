The effect of different protease inhibitors on the proteolytic processing of the plum pox potyvirus (PPV) polyprotein has been analyzed. Human cystatin C, an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, interfered with the outoprocessing of the viral papain-like cysteine protease HCPro. Unexpectedly, it also had an inhibitory effect on the autocatalytic cleavage of the Nla protease which, although it has a Cys residue in its active center, has been described as structurally related to serine proteases. Other protease inhibitors tested had no effect on any of the cleavage events analyzed.

The diagnosis of acute kidney injury by evaluating the activity of urinary enzymes is an important tool especially for its precocity in relation to methods of assessment of renal function considered late as the installation of injury precedes the function change. This study was performed to determine the reference interval for urinary NAG activity (N-Acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase) in urine of healthy dogs of different breeds, ages and sexes. It was utilized an automated method for the determination of NAG activity standardized for dog urine samples. Through statistical analysis it was observed that NAG is positively correlated with the age of the animal and urine specific gravity but is not interfered by sex or weight. Based on the determination of urinary activity and after correcting the values for a 1,025 urine specific gravity was obtained an reference interval of X '= 3.62U/LÂ±0.66U/L.(AU)

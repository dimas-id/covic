Heparanase (HPSE) is a multifunctional protein endowed with many non-enzymatic functions and a unique enzymatic activity as an endo-ÃŸ-D-glucuronidase. The latter allows it to serve as a key modulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) via a well-regulated cleavage of heparan sulfate side chains of proteoglycans at cell surfaces. The cleavage and associated changes at the ECM cause release of multiple signaling molecules with important cellular and pathological functions. New and emerging data suggest that both enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic functions of HPSE are important for health and illnesses including viral infections and virally induced cancers. This review summarizes recent findings on the roles of HPSE in activation, inhibition, or bioavailability of key signaling molecules such as AKT, VEGF, MAPK-ERK, and EGFR, which are known regulators of common viral infections in immune and non-immune cell types. Altogether, our review provides a unique overview of HPSE in cell-survival signaling pathways and how they relate to viral infections.

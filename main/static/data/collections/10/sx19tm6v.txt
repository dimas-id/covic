Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is based on bronchodilation, with inhaled corticosteroids or azithromycin associated when frequent exacerbations occur. Despite the proven benefits of current treatment regimens, the need for new interventions in delineated subgroups remains. There is convincing evidence for oral vitamin D supplementation in reducing exacerbations in COPD patients severely deficient for circulating vitamin D. However, little is known about local vitamin D metabolism in the airways and studies examining expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), the activating enzyme (CYP27B1) and inactivating enzyme (CYP24A1) of vitamin D in lung tissue of COPD patients are lacking. Therefore, the expression and localization of key enzymes and the receptor of the vitamin D pathway were examined in tissue of 10 unused donor lungs and 10 COPD explant lungs. No differences in the expression of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 were found. Although protein expression of VDR was significantly lower in COPD explant tissue, there was no difference in downstream expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Whereas CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 were present in all layers of the bronchial epithelium, VDR was only expressed at the apical layer of a fully differentiated bronchial epithelium with no expression in vascular endothelial cells. By contrast, CYP24A1 expression was highly present in lung endothelial cells suggesting that systemic vitamin D can be inactivated before reaching the epithelial compartment and the tissue immune cells. These data support the idea of exploring the role of vitamin D inhalation in patients with COPD.

In this work, a new method is introduced for synthesis of nano drug for the first time. H(3)PMo(12)O(40) and Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2)/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), were prepared as nano drug and magneto thermally responsive nano-carrier respectively. Then the released behavior of H(3)PMo(12)O(40) nano-drug from this thermo-responsive carrier was investigated in an AC magnetic field. When a drug particle is broken up to nanometer range, the total surface area is increased; therefore the rate of dissolution and the rate of release are increased. The as-synthesized nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Furthermore, experimental condition which lead to the released profile of H(3)PMo(12)O(40) nano-drug from Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2)/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), such as strength of magnetic field (H), temperature (T), particle size of drug and content of loaded drug were tested. Increasing the strength of magnetic field, temperature and content of loaded drug, the rate of drug release was also increased.

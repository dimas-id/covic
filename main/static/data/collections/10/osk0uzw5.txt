ABSTRACT: Morus genus plants are mainly distributed in the temperate to tropical areas over the world and include 17 species and two subspecies. Due to their excellent pharmacological activity, security in food additives and high value in the national economy, Morus genus plants have drawn more and more attention in recent years. In the light of the references published over the last few decades, flavonoids, benzofurans, stilbenes, and Diels–Alder adducts have been reported to be the main bioactive constituents of Morus genus plants. This review summarizes the compounds with excellent bioactivities isolated from Morus genus plants as well as their structure–activity relationships (SARs), which might be useful for the further research and development of Morus genus plants.

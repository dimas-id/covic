Genetic variations in host immunity may influence susceptibility to novel infections like the recently emergent pandemic influenza virus. Prior studies demonstrated that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) inactivates influenza. Furthermore, MBL deficiency is common and appears to predispose to respiratory virus infections. Therefore, we studied whether MBL deficiency played a role in infection with the novel H1N1 2009 influenza strain in exposed health care workers. In a nested caseâ€“control study, we observed no association between phenotypic MBL deficiency, variously defined, and predisposition to H1N1 2009 influenza in 63 pairs of seropositive and seronegative participants. MBL appears to currently have little impact on innate immune responses to H1N1 2009 influenza.

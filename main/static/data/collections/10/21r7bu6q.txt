PURPOSE: To analyze epidemiology and burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Italy. METHODS: We used Hospital Discharge Records and number of residents in Italy to calculate number and rate of hospitalization for Chagas disease, dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, Taenia solium taeniasis, and cysticercosis by sex, citizenship group, and region in the period 2011-2016. RESULTS: 7195 hospitalizations for NTDs were retrieved, accounting for 7375 diagnoses, 60% in Italians and 40% in foreigners. Male-to-female ratio was 2; the age group more commonly affected was 25-44 years (32.5%). The most common diagnoses were leishmaniasis (34%), schistosomiasis (29%), strongyloidiasis (12%), Chagas disease (8%), and dengue (8%). Average yearly hospitalization rate per 100,000 residents for all NTDs was 2.05, 1.33, and 10.39 in general population, Italians, and foreign citizens, respectively. Hospitalization rates higher than 100 per 100,000 subjects were found in citizens from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Bolivia. CONCLUSIONS: NTDs have a not negligible burden in Italy. The most clinically relevant NTDs in Italy are leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis, followed by strongyloidiasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. Cystic echinococcosis, that was not included in the analysis since a similar study on this disease was recently published, should also be listed among the leading NTD in Italy. While schistosomiasis has its highest burden on population coming from highly endemic areas such as SSA, leishmaniasis is especially relevant in Italian-born residents of southern regions. Education at university and post-graduate levels, to increase the awareness of healthcare professionals on these topics, as well as targeted public health interventions (such as screening or presumptive treatment in high-risk groups), are an asset to improve clinical management and control of these diseases.

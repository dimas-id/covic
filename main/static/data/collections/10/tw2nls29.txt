Over the past two decades, deadly coronaviruses have caused major challenges to public health, with the most recent being the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019) pandemic. The path for virus invasion into humans and other hosts is mediated by "host-pathogen" interactions, specifically, virus-receptor binding. An in-depth understanding of the virus-receptor binding mechanism is a prerequisite for the discovery of vaccines, antibodies, and/or small-molecule inhibitors that can interrupt this interaction and prevent or cure infection. In this review, we discuss the viral entry mechanism, the known structural aspects of virus-receptor interactions (SARS-CoV-2 S/humanACE2, SARS-CoV S/humanACE2, and MERS-CoV S/humanDPP4), the key protein domains and amino acid residues involved in binding, and the small-molecule inhibitors and other drugs that have (as of June, 2020) exhibited therapeutic potential. Specifically, we review the potential clinical utility of two transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)-targeting protease inhibitors, nafamostat mesylate and camostat mesylate, as well as two novel potent fusion inhibitors and the repurposed Ebola drug, remdesivir, which is specific to RdRp, against human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

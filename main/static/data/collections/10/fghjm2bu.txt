This review aims to describe new developments in coronary revascularization strategies for patients with pre-existing Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Recommended strategies for revascularization have been an active area of study with recent important developments. In patients with Type 2 DM and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is the preferred method for revascularization. Patients with DM are at increased risk for diffuse cardiovascular disease due to the proinflammatory, prothrombotic effects of chronic hyperglycemia. In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, drug-eluting stents and more potent antiplatelet agents especially in those presenting with acute coronary syndromes should be employed.

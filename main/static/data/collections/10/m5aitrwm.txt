A 62-year-old man with situs inversus totalis and non-small-cell lung cancer underwent a right lower lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Lobectomy in a situs inversus totalis patient can be performed safely using this minimally invasive procedure. Preoperative evaluation of the pulmonary artery and veins by three-dimensional computed tomography and the bronchial tree by bronchoscopy, is essential to avoid unanticipated complications during the procedure.

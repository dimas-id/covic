Several substituted phenoxy acetic acid derived pyrazolines were synthesized by the reaction between 2-{4-[3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-oxo-1-propenyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy} acetic acid and substituted acid hydrazides and were tested for their in vitro cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. None of the compounds showed any specific antiviral activity [50% antivirally effective concentration (EC(50)) > or = 5-fold lower than minimum cytotoxic concentration]. The most cytotoxic of the series was 2-{4-[3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-(2-hydroxybenzoyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-5-pyrazolyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy}acetic acid (3(j)), with a minimum cytotoxic concentration of 0.16 microg/mL in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells.

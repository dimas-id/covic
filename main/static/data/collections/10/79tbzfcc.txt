This paper presents a project, named VIDAR-19, able to extract automatically diseases from the CORD-19 dataset, and also diseases which might be considered as risk factors. The project relies on the ICD-11 classification of diseases maintained by the WHO. This nomenclature is used as a data source of the extraction mechanism, and also as the repository for the results. Developed for the COVID-19, the project has the ability to extract diseases at risk and to calculate relevant indicators. The outcome of the project is presented in a dashboard which enables the user to explore graphically diseases at risk which are put back in the classification hierarchy. Beyond the COVID-19, VIDAR has much broader applications and might be directly used for any corpus dealing with other pathologies.

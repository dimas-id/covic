T cell accumulation and effector function following CNS infection is limited by a paucity of Ag presentation and inhibitory factors characteristic of the CNS environment. Differential susceptibilities of primary and recall CD8+ T cell responses to the inhibitory CNS environment were monitored in naive and CD8+ T cell-immune mice challenged with a neurotropic coronavirus. Accelerated virus clearance and limited spread in immunized mice was associated with a rapid and increased CNS influx of virus-specific secondary CD8+ T cells. CNS-derived secondary CD8+ T cells exhibited increased cytolytic activity and IFN-gamma expression per cell compared with primary CD8+ T cells. However, both Ag-specific primary and secondary CD8+ T cells demonstrated similar contraction rates. Thus, CNS persistence of increased numbers of secondary CD8+ T cells reflected differences in the initial pool size during peak inflammation rather than enhanced survival. Unlike primary CD8+ T cells, persisting secondary CD8+ T cells retained ex vivo cytolytic activity and expressed high levels of IFN-gamma following Ag stimulation. However, both primary and secondary CD8+ T cells exhibited reduced capacity to produce TNF-alpha, differentiating them from effector memory T cells. Activation of primary and secondary CD8+ T cells in the same host using adoptive transfers confirmed similar survival, but enhanced and prolonged effector function of secondary CD8+ T cells in the CNS. These data suggest that an instructional program intrinsic to T cell differentiation, rather than Ag load or factors in the inflamed CNS, prominently regulate CD8+ T cell function.

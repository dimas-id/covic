Summary COVID-19 has become a global pandemic not long after its inception in late 2019. SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced and shared on public repositories at a fast pace. To keep up with these updates, scientists need to frequently refresh and reclean datasets, which is ad hoc and labor-intensive. Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In order to address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, a webserver to enable simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Given a new sequence, CoV-Seq automatically predicts gene boundaries and identifies genetic variants, which are presented in an interactive genome visualizer and are downloadable for further analysis. A command-line interface is also available for high-throughput processing. Availability and Implementation CoV-Seq is implemented in Python and Javascript. The webserver is available at http://covseq.baidu.com/ and the source code is available from https://github.com/boxiangliu/covseq.

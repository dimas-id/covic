Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) positive cells are present in pyogranulomas and exudates from cats with FIP. These cells belong mainly to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. How these cells survive in immune cats is not known. In this study, FIPV positive cells were isolated from pyogranulomas and exudates of 12 naturally FIPV-infected cats and the presence of two immunologic targets, viral antigens and MHC I, on their surface was determined. The majority of the infected cells were confirmed to be cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. No surface expression of viral antigens was detected on FIPV positive cells. MHC I molecules were present on all the FIPV positive cells. After cultivation of the isolated infected cells, 52Â±10% of the infected cells re-expressed viral antigens on the plasma membrane. In conclusion, it can be stated that in FIP cats, FIPV replicates in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage without carrying viral antigens in their plasma membrane, which could allow them to escape from antibody-dependent cell lysis.

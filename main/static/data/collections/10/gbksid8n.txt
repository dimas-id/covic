We have developed an ultrasensitive biosensor based on an integrated optical Young interferometer. Key features of this sensor are that it is very compact, extremely sensitive, label free, and very fast. Therefore the Young interferometer has significant potential to be developed into a handheld, point-of-care device. In this chapter we review the progress that has been made on the development of integrated Young interferometer sensors. The sensor developed in our lab is discussed in detail. We demonstrate various applications of the current sensor. Special attention is paid to the detection of viruses. Finally a discussion on future prospects of this sensor for diagnostics is given.

Reactive poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) (PPFPA) grafted surfaces offer a versatile platform to immobilize biomolecules. Here, we utilize PPFPA grafted surface and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) recognizing J2 antibody to construct a universal virus detection platform with enhanced sensitivity. PPFPA on silicon substrates are prepared, and surface hydrophilicity is modulated by partial substitution of the pentafluorophenyl units with poly(ethylene glycol). Following dsRNA antibody immobilization, the prepared surfaces can distinguish long dsRNAs from single-stranded RNAs of the same length and short dsRNAs. As long dsRNAs are common byproducts of viral transcription/replication, these surfaces can detect the presence of different kinds of viruses without prior knowledge of their genomic sequences. To increase dsRNA detection sensitivity, a two-step method is devised where the captured dsRNAs are visualized with multiple fluorophore-tagged J2 antibodies. We show that the developed platform can differentiate foreign long dsRNAs from cellular dsRNAs and other biomolecules present in the cell lysate. Moreover, when tested against cells infected with hepatitis A or C viruses, both viruses are successfully detected using a single platform. Our study shows that the developed PPFPA platform immobilized with J2 antibody can serve as a primary diagnostic tool to determine the infection status for a wide range of viruses.

As innovation continues to evolve in gynecologic surgery, new "cosmetic" techniques are continually being developed. Minimally invasive surgery offers clear benefits over open surgery, such as decreased postoperative pain, infection, length of hospital stay, and time out of work. It is now possible to perform many laparoscopic gynecologic surgeries with minimal to no visible scars. This article reviews the use of 3mm ports and several reduced-port and single-port techniques for use in gynecologic surgery as well as vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES). We also discuss the advantages and challenges that physicians face regarding the adoption of these procedures into general practice. Lastly, we present our novel economic adaption in approach to reduced-port laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy versus traditional single-site laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. In conclusion, minimally invasive approaches to gynecological surgery are considered feasible and safe.

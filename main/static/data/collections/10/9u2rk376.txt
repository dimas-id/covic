The COVID-19 disease is caused by a positive stranded RNA virus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus mainly targets the pulmonary epithelial cells as itâ€™s initial site of infection by letting its surface spike protein interact and bind to the host ACE2 receptor. The internalization and gradual replication of the virus results in an exaggerated immune response triggering release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This immune storm is responsible for multiple health hazards in the host ultimately leading to multiple organ failure. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy offers a promising approach towards mitigating the delirious effects of the infection in the COVID-19 patients. This therapy has shown to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as repair of damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients. This review has been organized to put forward the positive aruments and implications in support of mesenchymal stem cell therapy as a necessary approach for treating COVID-19 patients.

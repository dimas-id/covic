INTRODUCTION Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most frequent cause of hemorrhagic strokes in the pediatric population. The study aim was to retrospectively assess the safety and efficacy of Onyx embolization with the intention to cure AVMs in a pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients (<18 years) who underwent endovascular embolization using Onyx at our institution was conducted. The primary endpoint was the composite complete angiographic occlusion of AVM immediately after the last embolization session that had no procedure-related complication requiring emergency surgery. Secondary endpoints were angiographic occlusion rates, procedure-related complications, and clinical outcomes after treatment and at the 6-month follow-up RESULTS Twenty-three patients (mean age, 11.7 years) underwent a total of 45 embolization sessions. The median Spetzler-Martin grade was 3 (range 1 to 4). The primary endpoint was achieved in 19 patients (82.6 %). Complete angiographic occlusion of the AVM was obtained in 21 patients (91.3 %) immediately after embolization and at the 6-month follow-up. Embolization-related complications were observed in three patients (13 %). None of the complications resulted in permanent functional disability or death. In two patients (8.7 %), the AVM could not be completely occluded by embolization alone and the patients were referred to radiosurgery and microsurgery, respectively. CONCLUSION Onyx embolization of AVM in pediatric patients with the intention to cure resulted in high occlusion rates without increasing neurological disability or death. The development of new embolization techniques and devices seems to improve the safety of Onyx embolization.

The pathogenesis of postviral olfactory disorder (PVOD) has not been fully elucidated. We investigated morphological changes and innate immune responses in the mouse olfactory mucosa induced by intranasal administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA. Mice received three administrations of saline with or without Poly(I:C), once every 24 h. The olfactory mucosa was harvested at various intervals after the first administration (8 h, 3, 9 and 24 days). In the Poly(I:C) group, the number of apoptotic cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium had increased at 8 h. At 9 days, the olfactory neuroepithelium had severely degenerated and behavioral tests demonstrated that the mice showed signs of olfactory deterioration. At 24 days, the structure of the neuroepithelium had regenerated almost completely. Regarding the innate immune responses, many neutrophils had infiltrated the olfactory neuroepithelium at 8 h and had exuded into the nasal cavity by 3 days. Macrophages had also infiltrated the olfactory neuroepithelium at 8 h although to a lesser extent, but they still remained in the neuroepithelium at 24 days. Poly(I:C)-induced neuroepithelial damage was significantly inhibited by a neutrophil elastase inhibitor and was suppressed in neutropenic model mice. These findings suggest that the secondary damage caused by the neutrophil-mediated innate immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PVOD.

This research brings together scholarship across the Americas and Caribbean to examine digital inclusion initiatives in the following countries: Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, the United States, and Canada Across the cases, several themes emerge that offer important indicators for future digital inclusion initiatives First, public policy can effectively reduce access gaps when it addresses the trifecta of network, device, and skill provision Second, this triple-crown of public policy is highly effective for longitudinal effect when implemented early via educational institutions Third, rural-urban digital inequality is resistant to change such that rural populations benefit less from policy initiatives than their urban counterparts Fourth, digital inclusion in rural areas and among marginalized populations is most effective when co-created with communities to ensure community investment, participation, and control Fifth, stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly increasing our dependence on digital technologies, making digital inclusion more important than ever for education and rural communities We therefore close the article with discussion of how the COVID-19 pandemic is amplifying digital disadvantage and exclusion across the Americas, the Caribbean, and the globe

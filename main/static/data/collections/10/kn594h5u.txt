BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) to treat obesity and associated comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, is well established. As diabetes may add risk to the perioperative period, we sought to characterize perioperative outcomes of these surgical procedures in diabetic patients. METHODS: Using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database, we identified patients who underwent LSG and LRYGB between 2015 and 2017, grouping by non-diabetics (NDM), non-insulin-dependent diabetics (NIDDM), and insulin-dependent diabetics (IDDM). Primary outcomes included serious adverse events, 30-day readmission, 30-day reoperation, and 30-day mortality. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the outcome in each diabetic cohort. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis of patients who underwent LSG (with NDM patients as reference) showed higher 30-day mortality (NIDDM AOR = 1.52, p = 0.043; IDDM AOR = 1.91, p = 0.007) and risk of serious adverse events (NIDDM AOR = 1.15, p < 0.001; IDDM AOR = 1.58, p < 0.001) in the diabetic versus NDM groups. Multivariable analysis of patients who underwent LRYGB (with NDM patients as reference) showed higher risk of serious adverse events (NIDDM AOR = 1.09, p = 0.014; IDDM AOR = 1.43, p < 0.001) in the diabetic versus NDM groups. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetics who underwent LSG and LRYGB had higher rates of several perioperative complications compared with non-diabetics. IDDM had a stronger association with several perioperative complications compared with NIDDM. This increase in morbidity and mortality is modest and should be weighed against the real benefits of bariatric surgery in patient with obesity and diabetes mellitus.

OBJECTIVE To date, no cases have been reported on the effects of COVID-19 in laryngectomees. CASE PRESENTATION We herein presented two clinical cases of laryngectomized patients affected by COVID-19, detailing their clinical course and complications. DISCUSSION In our experience, permanent tracheostomy did not significantly affect the choice of treatment. However, dedicated devices and repeated tracheal toilettes may be needed to deal with oxygen-therapy-related tracheal crusting. CONCLUSION In conclusion, laryngectomees should be considered a vulnerable population that may be at risk for worse outcomes of COVID-19 due to anatomical changes in their airways. The role of the ENT specialist is to guide airway management and inform the support-staff regarding specific needs of these patients.

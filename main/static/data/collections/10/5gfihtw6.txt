Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), an economically-important disease caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), has become endemic to most pig-producing countries. Point mutation and recombination are responsible for genetic heterogeneity, resulting in circulation of genetically-diverse strains. However, no natural recombinant PRRSV has yet been identified in Korea. Here, we successfully isolated natural recombinant PRRSV-2 (KU-N1202) using cell culture, investigated its genomic characteristics, and further evaluated its pathogenicity. KU-N1202 is a recombinant strain between Korean MN184-like and VR-2332-like strains. Specifically, ORF5 to partial ORF7 of the VR-2332-like strain was inserted into the backbone of a CP07-626-2-like strain. KU-N1202 induced mild-to-moderate clinical signs and mild histopathological changes with low viral loads in challenged pigs. Contact pigs showed minimal clinical signs and lower viral loads than those in the challenge group. This study demonstrates the genomic characteristics and pathogenicity of natural recombinant PRRSV-2, illustrating the potential importance of recombination in the field.

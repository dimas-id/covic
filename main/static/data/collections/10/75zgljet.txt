Abstract Emerging viruses are a major threat to human health. Recent outbreaks have emphasized the urgent need for new antiviral treatments. For several pathogenic viruses, considerable efforts have focused on vaccine development. However, during epidemics infected individuals need to be treated urgently. High-throughput screening of clinically tested compounds provides a rapid means to identify undiscovered, antiviral functions for well-characterized therapeutics. Repurposed drugs can bypass part of the early cost and time needed for validation and authorization. In this review we describe recent efforts to find broad spectrum antivirals through drug repurposing. We have chosen several candidates and propose strategies to understand their mechanism of action and to determine how resistance to antivirals develops in infected cells.

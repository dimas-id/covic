December 2013, an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus began in a small village in southern Guinea, the first outbreak of the Zaire Ebola strain in West Africa. Within a yearâ€™s time, the outbreak, which was not officially noticed by health authorities until March 2014, had led to approximately 18,000 known human cases and 6,300 deaths, posing an unprecedented challenge to global public health. Air travel helped the disease leap from West Africa to other continents, including North America and Europe.

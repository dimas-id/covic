Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an atypical immunological paradox commonly associated with dengue virus re-infection. However, various research models have demonstrated this phenomenon with other viral families, including Coronaviridae. Recently, ADE in SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as one hypothesis to explain severe clinical manifestations. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is augmented by ADE remains undetermined and has therefore garnered criticism for the improper attribution of the phenomenon to the pandemic. Thus, critical evaluation of ADE in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development will be indispensable to avoid a global setback and the erosion of public trust.

OBJECTIVES: To add to the growing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, so as to better inform clinical decision making and optimize patient outcomes. METHODS: A systematic search of relevant databases was perfomed on 25 March 2020 and a repeat search, on 10 April 2020. Reports of pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at any time during their pregnancy were reviewed and summarized . RESULTS: We summarized the outcomes of a total of 155 pregnant women and 118 neonates. The evidence suggests a similar rate of severe COVID-19 cases in pregnant women and the general population. The frequency of cesarean deliveries is high, against guidelines recommendations. CONCLUSION: Limited data on COVID-19 during preganacy, associated with a wide variation in the methodology make accurate data interpretation difficult.

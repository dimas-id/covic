PURPOSE: Clinical empathy is the ability to understand the patient's situation, perspective, feelings, and actions, based on the patient’s perception, in a helping or therapeutic way. This study was conducted with the aim of exploring oncology nurses’ perception of the consequences of clinical empathy in patients and nurses and the factors influencing it. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted by semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The participants were 6 male and 9 female oncology nurses who were selected by purposive sampling. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: The theme of “empathy as a double-sided mirror” was created, based on oncology nurses’ perception of the effects of clinical empathy in patients and nurses. Two themes of “organizational factors” and “contextual factors” were generated in response to influencing factors on clinical empathy. CONCLUSIONS: By awareness of the effects of clinical empathy, controlling the barriers and strengthening the facilitators, there is a possibility to design interventional programs to develop empathy as a clinical competency in oncology nurses.

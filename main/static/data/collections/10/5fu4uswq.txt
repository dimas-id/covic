Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world today, being the most important parasitic infection, and Plasmodium falciparum is the organism responsible for most of the mortality [1]. It has been estimated that approximately 300–500 million people contract malaria every year, with approximately 1–2 million deaths, most of these occurring in children [1–5]. Plasmodium falciparum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and measles currently compete for the title of the single most important pathogen causing human morbidity and mortality [2, 3]. Infection with Plasmodium falciparum has a wide variety of potential clinical consequences [4, 6, 7].

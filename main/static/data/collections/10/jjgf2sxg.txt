Despite the increasing number of recent reports on laparoscopic resection of malignant liver tumors in adults, there have been few reports involving children. In this paper we discuss the laparoscopic resection of a hepatoblastoma in a 1-year-old boy. The CT scan revealed an exophytic hepatic tumor on S5 measuring 6 × 5 × 4 cm after preoperative chemotherapy. The operation time was 225 min with an estimated blood loss of about 38 mL; intraoperative transfusion was not required. Radiofrequency-assisted precoagulation was performed. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and started postoperative chemotherapy on postoperative day 12. Our literature search revealed only five reported cases of laparoscopic resection of hepatoblastoma in which there was no postoperative complication or recurrence. Laparoscopic resection of a hepatoblastoma in a selected subgroup of patients can be safe and feasible.

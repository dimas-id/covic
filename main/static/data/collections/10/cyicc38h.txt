BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus infection (COVID‐19) was confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and the COVID‐19 pandemic has spread around the world. However, no clinical studies on the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on EMS systems has been conducted worldwide. METHODS: This was a retrospective study with a study period from January 1, 2020 to April 14, 2020. We included the patients transported by ambulance for acute diseases and traffic accidents in Osaka City. The main outcome of this study was the difficulty in hospital acceptance. We calculated the rate of difficulty of hospital acceptance for each month for acute diseases and traffic accidents. RESULTS: Between January 1 to April 14, 2020, 36,981 patients were transported to hospitals by ambulance for acute diseases and 3096 patients for traffic accidents. There was no difference in the proportion of the difficulty in hospital acceptance due to traffic accidents between 2019 and 2020, but there was an increase in the proportion of the difficulty in hospital acceptance due to acute disease after the 13th week (March 25‐March 31) of 2020 compared to that of 2019. The OR in April was 2.17 (95% CI, 1.84‐2.58) for acute disease. CONCLUSION: We assessed the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the EMS system in Osaka city, Japan and found that since April 2020, the EMS system in Osaka city has been facing difficulty in terms of hospital acceptance of patients transported to hospital for acute diseases.

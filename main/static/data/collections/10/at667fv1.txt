BACKGROUND: As a consequence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a large amount of consultations will be delivered through tele-medicine, especially for diseases causing chronic disability and requiring immunomodulatory treatments, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: We have hereby reviewed available tools for tele-neurology examination in MS, including components of neurological examination that can be assessed through video, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and digital technology. RESULTS: Overall, we have suggested a battery for assessing MS disability and relapses on tele-medicine, which brings together conventional examination, PROMs (e.g., Patient Determined Disease Steps, MS Impact Scale), and cognitive tests (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) that can be delivered remotely and in multiple languages. DISCUSSION: The use of common tools for neurological examination could improve tele-neurology practice for both general neurologists and MS specialists, and quality of care for people with MS.

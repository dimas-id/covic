PURPOSE Certain splenic conditions in children require surgical interventions, the majority of which are approached via standard laparoscopy with multiple incisions. The single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) technique is gaining popularity. The aim of this study is to review our institutional experience using the SIL technique to surgically manage different splenic pathology in the pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of the patients who underwent SIL splenic procedures at Miller Children's Hospital (Long Beach, CA) from January 2009 to December 2010. RESULTS Seven patients underwent a SIL technique for different splenic diseases. Five patients underwent splenectomy, 1 patient underwent a splenic cystectomy and omental patching, and 1 patient underwent reduction of splenic torsion and splenopexy. There were no conversions to open. Six procedures were successfully performed without the need for an additional trocar. However, 1 patient required an additional grasper through a separate stab incision. There were no intraoperative complications. One patient had a superficial wound infection at 2-week postoperative follow-up, which resolved with local wound care. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience shows the SIL technique for the management of splenic pathology in children is safe and feasible.

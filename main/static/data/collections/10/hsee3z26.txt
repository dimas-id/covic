A new protein of feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) was discovered in lysates of [35S]cysteine-labeled infected cells. Expression of open reading frame (ORF) 6b of FIPV in recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells was used to identify it as the 6b protein. Further characterization revealed that it is a novel type of viral glycoprotein whose function is not clear. It is a soluble protein contained in microsomes; its slow export from the cell is caused by the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal at the C terminus. This amino acid sequence, KTEL, closely resembles the consensus KDEL signal of soluble resident ER proteins. A mutant 6b protein with the C-terminal sequence KTEV became resistant to digestion by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H with a half-time that was reduced threefold. In contrast, a mutant with the sequence KDEL was completely retained in the ER. The FIPV 6b protein is the first example of a viral protein with a functional KDEL-like ER retention signal.

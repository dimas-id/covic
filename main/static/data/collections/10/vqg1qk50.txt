Healthcare monitoring system in hospitals and many other health centers has experienced significant growth, and portable healthcare monitoring systems with emerging technologies are becoming of great concern to many countries worldwide nowadays. The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies facilitates the progress of healthcare from face-to-face consulting to telemedicine. This paper proposes a smart healthcare system in IoT environment that can monitor a patientâ€™s basic health signs as well as the room condition where the patients are now in real-time. In this system, five sensors are used to capture the data from hospital environment named heart beat sensor, body temperature sensor, room temperature sensor, CO sensor, and CO(2) sensor. The error percentage of the developed scheme is within a certain limit (< 5%) for each case. The condition of the patients is conveyed via a portal to medical staff, where they can process and analyze the current situation of the patients. The developed prototype is well suited for healthcare monitoring that is proved by the effectiveness of the system.

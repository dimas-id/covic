This article offers some initial commentary on the cultural impacts of COVID-19. It first considers how the pandemic might already have shifted the focus - or challenged our capacities - for cultural studies scholarship. However, the article is more centrally concerned with how measures designed to combat COVID-19 have begun to transform patterns of cultural consumption, production and work. The article considers the current status of cultural workers, in the midst of (yet further) crisis, and poses questions of what might culture be or become, in and beyond the current state of emergency.

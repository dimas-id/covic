Blood transfusion is essential and vital in the successful treatment of many malignant and nonmalignant hematological disorders. Children with thalassemia, adults with myelodysplastic syndromes, and patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemias, leukemias, or aplastic anemias become chronically dependent on blood transfusions. Modern treatment procedures such as high-dose chemotherapy and progenitor cell transplantation require intensive support with blood components and products. The serological basis of blood transfusion, the available blood components and products, and adverse effects of blood transfusion with special emphasis on infectious disease transmission are discussed in this chapter.

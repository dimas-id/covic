Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) represents a public health threat worldwide and Italy at the present time is considered the epicenter of this severe infection in the western world. Unfortunately, no standardized therapy does exist for COVID-19 and a number of investigational drugs for use in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 infections have been tried. One investigational treatment being explored for COVID-19 involves the use of convalescent plasma collected from recovered COVID-19 patients.

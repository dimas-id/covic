BACKGROUND The most common early complications associated with mammary implants are seroma and haematoma formation, and acute infection. The aspiration of fluid around the prosthesis can help to diagnose and correctly treat these complications. The use of a needle with a sharp tip can damage the implant. We present our experience in removing periprosthetic fluid using the atraumatic Veress needle. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twelve patients with breast implants presented with a progressive monolateral breast enlargement. Ultrasound examination revealed the collection of fluid around the implants. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle aspiration of the fluid was performed using the Veress needle. RESULTS No complications were reported. None of the implants was found to be damaged at the ultrasound assessment. CONCLUSION Our proposed use of the Veress needle is similar to the use for which it was designed. Indeed, we used the device to remove some fluid from a real cavity. This procedure proved to be effective and safe.

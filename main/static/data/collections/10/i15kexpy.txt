From January 1986 through December 1987, 277 cases of cryptosporidiosis in calves were diagnosed by the South Dakota State University Diagnostic Laboratory. Cryptosporidium sp was the only pathogen identified in 142 (51.3%) of the calves. Concurrent infections with rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp, bovine viral diarrhea virus, or other pathogens were identified in the remaining 135 calves. After elimination of cases involving autolyzed specimens or calves with chronic diarrhea, records of 11 calves with acute, severe cryptosporidiosis were identified in which Cryptosporidium sp was the only pathogen.

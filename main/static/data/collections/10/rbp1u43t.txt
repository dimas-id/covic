A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay was developed to detect and distinguish feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline bocavirus (FBoV) and feline astrovirus (FeAstV). Three pairs of primers were designed based on conserved regions in the genomic sequences of the three viruses and were used to specifically amplify targeted fragments of 237 bp from the VP2 gene of FPV, 465 bp from the NP1 gene of FBoV and 645 bp from the RdRp gene of FeAstV. The results showed that this mPCR assay was effective, because it could detect at least 2.25-4.04 × 10(4) copies of genomic DNA of the three viruses per μl, was highly specific, and had a good broad-spectrum ability to detect different genotypes of the targeted viruses. A total of 197 faecal samples that had been screened previously for FeAstV and FBoV were collected from domestic cats in northeast China and were tested for the three viruses using the newly developed mPCR assay. The total positive rate for these three viruses was 59.89% (118/197). From these samples, DNA from FPV, FBoV and FeAstV was detected in 73, 51 and 46 faecal samples, respectively. The mPCR testing results agreed with the routine PCR results with a coincidence rate of 100%. The results of this study show that this mPCR assay can simultaneously detect and differentiate FPV, FBoV and FeAstV and can be used as an easy, specific and efficient detection tool for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigation of these three viruses.

Needlestick and sharp instrument injuries are common in dental practice and present the risk of direct exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including hepatitis B virus. This cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the risk factors of injury and infection in three types of dental clinic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 274 male and 241 female dentists completed a structured questionnaire on demographic factors, compliance with infection control practices, and past exposure to injury and infection hazards. Dentists with more years of professional experience were significantly less likely to report having had an injury in the past (unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.48, 0.27-0.87 and 0.38, 0.16-0.89 for dentists with 10-20 years and for those with over 20 years of experience, respectively). Greater compliance with infection control procedures was associated with significantly fewer reports of previous infection (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.84). Experience of occupational safety training was not associated with a lower rate of injury or infection. Greater occupational safety knowledge and compliance with infection control management practices contribute to a reduced risk of injury and infection among dentists. More focused and specialized training on infection control and occupational safety is needed for all practicing dentists and dental students.

In this study, we evaluated the difference ot biological characteristics in the MERS-CoV infected mice model in prior to transduction with different dosage of human DPP4. Firstly, we transduced different dosage of DPP4 (high or low) into mice, and then challenged them with MERS-CoV in order to establish the model. After establishment of mice model, we observed the clinical signs of disease, virus replication, immunopathogenesis and antibody response. The results indicated that the infected mice showed typical pneumonia, virus replication, histological lesions, and neutralizing antibody production. Moreover, the high dosage group was superior to the low dosage group. Fourteen days after infection, the specific antibody to virus structural protein and neutralizing antibody were analyzed, the high dosage group induced higher level antibody. In summary, the MERS-CoV infected mice model were established prior transduction with DPP4, and the level of DPP4 influenced the clinical signs of disease, virus replication and antibody response in this model.

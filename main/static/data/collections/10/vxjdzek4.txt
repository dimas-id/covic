Cognitive dysfunction is a pervasive and disabling aspect of schizophrenia without adequate treatments. A recognized correlate to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is attenuated frontal theta oscillations. Neuromodulation to normalize these frontal rhythms represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy. Here, we evaluate whether noninvasive neuromodulation of the cerebellum in patients with schizophrenia can enhance frontal theta oscillations, with the future goal of targeting the cerebellum as a possible therapy for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. We stimulated the midline cerebellum using transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), a noninvasive transcranial direct current that can be delivered in a frequency-specific manner. A single 20-min session of theta frequency stimulation was delivered in nine patients with schizophrenia (cathode on right shoulder). Delta frequency tPCS was also delivered as a control to evaluate for frequency-specific effects. EEG signals from midfrontal electrode Cz were analyzed before and after cerebellar tPCS while patients estimated the passage of 3- and 12-s intervals. Theta oscillations were significantly larger following theta frequency cerebellar tPCS in the midfrontal region, which was not seen with delta frequency stimulation. As previously reported, patients with schizophrenia showed a baseline reduction in accuracy estimating 3- and 12-s intervals relative to control subjects, which did not significantly improve following a single-session theta or delta frequency cerebellar tPCS. These preliminary results suggest that single-session theta frequency cerebellar tPCS may modulate task-related oscillatory activity in the frontal cortex in a frequency-specific manner. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to evaluate whether multiple sessions delivered daily may have an impact on cognitive performance and have therapeutic implications for schizophrenia.

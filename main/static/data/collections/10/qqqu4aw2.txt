Despite its aggressive clinical course, leading to 6.4% fatality rate as of May 25, 2020 (https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html), COVID‐19 turned out to be only marginally aggressive in children. In a report from Lombardy, 18/88 COVID‐19 hospitalized adults (20%) had developed cutaneous manifestations: erythematous rash, widespread urticarial, and chickenpox‐like vesicles. Trunk was the main involved region. Itching was low or absent and usually lesions healed in few days. An unexpected outbreak of acute pseudochilblain skin lesions is being reported from different countries and related to COVID‐19.

Abstract Cell culture is a very versatile tool in the investigation of basic scientific and translation research questions. The advantage of using cell lines in scientific research is their homogeneity and associated reproducibility in data generated. This chapter introduces the principles behind the setup of a cell culture lab and the guidelines that ensure safety of the lab personnel as well as the cultured cells. It also addresses potential microbiological contaminants and how they can be avoided but also detected early. Since the selection of a particular cell line and specific cell culture conditions depends on the readout of the desired assay, this chapter will present a generalized overview of common mammalian cell culture components and properties that contribute to a suitable cell culture microenvironment. Consequently, this chapter outlines several techniques that are crucial for cell propagation and can be easily adapted to a broad number of cell types and experimental procedures.

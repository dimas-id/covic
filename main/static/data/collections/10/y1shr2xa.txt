BACKGROUND: Existing health disparities based on race and ethnicity in the United States are contributing to disparities in morbidity and mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey of American adults to assess similarities and differences by race and ethnicity groups with respect to COVID-19 symptoms, estimates of the extent of the pandemic, knowledge of control measures, and stigma. OBJECTIVE: Describe similarities and differences in COVID-19 symptoms, knowledge, and beliefs by race and ethnicity among adults in the US. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from March 27, 2020 through April 1, 2020. Participants were recruited on social media platforms and completed the survey on a secure, online survey platform. We used chi square tests to compare characteristics related to COVID-19 by race and ethnicity. Statistical tests were corrected using the Holm Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 1,435 (3.6% Asian, 11.0% non-Hispanic Black, 38.2% Hispanic, 40.9% non-Hispanic white, and 6.3% other or multiple races) participants completed the survey. Only one symptom (sore throat) was found to be different based on race and ethnicity (p = 0.003), which was less frequently reported by Asian (5.8%), non-Hispanic Black (5.7%), and other/multiple race (8.9%) participants compared to those who were Hispanic (18.1%) or non-Hispanic white (16.2%). Non-Hispanic white and Asian participants were more likely to estimate that the number of current cases was at least 100,000 (p = 0.004) and were more likely to answer all 14 COVID-19 knowledge scale questions correctly (Asian, 25.0%; non-Hispanic White, 30.7%) compared to Hispanic (19.7%) and non-Hispanic Black (15.8%) participants. CONCLUSIONS: We observed differences with respect to knowledge of appropriate methods to prevent infection by the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Deficits in knowledge of proper control methods might further exacerbate existing race/ethnicity disparities. Additional research is needed to identify trusted sources of information in Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black communities and effective messaging to disseminate correct COVID-19 prevention and treatment information.

BACKGROUND Perioperatively, unexpected hypothermia may cause adverse surgical outcomes. However, few studies have explored the efficacy of forced-air warming in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. AIM/OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of forced-air warming for preventing perioperative hypothermia and complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS A total of 127 participants undergoing laparoscopic thoracic or abdominal surgery were recruited between January and November 2015. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention (forced-air warming, n = 64) and control groups (passive insulation, n = 63). Oesophageal core temperature was measured during surgery, whilst tympanic core temperature was measured every 30 minutes preoperatively and in the postanaesthesia care unit. Levels of shivering and pain, amount of bleeding, and adverse cardiac events were measured before the transfer from the postanaesthesia care unit. The generalized estimating equation was used for data analysis. RESULTS The intervention group had better warming efficacy than the control group between 90 and 330 minutes during surgery. The intervention group had fewer complications than the control group in terms of intraoperative bleeding, time to rewarm to 36Â°C, pain levels, and shivering levels in the postanaesthesia care unit. CONCLUSION Forced-air warming can increase warming efficacy and reduce complications of perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

The previous chapters contain a great deal of medical, socioeconomic, demographic, epidemiologic, racial, ethnic, educational, and cultural information pertaining particularly to the black population of the United States, but it is admittedly somewhat incomplete. There is so much more that might have been included, but space and time limitations preclude a more comprehensive coverage of everything that touches upon the healthcare scene involving black Americans. In this brief postscript, I would like to suggest to the reader to consider a few more important issues affecting black health.

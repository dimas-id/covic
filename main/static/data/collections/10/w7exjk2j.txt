PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is a common rare/orphan disease that manifests itself early in the paediatric age. It imposes a considerable burden upon patients as well as on caregivers. Decisions regarding optimal care often rely on several medical instances working together as a team. METHODS: The authors reviewed the literature and supplied a description of their own clinical work at the NF1 centres. RESULTS: The experience of a multidisciplinary teamwork of three NF centres was summarized in order to enhance awareness for possible multidisciplinary ways of delivery of health and health-related aspects of care to NF1 patients. Both population-focused research centres and family-focused centres were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic rare diseases that start in the paediatric age mandate long-term follow-up most often by several disciplines. NF1 syndrome is an example of a multidisciplinary centre in order to enhance the quality of care.

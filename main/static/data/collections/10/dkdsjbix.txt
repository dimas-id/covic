Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Isatidis Radix, the sun-dried roots of Isatis indigotica Fortune ex Lindl., is one of the most usually used traditional Chinese medicines. For centuries, the herb has been employed in clinical practice for treatment of virus infection and inflammation. However, its active ingredients remain unclear. Aim of the study In the present study, the anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products, was firstly evaluated in vitro and in ovo and their mechanism of action was investigated. Materials and methods Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were isolated from Isatidis Radix by chiral separation. In vitro and in ovo evaluations were performed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonated eggs respectively, both using protocols including prevention, treatment and virus neutralization. Hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays were performed for further understanding of the antiviral mechanism. Results Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products all exhibited dose-dependent inhibition effect against influenza A virus (H1N1) without toxicity. The antiviral potency of the components was in the order of progoitrin > goitrin > epigoitrin > epiprogoitrin. The attachment of the constituents to the viral envelope conduced to the mechanism of their antiviral action without disturbing viral adsorption or budding. Conclusion Taken together, these results are promising for further development of Isatidis Radix and may contribute an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for influenza virus infection.

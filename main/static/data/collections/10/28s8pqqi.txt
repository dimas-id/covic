Due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) doctors were redeployed to unfamiliar clinical teams, where they would work at the level of a fully‐registered Foundation doctor. As undergraduate clinical teaching fellows, we were re‐purposed to rapidly produce a training programme to refresh the medical knowledge of doctors who were from a wide variety of non‐medical specialities and grades. Building on our experience of facilitating medical students, wedevised medical ward‐based scenarios in an informal Objective Structure Clinical Examination (OSCE) style to promote focused active learning and prompt further independent study.

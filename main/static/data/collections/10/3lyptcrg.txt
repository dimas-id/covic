OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SprayShield™ Adhesion Barrier in preventing and/or reducing postoperative adhesion during gynecological surgery. DESIGN This was a prospective, controlled, blinded, and randomized study. Patient blinding was performed intraoperatively. Subjects were randomly assigned to the SprayShield™ or the control group in a 2:1 ratio. SETTING The study was conducted at the Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, at the University Hospital for Gynecology in Germany. PATIENTS Fifteen patients participated in this study; nine patients were assigned to the SprayShield™ and six patients to the control group. INTERVENTIONS During first operation (FLL) in the SprayShield™ group, the agent was applied to all myomectomy suture lines. Patients in the control group did not receive any anti-adhesion treatment, only good surgical practice. A second-look laparoscopy (SLL) was performed 8-12 weeks after myomectomy to evaluate adhesion formation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Main outcome measures were incidence, severity, and extent of uterine adhesions. RESULTS No significant differences were found between the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS SprayShield™ is easy to use. No serious adverse event related to SprayShield™ was observed. Efficacy data are inconclusive regarding the performance of SprayShield™. Further studies are needed to better understand this performance.

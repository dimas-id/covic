AIM: To study the uptake, barriers and motivators of influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and pertussis vaccines among members of public in Arabian Gulf countries. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries’ residents. Data collected electronically through a smartphone app. The survey variables aimed to investigate the respondents’ awareness about vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and pertussis infections. Collected data concerning the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics, their perception toward vaccine uptake and the factors that motivate or demotivate them from taking influenza vaccine. The data were analysed statistically using the SPSS v.23.0. Differences in the characteristics of users from different countries were quantified through bivariate analysis. Other important variables and controlling factors were studied using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1812 respondents participated in the study. Their mean age was 27 years, 82% were male and 24% had ≥ 1 chronic diseases. The overall uptake of influenza vaccine was 17% (21% among “at risk” people) and ranged from 15% in Saudi Arabia to 24% in Qatar. Doctor’s advice (23%) and a perception of having low body immunity (21%) were the main cited reasons for being vaccinated, whereas unawareness about the vaccine (43%) was the main barrier. The overall uptake of pneumococcal vaccine in the preceding three years was 22% (25% among “at risk” individuals) and ranged from 0% in Bahrain to 79% in Kuwait. The overall uptake of pertussis vaccine was 16% (31% among “vulnerable” people), and ranged from 7% in Saudi Arabia to 75% in Oman. The overall uptake of meningococcal vaccine was 20% (29% among the “at risk” people) and ranged from 3% in Oman to 50% in Bahrain. CONCLUSION: The vaccination uptake across GCC countries is suboptimal and varies widely across the countries. Further research is needed to unearth the reasons and formulate action plan.

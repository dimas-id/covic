Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) produces an encephalitis in dogs that varies with viral strain. We have studied the cell tropisms of two virulent strains (CDV‐SH and CDV A75–17) and an attenuated strain, Rockborn (CDV‐RO), in cultured canine brain cells. Infected cell types were identified by double immunofluorescent labeling of specific cell markers and viral antigens. All viral strains studied produced infection in astrocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Neurons were not infected by CDV A75–17 but were rapidly infected by CDV‐SH and CDV‐RO. Multipolar oligodendrocytes were very rarely infected by any of the virus strains. In contrast, a morphologically distinct subset of bipolar oligodendrocytes were commonly infected by CDV‐SH and CDV‐RO. The kinetics of infection in the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and macrophages varied between strains. Both CDV‐SH and CDV‐RO rapidly infected bipolar oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages by 14 days post infection while infection by CDV A75–17 was delayed until after 28–35 days post infection. The differences in the growth kinetics and cell tropisms for some brain cells, exhibited by the three viral strains examined in this in vitro study, may relate to the different CNS symptoms that these strains produce in vivo.

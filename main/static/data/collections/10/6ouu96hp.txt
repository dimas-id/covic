BACKGROUND The current tendency to use increasingly less aggressive procedures has facilitated the development of new minimally invasive techniques. In this context, single-port (SP) access procedures can become an alternative to the conventional laparoscopic approach. METHODS A total of 22 morbidly obese patients were submitted to pure SP Roux-en-Y gastric bypass without additional ports. Selection for this approach was based on distance from the xiphoid to the umbilicus less than 28 cm, body mass index (BMI) lower than 50 kg/m(2), and preferably peripheral obesity. Access to the cavity was obtained through a single transverse, transumbilical incision, with placement of a SILS Port device. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 41 ± 8.98 years, and 95 % of the patients were women. The mean BMI of the series was 42.68 ± 2.28 kg/m(2), and the mean body weight was 111.34 ± 10.66 kg. Surgery was performed successfully in all cases through a transumbilical incision with a mean length of 26.68 ± 5.27 mm. The mean surgical time was 114.05 ± 21 min, and the mean hospital stay was 3.27 ± 1.01 days. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative deaths or complications occurred. The median postoperative BMI during a mean follow-up period of 12 months was 28 kg/m(2) (range, 18-35 kg/m(2)). The median weight loss was 39 kg, and the percentage loss of excess body weight was 86 %. In relation to improvement of the comorbidities, two of the three patients with arterial hypertension showed normalization of their blood pressure values. Likewise, the blood glucose levels were corrected in two of the three diabetic patients, as well as in the patient with altered fasting blood glucose. CONCLUSIONS Single-port Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery seems to be a safe, viable, and reproducible technique, but randomized studies involving larger patient series and longer follow-up periods are needed to compare the SP access and the multiple-port laparoscopic approach.

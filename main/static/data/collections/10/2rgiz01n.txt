OBJECTIVE: To explore the infection prevention and control strategy of bedside blood purification treatment in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isolation ward, and to evaluate the effect of infection prevention and control management measures. METHODS: We summarized and analyzed the clinical features, infection status, outcome and infection prevention and control measures of bedside blood purification treatment patients in COVID-19 isolation ward from February 8, 2020 to March 31, 2020, analyzed the COVID-19 cross-infection between the patients and medical staffs, and the blood-borne pathogens cross-infection situation between the patients, and analyzed the effect of bundle prevention and control measures in controlling the occurrence and spread of cross-infection. RESULTS: A total of 101 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in this COVID-19 isolation ward, of whom 10 patients (9.90%) received bedside blood purification treatment and the blood purification treatment method was continuous hemodialysis filtration (CVVHDF), and the 10 patients received 79 times of blood purification treatment in total. The prevention and control management measures adopted included divisional isolation, patient behavior isolation and patient placement, operator personal protection and hand hygiene, dialysis waste fluid disposal, isolation room air purification, object surfaces, medical devices and medical fabrics dis-infection management. There were no occurrence and spread of COVID-19 in the medical healthcare workers and blood-borne pathogens cross-infection in the patients. And all the twice throat swabs (two sampling interval > 1 day) of the medical staffs in COVID-19 virus nucleic acid test were negative. The 2 suspected COVID-19 patients' throat swab virus nucleic acid test and the COVID-19 IgG, IgM were always both negative, the chest CT showed no viral pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Bedside blood purification treatment in the COVID-19 isolation ward, the occurrence and spread of healthcare associated infection can be effectively controlled through effective infection prevention and control management, including divisional isolation, patient behavior isolation and patient placement, operator personal protection and hand hygiene, dialysis waste fluid disposal, isolation room's air purification, object surfaces, medical devices and medical fabrics disinfection, which can provide experience for diagnosis, treatment and prevention and control of patients in the respiratory infectious disease ward.

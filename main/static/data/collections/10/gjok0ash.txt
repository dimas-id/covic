BACKGROUND Secretory immunity is a major defence mechanism against infections at mucosal surfaces which are common in HIV infected patients. AIMS To analyse intestinal immunoglobulin production in HIV infection in comparison with that in saliva and serum. PATIENTS AND METHODS Immunoglobulin G (IgG), A (IgA), and M (IgM) concentrations were determined in supernatants of short term cultured duodenal biopsy samples, serum, and saliva from HIV infected patients (n = 28) and controls (n = 14) by radial immunodiffusion. RESULTS IgG was increased in the supernatants of short term cultured biopsy samples and saliva from HIV infected patients compared with controls (p < 0.01), but IgA and IgM levels were normal. In contrast, both IgG and IgA concentrations in serum were higher in HIV infected patients than in controls (p < 0.002). No correlation was found between IgA produced by duodenal biopsy specimens and serum IgA. CONCLUSION Abnormalities in mucosal immunoglobulin production in HIV infection were surprisingly small, indicating that specific secretory immunity rather than quantitative immunoglobulin production may be impaired. However, increased production of IgG could contribute to mucosal inflammation by complement activation. Our findings of normal mucosal IgA production and the lack of correlation between serum and mucosal IgA argues against an intestinal origin for the increased serum IgA levels in HIV infected patients.

Abstract Innate immunity is traditionally thought of as the first line of defense against pathogens that enter the body. It is typically characterized as a rather weak defense mechanism, designed to restrict pathogen replication until the adaptive immune response generates a tailored response and eliminates the infectious agent. However, intensive research in recent years has resulted in better understanding of innate immunity as well as the discovery of many effector proteins, revealing its numerous powerful mechanisms to defend the host. Furthermore, this research has demonstrated that it is simplistic to strictly separate adaptive and innate immune functions since these two systems often work synergistically rather than sequentially. Here, we provide a broad overview of innate pattern recognition receptors in antiviral defense, with a focus on the TRIM family, and discuss their signaling pathways and mechanisms of action with special emphasis on the intracellular antibody receptor TRIM21.

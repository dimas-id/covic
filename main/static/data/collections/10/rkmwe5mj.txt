The coronavirus epidemic that is spreading around our world poses a number of challenges for healthcare workers. The virus is spread by droplet infection and has a high virulence, so any intervention that generates airway aerosol formation potentially endangers the health of those involved in care. Severe forms of coronavirus infection are associated with progressive respiratory failure, for the treatment of which early endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are essential. There is an increased risk of airway aerosol formation during intubation, resulting in a high risk of infection for care personnel. In addition to the above, difficult airway insurance is relatively common in these patients. The aim of our article is to provide a practice-oriented overview of the specialties of airway insurance in patients infected with coronavirus, with particular reference to aspects of infection control and patient safety.

Abstract The Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has put the healthcare services all over the world into a challenging situation. The contagious nature of the disease and the respiratory failure necessitating ventilatory care of these patients has put extra burden on the intensive care unit (ICU) services. India has been no exception and by March 2020, the number of covid-19 patients started increasing in India. This article describes the measures taken and challenges faced in creating the ICU beds to cater to the anticipated load of patients in the state of Delhi, India. The main challenges faced among others were, estimating the number of ICU beds to be created; deciding the dedicated Covid hospitals; procurement of ventilators, personal protection equipment and other related material; mobilizing the human resource and their training; and providing isolated in-house accommodation to the staff on duty. The authors acknowledge and agree that the methodology proposed in this article is, but one way of dealing with this difficulty scenario, and that there could be other, perhaps better methods of dealing with such a problem.

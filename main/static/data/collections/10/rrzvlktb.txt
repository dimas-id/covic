Leukocyte infiltration is a hallmark of inflammatory responses. This process depends on the bacterial and host tissue-derived chemotactic factors interacting with G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors (GPCRs) expressed on the cell surface. Formylpeptide receptors (FPRs in human and Fprs in mice) belong to the family of chemoattractant GPCRs that are critical mediators of myeloid cell trafficking in microbial infection, inflammation, immune responses and cancer progression. Both murine Fprs and human FPRs participate in many patho-physiological processes due to their expression on a variety of cell types in addition to myeloid cells. FPR contribution to numerous pathologies is in part due to its capacity to interact with a plethora of structurally diverse chemotactic ligands. One of the murine Fpr members, Fpr2, and its endogenous agonist peptide, Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), control normal mouse colon epithelial growth, repair and protection against inflammation-associated tumorigenesis. Recent developments in FPR (Fpr) and ligand studies have greatly expanded the scope of these receptors and ligands in host homeostasis and disease conditions, therefore helping to establish these molecules as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

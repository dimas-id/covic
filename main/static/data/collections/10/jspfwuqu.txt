Abstract In recent years, authorities in Iran have introduced supporting policies for renewable energy resources but there is no comprehensive and updated survey from this perspective. The aim of this work is to give a comprehensive survey on the country background from energy outlook and its prominent policies for renewable energy resources. Due to the high CO2 emissions alongside with the high solar energy harvesting potential in Iran, We have presented a clear simulation on 20 kW and 1 MW grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants using RETScreen software to determine the environmental and economic aspects based on the net greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions reduction, the annual electricity exported to the grid, the cumulative cash flows, and the payback period for the initial investment. According to this simulation, the annual GHG emissions reduction and the annual electricity exported to the grid for 20 kW and 1 MW PV power plants are 22.06 tCO2, 1103 tCO2, 39 MWh, and 1953 MWh, respectively. From the economic outlook, based on the new feed-in tariff for power plants and the supposed initial costs, the payback period for the initial investments are between 3 and 4, and 5 years for 20 kW and 1 MW PV power plants, respectively.

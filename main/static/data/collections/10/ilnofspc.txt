BACKGROUND Wavelet transformed reconstructions of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion (wavelet-MRP) are a new and elegant way of visualizing vascularization. Wavelet-MRP maps yield a clear depiction of hypervascular tumor regions, as recently shown. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to elucidate a possible connection of the wavelet-MRP power spectrum in glioblastoma (GBM) with local vascularity and cell proliferation. METHODS For this IRB-approved study 12 patients (63.0+/-14.9y; 7m) with histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM were included. Target regions for biopsies were prospectively marked on tumor regions as seen on preoperative 3T MRI. During subsequent neurosurgical tumor resection 43 targeted biopsies were taken from these target regions, of which all 27 matching samples were analyzed. All specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for endothelial cell marker CD31 and proliferation marker Ki67 and correlated to the wavelet-MRP power spectrum as derived from DSC perfusion weighted imaging. RESULTS There was a strong correlation between wavelet-MRP power spectrum (median = 4.41) and conventional relative cerebral blood volume (median = 5.97 ml/100g) in Spearman's rank-order correlation (Îº = .83, p < .05). In a logistic regression model, the wavelet-MRP power spectrum showed a significant correlation to CD31 dichotomized to no or present staining (p = .04), while rCBV did not show a significant correlation to CD31 (p = .30). No significant association between Ki67 and rCBV or wavelet-MRP was found (p = .62 and p = .70, respectively). CONCLUSION The wavelet-MRP power spectrum derived from existing DSC-MRI data might be a promising new surrogate for tumor vascularity in GBM.

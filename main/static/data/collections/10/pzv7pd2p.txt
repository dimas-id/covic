Background India has reported more than 70,000 cases and 2000 deaths. Pune is the second city in the Maharashtra state after Mumbai to breach the 1000 cases. Total deaths reported from Pune were 158 with a mortality of 5.7%. To plan health services, it is important to learn lessons from early stage of the outbreak on course of the disease in a hospital setting. Objectives To describe the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak of COVID-19 in India from a tertiary care hospital. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study which included all admitted laboratory confirmed COVID19 cases from March 31, to April 24, 2020. The information was collected in a predesigned pro forma which included sociodemographic data, duration of stay, family background, outcome, etc., by trained staff after ethics approval. Epi Info7 was used for data analysis. Results Out of the total 197 cases, majority cases were between the ages of 31-60 years with slight male preponderance. Majority of these cases were from the slums. Breathlessness was the main presenting symptom followed by fever and cough. More than 1/5th of patients were asymptomatic from exposure to admission. The case fatality rate among the admitted cases was 29.4%. Comorbidity was one of the significant risk factors for the progression of disease and death (odds ratio [OR] = 16.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.0 - 40.1, P < 0.0001). Conclusion Mortality was higher than the national average of 3.2%; comorbidity was associated with bad prognosis.

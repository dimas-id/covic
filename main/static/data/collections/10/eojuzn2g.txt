The identification in 2003 of a coronavirus as the aetiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) intensified efforts to understand the biology of coronaviruses in general and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in particular. Rapid progress was made in describing the SARS-CoV genome, evolution and lifecycle. Identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an obligate cellular receptor for SARS-CoV contributed to understanding of the SARS-CoV entry process, and helped to characterize two targets of antiviral therapeutics: the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2. Here we describe the role of these proteins in SARS-CoV replication and potential therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing entry of SARS-CoV into target cells.

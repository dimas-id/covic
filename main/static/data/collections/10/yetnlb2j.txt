Chromone derivatives possess a spectrum of biological activities. Chromone has been recognized as a privileged structure for new drug invention and development. Substitution pattern of chromone scaffold determines different type of biological activities. The type, number and position of substituents connected to the chromone core play a vital role in determining pharmacological activities. In the present review, we have discussed new chromone derivatives as anticancer, anti-diabetic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and as anti-Alzheimer agents. This review deals with the chromone derivatives prepared by combining chromone molecule with various natural and synthetic pharmacophores and pharmacological activities presented by them. The main aim is to highlight the diversified pharmacological activities exhibited by chromone hybrid molecules during the last eight to ten years.

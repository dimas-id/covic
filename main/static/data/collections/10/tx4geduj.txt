BACKGROUND The morbidity linked to the use of sutures in inguinal hernioplasty is well known. Tissue adhesives may be an alternative, so as to be able to improve levels of postoperative comfort, but clinical experience using them is limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of cyanoacrylate as a substitute for sutures in the treatment of inguinal hernias. PATIENTS Randomized clinical trial in abdominal wall unit. A total of 208 patients were operated upon for inguinal hernias of which 102 were unilateral hernias via open surgery using the Lichtenstein technique, randomized to receive prolene sutures (n = 52) or n-hexyl-α-cyanoacrylate glue (n = 50) and 106 were patients with bilateral inguinal hernias operated upon via totally extraperitoneal laparoscopy and randomized to receive either tackers (n = 54) or glue (n = 52). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoints were pain and recurrence. Secondary endpoints were operating time, postoperative morbidity, pain, and analgesic consumption. RESULTS No morbidity associated with the use of the glue existed. The use of glue significantly reduced the mean of surgical time (12 minutes in open surgery, 13 minutes in laparoscopic surgery), pain, and analgesics consumption, both via the open and laparoscopic approaches (P < .001). After 1 year the adhesive did not change the recurrence rate in either of the approaches. The economic analysis shows potential yearly savings of 123 916.3 Euros. CONCLUSIONS Substituting sutures with glue (n-hexyl-α-cyanoacrylate) in open or laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty is safe with less postoperative pain and the same possibilities of recurrence.

Backgrounds. Since COVID-19 outbreak, various agents have been tested but no proven effective therapies have been identified. This has led to a lot of controversies among associated researches. Hence, in order to address the issue of using hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods. A thorough search was carried out to find relevant studies in MEDLINE, medRxiv, PubMed, Cochrane Database, China Academic Journals Full-text Database and Web of Science. Two investigators independently reviewed 274 abstracts and 23 articles. The trials which evaluated hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 were included for this systematic review. Two investigators assessed quality of the studies and data extraction was done by one reviewer and cross checked by the other. Results. Five trials involving 677 patients were included while conducting the meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin showed benefits in positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.95 [95% CI,0.19 to 19.73] and a reduction in progression rate (OR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.58 to 1.37]), but without demonstrating any statistical significance. This systematic review has also suggested a possible synergistic effect of the combination therapy which included hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. However, the use of hydroxychloroquine alone was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. The use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19 patients, seems to be effective. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has shown synergic effects. However, mortality rate was increased when the treatment was conducted with hydroxychloroquine.

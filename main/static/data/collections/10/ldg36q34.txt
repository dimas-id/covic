An immunohistochemistry technique was developed for the diagnosis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The technique was tested on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues from piglets naturally infected with PEDV. Five different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were tested in this study. PEDV antigen was consistently detected in the PLP (4% paraformaldehyde, 100 mM L-lysine dihydrochloride, 10 mM sodium m-periodate in phosphate-buffered saline)-fixed PEDV-infected Vero cells or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues from piglets naturally infected with PEDV. The C9-2-2 MAb gave the strongest reactivity and least background staining, detecting 10 of 10 infected pigs. The positive reaction was cytoplasmic. Positive enterocytes were distributed over the tip and along the sides of atrophied or fused villi in the jejunum and ileum. Positive-staining cells were not detected in the crypts. No staining was observed in cecum and colon. No positive cells were observed when the C9-2-2 MAb was reacted with the tissue sections from noninfected piglets or from transmissible gastroenteritus virus (TGEV)- and rotavirus-infected piglets. The selected anti-PEDV MAbs tested on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections are useful for diagnosis when virus isolation is not available. This method would be of particular value in countries where both PEDV and TGEV are epizootic and would aid in differentiating between PEDV and TGEV infection.

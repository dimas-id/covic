OBJECTIVE Primary stenting is a well-established treatment option for femoropopliteal arterial disease. However, there is a paucity of data concerning the performance of this modality at ≥5 years. This study evaluated the long-term clinical and radiologic outcomes of primary stent therapy in patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease. METHODS A prospective data collection and analysis was conducted in patients undergoing primary stent placement in femoropopliteal lesions between September 2006 and September 2007. The EverFlex (Medtronic/Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) bare-metal stent was used. The primary outcome of this study was the primary patency rate. Secondary outcomes were secondary patency rate, amputation-free-survival (AFS), and freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR). A Cox regression analysis identified risk factors for the primary and the secondary measure outcomes. RESULTS Included were 89 patients (102 stents). The prevalence of critical limb ischemia was 34% (n = 30). The initial angiography revealed a TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease C/D lesion in 31 patients (35%). Occlusions were present in 49 patients (55%), and the mean lesion length was 116 ± 33 mm. Popliteal artery disease was present in 39 treated limbs (35%). The primary patency rate at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years was 73%, 64%, 47%, and 33% respectively. At 7 years, secondary patency rate was 67%, freedom from TLR was 47%, and the AFS was 73%. Cox regression analysis revealed a decreased AFS among diabetic patients (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-6.28; P = .03), whereas secondary endovascular interventions showed a protective effect for AFS (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65; P = .01). Popliteal artery disease was identified as independent risk factor for secondary interventions (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.05-4.06; P = .04) and TLR (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.03-3.83; P = .04). Critical limb ischemia was associated with an increased incidence of surgical conversion owing to endovascular treatment failure (HR, 5.46; 95% CI, 2.44-12.17; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS This study found primary stenting was associated with acceptable clinical and radiologic long-term outcomes. Diabetes was associated with poor AFS, and popliteal artery involvement correlated with an increased need for reinterventions. AFS was better among patients undergoing secondary procedures.

In this paper we wish to report our clinical experience with a new heparin-coated dialysis catheter with a symmetric tip. Over a 16-month period, 60 heparin-coated Tal Palindrome catheters were placed in 57 patients. Catheter patency, catheter-related complications, and reasons for catheter removal were recorded. The patient's initial cause of end-stage renal disease, underlying diseases, and site of access were recorded as well. Patients were specifically followed for development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Patient ages were 34-91 (average 66). Fifty-four percent of patients had a history of diabetes. Sixty catheters were placed for a total of 5353 catheter-days. The average catheter indwell time was 107 days (range of 2-381 days). Catheter-related infection occurred in 6 patients over the study period, with a rate of 1.12/1000 catheter-days. Bacteremia occurred in 3 patients with a rate of 0.56/1000 catheter-days. Six catheters were removed or exchanged due to malfunction. There was no incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Initial clinical experience with the heparin-coated Tal Palindrome hemodialysis catheter demonstrated safe, reliable use, and low infection rates.

The stability of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was determined at 20째C--40% relative humidity (RH); 30째C--30% RH and 30째C--80% RH. MERS-CoV was more stable at low temperature/low humidity conditions and could still be recovered after 48 hours. During aerosolisation of MERS-CoV, no decrease in stability was observed at 20째C--40% RH. These data suggest the potential of MERS-CoV to be transmitted via contact or fomite transmission due to prolonged environmental presence.

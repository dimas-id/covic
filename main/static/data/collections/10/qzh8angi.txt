We have developed a new laparoscopic rectal transection method via umbilical incision using Endo GIA™ Radial Reload with a Tri-Staple™ Technology (RR) (Covidien, New Haven, CT) stapler. A 65-year-old woman with a rectal carcinoid tumor underwent a laparoscopic low anterior resection. We successfully performed a rectal transection via umbilical incision using this stapler. The postoperative course was uneventful. The possibility of a rectal transection via umbilical incision was demonstrated in the current case. However, further studies are needed to confirm the safety and feasibility of this procedure.

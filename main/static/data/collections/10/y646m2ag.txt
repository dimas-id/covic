This report is based on data (up to 31 March 2004) from the Renal Registry of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, and accounts for 90-95% of all patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the territory. Patients receiving RRT in the private sector are not included in this report. The number of patients receiving RRT was 6,054 (889 per million population [pmp]), of whom 51.6% (3,123, 451 pmp) were receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD), 10.9% (662, 97 pmp) hemodialysis (HD), and 37.5% (2,269, 334 pmp) had functioning kidney transplants. The net increase from the previous year in the number of patients receiving RRT was 3.1%. The incidence of end-stage renal failure in patients undergoing RRT was 954 (140 pmp). The median ages of existing and new patients receiving RRT were 55 and 56 years, respectively. There was a trend towards an increasing number of elderly dialysis patients. Diabetes was the third major cause of renal failure among existing RRT patients and the most common cause of renal failure in new cases. The rate of serologic positivity for hepatitis B infection in RRT patients was 9.68%, while that for hepatitis C infection was 3.28%. In Hong Kong, most patients were put on PD when RRT was required. Of all patients on dialysis, 83% were on PD, of whom 94.8% were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Most CAPD patients were on disconnect systems. HD was used in 17.5% of all patients on dialysis. Of the 2,269 patients with functioning kidney transplants, 836 (36.8%) were transplanted in Hong Kong. Of these, 495 (59.2%) had undergone cadaveric kidney transplantation. Of all patients receiving RRT, 30% were receiving erythropoietin. For the year ending 31 March 2004, the annual crude mortality rate for all RRT was 10% (15.3% for PD, 13% for HD, and 1.9% for transplantation). The major causes of death were infection, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular accident. The 1- and 5-year survival rates for patients with kidney transplantation performed in Hong Kong between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2003 were 98.6% and 96.5%, respectively, for living related kidney transplants, and 96.1% and 91.2%, respectively, for cadaveric kidney transplants. The 1- and 5- year graft survival rates were 91.1% and 86.1% (death censored) and 90.5% and 85.6% (death not censored) for living related kidney transplants, and 89% and 83% (death censored) and 86% and 79% (death not censored) for cadaveric kidney transplants. The overall peritonitis rate for all chronic PD systems for the year ending 31 March 2004 was one episode per 27.7 months.

Emerging diseases could have a devastating impact on international trade unless there is a change in the traditional approach to disease control and new holistic prevention and control strategies are adopted. The impact that emerging diseases will have on international trade will depend on several factors, such as the nature of the pathogen, the degree of co-ordination and integration between Veterinary Services and Public Health authorities, the ability to rapidly detect and respond to a disease appearance, and the existing trade relationship between countries. Strategies to control emerging diseases will be more effective if competent authorities and veterinary infrastructures in particular, integrate their public and animal health objectives into a single strategy. The co-ordinating role of international standard setting organisations such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) will be crucial. This paper discusses the events contributing to the appearance and spread of new emerging diseases and examines the changing roles of Veterinary Services and international organisations. Reference is also made to measures that can be taken towards minimising potential trade disruptions caused by the appearance of an emerging disease.

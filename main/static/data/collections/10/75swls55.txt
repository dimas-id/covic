INTRODUCTION There is evidence that patients are admitted to the hospital with low-acuity medical issues, though delineation of the underlying factors has not been comprehensively explored. This scoping review will provide an overview of the existing literature regarding factors outside of acute medical illness that influence hospitalisation of adults. The review will also seek to provide a review of common language and definitions used in the research on this phenomenon. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The scoping review framework, outlined by Arksey and O'Malley and expanded on by Levac et al, will be used as the basis for this study. A systematic search of seven databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts and Social Science Abstracts) will be conducted to identify existing literature followed by a standardised two-phase, two-reviewer process to select relevant papers for inclusion. Relevant studies will investigate adult non-psychiatric hospital admission plus at least one additional factor unrelated to medical acuity. Details of the work will be extracted, including the terminology used and perspectives included. An assessment of methodological quality will be performed using a tool designed for mixed-methods systematic review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The scoping review protocol delineates a transparent and rigorous review process, the results of which will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and presentation at relevant local or national meetings. The study does not require ethics approval as the data will be accumulated through the review of published, peer-reviewed literature and grey literature.

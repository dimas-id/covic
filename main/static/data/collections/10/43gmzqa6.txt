a mathematical model depicting the spread of covid-19 epidemic and implementation of population covid-19 intervention in Italy. The model has 8 components leading to system of 8 ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we investigate the model using the concept of fractional differential operator. A numerical method based on the Lagrange polynomial was used to solve the system equations depicting the spread of COVID-19. A detailed investigation of stability including reproductive number using the next generation matrix, and the Lyapunov were presented in detail. Numerical simulations are depicted for various fractional orders.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic gastric greater curvature plication (LGGCP) is a new restrictive weight loss procedure. METHODS Between February 2011 and June 2012, 57 patients underwent LGGCP. Thirteen had it associated with a lap band and were excluded from the study. Data was collected through routine follow-up. Demographics, complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) were determined. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent LGGCP, 40 women and 4 men with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18-72), a mean body mass index of 38 kg/m(2) (range, 35-46). Comorbidities included 2 diabetes mellitus, 11 hypertension, 8 hyperlipidaemia, and 8 obstructive sleep apnea. The mean operative time was 106 min (range, 60-180) and mean duration of hospital stay was 18 h (range, 12-168). Operative complications included one subphrenic abscess, one gastrogastric hernia, and one acute respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty patients experienced strong restriction with nausea and vomiting for the first 10 days (79.5 %). Eleven patients (25.0 %) came back with intractable nausea and vomiting, and were hospitalized, or had their hospital stay prolonged. Four patients needed early reversal of gastric plication (9 %). There was no postoperative death. The mean postoperative % EWL was 30.6 % (n = 40), 57.0 % (n = 24), 50.7 % (n = 13) at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LGGCP yields an acceptable weight loss compared to other restrictive procedures, but with a higher readmission rate for postoperative nausea and vomiting, or even reversal of plication. We advocate more studies to evaluate safety and effectiveness.

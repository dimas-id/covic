Since Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in December 2019, the disease has rapidly evolved into a pandemic that threatens societies around the world. As soon as the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified and its genome sequence determined, a laboratory diagnosis based on nucleic acid amplification technologies was quickly established and has played essential roles in the confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. Serological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is becoming available for complementary diagnosis, identification of convalescent plasma, and epidemiologic studies. Additional laboratory biochemical tests, including monitoring the change in blood cells, blood gas, coagulation, liver function, cardiac markers, and inflammatory responses such as cytokine levels in plasma, are also critical in combating COVID-19. Nevertheless, with overwhelming numbers of patients and potentially large numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical laboratories encounter enormous challenges in diagnostic approaches that can rapidly and accurately identify infected persons. Strategies that can effectively detect disease progression in order to stratify patients for appropriate care, and that can thereby prevent exacerbation of the disease, are urgently needed. This review discusses the laboratoryâ€™s role and challenges in combating COVID-19.

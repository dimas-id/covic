Surfactant treatment is one of the milestones of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treatment in preterm infants, but it has been also demonstrated to exert consistent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Exogenous natural surfactant contains antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nonenzymatic antioxidant molecules, such as plasmalogens and polyunsaturated phospholipids (PUPLs). Moreover, surfactant can contribute to the modulation of intra-alveolar inflammatory processes through the regulation effect of the surfactant A (SP-A) and B (SP-B) proteins. Although less extensively investigated, these functions may contribute to the efficacy of exogenous surfactant administration in preterm neonates with RDS.

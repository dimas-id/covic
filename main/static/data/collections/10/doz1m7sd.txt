Background: Orthoses for individuals with stroke is considered an integral part of the neurorehabilitation process. However, there are no universal guidelines to determine the initiation period, duration, or type of orthosis for stroke patients. Objectives: For this study, we systematically reviewed the evidence surrounding the use of orthoses for stroke-related upper extremity deficits. Methods: Medical librarians searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Health Technology Assessment Database, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and OTSeeker using subject headings and keywords related to upper extremities, orthoses, and stroke. The resulting articles were evaluated for inclusion by the systematic review team. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were appraised for content and quality using the "Evaluation Guidelines for Rating the Quality of an Intervention Study" (EQIS). Results: 14 studies were included, with the mean score of 31.29 (out of 48) for the EQIS using an ordinal scale with a range of 23-43.6 studies produced significant outcomes with effect sizes ranging from d = .52 (wrist flexion PROM) to d = 9.02 (patient satisfaction with orthosis). Conclusion: Future studies should aim to utilize homogenous outcome measures while exploring variability in dosage and level of upper extremity impairment upon initiation. Additionally, universal guidelines for initiation period, duration, and type of orthosis for patients post-stroke need to be established.

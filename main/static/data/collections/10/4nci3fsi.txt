PURPOSE: The primary purpose of the current study was to investigate and summarize the registered trials that listed COVID-19 as the primary condition. METHODS: We performed a search on ClinicalTrials.gov using the independent search terms COVID-19, SARS, and SARS COV2, and then downloaded the data file on March 23, 2020. All trials were downloaded to a csv file and searched for appropriateness. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 124 (45.2%) registered trials were listed as recruiting. The majority (85, 68.5%) classified their study as interventional, 37 (29.8%) classified as observational and one (0.8%) each classified their study as either expanded access:individual patients | treatment IND/Protocol or expanded access:intermediate-size population | treatment IND/Protocol. There were 67 (54.0%) of the trials that listed drug as the type of study. Immunological and antiviral trials were the greatest, representing approximately 30% and 21%, respectively. When immunological and antiviral drugs were used alone or in combination, they represented 41.9% and 34.4%, respectively. Anti-malarial agents are represented in 7.5% of trials. Approximately 14% of trials involved Traditional Chinese Medicine. The aforementioned study agents used solely or in combination represented approximately 80% of therapeutic approaches to COVID19. CONCLUSION: There was a large and quick response on ClinicalTrials.gov to the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of the registered trials are currently recruiting new patients, while some will begin in the near future. Specific potential experimental therapies, including dosing and monitoring, might be found by reviewing content. Within clinicaltrials.gov, patients, family members, health care professionals and researchers can search and find ongoing and future trials for COVID-19.

This chapter discusses how rapid development in China has caused a number of environmental hazards, food insecurity, and communicable health diseases. How the Chinese government has tackled pollution and major epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and airborne diseases in major cities, and how Hong Kong has handled its major epidemics, are analyzed in depth. Also, non-communicable disease emerging from the change of lifestyle in China will be discussed. Health Communication Policies and Planning in China will be assessed with recommendations and lessons learned from China and Hong Kong. Political-economic policies will be considered together with health communication policies regarding communicable and non-communicable diseases.

The localization of biliary glycoprotein (BGP) and its mRNA in normal colonic mucosa was studied by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. BGP mRNA was confined to columnar epithelial cells and expressed abundantly in the superficial mature cells and at low levels in differentiating cells in the upper crypts. Epithelial expression of BGP coincided with that of BGP mRNA. Ultrastructurally, BGP was localized to microfilaments of the fuzzy coat of the columnar cells at the luminal surface and the upper crypts. Additionally, BGP was found in cryptal caveolated cells. The results are consistent with primary transcriptional regulation of BGP production and suggest that BGP synthesis is controlled by the degree of cytodifferentiation. The fuzzy-coat localization of BGP implies a role in nonspecific defense mechanisms against pathogens.

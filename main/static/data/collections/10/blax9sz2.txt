Epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) now have >100,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by quantitative RT-PCR methods, but the capacity of quantitative RT-PCR methods is limited by their requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Herein, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, were developed and evaluated. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human coronaviruses was not observed. A colorimetric detection method was adapted for this RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.

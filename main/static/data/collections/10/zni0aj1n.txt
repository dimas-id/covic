EEC staff were provided with rapidly changing personal PPE guidance by Public Health England (PHE) with specific subspecialty advice from the British Emergency Eye Care Society (BEECS) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) UK during the COVID19 pandemic. BEECS undertook a baseline survey of its members after the initial response from the RCOphth 16/3/20 mirroring Public Health England (PHE) advice and a follow- up survey after the guidance was updated on 9/4/20. A combined total of 84 responses were received. Improvements after RCOphth changes between the two surveys from hospital respondents showed increases in temperature screening (13%), scrub use (34%), use of aprons (31%), masks (4%), eye protection (35%), gloves (25%) and slit lamp guard (1%). Our findings demonstrate a positive and significant adaptation of PPE in response to change in guidance published by PHE, RCOphth and BEECS between 16/3/20 and 11/4/20. The COVID19 pandemic has rapidly taken over the normal activity of Ophthalmic departments creating unprecedented challenges. Following initial confusion and vulnerability expressed by EEC professionals to PPE guidance, most Trusts appear to have adapted and are doing similar things. The response has been swift and effective as a result of good team work and early advice from BEECS and the RCOphth. On the whole, management teams are listening.

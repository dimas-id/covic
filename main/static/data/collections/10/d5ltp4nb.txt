OBJECTIVES The aim of the study is to determine the results of our initial experience of 32 cases who underwent single incision total laparoscopic hysterectomy MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-two patients who underwent transumbilical single incision total laparoscopic hysterectomy between March 2009 and February 2011 were reviewed retrospectively at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey Articulating and rigid instruments, 30 degrees 10 mm telescope, SILS port and advanced bipolar and mechanical energy modalities were used during the procedure. Duration of surgery length of hospital stay mean blood loss and postoperative complications were assessed. RESULTS Mean age of patients and mean operation time were 48 years (ranged 42-55) and 108 minutes (ranged 80-180), respectively. In all cases vaginal cuffs were closed with either intracorporeal or extracorporeal separate sutures. There were no intraoperative complications. All patients were discharged within 48 hours postoperatively The mean length of hospital stay and mean blood loss were as 1.6 days (range 1-2) and 45 ml (range 30-100), respectively CONCLUSIONS Total laparoscopic hysterectomy performed through transumbilical single incision is technically feasible and safe. Development of advanced flexible instrumentation and visualization platform may facilitate this new operative approach.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and early postoperative outcomes of hysterectomies and salpingo-oophorectomies using transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES). MATERIALS AND METHODS The women undergoing vNOTES hysterectomies and salpingo-oophorectomies at a tertiary referral medical center between April 2016 and April 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. In all of the vNOTES procedures, a handmade glove port system comprised of a glove-wound retractor NOTES port was used. RESULTS Thirteen patients underwent gynecological procedures with benign indications via vNOTES. Of the 13 operations, 6 of the patients had salpingo-oophorectomies and 7 had hysterectomies, and all of the surgeries were performed by the same surgeon (Dr. Ahmet Kale). No conversion to a conventional laparoscopy or even a laparotomy was needed in any of the procedures. The mean operation time was 73.14 min in the hysterectomy patients and 40.8 min in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. The mean drop in the hemoglobin (Hb) level was 1.4 g/dl in the hysterectomy patients and 1.6 g/dl in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. For these patients undergoing vNOTES, the mean postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score at 6 h was 4.38 and at 24 h it was 0.62. There were no intraoperative complications in any of the cases. The mean length of the hospital stay was 1.8 days in the hysterectomy patients and 1.5 days in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. CONCLUSION The vNOTES procedure overcomes the surgical and technical difficulties of conventional vaginal surgery by incorporating the advantages of endoscopic surgery. Moreover, vNOTES uses inexpensive, reusable, handmade conventional laparoscopic instruments and avoids those problems related to abdominal wall incisions and trocar-related complications. Overall, this procedure results in high patient satisfaction, cosmetic advantages, and decreased postoperative pain.

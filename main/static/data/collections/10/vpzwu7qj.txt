Intranasal recombinant interferon-alpha 2b (rIFN-alpha 2b) protects against natural colds due to rhinoviruses, but apparently not against those caused by viruses. Because rIFN-beta serine17 (rIFN-beta ser) appears less active than rIFN-alpha 2b in preventing natural rhinovirus colds, we compared the two IFNs in two in vitro assays against selected respiratory viruses. In a yield reduction assay, both IFNs had comparable activity against rhinovirus types 39 and 1A and coronavirus 229E, which were inhibited by 90% or more at IFN concentrations of 10(-11) to 10(-10) gram of protein/ml (approximately 2-20 IU/ml). Similar activities were observed with rIFN-beta ser against rhinoviruses isolated from clinical specimens. At concentrations of 10(-9) gram protein/ml, both IFNs inhibited the growth of influenza A and parainfluenza viruses, but not of adenovirus or respiratory syncytial virus in the cell culture systems tested. Thus, the different clinical protection conferred by rIFN-alpha 2b and rIFN-beta ser in studies of natural rhinovirus colds are not accounted for by differences in their in vitro activity against these viruses, and other explanations must be found.

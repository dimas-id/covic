Cisplatin derivatives containing tilorone and a tilorone derivative were synthesized and characterized employing IR analysis, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and chain length. The polymeric cisplatin derivatives prevent growth of four transformed cell lines, L929, 143, Vero, and BS-C-1 and effectively inhibit four viruses including the DNA viruses; herpes simplex-1, vaccinia, and Varicella zoster, and the RNA virus, reovirus in the micrograms/mL range. The tilorone polymers display activity against both transformed cells and DNA and RNA viruses at biologically important concentrations.

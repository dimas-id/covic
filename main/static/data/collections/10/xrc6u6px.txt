Rotating and permanent night shiftwork schedules typically result in acute and sometimes chronic sleep deprivation plus acute and sometimes chronic disruption of the circadian time structure. Immune system processes and functionalities are organized as circadian rhythms, and they are also strongly influenced by sleep status. Sleep is a vital behavioral state of living beings and a modulator of immune function and responsiveness. Shiftworkers show increased risk for developing viral infections due to possible compromise of both innate and acquired immunity responses. Short sleep and sleep loss, common consequences of shiftwork, are associated with altered integrity of the immune system. We discuss the possible excess risk for COVID-19 infection in the context of the common conditions among shiftworkers, including nurses, doctors, and first responders, among others of high exposure to the contagion, of sleep imbalance and circadian disruption.Abbreviations: ACE2: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; APC: Antigen﻿-presenting ﻿cells; CCL: Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand; CD+: ﻿Adhesion molecule expression; COVID-19: 2019 coronavirus disease; DCs: Dendritic cells; GH: Growth hormone; HPA: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; HSF: Heat shock factor; HSP70: Heat shock protein 70; HSP90: Heat shock protein 90; IL: Interleukin; INFγ: Interferon-gamma; LT/LB: T/B lymphocytes; MHC: Major histocompatibility complex; NK: Natural ﻿killer; RAAS: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; SARS: ﻿Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SCN: Suprachiasmatic nucleus;SD: Sleep deprivation; SNS: Sympathetic nervous system; Th1/Th2: T helper lymphocytes 1/2; TLR2/TLR4: Toll-like receptor 2/4; TNF-α: Tumor ﻿necrosis ﻿factor alpha; VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor.

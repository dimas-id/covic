We conducted two surveys to evaluate the health-seeking behaviors of individuals with acute respiratory infections (ARI) during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. Among 351 participants reporting ARI (10.3%, 351/3,411), 36.5% sought medical assistance. Children were more likely to seek medical assistance than other age groups (66.1% vs. 28.0%-35.1%).

AIM The aim of this study was to compare the safety, efficacy and oncologic results in the low rectal resection with total mesorectal excision with radiofrequency (Ligasure™, Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) in laparoscopic surgery. METHODS From July 2005 to December 2008, 227 patients underwent colorectal resection for cancer at S. Martino Hospital in Genoa. Sixty-one patients underwent curative rectal resection for mid or low rectal cancer using Ligasure™ device applied on smaller vessels and for the execution of total mesorectal excision. Forty-six patients underwent open laparotomy (OL), 15 laparoscopic surgery. There were no differences concerning demographics data and diagnosis, but only regarding staging (P=0.009). Primary goal was to evaluate major complications, operating time, hospital stay, distal margin of the tumor and number of nodes harvested in specimen. Secondary goal was to assess the average time of survival in the short period. RESULTS The mean operative times were shorter in the OL group (188 vs. 246 min) overall. This difference was significant (P=0.004). In particular two parameters of specimens were analyzed: the total number of nodes and distal clearing from cancer, excluding abdominoperineal resection. An average number of 16.6 nodes in the OL group and 13.9 in the VL group (P=ns) were detected; mean distal clearing in the OL group was 30.7 mm and 48.1 mm in the VL group (P=ns). There were no differences concerning major complications in either group. The hospital stay in the VL group was shorter than in the OL group, but the differences were not significant. CONCLUSION The Ligasure™ device does not reduce operating time in laparoscopy rectal cancer resection but it allows to get correct oncologic results in patients submitted to total mesorectal excision.

In this work, we consider a special kind of equivalence relations, which are called local congruences. Specifically, local congruences are equivalence relations defined on lattices, whose equivalence classes are convex sublattices of the original lattices. In the present paper, we introduce an initial study about how the set of equivalence classes provided by a local congruence can be ordered.

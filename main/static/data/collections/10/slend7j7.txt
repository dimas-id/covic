BACKGROUND: Eravacycline (ERV) is a fluorocycline being developed for the treatment of serious infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. The PK of ERV in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) or hepatic impairment (HI) were investigated. METHODS: Two multi-center studies were completed; one in subjects with ESRD and one in subjects with mild, moderate or severe HI based upon Child-Pugh scoring. Each included a cohort of healthy subjects (HS) matched by gender, age and BMI. A single IV dose of 1.5 mg/kg ERV was administered. PK parameters were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods and within study comparisons of PK for the ESRD and HI subjects were made with HS. RESULTS: The following comparative AUC(inf) and C(max) values for ERV were observed: CONCLUSION: Following a single IV dose of ERV, the systemic exposures in subjects with ESRD and mild or moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those observed in HS. The 2-fold increase in AUC(inf) observed in subjects with severe HI did not result in increased adverse events. Therefore, no dose adjustment should be required when ERV is given to subjects with either renal or hepatic impairment.

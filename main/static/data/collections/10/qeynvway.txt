Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) can rarely complicate infections. We wish to report a case of simultaneous presentation of COVID-19 disease and warm AIHA. A 46 year old female with a medical history of congenital thrombocytopenia not on therapy presented with dyspnea and cough to the Emergency Department. She was found to have pneumonia after a CT chest revealed a dense left upper lobe consolidation with minimal surrounding ground glass opacities and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. (Figure) She had normal vital signs and pulse oximetry on ambient air. She was initiated on azithromycin 500mg day one then 250 mg daily and discharged home.

Abstract The manufacturing of turbomachinery components for the aerospace sector is an important topic in machining research. Aeroengine manufacturing companies forecast increasing levels of design complexity and demand in the following years. Key elements are the Integral Bladed Rotor (IBR) parts, such as impellers and blade-disks. Despite advances in five-axis machining, manufacturing a reliable and efficient IBR component is still a challenge. In this work, the mechanics of the milling process with barrel-shape cutter is studied. These recently developed tools offer a potential advantage for a productive, chatter-free, high-performance machining of IBR parts. In this work, the cutting forces model is developed for this type of tools, then the model is verified in inclined milling operations.

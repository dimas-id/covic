Introduction Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring provides an objective, non-invasive measurement of the level of consciousness in a sedated patient. Aim In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate the hypothesis that risk of respiratory depression could be reduced and the desired level of sedation with minimal doses of propofol could be achieved by using BIS monitoring in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Material and methods Sixty patients in the ASA 1-2 category, who were scheduled for an ERCP with sedation, were randomly divided into two groups. The procedure was performed, and sedation was administered so that the patient's Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) would be 4-5 in the first group (group 1) and the patient's BIS value would be 65-75 in the second group (group 2). Cardiopulmonary complications, the total duration of the procedure, and the total amount of propofol administered were recorded. Results The mean SpO2 measurements at the third minute, fifth minute, and 10th minute were higher in the BIS group (p < 0.001) (p < 0.05). The mean number of respirations during the third, fifth, 10th, and 15th minute of sedation was significantly higher in the RSS group than in the BIS group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of recovery time, total propofol amount, and additional doses of bolus propofol. Conclusions BIS monitoring during sedation with propofol for ERCP did not reduce total propofol use, but it may be an efficient guide for the timing of additional dose administration, which could reduce the risk of respiratory depression, and it could be used safely as an objective method in the follow-up of level of sedation.

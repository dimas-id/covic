With the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with COVID-19, a high-speed and convenient detection technology should be at the forefront of medical care worldwide. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of GeneSoCÂ®, a compact, high-speed reciprocal flow RT-qPCR system, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our results support the use of this system for the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2. This approach can contribute to the strategic selection of initial management strategies for patients with COVID-19.

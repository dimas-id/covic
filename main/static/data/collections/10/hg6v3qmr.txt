Significant evidence has accumulated to support the hypothesis that hippocampal region CA1 operates as an associative mismatch detector (e.g., Hasselmo et al., 1995; Lörincz & Buzsáki, 2000; Lisman & Otmakhova, 2001; Vinogradova, 2001; Meeter et al., 2004; Lisman & Grace, 2005; Kumaran & Maguire, 2007; Duncan et al., 2009; Schiffer et al., 2012). CA1 compares predictive synaptic signals from CA3 with synaptic signals from EC3, which reflect actual sensory inputs. The new CA1 pyramidal model presented here shows that the distal-proximal segregation of synaptic inputs from EC3 versus CA3, along with other biophysical features, enable such pyramids to serve as comparators that switch output encoding from a brief burst, for a match, to prolonged tonic spiking, for a mismatch. By including often-overlooked features of CA1 pyramidal neurons, this new model allows simulation of pharmacological effects that can eliminate either the match (phasic mode) response or the mismatch (tonic mode) response. These simulations reveal that dysfunctions can arise from either too much or too little ACh stimulation of the muscarinic receptors that control KCNQ channels. Additionally, a dysfunction caused by administration of an NMDA antagonist could be rescued by simultaneous administration of a KCNQ channel agonist, such as retigabine.

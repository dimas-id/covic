BACKGROUND: The information regarding viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics in hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in central Fujian is limited. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics of ARTI in hospitalized children admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. METHODS: Cohort of 386 hospitalized children (31 days to 15 years) diagnosed with ARTI admitted to the Department of Pediatrics from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples on the day of hospitalization were tested for 11 viruses via a GeXP‐based multiplex‐PCR assay. The viral profiles and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall positive rate of the samples was 43.26% (167/386). Among the 167 positive samples, 134 (80.24%, 134/167) had a single virus and 33 (19.76%, 33/167) had multiple viruses. There was a significant difference in the frequency of single vs mixed infections among positive samples (80.24% vs 19.76%; χ (2) = 122.168, P = .000) as well as among the total examined samples (34.72% vs 8.55%; χ (2) = 77.945, P = .000). Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus (17.36%, 67/386), followed by influenza A (5.96%, 23/386) and human adenovirus (5.70%, 22/386). There was no significant difference in the etiological distribution of viral pathogens between males and females (χ (2) = 0.480, P = .489). Viral infections were more likely to occur in the winter‐spring months than in the summer‐autumn months (52.51% vs 33.53%, χ (2) = 13.830, P = .000). CONCLUSIONS: The GeXP‐based multiplex PCR is an accurate and high‐throughput assay allows us to quickly detect multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously in pediatric patients. Our study provides information on the viral profiles and clinical characteristics in hospitalized children with ARTI, which would help better effective prevention strategies.

Immunosenescence results in populating immune tissues with less functional T cells, and perhaps B cells dendritic cells, that do not function well and produce more type 2 cytokines and fewer type 1 cytokines. Impaired immunity, distinct from immunosenescence, correlates more with disease burden than chronologic age. Older adults who have chronic diseases or chronic infections are more susceptible to common infections and have poor vaccine responses. Understanding specific mechanisms and targeting interventions are dependent on research to resolve the relationship between frailty-associated impaired immunity and the role of chronic infection versus immunosenescence in developing impaired immunity.

BACKGROUND No consensus exists on the diagnostic approach for immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHR) to radiocontrast media (RCM). We analyzed the diagnostic value of a skin test (ST), drug provocation test (DPT) and basophil activation test (BAT) in patients with symptoms compatible with IHR to RCM. METHODS Ninety patients with symptoms suggestive of IHR to RCM were evaluated. ST with a panel of RCM was performed, and if negative, DPT was carried out with the culprit RCM. If ST or DPT were positive, tolerance was assessed with an alternative RCM and BAT was carried out with the same panel used for ST. RESULTS Eight (8.9%) cases were confirmed as having IHR, 5 (62.5%) by ST and 3 (37.5%) by DPT. Five from those confirmed as IHR (62.5%) had a positive BAT. CONCLUSIONS Hypersensitivity to RCM was confirmed in 9%, by ST or DPT. BAT proved a valuable method for diagnosis.

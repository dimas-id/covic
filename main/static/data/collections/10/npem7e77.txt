BACKGROUND Recent studies document excess weight loss (EWL) of more than 50% with the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LGB). This study reviews the LGB experience at an urban academic center in terms of complications, reoperative rates, and comorbidities. METHODS In this study, 144 consecutive patients undergoing LGB were prospectively reviewed. Data were collected including weight, body mass index (BMI), excess weight loss (EWL), comorbidities, and complications. Demographics were analyzed using a t-test. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship of BMI, race, and age to EWL at 12 months. RESULTS The study participants were 130 women with a mean age of 43 ± 11 years, a mean weight of 127.1 kg ± 20.5 kg, and a mean BMI of 45.6 ± 6.1. The mean follow-up period was 16 months. The mean EWL was 20% ± 14% at 6 months (n = 118), 26% ± 16% at 12 months (n = 106), 30% ± 20% at 18 months (n = 68), and 34% ± 23% at 24 months (n = 43). Patients with a BMI higher than 50 kg/m(2) had a lower EWL at 12 months than patients with a BMI lower than 50 kg/m(2) (P = 0.00005). The mean EWL at 12 months was significantly less for African Americans than for Caucasians (P = 0.0046; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3-15%). Patients older than 50 years had a lower EWL, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Complete and partial resolution of comorbidities occurred for 10% and 4% of the patients, respectively. Removal of the band with revision to a sleeve gastrectomy for inadequate EWL was required for 14 patients (11.5%). Complications occurred for 8% of the patients (n = 15) including port flipping, stoma obstruction, tube disconnection, port infections, dysphagia, and band slippage. Overall, 16.7% of the patients (n = 24) required reoperation. CONCLUSION After LGB, a majority of the patients failed to achieve a 50% EWL, and 16.7% required reoperation. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding may not be the optimal bariatric procedure for patients older than 50 years, patients with a BMI higher than 50 kg/m(2), or African Americans.

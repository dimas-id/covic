With fears of global health epidemics (of reemerging infectious diseases) having escalated over the past few decades, we must ask how we understand the diverse responses to such outbreaks. I explore a single event that merits revisiting--the 1994 outbreak of plague in Surat, the commercial capital of the Indian state of Gujarat--in an attempt to answer this question. I trace responses at various intersecting levels of public health and political authority-global, national, and local-as they interacted with each other and expressed specific political concerns and social anxieties during this outbreak.

Abstract Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the primary pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). EV71 infection may lead to neurologic damage, with higher incidence of fatality compared with other HFMD pathogens. An effective drug or vaccine against EV71 infection is currently unavailable. It is desirable to determine the pathogen of HFMD accurately and quickly for early treatment. In the current study, reverse-transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology were developed to detect EV71. The efficacy of detecting EV71 was compared with regular nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After detecting 108 clinical specimens, results showed that RT-LAMP can specifically detect EV71, but not Coxsackie virus A16, and exhibited a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 97.1%, which was higher than regular RT-PCR. The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is a practical method for EV71 diagnostic applications, particularly in small county institutes of medical service. The detection ability of RT-LAMP was significantly affected by cryopreservation as the clinical specimens were repeatedly subject to freezing and thawing treatments.

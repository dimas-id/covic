Abstract Objective Lung transplantation is therapeutic for end-stage lung disease, but survival is limited due to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and restrictive chronic lung allograft dysfunction. We sought a common denominator in lung transplant recipients, analyzing risk factors that trigger immune responses that lead to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Methods We collected blood from patients who underwent lung transplant at our institution. Exosomes were isolated from the sera of recipients with risk factors for chronic rejection and from stable recipients. Exosomes were analyzed with western blot, using antibodies to lung self-antigens K alpha 1 tubulin and collagen-V, costimulatory molecules (costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86), transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î±, Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator), and 20S proteasome. Results Of the 90 patients included, we identified 5 with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, 5 without, 15 with respiratory viral infection, 10 with acute rejection, 10 with donor-specific antibodies (DSA), 5 without DSA, and 10 who were stable for exosome isolation. Recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and DSA had exosomes containing self-antigens; exosomes from stable recipients did not. Exosomes from recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, acute rejection, and DSA also demonstrated costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factor, and 20S proteasome. Conclusions Transplanted lungs with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, symptomatic respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and immune responses induce exosomes that contain self-antigens, costimulatory molecules, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factors, and 20S proteasome. Release of circulating exosomes post-transplant from the aforementioned stress-inducing insults augment immunity and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

A 3-year-old girl with a history of continuous urinary incontinence was found to have a right single-system ectopic ureter. She underwent laparoendoscopic single-site nephrectomy without any intraoperative or postoperative complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a laparoendoscopic single-site nephrectomy for single-system ectopic ureter in a child.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, close unprotected contact, and intense aerosols-generating procedures. Sleep study and non-invasive positive airway pressure (NIPAP) therapy can increase the risk of exposure and transmission of new coronaviruses to medical staff and patients. China's national epidemic control has entered a critical stage of overall prevention and control together with the restoration of normal medical care delivery. Based on the characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing, this consensus elaborates on the recommendations from the following four aspects that include patient and medical staff education, optimization of diagnostic and treatment protocols, sterilization of medical devices and the environment, and control of hospital-acquired infection. It is emphasized that the indications for sleep study and NIPAP should be strictly defined according to the local epidemic situation. Portable home sleep study and auto-titration positive airway pressure is recommended. The applications of disposable nasal pressure transducer for sleep study and disposable or personal masks and ventilator tubing for NIPAP are strongly suggested. Moreover, it is necessary to standardize the procedure of NIPAP, to separate the functional divisions in sleep lab, to comply with the protection regulations for medical personnel, and to strengthen the cleaning and disinfection management.

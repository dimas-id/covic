The association between exposure to Haemophilus somnus and Mannheimia haemolytica (formerly Pasteurella haemolytica) and the risk of undifferentiated bovine respiratory disease (UBRD) was investigated using serological evidence of exposure coupled with a factorial design vaccine field trial. Measures of previous exposure (titer at arrival) and current exposure (titer increase in the study period) to these agents were used. The vaccine field trial involved systematic allocation of animals into groups that received either a M. haemolytica vaccine, an H. somnus vaccine, a combined M. haemolytica and H. somnus vaccine, and an unvaccinated control group. Serum was collected from the 852 animals enrolled to determine titers to H. somnus, M. haemolytica, bovine coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Vaccination with H. somnus in combination with M. haemolytica and with M. haemolytica alone reduced the risk of UBRD. The odds ratio for vaccination with H. somnus alone and UBRD risk suggested some sparing effect, but the 95% confidence limits included unity. There was no association between serological evidence of concurrent exposure to M. haemolytica and UBRD occurrence. There was an association between titer change to H. somnus and UBRD risk. However, the association changed with time of BRD treatment; animals diagnosed and treated for UBRD on or after day 10 showed little evidence of exposure to H. somnus, despite evidence of natural H. somnus exposure in the unvaccinated group. The association between titer change to H. somnus and UBRD occurrence seen in this study may be a consequence of prolonged exposure to antibiotics, rather than a causal association.

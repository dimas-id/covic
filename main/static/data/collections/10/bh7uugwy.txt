Abstract Culture and serotyping of human enteroviruses by fluorescence microscopy are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Flow cytometry has the potential of being more rapid, sensitive, and objective but has not been used for these purposes in a clinical laboratory. Primary rhesus monkey kidney (PMK) cells were inoculated with several enterovirus serotypes and stained with enterovirus-specific antibodies for flow cytometry and indirect fluorescence antibody testing (IFA). Kinetic studies of coxsackievirus B1 and echovirus 30 infection of PMK cells were performed on days 1â€“4 after inoculation. Flow cytometry results for echovirus 6, 9, 11, and 30 and coxsackievirus B1 correlated with IFA in all cases. Coxsackievirus B1 and echovirus 30 infections were detected 1 day earlier by flow cytometry than IFA. Flow cytometry can be effectively used for detecting enterovirus-infected cells in a clinical laboratory with the advantages of better quantitation of low levels of infection and earlier detection of virally infected cells in culture systems.

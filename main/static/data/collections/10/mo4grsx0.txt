UNLABELLED Several methods have been developed to label peptides with (18)F. However, in general these are laborious and require a multistep synthesis. We present a facile method based on the chelation of (18)F-aluminum fluoride (Al(18)F) by 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA). The method is characterized by the labeling of NOTA-octreotide (NOTA-d-Phe-cyclo[Cys-Phe-d-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys]-Throl (MH(+) 1305) [IMP466]) with (18)F. METHODS Octreotide was conjugated with the NOTA chelate and labeled with (18)F in a 2-step, 1-pot method. The labeling procedure was optimized with regard to the labeling buffer, peptide, and aluminum concentration. Radiochemical yield, specific activity, in vitro stability, and receptor affinity were determined. Biodistribution of (18)F-IMP466 was studied in AR42J tumor-bearing mice and compared with that of (68)Ga-labeled IMP466. In addition, small-animal PET/CT images were acquired. RESULTS IMP466 was labeled with Al(18)F in a single step with 50% yield. The labeled product was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography to remove unbound Al(18)F and unlabeled peptide. The radiolabeling, including purification, was performed in 45 min. The specific activity was 45,000 GBq/mmol, and the peptide was stable in serum for 4 h at 37 degrees C. Labeling was performed at pH 4.1 in sodium citrate, sodium acetate, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer and was optimal in sodium acetate buffer. The apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of the (19)F-labeled IMP466 determined on AR42J cells was 3.6 nM. Biodistribution studies at 2 h after injection showed a high tumor uptake of (18)F-IMP466 (28.3 +/- 5.2 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]; tumor-to-blood ratio, 300 +/- 90), which could be blocked by an excess of unlabeled peptide (8.6 +/- 0.7 %ID/g), indicating that the accumulation in the tumor was receptor-mediated. Biodistribution of (68)Ga-IMP466 was similar to that of (18)F-IMP466. (18)F-IMP466 was stable in vivo, because bone uptake was only 0.4 +/- 0.2 %ID/g, whereas free Al(18)F accumulated rapidly in the bone (36.9 +/- 5.0 %ID/g at 2 h after injection). Small-animal PET/CT scans showed excellent tumor delineation and high preferential accumulation in the tumor. CONCLUSION NOTA-octreotide could be labeled rapidly and efficiently with (18)F using a 2-step, 1-pot method. The compound was stable in vivo and showed rapid accretion in somatostatin receptor subtype 2-expressing AR42J tumors in nude mice. This method can be used to label other NOTA-conjugated compounds with (18)F.

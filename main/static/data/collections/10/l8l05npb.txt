The sexual impact of urinary incontinence in women depends on a host of parameters, including physical, psychological, social and cultural dimensions. Evaluation of the effects of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and lower urinary tract symptoms on sexual function is often biased by their common association with other pelvic floor disorders, such as pelvic organ prolapse, which also affect sexual satisfaction. Indeed, these complexities are reflected in the literature, which shows considerable disparity in sexual functional characteristics in women with incontinence both before and after treatment. This discordance is further emphasized by heterogeneity in study design, quality and analysis. Here, we describe the nature of sexual dysfunction in women with incontinence, including coital incontinence. The various treatments for SUI, which include transvaginal tape surgeries, can also affect sexual function, positively or negatively. Coital incontinence seems to be a good predictor of an improvement in postoperative sexual parameters: its cure, achieved by >90% of women, to a large extent explains the sexual benefits reported in several studies. By contrast, deterioration in sexual function is sometimes reported after surgery, with de novo or worsened dyspareunia being the most common cause. The literature does not contain any convincing arguments for one treatment or another on the basis of sexual functional outcome.

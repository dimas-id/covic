Abstract Exhaust air heat recovery is of great significance for building energy conservation. Since passive heat recovery systems use temperature or enthalpy difference between outdoor air and indoor air to drive the system, the temperature of fresh air supply cannot meet indoor requirements and the exhaust heat is not fully recovered. In this study, a solar-driven exhaust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery (SDEATHP) system is tested and evaluated for its ability to recover thermal energy from exhaust air to cool or heat fresh air. An experimental platform was established to test its performance. Results show that the SDEATHP system can obtain higher fresh air supply temperature in winter and lower fresh air supply temperature in summer. The system requires only 3.12 W of power for the fans, and the average relative cooling coefficient in summer and the average relative heating coefficient can reach 50.6 and 57.9, respectively. The optimal operating current and voltage of TE modules and photovoltaic system is analyzed, and then the number and types of electrical connections for the TE modules in SDEATHP system are discussed. The SDEATHP system provides a new method for building energy recovery and fresh air supply.

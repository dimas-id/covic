Background To assess the association between final polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) angiographic parameters and free shunt revision survey. Methods Series of two comparison groups were generated with persistence of varices or not, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile as cutoff for each angle and a 15-mm distance as cutoff for distance D. Kaplan Meier free shunt revision curves were then created and compared with Log Rank test. Results Mean follow-up was 455 days. Thirteen (19.4%) patients had shunt revision. Significant free shunt revision survey difference was found between post-procedural angiographic persistent varices group and the group without varices (P=0.0001). Shunt revision rate at 3, 12 and 24 months was respectively 13%, 29%, and 39% in the group with varices versus 0%, 2.7% and 2.7% in the group without. No difference was found between groups for angles A, B, C and distance D. Conclusions Persistence of gastric or esophageal varices on final trans-TIPS angiography increases TIPS revision rate after PTFE-covered stent shunt creation whereas geometric parameters have no influence.

The inactivation effect of a novel photocatalyst on polyethylene terephthalate film on goose parvovirus (GPV), avian influenza virus (AIV) and Qβ phage was evaluated. Under a light emitting diode (LED) light (range 410-750 nm), GPV was inactivated by irradiation at 1,000 lux for 6 hr, while AIV and Qβ phage were inactivated by irradiation at 150 lux for 2 hr. These data suggest that this new photocatalyst can potentially be used as one of the materials to inactivate viruses in the indoor environment and help us to prevent viral infectious diseases through indirect contact.

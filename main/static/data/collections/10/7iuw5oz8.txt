The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic challenged program leaders to respond rapidly to changes in health care delivery, protect trainee safety, and transform educational activities. The pandemic demanded that program directors prioritize and address myriad threats to trainees' well-being. In this paper, we adapt Maslow's needs framework to systematically address trainee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential interventions to meet trainee needs at the program, institution, and extrainstitutional levels. Transforming education to effectively respond to trainee well-being needs requires leadership, and we use Kotter's 8-step change management model as an example of a framework to effectively lead change. Program leaders can take this opportunity to reflect upon their training programs and take the opportunity to improve them. Some of the systems of education we develop during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as telehealth, tele-education, and ways to stay connected may provide advantages and will be important to continue and expand upon post-COVID-19.

The age of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has increased during the last decades, mainly due to improved reduced-intensity/toxicity conditioning protocols. A reduced-intensity conditioning based on fludarabin, carmustin/BCNU and melphalan (FBM) has been previously developed at our institution. Since we observed detrimental effects in individual patients with compromised lung function, efforts have been made in order to replace BCNU by thiotepa (FTM) to reduce toxicity. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the outcome, GvHD incidence, lung function and organ toxicity of patients with a median age of 62 years (range 21–79) transplanted for malignant disease (96.7%, 62.3% in intermediate/advanced disease stage) at our institution after conditioning with FBM (n = 136) or FTM (n = 105) between 2013 and 2017. Median follow-up was 868 days (range 0–2615). In multivariate analysis for overall survival, no difference was detected between both conditioning protocols in the presence of impaired lung function, age, lower performance, and liver disease previous allo-HCT. In the subgroup analysis, FTM was not inferior to FBM in patients with pulmonary disease prior allo-HCT, lymphoid malignancies, and higher comorbidity index. In conclusion, the reduced-intensity FBM and FTM conditioning protocols show adequate antineoplastic efficacy and are suitable for patients with impaired lung function.

It seems a strange thing to be writing about child oral health in the middle of a virus pandemic that has, in the UK at least, paused all routine dental care. Perhaps not; as thoughts turn to the return of "normal" opera- tion there are concerns over potential ongoing impacts from COVID-19 on health services including stricter infection-control requirements and economic impacts from the lockdown. It invites ridicule to try and predict what will happen in the coming years, but the economic and social impacts are likely to increase vulnerability among the already vulnerable and the delivery of dental care is likely to be more problematic and more expensive. More than ever we need to reduce the burden of avoidable dental disease.

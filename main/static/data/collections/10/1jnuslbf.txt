With this paper we communicated the existence of a surface electrocardiography (ECG) recordings dataset, named WCTECGdb, that aside from the standard 12-lead signals includes the raw electrode biopotential for each of the nine exploring electrodes refereed directly to the right leg. This dataset, comprises of 540 ten second segments recorded from 92 patients at Campbelltown Hospital, NSW Australia, and is now available for download from the Physionet platform. The data included in the dataset confirm that the Wilsonâ€™s Central Terminal (WCT) has a relatively large amplitude (up to 247% of lead II) with standard ECG characteristics such as a p-wave and a t-wave, and is highly variable during the cardiac cycle. As further examples of application for our data, we assess: (1) the presence of a conductive pathway between the legs and the heart concluding that in some cases is electrically significant and (2) the initial assumption about the limbs potential stating the dominance of the left arm concluding that this is not always the case and that might requires case to case assessment.

INTRODUCTION: The recent outbreak of COVID-19 which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide evolving into a pandemic, poses a global health emergency. As of mid-April over 2 million people have been infected with over 145 thousand casualties. The disease is more severe in the older population, whereas in children lower infection rates and milder symptoms are more common. Severe symptoms in the pediatric population, although uncommon, have been reported mainly in infants younger than 1 year of age. Perinatal transmission is infrequent and associated with a relatively mild illness in the newborn.

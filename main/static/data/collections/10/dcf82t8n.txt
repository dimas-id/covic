The corona virus disease -2019 (COVID-19) is a recently described infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 with significant cardiovascular implications. Given the increased risk for severe COVID-19 observed in adults with underlying cardiac involvement, there is concern that patients with pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) may likewise be at increased risk for severe infection. The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 include myocarditis, arrhythmia and myocardial infarction. Importantly, the pandemic has stretched health care systems and many care team members are at risk for contracting and possibly transmitting the disease which may further impact the care of patients with cardiovascular disease. In this review, we describe the effects of COVID-19 in the pediatric and young adult population and review the cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 focusing on implications for patients with congenital heart disease in particular.

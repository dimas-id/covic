Current concepts in the management of hepatic metastases have changed dramatically over the past two decades. Multidisciplinary therapies including chemotherapy, surgery, and regional therapy have alone and in combination significantly improved the survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Conditions that were previously considered hopeless and treated merely for palliation can now be approached with curative intent. In this paper, we review the surgical treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) and describe a paradigm-shift in the management of complex heretofore-considered unresectable CRLM. Utilizing advanced multidisciplinary treatment strategies has improved the prognosis of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer to the point where we may question whether CRLM are now a chronic disease.

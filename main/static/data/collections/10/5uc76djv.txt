Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions remain to be important in the prevention of further spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Basic hygiene interventions such as handwashing with water and soap (HWWS) when applied consistently will deactivate and remove the virus particles from the hands. Realizing the efforts that have been made by countries world over in controlling the COVID-19, this letter seeks to discuss how the available WASH services can be used in the fight against further spread of COVID-19. The letter highlights the challenges being faced by the current WASH services in middle- and low-income countries and suggests measures that can be employed to strengthen the WASH services in this period of the COVID-19 pandemic.

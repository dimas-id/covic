This paper examines the problems of coordination between and within six jurisdictional players, namely the Hong Kong SAR Government, the Guangdong Province, the Central Authority (PRC), the Taiwanese Government, the Taipei Government and the World Health Organization during the SARS episode from November 2002 until August 2003. We found that the diverging political interests and entrenched administrative practices accounted for the poor coordination between and within these players. The obsession with "political correctness" has severely hampered "rational" decision making among the jurisdictional players. The highly fragmented and compartmentalised intra-jurisdictional public health system means that marshalling resources from health and non-health sectors is difficult.

A 10‐year‐old, neutered female, domestic shorthair cat was presented with a recent history of weight loss, polydipsia, diarrhea and vomiting. On physical examination, intestinal thickening and mesenteric lymph node enlargement were apparent. Clinical investigations revealed peripheral blood eosinophilia, eosinophilic abdominal effusion and eosinophilic mesenteric lymphadenitis. There was a temporary response to treatment with glucocorticoids but signs progressed and the cat was euthanased. On histology, there was eosinophilic infiltration and fibroplasia of intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes. Large aggregates of neoplastic round cells in the intestine and lymph nodes were identified as T lymphocytes using immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of intestinal T cell lymphosarcoma was made. This case demonstrates that hypereosinophilic paraneoplastic syndrome may occur in cats with lymphosarcoma. Eosinophil chemotaxis may be a response to the production of interleukin‐5 by neoplastic lymphocytes.

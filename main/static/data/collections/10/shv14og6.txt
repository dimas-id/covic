The current decade has witnessed the evolution of Minimal Access Surgery (MAS) from Multi port Laparoscopy to Single Port Laparoscopy. The reduction of ports, subsequent scars and pain makes MAS more patients friendly. Symptomatic Subxiphoid Incisional hernias in patients having post CABG Sternotomy are surgically challenging. This is because of the difficult anatomical position i.e. sternum and the ribs superiorly and the diaphragm posteriorly. Another reason is high intra-abdominal pressure with the shearing forces of the musculature in the upper abdomen. Consequently the conventional open primary anatomical or mesh repairs are difficult to perform and have a high recurrence rate. Laparoscopy promises to be an effective technique to treat this condition. In this case report we describe the use of Laparoscopy in particular: Single Incision for the repair of CABG Sternotomy Subxiphoid Hernia along with relevant literature. This is the first report in English Language Literature.

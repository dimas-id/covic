Polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) were detected from 7 (3.0%) and 38 (16.4%) of 232 children with respiratory tract infections by real‐time PCR. The rates of infection by KIPyV and WUPyV alone were 3 of 7 (42.9%) and 20 of 38 (52.6%), respectively. In the other samples, various viruses (human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1 and human bocavirus) were detected simultaneously. One case was positive for KIPyV, WUPyV and hMPV. There was no obvious difference in clinical symptoms between KIPyV‐positive and WUPyV‐positive patients with or without coinfection. KIPyV was detected in one of 30 specimens of lung tissue (3.3%). Neither of the viruses was detected in 30 samples of lung adenocarcinoma tissue.

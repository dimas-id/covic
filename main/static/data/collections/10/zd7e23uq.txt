Treatment options for portomesenteric venous thrombosis range from anticoagulation to surgery, depending on chronicity, severity of symptoms, extent of thrombosis, and the availability of local expertise. For acute and subacute cases, a variety of endovascular options have been described in limited published series and case reports, including thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. We report what is to our knowledge the first case in which the Trellis pharmacomechanical thrombolysis device was used successfully to treat complete acute thrombosis of the entire superior mesenteric vein and the entire portal vein with extension into all segmental intrahepatic portal branches in a young adult after liver transplantation. This device, coupled with adjunctive techniques using balloon catheters, facilitated complete restoration of flow, resulting in graft salvage and long-term patency.

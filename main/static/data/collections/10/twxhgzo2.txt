PURPOSE To report a combined procedure that opens the acutely thrombosed superior vena cava (SVC) to rapidly alleviate symptoms in seriously ill patients with SVC syndrome. CASE REPORTS Four patients aged 54 to 63 years old with underlying malignancies were referred for treatment of SVC syndrome. All received isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (IPMT) with tissue plasminogen activator delivered in a Trellis Peripheral Infusion System that removed obstructive clot in minutes versus the 24 to 48 hours required for traditional catheter-directed thrombolysis. In each case, stents were inserted immediately following IPMT in a combined procedure lasting <1 hour. Patients exhibited near-immediate relief of debilitating symptoms; completion venography demonstrated patent vessels with excellent blood flow. CONCLUSION Combining IPMT with immediate stenting during the same session is an effective method for managing acute thrombotic SVC syndrome and limiting the exposure time and number of interventions performed on seriously ill patients.

Global health diplomacy has been defined as the art and practice of negotiation in relation to global health issues. This chapter draws on generic concepts of negotiation as a process of diagnosis, formula development, exchange and implementation, reflecting the shared and sometimes contested values, power relationships and interests of the many different actors involved. It sets out a framework for understanding the main phases of global health negotiation process as they arise in many different contexts. The negotiation of global health issues is shown to be a driver of the regimes of global health governance institutions that are shaped by the new trends in global governance described in the previous chapter. The leadership and development of diplomatic negotiations at every level with an increasing range of actors is therefore key to global governance for health.

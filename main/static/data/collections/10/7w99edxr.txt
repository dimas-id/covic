Fibrinogen-like protein 2/fibroleukin (Fgl2) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both experimental and human fulminant hepatic failure. We have reported recently that the nucleocapsid (N) protein from strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-3, MHV-A59), which cause massive hepatocellular necrosis but not from strains (MHV-JHM, MHV-2) which do not produce serious liver disease, induces transcription of fgl2. The purpose of the present study was to characterize both viral and host factor(s) necessary for viral induced transcription of fgl2. Mutation of residues Gly-12, Pro-38, Asn-40, Gln-41, and Asn-42 within domain 1 of the N protein of MHV-A59 to their corresponding residues found in MHV-2 abrogated fgl2 transcription, whereas mutation of other N protein domains, including a protein expressed from an internal reading frame (I protein), did not affect fgl2 gene transcription. We then examined the -372 to -306 sequence within the 1.3-kb fgl2 promoter region upstream from the transcription start site that was previously identified as necessary for N protein-induced gene transcription. We demonstrated that the -331/-325 HNF4 cis-element and its cognate transcription factor, HNF4alpha, are necessary for virus-induced fgl2 gene transcription. In uninfected macrophages and macrophages infected with MHV-2, an unidentified protein occupies the HNF4 cis-element. Following stimulation with MHV-A59, it was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that HNF4alpha binds the HNF4 cis-element in the fgl2 promoter. We further report the unprecedented presence of HNF4alpha in peritoneal macrophages. Collectively, the results of this study define both viral and host factors necessary for induction of fgl2 prothrombinase gene transcription in MHV infection and may provide an explanation for the hepatotrophic nature of MHV-induced fulminant hepatic failure.

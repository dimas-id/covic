Ethical issues, along with transparency, disinformation and bias are in the focus of our information society. In this demo, we will present the [Image: see text] system, that based on the web graph computes the bias characteristics of web domains to user-defined concepts. Our approach uses adaptations of propagation models and a variation of the pagerank algorithm named Biased-PR, that models various behaviours of biased surfers. Currently, the system runs over a subset of the greek web graph. We have developed cross-browser plugins that let users explore the bias characteristics of domains, define their own biased concepts and monitor the consumption of biased information through some analytics.

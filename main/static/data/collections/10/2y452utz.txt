A novel coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV has caused a rapid global pandemic-COVID-19. Scientists have taken onto the task of characterizing this new virus and understanding how this virus has transmitted to humans. All preliminary studies have found some striking similarities between this new virus and the SARS-CoV that caused a similar kind of epidemic in 2002â€“2003. Through bioinformatics tools, a great deal of information has been gathered about the origin, evolution and zoonosis of this virus. We, in this review, report the symptoms, mode of transmission and available and putative treatments to tackle 2019-nCoV infections. We also comprehensively summarize all the information so far made available regarding the genome, evolution and zoonosis of this virus.

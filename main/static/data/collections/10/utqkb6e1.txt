This study was carried out to assess the physicochemical and bacteriological contaminants of surface, shallow well and municipal borehole waters in part of the western Niger Delta as a way of safeguarding public health against waterborne diseases. A total of 72 water samples collected from the study area were analysed and their results show that the pH average value ranges from 6.2 in the dry to 8.5 in the rainy seasons for surface water, 6.6 and 8.3 for shallow well water and 6.5 to 8.4 for borehole water. The turbidity in surface water varies from 8.1 to 26.2 Formazin Attenuation Unit (FAU), 0.3 to 2.9 FAU in shallow well water and 0.4 to 4.8 FAU in borehole water. Electrical conductivity (EC) value varies from 1010 to 1840 μs/cm for surface water, 201 to 950 μs/cm for shallow well water and 670 to 1650 μs/cm for borehole water. Total dissolved solids range from 0.1 to 2.6 mg/l in surface water, 0.2 to 4.1 mg/l in shallow well water and 0.3 to 4.4 mg/l in borehole water. The value of the total hardness ranges from 44 to 120 mg in surface water, 46 to 96 mg in shallow well water and 70 to 130 mg in borehole water. The nitrate value ranges from 1.1 to 10.6 mg in surface water, 3.0 to 8.4 mg in shallow well water and 3.7 to 9.6 mg in borehole water. The value of sulphate content varies from 4.6 to 38.5 mg in surface water, 6.2 to 34.8 mg in shallow well water and 5.7 to 55.7 mg in borehole water. The value of phosphate concentrations in surface water varies from 1.0 to 9.0 mg, 0.7 to 3.4 mg in shallow well water and 1.0 to 4.7 mg in borehole water. The bacteriological analysis using the membrane filtration technique revealed the presence of faecal bacteria and total coliform counts. The presence of the analysed twin contaminants in the studied water resources reduced their water quality. The physicochemical and bacteriological data were subjected to statistical and correlation tests. It was concluded that their concentration levels were independent of intra-seasonal changes. The likely natural and artificial sources of contaminants are run-offs from fertilized lands, septic tanks, industrial discharges, sewage and waste disposal, algae blooms and erosion from natural deposits. The inherent risk is water-related diseases such as waterborne diseases, water-washed diseases, water-based diseases and diseases transmitted by water-related insect vectors. Water resources should be protected through proper sanitation systems, limiting of up-stream discharges, maintenance of wellheads, boiling and municipal water treatment plants. Educational advice should be given to the inhabitants on the dangers posed by continuous drinking of contaminated water. These measures will prevent disease outbreak and public health burden in the area.

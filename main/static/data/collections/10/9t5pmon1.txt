The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heralded a new era in the cross-species transmission of severe respiratory illness leading to rapid spread in mainland China and around the world with a case fatality rate of 2.3% in China and 1.8-7.2% outside China (Wu & McGoogan, 2019; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Onder Rezza, & Brusaferro, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020). As of May 15, 2020, a total of 4,338,658 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 297,119 death cases have been documented globally (World Health Organization, 2020). Several strategies have been adopted to contain the outbreak including classic infection-control and public health measures, nevertheless these measures may not be effective for tackling the scale of COVID-19.

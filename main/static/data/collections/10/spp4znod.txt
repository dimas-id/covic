We present a prospective study of influenza C virus infections in hospitalized children in Spain during 6 years, including the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm. Influenza C infections accounted for 13.3% of influenza-positive cases. The patients with simple influenza C infection were clinically similar to other influenza types, but a high rate of coinfection (81%) makes it difficult to assess its clinical role.

In this study, 290 Chinese native Yantai black pig piglets were investigated to identify gene polymorphisms, for haplotype reconstruction, and to determine the association between piglet diarrhea and swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) class II DQA exons 2, 3, and 4 by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism and cloning sequencing. The results showed that the 5, 8, and 7 genotypes were identified from SLA-DQA exon 2, 3, and 4, respectively, based on the single-stranded conformational polymorphism banding patterns and found a novel allele D in exon 2 and 2 novel mutational sites of allele C (c.4828T>C) and allele F (c.4617T>C) in exon 3. Polymorphism information content testing showed that exon 2 was moderately polymorphic and that exons-3 and -4 loci were highly polymorphic. The piglet diarrhea scores for genotypes AB (1.40 ± 0.14) and AC (1.54 ± 0.17) in exon 2, AA (1.22 ± 0.32), BC (1.72 ± 0.13), DD (1.67 ± 0.35), and CF (1.22 ± 0.45) in exon 3, and AD (2.35 ± 0.25) in exon 4 were significantly higher than those for the other genotypes (P ≤ 0.05) in DQA exons. There were 14 reconstructed haplotypes in the 3 exons from 290 individuals and Hap12 may be the diarrhea-resistant gene. Haplotype distribution was extremely uneven, and the SLA-DQA gene showed genetic linkage. In this study, we identified molecular genetic markers and provided a theoretical foundation for future pig anti-disease resistance breeding.

The smallest Cas13 family protein, CasRx, has a high cleavage activity and targeting specificity, offering attractive opportunity for therapeutic applications. Here we report that delivery of CasRx by adeno-associated virus via intravitreal injection could efficiently knockdown Vegfa transcripts and significantly reduce the area of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in a mouse model of age-related macular degeneration. Thus, RNA-targeting CRISPR system could be used for in vivo gene therapy.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of the MVP™ microvascular plug(Covidien) for closure of vascular anomalies in patients with congenital heart diseases (CHD). BACKGROUND The MVP™ is a novel device with PTFE integrated. The device has been recently introduced in the radiological field and reported exclusively for neurological anomalies. METHODS All CHD patients receiving the device from April 2015 until July 2015 were included in the study and followed up clinically as well as by transthoracic echocardiography. Standard safety and follow-up such as vascular complications, embolization rate, and residual shunting were assessed. RESULTS Twelve patients with a median age of 2.6-years (0.03-12.6 years) and a mean weight of 13 kg (2.8-34.2 kg) were included. Devices were delivered from the femoral artery in 10 and from the femoral vein in 2 patients. Devices were used for closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure (n = 5), aorto-pulmonary collaterals or Blalock-Taussig shunt (n = 5), veno-venous fistula (n = 1), and coronary fistula (n = 1). One device was retrieved before release due to inappropriate size estimation (PDA spasm). The PDA was successfully closed using a PDA device (Lifetech, Medtronic). Immediate angiographic evaluation showed minimal or no shunt in 90% (10/11 patients) and 100% occlusion rate after a mean follow-up of 3.2-months. There was no device embolization, hemolysis, or any other complication following closure. CONCLUSIONS The delivery of new MVP™ micro vascular plug system (Covidien) is safe and effective in patients with CHD for closure of a variety of vascular abnormalities. The low profile of the device and the sheathless nature of the procedure make it particularly interesting for PDA closure in premature babies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Cardiac amyloidosis, the majority of cases of which are due to immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), affects different aspects of the heart and cardiovascular system. Amyloid-induced cardiomyopathy, clinically manifesting with heart failure and electrophysiological abnormalities, has distinct characteristics compared to non-amyloid cardiomyopathies. Accordingly, specific management strategies are required. This paper will review the cardiovascular manifestations of patients with cardiac amyloidosis and their suggested treatment strategies, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary care.

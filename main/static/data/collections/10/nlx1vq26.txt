Subclinical Ruminal Acidosis (SARA) and Subclinical Ketosis (SCK) are two of the most prevalent metabolic diseases of dairy cows, with impacts on reproductive performance. There is scarce literature about these diseases in dairy regions in Colombia. In 29 randomly selected herds in Pasto, Colombia, 249 dairy cows were followed weekly for two months postpartum to determine: 1) incidence risk of SARA and SCK; and 2) effects of SARA and SCK on the occurrence of postpartum anestrus (PA) at two months. Samples from ruminal liquor and blood were obtained one time per cow during the first week postpartum to determine presence of SARA (pH < 5.6) and SCK (1.0-2.9 mmol/L of blood Beta-Hydroxy-Butyrate), respectively. PA diagnosis was determined with ultrasound. Pregnancy risks at 30 and 60 days post-breeding (and assumed embryo losses between these days) were determined. Risk factors associated with PA were estimated through a mixed multi-level multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for clustering of cows within herds. The incidence risks of SARA and SCK were 23.3% and 46.2%, respectively. Simultaneous occurrence of SCK and SARA (SCASCK) was present in 5.2% of the cows. In the final multivariable model, the occurrence of SARA (Odds Ratio: OR = 39.4), SCK (OR = 47.4) and SCASCK (OR = 68.5) was associated with increased odds of PA. Feeding a transition period diet was associated with reduced odds of PA (OR = 0.15). Second parity cows had significantly lower odds of PA than first parity cows (OR = 0.21). In conclusion, inadequate pre-partum and postpartum nutritional management of the herds increased the occurrence of SARA and SCK, which had adverse effects on reproductive performance.

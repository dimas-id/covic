Ethical restrictions are limitations of in vivo inhalation studies, on humans and animal models. Thus, in vitro or ex vivo anatomical models offer an interesting alternative if limitations are clearly identified and if extrapolation to human is made with caution. This work aimed to develop an ex vivo infant-like respiratory model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia easy to use, reliable and relevant compared to in vivo infant data. This model is composed of a 3D-printed head connected to a sealed enclosure containing a leporine thorax. Physiological data and pleural-mimicking depressions were measured for chosen respiratory rates. Homogeneity of ventilation was assessed by 81mkrypton scintigraphies. Regional radioaerosol deposition was quantified with 99mtechnetium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid after jet nebulization. Tidal volumes values are ranged from 33.16 ± 7.37 to 37.44 ± 7.43 mL and compliance values from 1.78 ± 0.65 to 1.85 ± 0.99 mL/cmH2O. Ventilation scintigraphies showed a homogenous ventilation with asymmetric repartition: 56.94% ± 9.4% in right lung and 42.83% ± 9.36 in left lung. Regional aerosol deposition in lungs exerted 2.60% ± 2.24% of initial load of radioactivity. To conclude the anatomical model satisfactorily mimic a 3-months old BPD-suffering bronchopulmonary dysplasia and can be an interesting tool for aerosol regional deposition studies.

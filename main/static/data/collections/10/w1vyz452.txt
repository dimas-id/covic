To extend the potential of antibodies and their derivatives to provide passive protection against enteric infections when supplied orally in crude plant extracts, we have expressed both a small immune protein (SIP) and a full‐length antibody in plants using two different plant virus vectors based on potato virus X (PVX) and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The agr;SIP molecule consisted of a single chain antibody (scFv) specific for the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) linked to the α‐CH3 domain from human IgA. To express the full‐length IgA, the individual light and heavy chains from the TGEV‐specific mAb 6A.C3 were inserted into separate PVX constructs and plants were co‐infected with both constructs. Western blot analysis revealed the efficient expression of both the SIP and IgA molecules. Analysis of crude plant extracts revealed that both the plant‐expressed αSIP and IgA molecules could bind to and neutralize TGEV in tissue culture, indicating that active molecules were produced. Oral administration of crude extracts from antibody‐expressing plant tissue to 2‐day‐old piglets showed that both the αSIP and full‐length IgA molecules can provide in vivo protection against TGEV.

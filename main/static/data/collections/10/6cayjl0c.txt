PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate whether associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) can be used as an effective and safe rescue procedure in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and insufficient effect on the future liver remnant (FLR) after previous portal vein occlusion (PVO). METHODS Eleven patients with bilobar CRLM treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and previous PVO with insufficient effect on the FLR were analyzed retrospectively from a prospective database. FLR was evaluated with computed tomography volumetry 6 days after stage 1, and stage 2 was performed on day seven. RESULTS Six days after stage 1, the median increase of the FLR was 209 ml (range 87-314, P < 0.001). This corresponded to a median FLR growth of 61.8 % (range 19.3-120) resulting in an FLR/BW ratio >0.5 % in all patients and successful subsequent removal of the tumor bearing liver (segments IV-VIII) in all patients with no 90-day mortality. No patient had a 3b-complication or more according to Clavien-Dindo. No patient developed severe posthepatectomy liver failure. CONCLUSIONS The powerful hypertrophy of the FLR associated with ALPPS seems to be maintained in patients with CRLM and previous failed PVO.

The following communication is a tripartite synopsis of the role of viral infection in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The first section describes the impact of viral opportunistic infection in AIDS; for each virus, clinical presentation and diagnosis, laboratory diagnostic approaches (with emphasis on electron microscopy), and therapeutic interventions attempted to date are discussed. The second segment explores current theories on the pathogenesis of AIDS, and describes diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the syndrome itself. The final section catalogues ultrastructural anomalies in the cells of AIDS patients, many of which have been mistakenly identified as etiologic agents.

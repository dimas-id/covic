Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was identified for the first time in Quebec, using a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Unlike the virus neutralization test (VNT), this ELISA was able to distinguish transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) from PRCV. Among the 15 seropositive fattening herds from group A, sera containing PRCV antibodies represented 74.8%, whereas those with TGEV antibodies represented only 7.2%. In group B, which consisted of 15 sow herds, nine herds expressed only PRCV-specific antibodies while the other herds had animals positive for TGEV-specific antibodies.

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is emerging as an alternative technique to conventional laparoscopy for the treatment of common surgical diseases. Despite its wide use, the adoption of SILS in children has been slower since the broad application of minimally invasive techniques in children, in general, has historically lagged behind those in adults. This paper reviews the evolution of SILS from its original conception and its application in the field of pediatric surgery.

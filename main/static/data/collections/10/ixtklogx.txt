PURPOSE To compare, using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, the risk of incisional hernia in patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic surgery to those undergoing traditional laparoscopic surgery. METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing single-incision laparoscopic surgery to traditional laparoscopic surgery and which reported incisional hernias over a minimum 6-month follow-up period were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook. Pooled odds ratios were calculated using RevMan. RESULTS Of 309 identified studies, 22 were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed higher odds of incisional hernia following single-incision laparoscopic surgery relative to traditional laparoscopic surgery (odds ratio 2.83, 95% CI 1.34-5.98, p = 0.006, I2 = 0%). There was no difference in the odds of incisional hernias requiring surgical repair (p = 0.10). Subgroup analysis found no difference in the odds of incisional hernias based on procedure type (p = 0.69) or method of follow-up (p = 0.85). The quality of evidence was determined to be moderate. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is associated with a threefold increase in the odds of incisional hernia compared with traditional laparoscopic surgery.

Stroke has been considered as one of the underlying diseases that increases the probability of severe infection and mortality. Meanwhile, there are ongoing reports of stroke subsequent to COVID-19 infection. In this narrative paper, we reviewed major neurologic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and pharmacokinetics of drugs which are routinely used for COVID-19 infection and their potential drugâ€“drug interactions (PDDIs) with common drugs used for the treatment of stroke. It is highly recommended to monitor patients on chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), antiviral drugs, and/or corticosteroids about initiation or progression of cardiac arrhythmias, delirium, seizure, myopathy, and/or neuropathy. In addition, PDDIs of anti-COVID-19 drugs with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), anticoagulants, antiaggregants, statins, antihypertensive agents, and iodine-contrast agents should be considered. The most dangerous PDDIs were interaction of lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir with clopidogrel, prasugrel, and new oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

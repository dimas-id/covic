This review article presents 342 aromatic glycosides, isolated from and identified in plants and microorganisms, that demonstrate different biological activities. They are of great interest, especially for the medicinal and/or pharmaceutical industries. These biologically active natural surfactants are good prospects for the future chemical preparation of compounds useful as antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antibacterial agents. These glycosidic compounds have been classified into several groups, including simple aromatic compounds, stilbenes, phenylethanoids, phenylpropanoids, naphthalene derivatives, and anthracene derivatives.

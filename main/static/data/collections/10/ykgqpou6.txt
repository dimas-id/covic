The present investigation aimed to evaluate the radiomitigative efficacy of the recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) against acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in a rat model. Rats were irradiated with a single sublethal dose of γ-radiation (7 Gy; total body irradiation; TBI) on the 1st day of experimental course, then received EPO (5000 IU/kg; i.p.) 24 h after irradiation, and rats were observed for 30 days of survival analysis. Administration of EPO improved 30-day survival, alleviated TBI-induced myelosuppression and pancytopenia, by augmenting lymphocytes and other white blood cells in the peripheral blood of rats, while bone marrow and spleen cellularity were restored. EPO post-exposure treatment alleviated hepatotoxicity biomarkers and restored splenic function. EPO abrogated radiation-induced oxidative stress through the upregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α-7-nAChR) and the pro-survival Janus kinase-2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription JAK-2/STAT-3 signaling mediated via enhancing nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf-2) cytoprotective machinery in liver and spleen of irradiated rats. Moreover, EPO treatment prevented hepatic and splenic apoptosis. The present study establishes the implication of α-7-nAChR-JAK-2/STAT-3-Nrf-2 signaling cascade in the radiomitigative potential of EPO against ARS.

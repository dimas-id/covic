BACKGROUND Incisional hernia after abdominal surgery is a well-known complication. Controversy still exists with respect to the choice of hernia repair technique. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term recurrence rate as well as surgical complications in a consecutive group of patients undergoing open repair using an onlay mesh technique. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing open incisional hernia repair with onlay-technique between 01/05/1995 and 01/09/2007 at a single institution were included in the study. For follow-up patients were contacted by telephone, and answered a questionnaire containing questions related to the primary operation, the hernia and general risk factors. Patients were examined by a consultant surgeon in the outpatient clinic or in the patient's home if there was suspicion of an incisional hernia recurrence. RESULTS The study included 56 patients with 100% follow-up. The median follow-up was 35 months (range 4-151). Recurrent incisional hernia was found in 8 of 56 patients (15%, 95% CI: 6-24). The overall complication rate was 13% (95% CI, 4-22). All complications were minor and needed no hospital admission. CONCLUSION This study with a long follow-up showed low recurrence and complication rates in patients undergoing incisional hernia repair with the open onlay technique.

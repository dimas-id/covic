Vertical-banded gastroplasty (VBG) was once a common bariatric procedure. It has fallen out of favor due to the emergence of the adjustable gastric band and late complications including band erosion and stenosis. Options for revision include conversion to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or VBG reversal via gastrogastrostomy. Patients undergoing revision of a previous VBG were identified. VBG reversal was performed laparoscopically. Conversion to RYGB was performed by both laparotomy and laparoscopy. Perioperative outcomes and long-term weight loss were evaluated. A total of 34 patients with a previous open VBG underwent revision over a nearly 8-year period (January 2003 to September 2010). Conversion to RYGB was performed in 25 (four laparoscopically) and VBG reversal in nine patients. Mean age for all patients was 56.3 years (range 36-70), and VBG had been performed 23 years previously (range 16-30). Patients to undergo VBG reversal were more likely to be male and less likely to be morbidly obese at the time of revision. Operative time and length of stay were shorter for laparoscopic procedures. Complication rates did not differ based on technique or procedure. Patients with a previous VBG may present with complications and obesity decades after the primary procedure. Revisional surgery can be accomplished laparoscopically. Following VBG reversal, most patients gain weight and many become morbidly obese again. Conversion to RYGB is associated with weight loss and resolution of morbid obesity in most patients. When feasible, laparoscopic conversion to RYGB may offer the best outcomes.

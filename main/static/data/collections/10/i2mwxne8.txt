The objective of this study was to evaluate whether bicycling infrastructure changes in the city of Minneapolis effectively reduced the incidence or severity of traumatic bicycling related injuries sustained by patients admitted to our Level 1 Trauma Center. Data for this retrospective cohort study was obtained from the trauma database at our institution and retrospective chart review. The total number of miles of bikeway in the city on a yearly basis was used to demonstrate the change in cycling infrastructure. Adjusted regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in ISS when total bike lane miles increased (Coef. − 0.04, P < 0.001). Increasing bike lane miles was also associated with a significant reduction in severe head injury (OR 0.99, P < 0.001) and ICU LOS (Coef. − 0.17, P = 0.013). The miles of bike lanes were not associated with any significant changes in mortality or mechanical ventilation days when adjusted for other factors. We were able to demonstrate a reduction in the severity of injuries incurred by cyclists in the setting of a significant increase in the total number of bicycle lane miles. Our data lends credence to the existing evidence that the addition of bicycle lane miles increases cyclist safety.

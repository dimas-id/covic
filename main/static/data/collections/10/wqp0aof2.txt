THE number and diversity of the viruses which infect the upper respiratory tract, and cause the common cold, virtually preclude the control of this disease by conventional vaccines. From this, apart from symptomatic therapy, the only hope for effective treatment of this most prevalent of diseases is in the development of broad spectrum antiviral drugs. We have developed a substituted guanidine, ICI 65,709 (ref. 1) (Fig. 1) which has good activity in vitro against all twenty-five rhinovirus serotypes tested in human embryonic lung cells, and also against certain other picornaviruses.

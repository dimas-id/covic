Dengue virus is considered to be the most important mosquito-borne virus worldwide and poses formidable economic and health care burdens on many tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue infection induces drastic rearrangement of host endoplasmic reticulum membranes into complex membranous structures housing replication complexes; the contribution(s) of host proteins and pathways to this process is poorly understood but is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our data sets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting data sets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both data sets. The host factors identified have diverse functions, including retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme As, and in the unfolded protein response. We selected GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for ARF activation, from the NS5 data set for follow up and functional validation. We show that GBF1 plays a critical role early in dengue infection that is independent of its role in the maintenance of Golgi structure. Importantly, the approach described here can be applied to virtually any organism/system as a tool for better understanding its molecular interactions.

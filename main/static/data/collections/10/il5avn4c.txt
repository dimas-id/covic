Efficacy of Diarex-Vet (The Himalaya Drug Company, Makali, Bangalore, India) was evaluated histologically in semichronic diarrhoea induced by lactose enriched diet in rats. The rats in different groups were given lactose enriched diet alone for 2 days before starting the treatment with Diarex-Vet at a dose of 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg body weight along with lactose enriched diet for 5 days. Animals were euthanised at the end of 5 days of treatment and histological changes were observed in the ileum, caecum and colon. Semiquantitative analysis of goblet cells in intestines showed dose dependent response among the treated groups. The morphological changes were comparable to normal in the group given 750 mg/kg body wt Diarex-Vet. The effects observed were attributed to the lactase like analogous activity of Diarex-Vet or the inhibition of the osmotic processes in the intestinal lumen thereby reducing the morphological changes in the intestines.

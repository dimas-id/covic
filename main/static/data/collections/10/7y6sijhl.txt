We report the case of an 80-year-old man treated for follicular grade 3B non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Immunochemotherapy consisted of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) every 21 days. Since the patient complained of mild dyspnea on effort with bilateral basilar crackles audible on auscultation, PET-CT was performed and showed disappearance of the initial 18F-FDG uptake, but new abnormal sites of 18F-FDG uptake were evident in the sub-pleural areas of the lung, mostly on the right side. After starting the fifth cycle of rituximab-CHOP, the dyspnea worsened. Chest-X ray and HRCT were consistent with an interstitial infiltration, including sub-pleural air-space consolidation, and “ground-glass” opacities, small pulmonary cysts and thickening of the interlobular septa were also seen. Trans-bronchial biopsy was performed and revealed interstitial inflammation of the lung parenchyma, as well as swelling and hyperplasia of atypical type II alveolar cells. Alternative diagnoses than drug-related pulmonary toxicity are discussed, and a literature review is provided.

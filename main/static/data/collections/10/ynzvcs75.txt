Abstract As Industry 4.0 sets foot as the next Industrial Revolution, it is necessary to bear in mind the new challenges from the human workforce perspective. There is a need for such challenges to inform educational and training programs, for them to enable skill development from a holistic viewpoint. Yet, most of the educational programs seem to be technological or subject-based, i.e. not skilled-based. There is an opportunity for a new approach to support and create educational programs and training for both university graduates and industry workers. This paper presents a human-centric model based on competences, age groups, and environment scenarios. The proposal supports the development of more robust means to look at educational gaps by visualizing and adapting a competency-based scenario. The aim is to provide a novel approach that is holistic, inclusive, and flexible in better preparing the future workforce.

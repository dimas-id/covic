Hepatitis caused by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), a murine coronavirus, is accompanied by direct infection and replication of virus within the liver. We demonstrate here that the aminoglycoside hygromycin B is able to eliminate MHV-A59 infection from mouse peritoneal macrophages and cultured liver cells in vitro and is also able to reduce levels of virus replication and necrotic liver foci in vivo.

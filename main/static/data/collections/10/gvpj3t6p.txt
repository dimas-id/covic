Abstract Although several methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescent assay, and Western blotting, have been used for the diagnosis of viral infections, none of them is ideal in terms of cost-effectiveness, speed, and accuracy. Currently, the rate of outbreak of emerging viruses is increasing and therefore the development and establishment of analytical methods for such viral infections are becoming more important. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a fast, multicomponent assay that enables non-invasive, non-destructive analysis. Recently, the diagnosis of viral infections using NIR spectroscopy has been attempted. In this review, the potential of the NIR method in the medical and virological fields is discussed.

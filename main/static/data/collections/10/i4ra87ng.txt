Objective The aims of this study were to introduce surgical guidelines, and to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a robotic single-site staging (RSSS) operation for early-stage endometrial cancer. Methods Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IA to IB) from endometrial curettage and preoperative imaging studies were selected at Dongsan Medical Center from March 2014 to November 2015. All surgical procedures, including hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic node dissection, and cytology aspiration, were performed by robotic single-site instruments (da Vinci SiÂ® surgical system; Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Results A total of 15 women with early-stage endometrial cancer underwent the RSSS operation. The median patient age and body mass index were 53 years (range, 37-70 years) and 25.4 kg/m2 (range, 18.3-46.4 kg/m2). The median docking time, console time, and total operative time were 8 minutes (range, 4-15 minutes), 75 minutes (range, 55-115 minutes), and 155 minutes (range, 125-190 minutes), respectively. The median retrieval of both pelvic lymph nodes was 9 (range, 6-15). There were no conversions to laparoscopy or laparotomy. Conclusion The RSSS operation is feasible and safe in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. In this study, operative times were reasonable, and the surgical procedure was well-tolerated by the patients. Further evaluation of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer should be performed in large-scale comparative studies using the laparoendoscopic, single-site staging operation to confirm the safety and benefits of the RSSS operation for early-stage endometrial cancer.

Abstract The pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) environment is well suited for simulation-based activities, be they educational interventions for PEM learners, evaluations of the interface between health providers and the environment that they work in, or research investigations using simulation as a tool to answer specific clinical questions. As such, PEM has been among the leaders in the integration of this modality for clinical training. Traditionally, simulation has been used extensively for the dissemination of clinical training in the areas of clinical knowledge and its application, and the clinical, technical, and teamwork skills involved in PEM care. Increasingly, simulation is being used in novel applications, including breaking bad news, disclosure of error, family-centered care, quality and patient safety education, and system-level integration. The future will look to further identify, measure, and inform the integration of simulation with new and innovative adjuncts in the clinical environment, as well as to determine the optimal timing and use of simulation-based education to enhance the quality of care delivered to patients by the interprofessional and multidisciplinary team.

The performance of many-objective evolutionary algorithms deteriorates appreciably in solving large-scale many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) which encompass more than hundreds variables. One of the known rationales is the curse of dimensionality. Estimation of distribution algorithms sample new solutions with a probabilistic model built from the statistics extracting over the existing solutions so as to mitigate the adverse impact of genetic operators. In this paper, an Gaussian Bayesian network-based estimation of distribution algorithm (GBNEDA-DR) is proposed to effectively tackle continued large-scale MaOPs. In the proposed algorithm, dimension reduction technique (i.e. LPP) is employed in the decision space to speed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better on many of the problems and for different decision space dimensions, and achieves comparable results on some compared with many existing algorithms.

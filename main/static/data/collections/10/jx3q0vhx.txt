This comment addresses the inadequacies of research and development for diseases endemic in developing countries and explores how the patent system can inhibit innovation for new drugs for neglected diseases. The author analyzes four strategies to encourage innovation, including open source initiatives, patent pools, prizes, and wild card patent extensions, and examines how these alternative systems may spur innovation while balancing cost concerns held by drug manufacturers and purchasers. The author concludes that a combination of solutions may provide the best framework for the creation of essential medicines for neglected diseases.

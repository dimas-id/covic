Since Homo erectus, an ancient ancestor of the modern human, was discovered to have evolved from Africa 2 million years ago, animals have been hunted for their skin and meat . Animal meat is a nutritious, a convenient, and an easily accessible source of protein in the diet. However, over the turn of the last century, a sharp increase in widespread human populations, clusters of extreme poverty in areas surrounded by wildlife, and highly profitable trade revenues have exploited bushmeat at an unprecedented level. It is at a point now whereby some species are on the brink of extinction, and others will follow suit unless a drastic change occurs. This case study will focus on the ethical demand for bushmeat, focusing on the UK and European markets, and zoonotic diseases that have caused a major threat to the existence of human and animals alike.

ARDS or acute respiratory distress syndrome continues to be a considerable critical care challenge. Mortality has not decreased significantly over the last more than 30 years. This article presents an overview of origin, evaluation, and treatment of ARDS. Recent findings relative to onset and precipitators of ARDS have led to changes in evaluation and treatment plans. Clinical and radiologic descriptors in assessment of the patient with ARDS are discussed. Ventilatory modes and nursing interventions to optimize patient outcomes are identified. The challenges of outcomes issues presented offer opportunities for further study.

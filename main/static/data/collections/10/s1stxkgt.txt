The effect of acute or chronic immunoneutralization of somatostatin (SRIF) on plasma GH, thyrotrophin (TSH) and thyroid hormones was examined. Acute responses to SRIF immunoneutralization were examined using 30 intact male lambs (19.8 +/- 0.6 kg) assigned to one of five treatment groups such that control (C) lambs received no anti-SRIF immunoglobulin and SRIF-immunized (SI) lambs received 2 mg (SI2), 10 mg (SI10), 20 mg (SI20) or 100 mg (SI100) anti-SRIF immunoglobulin/kg body weight (BW). Control immunoglobulin was administered such that all lambs received 100 mg total immunoglobulin protein/kg BW. Effects of chronic SRIF immunoneutralization were examined using C and SI100 lambs which received additional (40 mg/kg BW) control and anti-SRIF immunoglobulin respectively, 4 and 8 days following the initial dose. Blood samples were collected from all lambs, at 10-min intervals, for 5 h immediately following initial immunoglobulin infusion and, from C and SI100 lambs, at 10-min intervals, for 5 h at 11 days following initial immunoglobulin infusion. At the end of each 5-h sampling period, pituitary and thyroid function was examined by i.v. challenge with thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH; 0.33 microgram/kg BW). Basal plasma GH and thyroxine (T4) and the GH, TSH, T4 and tri-iodothyronine (T3) responses to TRH were not influenced by acute or chronic immunoneutralization of SRIF. Acute, but not chronic, immunoneutralization of SRIF elevated basal plasma T3 in SI100 lambs only. The results suggest that SRIF, under physiological conditions, does not influence GH or thyroid hormone secretion in sheep but may influence thyroid hormone metabolism acutely.

Importance. Exploring the association of coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) mortality with chronic pre-existing conditions may promote the importance of targeting these populations during this pandemic in order to optimize survival. Objective. To explore the association of pre-existing conditions with COVID-19 mortality. Data Sources. MEDLINE, the OVID databases, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched for the period October 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. Snowballing was used to identify additional studies. Study Selection. Observational studies (n=19) reporting on 61,455 patients with relative risks (RR) or hazard ratios or odds ratios that reported the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 and comorbid conditions were included for the current study. Data Extraction and Synthesis. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified. Main Outcomes and Measures The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing conditions, reported as RR. Comorbidities explored were cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and stroke. Results. Ten chronic conditions from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n=61,455 patients with COVID-19; mean age, 61 years; 57% male). Any cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer significantly increased the risk of mortality from COVID-19. Cardiovascular disease was associated with a 135% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (RR=2.35, 95%CI 1.44-3.84 n=9). The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease was 2.4 times as high as those without coronary heart disease (RR= 2.40, 95%CI=1.71-3.37, n=5) and twice as high in patients with hypertension as high as that compared to those without hypertension (RR=1.89, 95%CI= 1.58-2.27, n=9). Patients with cancer also were at twice the risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to those without cancer (RR=1.93 95%CI 1.15-3.24, n=4), and those with congestive heart failure were at 2.5 times the risk of mortality compared to those without congestive heart failure (RR=2.66, 95%CI 1.58-4.48, n=3). Conclusions and Relevance COVID-19 patients with all any cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer have an increased risk of mortality. Tailored infection prevention and treatment strategies targeting this high-risk population are warranted to optimize survival.

The authors report a case of the safe performance of radiofrequency (RF) ablations and biopsies in a patient with metastatic pheochromocytoma. The patient had previously undergone RF ablation at another institution for a tumor in her liver; that procedure was complicated by a hypertensive crisis and cardiac arrest. Our experience emphasizes that, despite a prior life-threatening complication, careful pre-, intra-, and postprocedural care to avoid a hypertensive crisis allowed safe RF ablations and biopsies in a patient with pheochromocytoma.

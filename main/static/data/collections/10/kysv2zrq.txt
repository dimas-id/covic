Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a newly identified respiratory disease that threatened Taiwan between April 14 and July 5, 2003. Chang Gung University experienced various SARS-related episodes, such as the postponement of classes for 7 days, the reporting of probable SARS cases, and the isolation of students under Level A and B quarantines. Ninety-eight percent of the students at the university live in dormitories; thus the prevention of SARS became an important issue. Preventive strategies are classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention, with a different focus and strategy for each level of prevention. The university emphasized personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle as the key to SARS prevention. Our experiences as school nurses during this crisis can help other school nurses to prevent the spread of SARS during similar situations.

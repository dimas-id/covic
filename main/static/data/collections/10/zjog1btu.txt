Light-emitting diode (LED) technology is an emerging nonthermal food processing technique that utilizes light energy with wavelengths ranging from 200 to 780 nm. Inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in water by LED treatment has been studied extensively. LED technology has also shown antimicrobial efficacy in food systems. This review provides an overview of recent studies of LED decontamination of water and food. LEDs produce an antibacterial effect by photodynamic inactivation due to photosensitization of light absorbing compounds in the presence of oxygen and DNA damage; however, such inactivation is dependent on the wavelength of light energy used. Commercial applications of LED treatment include air ventilation systems in office spaces, curing, medical applications, water treatment, and algaculture. As low penetration depth and high-intensity usage can challenge optimal LED treatment, optimization studies are required to select the right light wavelength for the application and to standardize measurements of light energy dosage.

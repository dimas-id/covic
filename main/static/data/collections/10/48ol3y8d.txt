Abstract Oropouche virus (ORO), family Bunyaviridae, is the second most frequent cause of arboviral febrile illness in Brazil. Studies were conducted to understand ORO entry in HeLa cells. Chlorpromazine inhibited early steps of ORO replication cycle, consistent with entry/uncoating. The data indicate that ORO enters HeLa cells by clathrin-coated vesicles, by a mechanism susceptible to endosomal acidification inhibitors. Transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence indicated that ORO associates with clathrin-coated pits and can be found in association with late endosomes in a time shorter than 1h.

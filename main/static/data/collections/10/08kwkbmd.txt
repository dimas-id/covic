Abstract Background COVID-19 is a new infectious disease which emerged in China in late 2019 and is now spreading around the world. Social distancing measures were needed to reduce transmission, and lockdown included restricted access to healthcare facilities. The impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients is unknown but, considering their immunosuppression status and associated comorbidities, they should be considered a high risk population. Methods A kidney transplant center in Central Italy implemented a strategy to maintain follow-up of kidney transplant recipients by phone and e-mail during lockdown. Telephone interviews were used administer a clinical questionnaire to patients, and e-mail was used to receive the results of diagnostic tests conducted in outpatient settings. Results From March 17 to April 23, 2020, a total of 143 kidney transplant recipients were contacted. Twenty-eight patients needed in-hospital consultation for problems unrelated to COVID-19, 3 of whom needed hospitalization. Eleven patients were managed at home for mild urinary or respiratory diseases, and one was referred to the hematologist. We identified 2 suspected cases of COVID-19 infection, and referred them to hospital care. Immunosuppressive therapy was modulated, and intravenous corticosteroids and potentially effective antiviral therapy were administered, with a favorable outcome. Conclusion In the context of a lockdown, such as that occurring in response to COVID-19, we suggest implementing remote surveillance programs in kidney transplant recipients, with the help of any available technology, and offering medical consulting and logistic support as needed.

Here we report a case of left upper lobe sleeve lobectomy with pulmonary arterioplasty via video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) two-port approach. A squamous cell carcinoma with stage T3N1M0 was identified on pathological examination. The bronchial anastomosis was performed using running suture with a 3-0 prolene. Two bulldog clamps were used to gain adequate vascular control. Partial pulmonary artery resection was achieved tangentially with a stapler. The postoperative course was uneventful.

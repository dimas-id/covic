To clarify the evolutionary relationships among betavoronaviruses that infect bats, we analyzed samples collected during 2010â€“2011 from 14 insectivorous bat species in China. We identified complete genomes of 2 novel betacoronaviruses in Rhinolophus pusillus and Chaerephon plicata bats, which showed close genetic relationships with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses.

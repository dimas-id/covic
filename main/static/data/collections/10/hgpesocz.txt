Tuberculosis (TB) classified as one of the most fatal contagious diseases is of prime concern globally. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent that ingresses within the host cells. The approved conventional regimen, though the only viable option available, is unfavorably impacting the quality of life of the affected individual. Despite newer antibiotics gaining light, there is an unending demand for more therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, substantial continuous endeavors are been undertaken to come up with novel strategies to curb the disease, the stepping stone being nanotechnology. This approach is instrumental in overcoming the anomalies associated with conventional therapy owing to their intriguing attributes and leads to optimization of the therapeutic effect to a certain extent. This review focusses on the different types of nanocarrier systems that are being currently explored by the researchers for the delivery of anti-tubercular drugs, the outcomes achieved by them, and their prospects.

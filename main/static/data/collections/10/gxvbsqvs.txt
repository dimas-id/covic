Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is a potential complication of cranial and spinal surgery. Postoperative CSF leakage can induce delayed healing, wound infection and meningitis. DuraSeal速 (Covidien, Waltham, MA, USA) is a synthetic product which has been increasingly used to facilitate watertight repair of dural defects after cranial and spinal surgery. Despite some advantages of Duraseal速, the authors report a patient who developed cord compression following the use of DuraSeal速 in cervical spine surgery in which the expansion of the DuraSeal速 was believed to be the causative factor.

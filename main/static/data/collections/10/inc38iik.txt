A $115 million collaboration to tackle the rapidly spreading viral disease COVID-19, led by heavy hitters of Boston science and funded by a Chinese property development company, kicked off today as the group’s leaders pledged to take on the virus on many fronts The project brings together researchers at many of the city’s top academic institutions, along with local biotechnology companies such as Moderna Those leading it hope they can quickly funnel money into studies that will build off a new repository of samples from infected people and community surveillance, materials that can be rapidly shared among scientists The project, they anticipate, should answer critical questions about how COVID-19 is spreading and how best to prevent and treat infections

Like other human pathogenic viruses, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 employs sophisticated macromolecular machines for viral host cell entry, genome replication and protein processing. Such machinery encompasses SARS-CoV-2 envelope spike (S) glycoprotein required for host cell entry by binding to the ACE2 receptor, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3-chymotrypsin-like main protease (3Clpro/Mpro). Under the pressure of the accelerating COVID-19 pandemic caused by the outbreak of SARSCoV- 2 in Wuhan, China in December 2019, novel and repurposed drugs were recently designed and identified for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction machinery, with the aim to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The use of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as a critical determinant of what should be covered by a health system is a growing trend. This presents challenges when applied to rapidly evolving technologies. The case study here focuses on the example of drug-eluting stents and the four-year change in cost-effectiveness as determined by the U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). We contend that classic cost-effectiveness as a blunt instrument for determining what should be covered may lead to erroneous conclusions when a broader perspective and the impact on health outcomes and costs are considered.

CD8+ T cells are crucial for immunity against viral infections, including HIV. Several characteristics of CD8+ T cells, such as polyfunctionality and cytotoxicity, have been correlated with effective control of HIV. However, most of these correlates have been established in the peripheral blood. Meanwhile, HIV primarily replicates in lymphoid tissues. Therefore, it is unclear which aspects of CD8+ T cell biology are shared and which are different between blood and lymphoid tissues in the context of HIV infection. In this review, we will recapitulate the latest advancements of our knowledge on lymphoid tissue CD8+ T cells during HIV infection and discuss the insights these advancements might provide for the development of a HIV cure.

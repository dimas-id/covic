Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is sweeping across the globe, having sickened more than 640,000 people and claimed over 30,000 lives in approximately 202 countries at the time of writing with no sign of slowing down (World Health Organization, 2020). Each time a pandemic or an epidemic disease occurs, such as measles, scarlet fever, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, or the flu of 2013, healthcare professionals are on the front lines, battling diseases and caring for sick and dying patients, even while knowingly putting themselves at risk (Borghese, Di Donato, Ruotolo, & Fiegender, 2020).

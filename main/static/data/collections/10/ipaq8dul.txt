The clearance of cytomegalovirus viraemia in HIV-1-infected patients may partly result from the inhibition of cytomegalovirus protease by HIV-1 protease inhibitors contained in highly active antiretroviral therapy. We used a computational method to calculate the binding affinity of six HIV-1 protease inhibitors to cytomegalovirus protease based on its X-ray crystallography structure. The calculations showed that amprenavir and indinavir occupy the substrate-binding site of the cytomegalovirus protease with high affinity, and may be implicated in alleviating cytomegalovirus infection.

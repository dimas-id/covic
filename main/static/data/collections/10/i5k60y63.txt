Abstract Concept of “risk analysis” in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. “Food safety controls” are now being replaced by “risk-based controls” in all stages of food production.

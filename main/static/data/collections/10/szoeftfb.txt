Abstract Introduction Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a disease with a high mortality and morbidity rate, and the pathogenesis of PE remains still unclear. We aimed to investigate the gene expression differences of the complement system in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with symptomatic PE and controls. Methods Twenty cases of PE patients and twenty sex and age matched controls were recruited into the study. Human cDNA microarray analysis was used to detect the gene expression difference of the complement system between the two groups. Results 1). Expression of twenty-one genes encoding complement components was detected. In PE patients, expression of the genes encoding C1qα, C1qβ, C4b, C5 and Factor P was significantly greater (P<0.05) than controls, while C6, C7, C9, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (MASP1) mRNAs were lower (P<0.05) than controls. 2). Expression of seven genes encoding complement receptors was examined. In PE patients, CR1, integrin αM, integrin αX and C5aR mRNAs were significantly up-regulated (P<0.01) compared with controls. 3). Seven genes encoding complement regulators were examined. The mRNA expression of CD59 and CD55 was significantly up-regulated (P<0.05), whereas Factor I mRNA was significantly down-regulated (P<0.05) in PE patients than controls. Conclusions In PE patients, the mRNA expressions of complement components, receptors and regulators were unbalanced, suggesting dysfunction and/or deficiency of the complement system, which leads to decreased function of MAC-induced cell lysis in PE patients finally.

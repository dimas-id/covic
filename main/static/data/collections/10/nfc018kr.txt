A persistent viral infection is one in which the virus in a replicating or non-replicating form persists in the host beyond the normal recovery and elimination period for that particular viral infection. The clinical significance and mechanisms of persistence, when known, are discussed for the important viral infections of dogs and cats. Particular emphasis is given to feline viral rhinotracheitis, feline calicivirus, canine distemper, and feline leukemia.

The COVID-19 pandemic is placing huge strain on health systems and professionals. Emergency departments and their pharmacy services have been the first to face this challenge before any other pharmacy units. This article provides a description of the experience of two public hospitals located in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, Spain. Team working and reciprocal trust have made it possible to meet the unprecedented demand for health services and has facilitated rapid decision making. Strategies have been developed to guarantee the availability, distribution and safe use of medications. Other strategies have included favoring communication within Emergency Departments pharmacy services, and between these services and Emergency Departments during the pandemic. Multidisciplinary cooperation and information sharing have traditionally formed the base for efficient and quality work, along with solid technologies that guarantee a safe use of medications. The crucial role of information and communication technologies during the pandemic may give rise to a new model of pharmaceutical care, which should not replace face-to- face Emergency Department pharmacist support and advice. Promoting the re- humanization of healthcare and pharmacy services is essential. An adequate technical training and the development of abilities such as flexibility, planning and coordination skills, and an assertive communication and management of emotions will be key to the successful management of unimaginable settings in the future.

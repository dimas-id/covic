It is necessary to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharge to reduce exposure risks to humans and the environment. The currently practiced wastewater disinfection technologies are challenged by toxic by-products, chemicals and energy demand, a range of effectiveness limitations, among other concerns. An effective, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient alternative disinfection technique is desirable to modernize and enhance wastewater treatment operations. Copper and nickel micro-structured metal foams, and a conventional copper mesh, were evaluated as disinfecting surfaces for treating secondary-treated wastewater contaminated with coliform bacteria. The micro-structured copper foam was adopted for scale-up study, due to its stable and satisfactory bactericidal performance obtained over a wide range of bacterial concentrations and metal-to-liquid ratios. Three scales of experiments, using two types of reactor designs, were performed using municipal wastewater to determine the optimal scale-up factors: small lab-scale batch reactor, intermediate lab-scale batch reactor, and pilot-scale continuous tubular reactor experiments. The performance was evaluated with the aim of minimizing metal material requirement with respect to bactericidal efficiency and leaching risks at all scales. Copper foam, at or above optimal conditions, consistently inactivated over 95% of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and E.coli in wastewater at various scales, and leachate copper concentrations were determined to be below Canadian guideline values for outfall. This study successfully implemented the “structure” strategy of process intensification, and opens up the possibility to apply micro-structured copper foam in a range of other water disinfection systems, from pre-treatment to point-of-use, and should thus become a topic of further research.

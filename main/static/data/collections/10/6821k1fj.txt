Patient test samples are taken and examined at outpatient clinics, in bed posts and at policlinic consultations and treatment units. They are collected and transported to central laboratories or examined by smaller laboratory units, adapted to the patient group. Samples are sent in pipes or transported by defined methods to the laboratory. A large number of samples are also sent to other hospitals, laboratories or diverse private laboratories. The following chapter is focused on laboratory safety for patients and personnel to avoid spread of infections between patients, personnel and environment.

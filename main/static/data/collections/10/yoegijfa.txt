Recent evidence supports the use of prosthetic reinforcement material during laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair; however, the search for appropriate prosthetic materials is still under investigation. In this article, the technical feasibility and the short-term outcomes of the use of polyester composite mesh for crural reinforcement was determined. A small series of patients with large paraesophageal hiatal hernias underwent laparoscopic repair with mesh (5 males; mean age = 62 +/- 10 years; mean body mass index = 29 +/- 1 kg/m2, and mean American Society of Anesthesiologists = 3 +/- .4). There were no postoperative complications, deaths, or evidence of hernia recurrence documented by barium study at a median follow-up of 9 months. The use of the polyester composite mesh is technically feasible, has excellent intracorporeal handling characteristics, and holds suture readily. The short-term outcomes of the use of the polyester composite mesh for paraesophageal hernia repair reinforcement appeared to be favorable and are encouraging.

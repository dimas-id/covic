Digital finance is going to be heavily affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. We present a statistical model which can be employed to understand the contagion dynamics of the COVID-19, so that its impact on finance can possibly be anticipated, and digitally monitored. The model is a Poisson autoregression of the daily new observed cases, and considers both short-term and long-term dependence in the infections counts. Model results are presented for the observed time series of China, the first affected country, but can be easily reproduced for all countries.

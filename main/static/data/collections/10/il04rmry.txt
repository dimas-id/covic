In 2005, the economic gap between developing and developed countries is bigger than ever, and this has consequences for public health. So, to sustain education and research in the most resource-constrained regions, it is necessary to promote local teaching of the immunology of infectious diseases. This Perspective article reviews the use and expected efficiency of current Internet-based tools for higher education in the biomedical sciences in developing countries. We also discuss other approaches to improve access to updated training in immunology for students in the poorest countries.

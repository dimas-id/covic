The expression of a biologically active human IFNλ4 depends on the presence of a frameshift deletion polymorphism within the first exon of the interferon lambda 4 (IFNL4) gene. In this report, we use the lung carcinoma-derived cell line, A549, which is genetically viable to express a functional IFNλ4, to address transcriptional requirements of the IFNL4 gene. We show that the GC-rich DNA-binding transcription factor (TF) specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is recruited to the IFNL4 promoter and has a role in induction of gene expression upon stimulation with viral RNA mimic poly(I:C). By using RNAi and overexpression strategies, we also show key roles in IFNL4 gene expression for the virus-inducible TFs, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7. Interestingly, we also observe that overexpression of IFNλ4 influences IFNL4 promoter activity, which may further be dependent on the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor pathway. Together, our work for the first time reports on the functional characterization of the human IFNL4 promoter.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS)-CoV-2. In the light of the urgent need to identify novel approaches to be used in the emergency phase, a largely explored strategy has been the repurpose of clinically available drugs as new antivirals, by targeting different viral proteins. In this paper, we describe a drug repurposing strategy based on a virtual screening of druggable pockets located in the central Î²-sheet core of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD supported by in vitro tests identifying several steroidal derivatives as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that several potential binding sites exist in the SARS CoV-2 S protein, and that the occupancy of these pockets reduces the ability of the S protein RBD to bind to the ACE2 consensus in vitro. In particular, natural occurring and clinically available steroids as glycyrrhetinic and oleanolic acids, as well as the bile acids derivatives glyco-UDCA and obeticholic acid have been shown to be effective in preventing virus entry in the case of low viral load. All together, these results might help to define novel approaches to reduce the viral load by using SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors.

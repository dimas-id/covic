BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common acute and severe disease in clinic. Recent studies indicated that Cxc chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), an inflammatory chemokine, was associated with tumorigenesis. The present study investigated the role of the CXCL5/Cxc chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) bio-axis in ARDS, and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL/METHODS: The pathological morphology of lung tissue and degree of pulmonary edema were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and pulmonary edema score, respectively. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression levels of CXCL5, CXCR2, Matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2), and Matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) in lung tissues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine the expression levels of CXCL5 and inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10) in serum. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary edema appeared in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS and were positively correlated with the severity of ARDS. In addition, CXCL5 and its receptor CXCR2 were overexpressed by upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues of ARDS. In addition, CXCL5 neutralizing antibody effectively alleviated inflammatory response, diffuse alveolar damage, and pulmonary edema, and decreased the expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 compared to LPS-induced ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CXCL5/CXCR2 accelerated the progression of ARDS, partly by upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues with the release of inflammatory factors.

An extended dynamic model for SARS epidemic was deduced on the basis of the K-M infection model with taking the density constraint of susceptible population and the cure and death rates of patients into consideration. It is shown that the infection-free equilibrium is the global asymptotic stability under given conditions, and endemic equilibrium is not the asymptotic stability. It comes to the conclusion that the epidemic system is the permanent persistence existence under appropriate conditions.

In the midst of pandemic and chaos, the world did not cease. Although shelter-in-place was mandated, advance practice nursing students did not waiver. The Class of 2021 advance practice nurses will enter preventive and tertiary care with patience and resiliency. While healthcare facilities were limiting non-essential staff and visitors, the Class of 2021 did not stop. While working as full-time nurses and preparing our families for the worse care scenarios, we did not deter from our goals. Rather we found new goals through reflection and will be better prepared to face the unknown.

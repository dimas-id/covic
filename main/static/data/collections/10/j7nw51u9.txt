AIM Flow diverters were popular tools for treating intracranial aneurysms in the last decade. The DerivoÂ® embolisation device (DED) is a new-generation flow diverter designed to treat cerebrovascular aneurysms. The safety and efficacy of flow diverters and their long-term clinical outcome must be investigated. In the present study, the clinical outcomes of using the DED on 182 aneurysms are presented Material and Methods: In total, 146 patients with 182 aneurysms were treated with DED. The mean age of the participants was 51.5 years; among them, 46 (31.5%) presented with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. The mean aneurysm size was 8.3 mm, and 12 aneurysms were involved the vertebrobasilar system. Ophthalmic aneurysms account for most internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. RESULTS The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 patients was 15. DED was associated with a mortality rate of 2.7% and permanent morbidity rate of 3.4%, and a complete aneurysm occlusion rate was achieved in 78.7% of cases after 7.02 months Conclusion: The DED device is a new-generation flow diverter with excellent opening behaviour and navigational benefits. Our results indicated a safe aneurysm occlusion with optimum morbidity and mortality values despite the fact that almost one-third of the patients presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage.

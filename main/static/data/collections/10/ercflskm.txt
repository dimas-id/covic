All rights reserved Abstract: A simple clinical screening (CS) tool for respiratory virus (RV) infection was introduced and evaluated in a single hematology ward, as part of a strategy to reduce nosocomial RV infection. Up to 6 clinical symptoms or signs were scored and a predefined threshold score of ≥2 prompted paired nose/throat swab (NTS) collection for RV testing. The criterion standard for RV infection was positive immunofluorescence (IF) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 7 and 15 viruses, respectively. The tool was shown to be most beneficial at excluding infection at a threshold score of 1 (negative predictive value [NPV] 89%, [95% confidence interval 78–96%], sensitivity 85% [70–94%], specificity 35% [27–43%]), compared with a score of 2 (NPV 85% [76–91%], sensitivity 63% [46–77%], specificity 57% [48–65%]) at a prevalence of 22%. The tool's ability to diagnose infection was limited (positive predictive value 27% and 29% at thresholds 1 and 2). The sensitivity of IF compared with PCR was 45% for the 7 viruses common to both, and 23% for the extended virus panel detected by PCR. An algorithm incorporating CS, paired NTS collection at a threshold of 1 symptom or sign, and sensitive testing including PCR can guide infection control measures in hospitalized hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

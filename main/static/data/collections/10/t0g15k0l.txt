The Hill equation, which models the cooperative ligand-receptor binding equilibrium, turns out to be useful in modeling the progression of infectious disease outbreaks such as CoViD-19. The equation fits well the data for total and daily case numbers, allows tentative predictions for the half-point and end point of the epidemic, and presents a mathematical characterization of how social interventions "flatten the curve" of the disease progression.

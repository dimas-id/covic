Electron microscopic examination of stool samples from 195 infants and young children with acute gastroenteritis revealed rota virus in 31 samples (= 16%), corona virus in 44 samples (= 23%) and adenovirus in 13 samples (= 7%). Viruses were excreted for between 4 and 8 days in patients infected with rota virus and corona virus respectively. An outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in a premature baby unit with 24 cases is reported: corona virus was found in the stools of 15 infants. It is suggested that corona virus as well as rota virus may cause gastroenteritis in infants and small children.

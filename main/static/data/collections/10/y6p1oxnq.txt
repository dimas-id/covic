Cyclic peptides are found in a diverse range of organisms and are characterized by their stability and role in defense. Why is only one class of cyclic peptides found in mammals? Possibly we have not looked hard enough for them, or the technologies needed to identify them are not fully developed. We also do not yet understand their intriguing biosynthesis from two separate gene products. Addressing these challenges will require the application of chemical tools and insights from other classes of cyclic peptides. Herein, we highlight recent developments in the characterization of theta defensins and describe the important role that chemistry has played in delineating their modes of action. Furthermore, we emphasize the potential of theta defensins as antimicrobial agents and scaffolds for peptide drug design.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical performance of percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) for treatment of locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer (LAPC). MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-two MWA sessions (August 2015-March 2017) in 20 patients with primary pancreatic cancer (13 men, 7 women, mean-age: 59.9 ± 8.6 years, range: 46-73 years), who had given informed consent, were retrospectively evaluated. All procedures were performed percutaneously under CT-guidance using the same high-frequency (2.45-GHz) MWA device. Tumor location and diameter, ablation diameter and volume, roundness, duration, technical success and efficacy, output energy, complications, and local tumor progression defined as a tumor focus connected to the edge of a previously technically efficient ablation zone were collected. RESULTS Seventeen pancreatic malignant tumors (77.3%) were located in the pancreatic head and five (22.7%) in the pancreatic tail. Initial Mean Tumor Diameter was 30 ± 6 mm. Technical success and efficacy were idem (100%). No major complications occurred. Two patients (9.1%) showed minor complications of severe local pain related to MWA. Post-ablation diameter was on average 34.4 ± 5.8 mm. Mean ablation volume was 7.8 ± 3.8 cm³. The mean transverse roundness index was 0.74 ± 0.14. Mean ablation time was 2.6 ± 0.96 min. The mean applied energy per treatment was 9627 ± 3953 J. Local tumor progression was documented in one case (10%) of the 10/22 available three-month follow-up imaging studies. CONCLUSION High-frequency (2.45 GHz) microwave ablation (MWA) for treatment of unresectable and non-metastatic locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer (LAPC) shows promising results regarding feasibility and safety of percutaneous approach after short-term follow-up and should be further evaluated.

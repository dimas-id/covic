Factories are segregated primarily for protecting the product from the environment, segregation of raw materials and finished product, segregation of wet and dry materials, provision of mechanical and electrical services and health and safety issues (e.g. boiler rooms, chemical stores, fire hazards, noise limitation). Ready-to-eat (RTE) products factories have begun to further segregate or ‘zone’ production areas for food safety or hygiene reasons. A series of higher hygiene zones have been created to protect the product from microbiological cross-contamination events after it has been heat treated or decontaminated. There has also been the recognition that non-microbiological hazards, particularly allergens, and label declaration issues such as ‘suitable for vegetarians’, ‘organic’, ‘does not contain GM materials’ or ‘Kosher/Halal’ have to be controlled by segregating them from other product ingredients.

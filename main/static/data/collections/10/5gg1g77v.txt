We investigated by Western Blotting the antibody responses against the three major structural proteins of Canine coronavirus (CCoV) in dogs naturally infected. A pool of Elisa positive sera were also tested to clearly identify the binding profiles of CCoV proteins. The immune response to S protein was barely detectable in naturally infected dogs, whereas anti-M and anti-N antibodies were detected with a very strong reaction and for a long time post infection. The limited response to S protein may explain the poor protection of dogs and the possibility of persisting infection.

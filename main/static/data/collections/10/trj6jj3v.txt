The synthesis of a new group of triterpenoid acylates has been conducted on the basis of oleanolic, glycyrrhetic, and ursolic acids and betulin. 28-ortho-Methoxycynnamoylbetulin has been demonstrated to possess high activity against the influenza type A (H1N1) virus with the selectivity index SI > 100 while studying the activity of the synthesized compounds in relation to the reproduction of viral pathogens of respiratory infections. The high activity of 3,28-dinicotinoylbetulin against the papilloma virus (strain HPV-11) was detected with the selectivity index SI 35.

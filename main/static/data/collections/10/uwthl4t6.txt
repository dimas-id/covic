Abstract Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed 6 hr per day for 14 consecutive days to aged and diluted sidestream smoke (ADSS), used as a surrogate for Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), at concentrations of 0.1 (typical), 1 (extreme), or 10 (exaggerated) mg of particulates per cubic meter. Animals were exposed nose-only, inside whole-body chambers, to ADSS from the 1R4F reference cigarette. End-points included histopathology, CO-oximetry, plasma nicotine and cotinine, clinical pathology, and organ and body weights. The only pathological response observed was slight to mild epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation in the most rostral part of the nasal cavity, in the high-exposure group only. No effects were noted at medium or low exposures. The minimal changes noted were reversible, using a subgroup of animals kept without further treatment for an additional 14 days. Overall, the end-points used in the study demonstrated that there was no detectable biological activity of ADSS at typical or even 10-fold ETS concentrations and that the activity was only minimal at very exaggerated concentrations (particle concentrations 100 times higher than typical real-world concentrations).

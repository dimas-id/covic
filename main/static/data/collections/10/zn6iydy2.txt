Infectious disease models are mathematical descriptions of the spread of infection. The majority of infectious disease models consider the spread of infection from one host to another and are sometimes grouped together as “mathematical epidemiology.” A growing body of work considers the spread of infection within an individual, often with a particular focus on interactions between the infectious agent and the host’s immune responses. Such models are sometimes grouped together as “within-host models.” Most recently, new models have been developed that consider host–pathogen interactions at two levels simultaneously: both within-host dynamics and between-host transmissions. Infectious disease models vary widely in their complexity, in their attempts to refer to data from real-life infections and in their focus on problems of an applied or more fundamental nature. This entry will focus on simpler models tightly tied to data and aimed at addressing well-defined practical problems.

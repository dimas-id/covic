We generalize the class of input strictly local string functions (Chandlee et al. 2014) to tree functions. We show they are characterized by a subclass of frontier-to-root, deterministic, linear tree transducers. We motivate this class from the study of natural language as it provides a way to distinguish local syntactic processes from non-local ones. We give examples illustrating this kind of analysis.

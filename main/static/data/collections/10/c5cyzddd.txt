Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In immunocompetent individuals, the infection is usually subclinical but it can sometimes be life threatening. We describe a case of fatal CMV proctitis in a 71-year-old man following an Ivorâ€“Lewis esophagectomy. After surgery he developed renal failure, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He recovered but developed melena and massive fresh rectal bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy revealed severe proctitis and a biopsy was consistent with ischemia. Despite undergoing a proctectomy he continued to bleed and died despite every effort. The final histological examination of the rectum revealed a CMV infection.

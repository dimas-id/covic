OBJECTIVE To compare surgical outcomes for robotic vs laparotomy staging in obese endometrial cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m(2) staged in a community gynecologic oncology practice. Patients undergoing robotic staging were compared with historic laparotomy controls. RESULTS One hundred twenty-nine patients underwent robotic staging, compared with 110 laparotomy patients. The robotic cohort had fewer abdominal wound complications (13.9% vs 32.7%, P < .001), but more vaginal cuff complications (4.7% vs 0%, P = .032). Blood loss was lower in the robotic group (P < .001), as was length of stay (P < .001). Surgical times were longer in the robotic group (P < .001). There was no difference in terms of percentage of patients undergoing pelvic or paraaortic lymph node dissection. CONCLUSION Robotic staging for endometrial cancer is feasible in obese women, with fewer abdominal wound complications, but more vaginal cuff complications.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Abdominopelvic abscess is a serious, but infrequent, postoperative complication of sacrocolpopexy, which a priori requires a second surgery to debride the affected tissue and dry out the infected mesh in addition to a prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. METHODS We present two cases of post-surgical abdominopelvic abscesses, treated with conservative management using ultrasound-guided transcervical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Both patients underwent a favorable evolution without needing the removal of the mesh. CONCLUSIONS Because of the search for new alternatives to avoid mesh removal and the comorbidity associated with a second surgery, transcervical drainage is a treatment to be considered in selected cases.

OBJECTIVES To introduce the surgical techniques of a single-port transvesical enucleation of the prostate (STEP) for enlarged prostates with severe intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). PATIENTS AND METHODS Our study included 7 patients with prostates larger than 80 mL and with severe IPP who underwent STEP. All the procedures were performed using a home-made single-port device through a 3-cm midline incision at the level three fingerbreadths above the symphysis pubis. Rigid laparoscopic instruments and Harmonic Scalpels(®) were used to enucleate the large adenoma of the prostate. RESULTS All the procedures were completed satisfactorily, with no intra and early postoperative complications. The mean resected prostatic weight was 54.14 ± 8.38 g, and the mean operative time was 191.86 ± 40.88 min. The mean time for catheterization was 5.29 ± 1.80 days. The postoperative 3-month international prostate symptoms score (IPSS) and maximal flow rate (Qmax) were improved following STEP (IPSS; 23.57 ± 2.15 vs. 11.43 ± 2.44, Qmax; 17.14 ± 3.44 mL/s vs. 6.71 ± 2.29 mL/s). CONCLUSIONS Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and enucleation of the prostate with rigid laparoscopic instruments might be difficult but is feasible. STEP may be a new treatment option for use in open prostatectomies for enlarged prostates with severe IPP in carefully selected patients.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of the Solitaire FR device in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to large artery occlusion. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke treated with Solitaire FR as the first-line device to restore blood flow in 6 experienced European centers. This study was entirely funded and supported by Coviden Neurovascular. An independent Corelab determined modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores on the preprocedure and postprocedure angiograms. Complete revascularization was defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3 post-Solitaire FR device use. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage Type 2 associated with a decline of ≥ 4 points in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score within 24 hours or causing death. Favorable functional outcome was considered as modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2 at Day 90. RESULTS We studied 141 patients (mean age, 66 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 18); 74 patients received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator before endovascular treatment. Complete revascularization was achieved in 120 of 142 occlusion sites (85%) and good outcome in 77 of 141 (55%) patients. Good outcome was more frequent in patients treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator than in those without (66% versus 42%; P<0.01). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was reported in 5 patients (4%) and 29 of 141 (20%) patients died or were lost during follow-up (3 cases). CONCLUSIONS This retrospective study with centralized evaluation shows that the use of Solitaire FR is safe and achieves good revascularization rates and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke and large artery occlusion.

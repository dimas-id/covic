PURPOSE To describe the technique of percutaneous stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) and its application in a patient with an unresectable multifocal intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). MATERIALS AND METHODS A 72-year-old man presented with two nodules of an ICC with a maximum diameter of 10 and 4 cm, respectively. To produce overlapping ablation areas and cover the entire tumor volume, 18 paths for the placement of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probes at multiple locations were planned on 2D and 3D reconstructions of the computed tomographic (CT) data. The 15-gauge coaxial needles were advanced through the aiming device to the preplanned depth. A control CT fused to the planning CT data confirmed correct needle placements. RFA was performed with an impedance-based multiple-electrode RFA system. Fusion of the contrast-enhanced control CT with the planning CT showed an appropriate zone of ablation. RESULTS Besides a mild asymptomatic pleural effusion, no complications occurred. Twenty-seven months after the first RFA, two new small distant liver metastases were successfully treated by SRFA. Currently, 38 months after diagnosis and 36 months after the first SRFA, the patient is free of detectable disease. CONCLUSION SRFA seems to offer an effective treatment option in selected patients with even unresectable ICC.

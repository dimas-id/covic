Abstract The infectious bronchitis virus Middle-East GI-23 lineage (Var2-like) was observed on a German broiler farm, for the first time. The animals suffered from respiratory and nephropathogenic disease. Gross lesions observed during necropsy included tracheitis, aerosacculitis, and nephritis. Tracheal swabs were tested positive for infectious bronchitis virus Middle-East GI-23 lineage (Var2-like) by PCR. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the S1 spike protein showed close relationship to the commercially available vaccine TAbic IBVAR206 and polish isolates.

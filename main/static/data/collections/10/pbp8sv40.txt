BACKGROUND Multiple professional bodies have temporarily revised recommendations for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) testing during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce person-to-person contact. The current Australian temporary criteria advise that if the fasting glucose is ≤4.6 mmol/L, then no glucose tolerance test (GTT) is required. AIMS The aim of this study is to examine the extent of underdiagnosis of GDM using a fasting glucose ≤4.6 mmol/L as a cut-off to determine that a GTT is not necessary. MATERIALS AND METHODS De-identified data from pregnant women having a GTT test in the Illawarra area during a six-year period was used to determine the number of women with GDM and the proportion of positive cases that would be missed for different fasting glucose values. RESULTS There were 16 522 results identified and GDM was diagnosed in 12.2%. The majority of women were more than 30 years of age (85.2%) and diagnosed at ≥20 weeks gestation (81.1%). Of those diagnosed with GDM, 29% had a fasting glucose of ≤4.6 mmol/L and would have been missed. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that using a fasting glucose of 4.6 mmol/L or less would miss nearly a third of women who would otherwise be diagnosed with GDM.

Influenza has circulated among humans for centuries and kills more people than many newly emerging diseases. The present methods for control of influenza are not adequate, especially for dealing with a pandemic. In the face of a rapidly spreading outbreak, a race to isolate the virus and prepare a vaccine would probably not succeed in time to avoid great losses. Thus, additional anti-infection strategies are needed. Broad cross-protection against widely divergent influenza A subtypes is readily achieved in animals by several means of immunization. How does cross-protection work in animals, and can we apply what we have learned about it to induce broad cross-protection in humans?

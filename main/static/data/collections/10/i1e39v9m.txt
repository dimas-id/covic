Despite ongoing medical advances, cardiovascular disease continues to be a leading health concern. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in regulating cardiovascular function, and is, therefore, the subject of extensive study. Several drugs currently used to treat hypertension and heart failure are designed to target angiotensin II synthesis and function, but thus far, none have been able to completely block the effects of RAS signaling. This review discusses current and emerging approaches towards inhibiting cardiac RAS function in order to further improve cardiovascular disease outcomes.

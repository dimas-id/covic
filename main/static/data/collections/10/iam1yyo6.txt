Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be an option for patients with lung tumors who have unresectable disease and are not suitable for available palliative modalities. RFA electrode positioning may take several attempts, necessitating multiple imaging acquisitions or continuous use of computed tomography. Electromagnetic tracking uses miniature sensors integrated with RFA equipment to guide tools in real time, while referencing to preprocedure imaging. This technology was demonstrated successfully during a lung tumor ablation, and this was more accurate at targeting the tumor compared with traditional freehand needle insertion. It is possible, although speculative and anecdotal, that more accuracy could prevent unnecessary repositioning punctures and decrease radiation exposure. Electromagnetic tracking has theoretical potential to benefit minimally invasive interventions.

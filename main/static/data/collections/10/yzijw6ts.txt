Surgical site infections are a common source of post-operative morbidity and contribute significantly to healthcare costs. Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy and/or bowel surgery are particularly at risk. Prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been shown to reduce wound infection. However, to date, there has been a lack of consensus around its use for closed laparotomy wounds. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials comparing the use of prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy with standard dressings for closed laparotomy incisions. The primary outcome was incidence of incisional surgical site infection (SSI) at 30 days post-operatively. Secondary outcomes included superficial and deep SSI, skin dehiscence, fascial dehiscence and length of stay. A total of 2182 publications were identified, of which, following review of titles, abstracts and full texts, five studies met the criteria for inclusion. Across these studies, 467 patients were randomised to NPWT and 464 to standard dressings. Overall SSI rate was 18.6% (n = 87/467) versus 23.9% (n = 111/464) in the NPWT and standard dressing groups, respectively (Odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52â€“0.99, p = 0.04*). Deep SSI incidence was the same in both groups (2.6%). Both skin dehiscence and fascial dehiscence were slightly higher in the standard dressing group ((4.2%, n = 11/263 versus 3.1% (n = 8/261) and (0.9% (n = 3/324) versus 0.6% (n = 2/323)), respectively. This study observed that NPWT reduces the overall SSI for closed laparotomy wounds. It supports data recommending the use of prophylactic NPWT dressings, especially in high-risk patients in both emergency and elective circumstances.

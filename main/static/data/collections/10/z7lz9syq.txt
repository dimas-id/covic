Abstract The objective of this report is to better understand the initial CT imaging spectrum and the relationship between clinical characteristics and initial CT imaging features of an imported family cluster cases involving 7 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We find that initial CT findings of 4 patients were positive within one week after the onset of symptoms and 1 patient was negative before the onset of symptoms. Two asymptomatic patients had typical CT abnormalities. The initial CT imaging manifestations are mainly peripheral or subpleural ground-glass opacities and ground-glass with consolidation. Our report is of potential guiding value for the initial CT screening of imported familial cluster cases since the imported cases have an identified time of infection.

OBJECTIVE Human Salivirus (SalV) has been associated with gastroenteritis on all continents. METHODS This paper presents the real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of SalV in clinical fecal samples collected from 192 hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis in Piedmont, Italy. RESULTS The most commonly detected virus was Norovirus genogroup II (GII) (33.8%), followed by Rotavirus (21.3%), Sapovirus (10.9%), Parechovirus (8%), Norovirus GI (6.7%), and Adenovirus (1%). PCR detected SalV in 1 (0.5%) subject. CONCLUSIONS Our data show that the detection rate of SalV in diarrheal children (0.5%) is lower than that observed in other countries, where it is reported in diarrheal children in 8.6-1.2% of patients.

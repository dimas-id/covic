The main purpose of this review is to analyze some aspects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, in order to obtain useful data to suggest preventive actions to reduce the spreading of the disease. Many elements have been examined to reach some conclusions and to allow an updated discussion. Surgical masks protect more the patient than the caregiver. Simple or double surgical masks may be useful, as double gloving protects the hands of the surgical personnel against percutaneous transmission of HIV eventually present in contaminated blood. The frequent substitution of the external masks with a new one will improve the filtering activity against droplets produced by cough or sneezes of the patient. The use of respiratory masks may be suggested in hospitals or in restricted ventilated areas where, even if coronavirus variant is considered an environmental contaminant more than a respiratory risk, droplets nuclei may persist in the air and add consistent dangers to the heath-care givers. Considering that large and medium droplets may infect floors and surfaces, in addition to gloves, gowns, masks and eyes protection, the available list of viral and bacterial factors implicated in SARS ethiology suggests a better hand antisepsis using frequently the alcohol based gels (containing an high percentage of emollients substances), if available. A liquid soap with triclosan can also be used, if the health-care workers compliance to hand washing increases, as expected in this explosive situation. On the basis of the results of some experimental data, the environmental disinfection may be effected with ethyl alcohol 70% in water. Disinfection of floors or larger surfaces may be obtained with chlorine compounds solutions, after an accurate pre-cleaning. When corrosion, bleaching or gas production have to be avoided, chlorine compounds may be substituted by phenolic detergent disinfectants.

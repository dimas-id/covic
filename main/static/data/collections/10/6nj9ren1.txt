Routine prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been recommended after surgery not only in the West but also in Asia recently. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of enoxaparin as a prophylaxis in patients undergoing distal, proximal, or total gastrectomy (TG) for gastric cancers. A total of 565 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were reviewed retrospectively. About 256 patients received postoperative prophylaxis with enoxaparin (2000 international unit twice daily for at least six days) and compression stockings; these patients were assigned to the enoxaparin group. About 257 patients comprised a historical control group, who used only compression stockings as a thromboprophylaxis. All patients underwent the same rehabilitation programs during the perioperative period. None of the patients developed symptomatic venous thromboembolism in either the enoxaparin group or the control group. The complication rate of bleeding was not significantly different between the two groups. Only one patient who used three antiplatelet agents concomitantly with enoxaparin required reoperation for anastomotic site bleeding. The usage of enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is safe for Japanese patients after gastrectomy. But, cautious application is still needed especially when used concomitantly with other antiplatelet agents.

The treatment of COVID-19 infection poses an increasing challenge to the Hungarian healthcare system and, in particular, to the anesthesiology and intensive care professions responsible for the care of critically ill patients. An essential condition for effective care is to protect intensive care unit staff from the spread of infection during day-to-day patient care and to make knowledge about them widely known. Based on practical considerations, the authors summarize the most important organizational, treatment, and prevention tasks related to intensive care for COVID-19 patients.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of cardiovascular disease (CVD) on the global pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we analyzed the cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Wuhan.MethodsâandâResults:Data were extracted from the medical records. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. A total of 33 (53.2%) of 62 cases with CVD, who had higher prevalence of severe COVID-19 compared with non-CVD patients (P=0.027). The median age of all patients was 66.0 (53.3, 73.0) years old. Coronary artery disease (11.3%) and hypertension (38.7%) were the common coexisting CVDs in COVID-19 patients. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), creatinine, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, and D-dimer levels in the severe COVID-19 with CVD group were higher than in the non-severe COVID-19 with CVD group (P<0.05). For all patients, chest computed tomography (CT) showed ground-glass opacity (66.1%), local (21.0%), bilateral (77.4%), and interstitial abnormalities (4.8%). In COVID-19 patients with CVD, 27 (81.8%) were cured and discharged. 6 (18.2%) remained in hospital, including 2 (3.2%) patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The hs-cTnI levels in the remaining hospitalized patients were higher than in the discharged patients (P=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: CVDs play a vital role in the disease severity of COVID-19. COVID-19 could result in myocardial injury, which affects the prognosis of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band with plication (LAGBP) is a novel bariatric procedure, which combines the adjustability of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) with the restrictive nature of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). The addition of plication of the stomach to LAGB should provide better appetite control, more effective weight loss, and greater weight loss potential. The purpose of the study was to analyze the outcomes of LAGBP at 18 months. METHODS Data from all patients who underwent a primary LAGBP procedure from December 2011 through June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected from each patient included age, gender, weight, body mass index (BMI), and excess weight loss (EWL). RESULTS Sixty-six patients underwent LAGBP. The mean age and BMI were 44.6 ± 12.7 years and 42.1 ± 5.1 kg/m2, respectively. The patients lost an average of 49% and 46.8% EWL at 12 months (77.2% follow-up) and 18 months (66.1% follow-up), respectively. The mean band adjustments were 2.1 ± 1.7 (range, 0-7) per patient in 1 year. The mean additional adjustment volume (infusion and withdrawal of saline) was 0.6 ± 1 cc. Dysphagia was the most common long-term complication. The band removal rate was 7.5%. The mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSIONS LAGBP is a relatively safe and effective bariatric procedure. In light of recent studies demonstrating poor outcomes following LAGB, LAGBP may prove to be the future for patients desiring a bariatric procedure without resection of the stomach.

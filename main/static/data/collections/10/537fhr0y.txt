BACKGROUND A few studies have compared robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RALP) with open pyeloplasty (OP) in children, but no previous study includes a long-term follow-up of renal function and hydronephrosis in combination with a thorough prospective follow-up of the RALP patients of at least 2 years. OBJECTIVE To analyze perioperative results and long-term outcome of children with obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction, operated on with RALP compared to OP. PATIENTS AND METHODS Children â‰¤15 years operated on with RALP or OP from 2000 through 2013 were reviewed. Patient demographics, perioperative data, postoperative complications, and long-term outcome were evaluated. The outcome was based on pre- and postoperative examination of renal function, hydronephrosis and flank pain. RESULTS 129 pyeloplasties (84 OP, 39 RALP, 6 reoperations) on 123 patients were included. RALP had significantly longer operative time and shorter postoperative hospital stay, compared to OP. No difference was found in postoperative need of morphine or complication rates. Mean follow-up for RALP with ultrasound was 29 and 25 months with renal scan, compared to 34 and 28 months, respectively, for OP. The success rate for flank pain was 96 and 94 %, for hydronephrosis 93 and 95 %, and renal function 94 and 92 %, for RALP and OP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS RALP is a safe method, with advantages compared to OP, and with the same success rate. This study supports the use of RALP in children.

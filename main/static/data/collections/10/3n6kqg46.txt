Several published and pre-print studies report associations between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality. While further epidemiological and experimental studies are still needed to prove causality, the association is plausible and consistent with the literature: Air pollution is associated with inferior outcomes in other respiratory infections, may act as carrier for the virus, exerts negative effects on the airways and is associated with cardiopulmonary comorbidities that lead to a poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients. The lockdown to inhibit the spread of COVID-19 has led to substantial decreases in air pollution levels in many countries.

Students may have left your campus due to the COVID‐19 crisis, but they still need your support to succeed — now more than ever. To help student affairs professionals provide students with that support during campus closures, NASPA: Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education presented a webinar featuring Alicia Battle, Assistant Professor and Director of the Online Master of Public Health Program at Tulane University; Jaimie Hoffman, Ed.D., Vice President for Student Affairs at Noodle Partners, which produces and runs online and hybrid higher ed programs; and James McGhee, Assistant Dean of Students at Randolph‐Macon College.

The 1998 Report of the American Association of Feline Practitioners and Academy of Feline Medicine Advisory Panel on Feline Vaccines was developed to help veterinary practitioners formulate vaccination protocols for cats. The current panel report updates information, addresses questions, and speaks to concerns raised by the 1998 report. In addition it reviews vaccine licensing, labeling, and liability issues and suggests ways to successfully incorporate vaccination protocol changes into a private practice setting.

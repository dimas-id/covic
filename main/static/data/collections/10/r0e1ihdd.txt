In this chapter, we present a few definitions of post-truth and explain why the human capacity for lying and influencing others with false information, which is not new in human history, has given birth to alarming new dangers in recent years. We also set forth our path for describing the history and theoretical claims underlying the phenomenon of post-truth, accounting briefly for the social, political, and economic changes posed by individualization, bureaucratization, and globalization issues that will not be addressed in the remainder of the book.

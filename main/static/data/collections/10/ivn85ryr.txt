We report a case of a 73-year-old woman who presented to general surgery with a tender lump in the groin 5 years after insertion of a tension-free vaginal tape. The lesion was thought to be an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Emergency surgical exploration revealed a 7 × 5 × 4 cm soft tissue mass which was adherent to the external inguinal ring, emanating from the end of the tension-free vaginal tape at the level of the symphysis pubis. Resection and histological examination revealed a central track of granulation tissue with a surrounding foreign body inflammatory response. The surgery was complicated by an infected seroma requiring surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy, following which the patient made a full recovery. Large foreign body reaction is a rare but an important complication of tension-free vaginal tapes and may be mistaken for a groin hernia or lymphadenopathy.

Abstract Five Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids, jubanines F–J (1–5), and three known compounds, nummularine B (6), daechuine-S3 (7), and mucronine K (8) were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus jujuba. Their structures were fully characterized by spectroscopic analyses in combination with chemical derivatization. Compounds 1–3, and 6 were evaluated for their antiviral activity against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV replication.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh-generation coronavirus family causing viral pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across globe affecting millions of people. The objectives of this study are to (1) identify the major research themes in COVID-19 literature, (2) determine the origin, symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID, (3) recommend the intervention and mitigation strategies adopted by the Governments globally against the spread of COVID-19 and the traumatization among the public? and (4) study the possible drugs/treatment plans against COVID-19. A systematic literature review and comprehensive analysis of 38 research articles on COVID-19 are conducted. An integrated Research focus parallel-ship network and keyword co-occurrence analysis are carried out to visualize the three research concepts in COVID-19 literature. Some of our observations include: (1) as SARS-CoV-2’s RNA matches ~ 96% to SARS-CoV, it is assumed to be transmitted from the bats. (2) The common symptoms are high fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, diarrhoea etc. (3) A lockdown across 180 affected counties for more than a month with social-distancing and the precautions taken in SARS and MERS are recommended by the Governments. (4) Researchers’ claim that nutrition and immunity enhancers and treatment plans such as arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, convalescent plasma and mesenchymal stem cells and drugs including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and favipiravir are effective against COVID-19. This complied report serves as guide to help the administrators, researchers and the medical officers to adopt recommended intervention strategies and the optimal treatment/drug against COVID-19.

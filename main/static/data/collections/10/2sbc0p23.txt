OBJECTIVE Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) produces more durable glycemic control than sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or intensive medical therapy (IMT). However, the contribution of acylated ghrelin (AG), a gluco-regulatory/appetite hormone, to improve glucose metabolism and body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) following RYGB is unknown. DESIGN STAMPEDE (Surgical Treatment and Medication Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently) was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS Fifty-three (body mass index: 36±3 kg m(-2), age: 49±9 years) poorly controlled patients with T2D (HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin): 9.7±2%) were randomized to IMT, IMT+RYGB or IMT+SG and underwent a mixed-meal tolerance test at baseline, 12, and 24 months for evaluation of AG suppression (postprandial minus fasting) and beta-cell function (oral disposition index; glucose-stimulated insulin secretion × Matsuda index). Total/android body fat (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) was also assessed. RESULTS RYGB and SG reduced body fat comparably (15-23 kg) at 12 and 24 months, whereas IMT had no effect. Beta-cell function increased 5.8-fold in RYGB and was greater than IMT at 24 months (P<0.001). However, there was no difference in insulin secretion between SG vs IMT at 24 months (P=0.32). Fasting AG was reduced fourfold following SG (P<0.01) and did not change with RYGB or IMT at 24 months. AG suppression improved more following RYGB than SG or IMT at 24 months (P=0.01 vs SG, P=0.07 vs IMT). At 24 months, AG suppression was associated with increased postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (r=-0.32, P<0.02) and decreased android fat (r=0.38; P<0.006). CONCLUSIONS Enhanced AG suppression persists for up to 2 years after RYGB, and this effect is associated with decreased android obesity and improved insulin secretion. Together, these findings suggest that AG suppression is partly responsible for the improved glucose control after RYGB surgery.

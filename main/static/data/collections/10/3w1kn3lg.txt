ABSTRACT: A reliable, portable and low-cost ventilator named “DEVEN” is designed and developed by scientists of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex, RCI, DRDO-Hyderabad. This Ventilator is named as DEVEN—DRDO’s Economical Ventilator. DEVEN has features comparable to high-end ventilators and would serve the requirements of a large number of ventilators under the present COVID-19 pandemic situation. Also, DEVEN being a portable ventilator can be used in field application using a portable air compressor and reservoir. Hence, it can be used in an ambulance, any mobile vehicle or for application in any remote/rural area. DEVEN has a micro-controller-operated solenoid valve-based design and is developed by tweaking existing technology being used for hot gas reaction control systems (HRCS), employed in attitude control of exo-atmospheric missiles. HRCS is achieved by actuating solenoid valves through a micro-controller to control the flow of oxidizer as well as fuel. Existing controllers being used for control of electro-mechanical actuators are tweaked for control of the above-mentioned solenoid valves for inspiratory as well as expiratory lines of DEVEN.

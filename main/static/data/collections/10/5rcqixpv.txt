PURPOSE To evaluate the effect of a novel valveless trocar system (VTS) on perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). METHODS A single-institution retrospective review was performed of 792 patients undergoing RALP. Preoperative patient variables, tumor characteristics, and perioperative variables were collected and analyzed. The first 150 patients were excluded from analysis to account for the learning curve of robotic surgery. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess factors affecting operative time (ORT). RESULTS A total of 257 and 385 patients underwent RALP utilizing the VTS and conventional insufflation, respectively. There were no significant differences in American Society of Anesthesiologist score, body mass index (BMI), prostate volume, final Gleason score, estimated blood loss, and complications between the cohorts. The only difference noted was a significantly shorter mean ORT in the VTS cohort (149.5 vs. 170.1 min, p < 0.0001). In light of this finding, further analysis was performed to identify associations with ORT. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that VTS, BMI, final Gleason score, prostate volume, surgeon, and node dissection were significantly associated with ORT. The use of the VTS decreased mean ORT by 23.2 min when controlling for confounding factors (p < 0.001). The performance of a nerve sparing operation was found to decrease ORT by 15.9 min (p < 0.001), though more often performed for lower-risk disease. CONCLUSION The use of a novel VTS demonstrated decreased ORT in patients undergoing RALP when controlling for confounding factors. Prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate its ultimate benefit in various surgical cohorts.

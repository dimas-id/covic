Objective To establish the cost to the Queensland dairy industry of cattle tick infestation and its control, excluding the costs incurred from control measures directed specifically at tick fever and morbidity and mortality arising from tick fever. Study design Economic models are described that have been based on empirical data relating to liveweight and milk yield loss, and on a survey of control practices and tick infestation. The first two models were designed to estimate costs of control and losses resulting from tick infestation on a single dairy farm. The third model developed estimates of the cost of tick infestation for each of four regions within the tick‚Äêinfested area of Queensland. Results The overall cost to the Queensland dairy industry of the cattle tick (excluding the costs associated specifically with tick fever) and based on 1998 management practices, was $4,096,000 per annum. About 49% of this cost was related to the costs of control and 51% to losses in production. Conclusion Cattle tick infestation represents a significant impost on dairy producers in Queensland, and although the actual cost will change as deregulation results in economic changes in the industry, infestations of ticks will continue to be expensive to control.

Secondary to the widespread use of the modern imaging techniques of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound, 70% of renal tumors today are detected incidentally with a median tumor size of less than 4 cm. Twenty years ago, all renal tumors, regardless of size were treated with radical nephrectomy (RN). Elective partial nephrectomy (PN) has emerged as the treatment of choice for small renal tumors. The basis of this paradigm shift is three major factors: (1) cancer specific survival is equivalent for T1 tumors (7 cm or less) whether treated by PN or RN; (2) approximately 45% of renal tumors have indolent or benign pathology; and (3) PN prevents or delays the onset of chronic kidney disease, a condition associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although PN can be technically demanding and associated with potential complications of bleeding, infection, and urinary fistula, the patient derived benefits of this operation far outweigh the risks. We have developed a "mini-flank" open surgical approach that is highly effective and, coupled with rapid recovery postoperative care pathways associated with a 2-day length of hospital stay.

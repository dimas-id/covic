Human enterovirus 68 (EVD68) is a primary causative agent for respiratory illness worldwide. Until now, there has been no available medication for treating EVD68-related diseases. Rheum emodin, artemisinin, astragaloside, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin are natural extracts from Chinese herbs that have traditionally been used for the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases. Our results showed that pseudolaric acid B protected cells from EVD68-induced cytopathic effects and decreased viral production. However, the same effects were not observed with rheum emodin, astragaloside, or artemisinin. Pseudolaric acid B inhibited EVD68 production by manipulating the host cell cycle in G2/M phase. Further, either oridonin or erianin related G2/M arrest also inhibited viral production. Due to inducing G2/M phase arrest, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin might be good candidates for inhibiting EVD68 production, and Chinese herbs with natural compounds inducing G2/M arrest should be considered for the treatment of EVD68-related diseases.

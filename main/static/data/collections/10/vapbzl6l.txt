A population-based household survey was performed to estimate the prevalence of IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in residents of six districts in Sao Paulo City, Brazil. Serum samples collected from 299 randomly-selected adults and 218 cohabitants (N=517) were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay ten weeks after the first reported case. Weighted overall seroprevalence was 4.7% (95% CI 3.0-6.6%). The low seroprevalence suggests that most of this population could still be infected. Serial serosurveys were initiated aiming to monitor the progress of the ongoing pandemic throughout the entire city. This may help inform public health authority decisions regarding prevention and control strategies.

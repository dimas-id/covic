BACKGROUND The aim of the present study is to report and to compare the results of three different laparoscopic transperitoneal surgical approaches [lateral transperitoneal (LT), anterior transperitoneal (AT) and anterior transperitoneal submesocolic (ATS)] for the treatment of Conn's and Cushing's syndrome from left adrenal disease. METHODS This study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. From 1994 to 2017, 535 laparoscopic adrenalectomies (LA) were performed. One hundred and sixty-four patients with Conn's or Cushing's syndrome underwent left LA. Patients were divided in three groups based on the approach: LT (Group A), AT (Group B) and ATS (Group C). RESULTS The diagnosis was Conn's and Cushing's syndrome in 99 and 65 patients, respectively. LT was used in 13 cases, AT in 55 and ATS in 96. No significant differences in patient's gender, age and BMI were observed. Mean operative time was 117.6 ± 33.7, 107.6 ± 40.3 and 96.2 ± 47.5 min for Groups A, B and C, respectively. Conversion to open surgery was observed in 4 Group C patients (4.1%). Morbidity occurred in 2 Group B (2%) and in 5 Group C patients (5.2%). CONCLUSIONS In case of Conn's or Cushing's syndrome, left LA with ATS approach is equally safe and effective as compared to the LT and AT approaches. Early control of the adrenal vein with minimal gland manipulation and limited surgical dissection are the major advantages of the submesocolic approach. Even if statistically significant differences are not observed, postoperative results are the same as those reported in the literature with other approaches.

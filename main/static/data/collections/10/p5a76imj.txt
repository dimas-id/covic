COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous challenge to healthcare system in Egypt. This document is a position statement from the Egyptian Society of Cardiology. It aims to provide information to cardiovascular healthcare providers in Egypt to guarantee delivery of quality patient care and ensure adequate levels of protection against infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older patients and those with cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of mortality. The current situation requires unusual allocation of resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiologists should be prepared in the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenge is in providing the best quality of care despite limited resources while keeping all medical staff as safe as possible. Consider deferring elective procedures whenever possible. All medical staff should undergo rigorous training on infection control and the use of high-quality personal protection equipment. Cardiologists should promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritize outpatient contacts, and avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers. A much conservative approach for emergent cardiac patients is recommended, and invasive interventions are reserved for high risk hemodynamically unstable patients. During the pandemic, the most important principles of treatment should be controlling the spread of infection as the first priority, prompt assessment of patient risk, recommending conservative medical therapy rather than invasive interventions, and strict infection control measures to limit infection spread within the hospital and to healthcare workers.

PURPOSE The prognostic significance of biomarkers in colorectal cancer is still being defined. This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of BRAF mutation alone and in combination with microsatellite instability (MSI), in stage III colon cancer. METHODS Curatively resected stage III colon cancers were studied from a 33-year period. Clinicopathological data were collated (adjuvant chemotherapy, age, gender, obstruction, perforation, tumour location, grade, presence of mucin, nodal stage, extramural vascular, and perineural invasion). MSI status was established and molecular testing for BRAF (V600E) was performed. Four mutation categories were examined: "traditional" (microsatellite stable [MSS]/BRAF -ve), "presumed Lynch" (MSI/BRAF -ve), "sporadic MSI" (MSI/BRAF +ve), and "other BRAF" (MSS/BRAF +ve). These factors were correlated with cancer-specific survival. RESULTS In total, 686 unselected cases met our inclusion criteria, of which 15.7% had a BRAF mutation and 13.8% showed MSI. In the adjusted analysis, neither BRAF mutation nor MSI mutation were independently prognostic. On univariate analysis, survival in presumed Lynch cancers was similar to traditional cancers (5-year survival: 62% and 61%, respectively). While there was no difference in cancer-specific survival between sporadic MSI and other BRAF, both these tumour group had poorer outcome when compared to traditional or presumed Lynch cancers. Adjusted analysis of the four groups, however, showed that none of the subgroups were independently prognostic. CONCLUSION BRAF-mutated cancers demonstrated a trend toward poorer outcomes, however, when adjusted for clinicopathological factors and chemotherapy, BRAF mutation was not found to be an independent prognostic biomarker in stage III colon cancer, even when combined with MSI.

BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a prerequisite for treatment and prevention. The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of the antibody test to RNA test need to be demonstrated. METHOD: Serial sera of 80 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and the antibody dynamics during the infection were described. RESULTS: The seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM and IgG were 98.8%, 93.8% and 93.8%, respectively. The first detectible serology marker was Ab, followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20â days post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12â days post onset (d.p.o), respectively. The antibody levels increased rapidly beginning at 6â d.p.o. and were accompanied by a decline in viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7â d.p.o), Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p<0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% 2â weeks later, respectively. When the same antibody type was detected, no significant difference was observed between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other forms of immunoassays. CONCLUSIONS: A typical acute antibody response is induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology testing provides an important complement to RNA testing in the later stages of illness for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patients.

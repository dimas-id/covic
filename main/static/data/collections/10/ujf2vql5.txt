Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Enterovirus genus in the family of Picornaviridae. Identification of the specific strain in HRV disease has been difficult because the traditional serological method is insensitive, labor intensive, and cumbersome. With the fast progress in molecular biological technique, more sensitive and faster molecular methods have been developed, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and real-time RT-PCR. To improve the technique for defining the links between illnesses and specific strains of HRV, we developed RT-PCR specific for HRV as routine base. A multiplex RT-PCR that simultaneously identifies 12 respiratory viruses including HRV is also routinely used in our lab. Here we have described the specific steps of methods for identification of HRV from clinical samples, such as sample preparation, isolation of total RNA, nested-RT-PCR for HRV, Seeplex(®) RV15 ACE Detection method, gel electrophoresis, how to use the QIAxcel(®) capillary electrophoresis system, and results interpretation.

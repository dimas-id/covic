In response to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), researchers are expeditiously searching for antiviral treatments able to alleviate the symptoms of infection, which can be life-threatening. Here, we provide a general overview of what is currently known about the structure and characteristic features of SARS-CoV-2, some of which could potentially be exploited for the purposes of antiviral therapy and vaccine development. This mini-review also covers selected and noteworthy antiviral agents/supportive therapy out of hundreds of drugs that are being repurposed or tested as potential treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV.

Artificial intelligence (AI) enabled products and services are becoming a staple of everyday life. While governments and businesses are eager to enjoy the benefits of AI innovations, the mixed impact of these autonomous and intelligent systems on human well-being has become a pressing issue. This article introduces one of the first international standards focused on the social and ethical implications of AI: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE) Standard (Std) 7010-2020 Recommended Practice for Assessing the Impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems on Human Well-being. Incorporating well-being factors throughout the lifecycle of AI is both challenging and urgent and IEEE 7010 provides key guidance for those who design, deploy, and procure these technologies. We begin by articulating the benefits of an approach for AI centered around well-being and the measurement of well-being data. Next, we provide an overview of IEEE 7010, including its key principles and how the standard relates to approaches and perspectives in place in the AI community. Finally, we indicate where future efforts are needed.

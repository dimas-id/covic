BACKGROUND Laparoscopic splenic vessel-preserving distal pancreatectomy (lap-SVPDP) is a popular procedure in pancreatic surgery. However, postoperative complications include false aneurysms of the splenic artery, splenic vein stenosis and thrombosis, pancreatic fistulas, abscess, and perigastric varices. METHODS Eight patients (three men, five women, average age 66.1 years) with benign tumors underwent lap-SVPDP. Lap-SVPDP was performed in the lithotomy position with the head slightly elevated. The splenic vein was peeled longitudinally toward the pancreatic tail. A vessel-sealing system was used to detach the pancreatic body from the greater omentum, and the pancreas was transected using a surgical stapler. RESULTS Mean operation time was 254 min; mean blood loss was 163 ml; and mean post-surgical hospitalization time was 13 days. No postoperative bleeding from the preserved splenic vessels occurred, and there were no splenic infarcts or splenic abscesses. CONCLUSIONS For safe performance of lap-SVPDP, the posterior surface of the pancreas should be completely exposed. The splenic vein should be 'peeled away', starting from its central rear, enabling easy detection of its course to avoid inadvertent sealing. With improved operational techniques, lap-SVPDP can be adopted as a standard procedure in pancreatic surgery.

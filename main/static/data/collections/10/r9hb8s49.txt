The rapidly increasing number of studies on the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) indicate that this viral agent can cause the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a syndrome with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from a mild disease with flu-like symptoms to a life-threatening condition that requires specialized management at Intensive Care Units (ICU). Critical patients with COVID-19 have a high risk of thromboembolic complications, as expressed by a Padua prediction score always ≥4. Moreover, a number of clinical factors may increase the risk of major bleedings in these patients during ICU stay. Overall, literature data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can rapidly develop into a severe condition with renal, pulmonary and hepatic complications, potentially increasing both thrombotic and haemorrhagic risk. Failure of prevention and interventional strategies for the haemostatic imbalance of severe COVID-19 patients may dramatically impact their prognosis. The role of thromboprophylaxis in this clinical setting is discussed. Key messagesSevere patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a high risk of thromboembolic complications, as expressed by a Padua prediction score always ≥4.A number of clinical factors may also increase the risk of major bleedings in this clinical setting.A patient-tailored strategy with a case-by-case approach is needed when prescribing prophylactic anticoagulation to severe COVID-19 patients.

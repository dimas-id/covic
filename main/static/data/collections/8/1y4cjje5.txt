A novel coronavirus-associated communicable respiratory disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), spread worldwide after an outbreak in Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China in November 2002. Since late February 2003, there has been an epidemic in Hong Kong involving both adult and pediatric patients. The clinical course, intensive care, and outcome of adolescent twin sisters with SARS are described. Adolescents infected with SARS may develop severe illness as adults, and close monitoring for disease progression in terms of both clinical and radiologic deterioration is warranted.

INTRODUCTION Bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) robotic thyroidectomy (RT) is proven to be a feasible method for the treatment of well-differentiated thyroid cancers in terms of oncology as well as cosmesis. However, BABA RT causes postoperative sternal discomfort and needs an incision over the nipple areolar area. Here, we suggest a novel robotic surgical technique for thyroid surgery that does not need a breast incision-bilateral axillary approach (BAA). PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited 51 patients who were willing to undergo the novel BAA robotic thyroid surgery. We performed a propensity score-matched analysis to compare the BAA robotic thyroid surgery group (BAA group) with the conventional open thyroid surgery group (open group). RESULTS Mean operation time in the BAA group (129.7 min) was significantly longer than that in the open group (103.1 min) (p < 0.001). However, no significant differences in the mean number of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), mean number of retrieved LNs, vocal cord palsy, hypoparathyroidism, and mean stimulated thyroglobulin level were observed between the two groups. There was no case of postoperative bleeding or chyle leak. Of the 51 patients who had undergone the BAA procedure, 27 patients answered the questionnaire. The mean scale, ranging from 0 to 10, at postoperative 1 day/2 weeks was as follows: voice change score, 3.0/1.6; swallowing difficulty score, 4.0/2.0; anterior neck pain score, 4.6/3.6; anterior neck numbness score, 5.4/4.3; right chest pain score, 3.8/2.1; left chest pain score, 3.6/2.3; right chest numbness score, 3.2/2.8; left chest numbness score, 2.4/2.7; right breast pain score, 0.9/0; left breast pain score, 1.2/0; right breast numbness score, 1.7/0; and left breast numbness score, 2.6/0, respectively. CONCLUSION BAA robotic thyroid surgery is a novel, safe, and feasible oncoplastic method, especially for patients who have fear of procedures around the nipple areolar complex.

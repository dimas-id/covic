INTRODUCTION The laparoscopic repair of a rare diaphragmatic Morgagni hernia using the reduced port approach is described. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 85-year-old female presented with a 2 days history of upper abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite. We diagnosed her condition as a Morgagni hernia by morphological studies and performed laparoscopic mesh placement with a multi-channel port and 12-mm port. This elderly patient had a rapid postoperative recovery. A 2-year follow-up CT showed no recurrence of the hernia. DISCUSSION Recent trends in laparoscopic procedures have been toward minimizing the number of incisions to reduce invasiveness. This case indicated that the reduced port approach can be considered a suitable and safe procedure for treatment of Morgagni hernia. CONCLUSION The reduced port approach is a good indication for Morgagni hernia.

The conversion of ribavirin to the monophosphate by adenosine kinase is the rate-limiting step in activation of this broad spectrum antiviral drug. Variation of the 3-substituents in a series of bioisosteric and homologated 1-Î²-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazoles has marked effects on activity with the human adenosine kinase, and analysis of computational descriptors and binding models offers insight for the design of novel substrates.

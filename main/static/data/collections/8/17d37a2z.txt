Proteins that specifically interact with mRNAs orchestrate mRNA processing steps all the way from transcription to decay. Thus, these RNA-binding proteins represent an important control mechanism to double check which proportion of nascent pre-mRNAs is ultimately available for translation into distinct proteins. Here, we discuss recent progress to obtain a systems-level understanding of in vivo RNAâ€“protein interactions in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana using protein-centric and RNA-centric methods as well as combined protein binding site and structure probing.

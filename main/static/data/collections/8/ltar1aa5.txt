The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) belongs to the family Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties resulting in the death of immune-compromised patients. We performed a phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree from the collected datasets. Phylogenomic analysis or sequence-based phylogeny showed an evolutionary relationship between the geographical strains. The phylogenomic tree grouped into two major clades consists of various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat SARS-like coronavirus, Bat coronavirus, and Pangolin coronavirus. The phylogenetic neighbor of newly sequenced Indian strains (Accession: MT012098.1, MT050493.1) was revealed to identify the variations between the nCoV-19 strains. The results showed keen evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from Bat SARS-like coronavirus. The evolutionary history and comparative proteomic analysis provide a new avenue for the current scientific research related to the coronavirus.

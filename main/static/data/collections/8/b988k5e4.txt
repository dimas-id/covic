PURPOSE Evaluate the efficacy of single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) and then compare it to a less-invasive sleeve approach (three-port) (3PSG) according to a propensity score (PS) matching analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed all patients who underwent SG through a three-port or a single-port laparoscopic approach. RESULTS After 2 years, the follow-up was completed in 84% patients treated with 3PSG and 95% patients of the SPSG group. Excess weight loss (EWL) was comparable for the first year of follow-up within the two groups except for the controls at 3 months in which the SPSG group showed a higher EWL (p = 0.0243). CONCLUSION We demonstrated the efficacy of SPSG in bariatric surgery even compared to another, less invasive, laparoscopic SG approach (three-port).

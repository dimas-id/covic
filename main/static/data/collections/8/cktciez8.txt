We have examined the influence of genotype at the relA locus on the kinetics of leftward (or â€“1) frameshifting at a variety of codons calling for a limiting aminoacyl-tRNA species. We used lacZ left-frameshift reporter constructs carrying the sequence U UUC xyz, where xyz was each of three triplets coding for three different amino acids; we slowed the ribosomes at each of these by limiting for the amino acid or for the aminoacyl-tRNA. In all cases, limitation stimulated leftward frameshifting. In all cases, the stimulation was greater in relA mutant cells than in their wild-type relA (+) counterparts. In the latter genotype, the increased frameshifting was constant from the start of the limitation regime. This was also true of the relA mutant strain during limitation for lysine-tRNA or for leucine; however, during limitation for isoleucine-tRNA (or for isoleucine) the mutant showed a gradual, progressive increase in frameshifting, suggesting an indirect effect. We suggest that gradual accumulation of undermodified tRNAs, which is characteristic of the relA response, is involved. However, the specific modification involved is unknown. It is not queosine: analysis of a tgt mutant that is completely defective in queosine modification showed no increase in leftward frameshifting on the reporter which showed the larger, gradual increase during the relA response to isoleucine-tRNA limitation.

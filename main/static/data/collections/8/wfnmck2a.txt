Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common autoimmune bleeding disorder. The understanding of ITP pathogenesis is rapidly evolving. We now recognize ITP as a complex and heterogeneous syndrome that results from a combination of humoral and cell-mediated attacks on platelets peripherally and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Autoantibody-mediated ITP also varies in the pathway used to clear platelets, which depends on the platelet glycoprotein being targeted. Moreover, ITP patients present with variable bleeding severities and treatment responses that do not closely correlate with platelet count. A gold standard diagnostic test for ITP is lacking, and biomarkers to assess disease severity are in their infancy. This review provides an update on the immunopathogenesis of ITP and summarizes currently available tests for ITP diagnosis, prediction of disease severity, and treatment responses. Given the heterogeneous pathogenesis and clinical presentation of ITP, we highlight the need for the development of diagnostic and prognostic tests that would allow for the individualized management of a complex disease.

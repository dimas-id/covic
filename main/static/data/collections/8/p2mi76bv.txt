The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is creating a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), most critically, N95 respirators for healthcare personnel. Our group was interested in the feasibility of ozone disinfection of N95 respirators as an alternative for healthcare professionals and organizations that might not have access to other disinfection devices. We tested the effectiveness of ozone on killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) on three different N95 respirators: 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8000. We used an ozone chamber that consisted of: an airtight chamber, an ozone generator, an ozone destruct unit, and an ozone UV analyzer. The chamber was capable of concentrating ozone up to 500 parts per million (ppm) from ambient air, creating an airtight seal, and precisely measuring ozone levels within the chamber. Exposure to ozone at 400 ppm with 80% humidity for two hours effectively killed bacteria on N95 respirators, types 1860, 1870, and 8000. There were no significant changes in filtration efficiency of the 1860 and 1870 type respirators for up to ten cycles of ozone exposure at similar conditions. There was no change in fit observed in the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. There was no significant change in the strap integrity of the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. Tests for filtration efficiency were not performed on the 8000 type respirator. Tests for fit or strap integrity were not performed on the 8000 or 1860 type respirators. This study demonstrates that an ozone application achieves a high level of disinfection against PsA, a vegetative bacteria that the CDC identifies as more difficult to kill than medium sized viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). Furthermore, conditions shown to kill these bacteria did not damage or degrade respirator filtration. This is the first report of successful disinfection of N95 PPE with ozone of which the authors are aware. It is also the first report, to the authors' knowledge, to identify necessary conditions for ozone to kill organisms on N95 masks without degrading the function of N95 filters.

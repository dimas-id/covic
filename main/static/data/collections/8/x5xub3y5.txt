In this paper we propose an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19. The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in a population: Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not infected, and non-Tested and not infected. The model is based on two levels of dynamics of spread in the population: at local level and at the global level. The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the context of India, the local locations are considered as districts and migration or traffic flow across districts are defined by normalized edge weight of the metapopulation network of districts which are infected with COVID-19. Based on this local growth, state level predictions for number of people tested with COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations as states, prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters are determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while training the model with real data. The predictions are made based on the present statistics of testing, and certain linear and log-linear growth of testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that the spread can be contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also necessary to prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid of the second wave of pandemic.

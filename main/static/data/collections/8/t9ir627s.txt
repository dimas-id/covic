The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency over a new coronavirus. The new corona virus (SARS‐CoV‐2) has raised global attention with raising concerns of rapid spread from human‐to‐human. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐nCoV, 2019‐nCoV can be passed directly from person to person by respiratory droplets, and may also be transmitted through contact and fomites.

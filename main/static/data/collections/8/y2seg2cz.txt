The first and only outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs in Ireland occurred in 1984 in a 650-sow unit which was one of three such units owned by one enterprise which supplied pigs to a 12,000 head fattening unit in the same ownership. The depopulation of the clinically infected unit and extensive serological monitoring of pigs in the other units and in pig farms throughout the country has proved successful in the elimination of transmissible gastroenteritis infections from pigs in Ireland.

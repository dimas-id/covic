BACKGROUND There are limited data on femoropopliteal artery stent thrombosis (ST), which is a serious adverse outcome of peripheral artery interventions. METHODS AND RESULTS Index procedures resulting in femoropopliteal ST were compared with stent procedures without subsequent ST in the Excellence in Peripheral Artery Disease registry. The study data had a total of 724 cases of stent procedures and 604 unique patients. Femoropopliteal ST occurred in 26 of 604 patients (4.3%) over a median follow-up of 6 months post procedure. ST was more likely to occur in men (96.3% versus 82.2%; P=0.026) and to have an initial intervention for chronic total occlusions (88.5% versus 64.0%; P=0.01). There was no significant difference in ST between drug-coated and bare-metal stents (4.4% versus 3.4%; P=0.55), but the rate of ST was significantly higher with self-expanding covered stent grafts compared with bare-metal stents (10.6% versus 3.4%; P=0.02). ST was significantly associated with an increased risk of 12-month major adverse limb events (hazard ratio, 4.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.31-10.77; P<0.001) compared with no ST. On multivariate analysis, treatment of chronic total occlusion lesions (odds ratio, 3.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-12.20; P=0.05) and in-stent restenosis lesions (odds ratio, 5.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-15.32; P=0.002) were independently associated with an increased risk of ST. CONCLUSIONS In a multicenter peripheral interventional registry, femoropopliteal ST occurred in 4.3% of patients who underwent stent procedures, and it was associated with treatment of chronic total occlusions and in-stent restenosis lesions, and had higher 12-month major adverse limb events.

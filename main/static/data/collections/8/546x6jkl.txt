Novel approaches to vaccine development include structure-based immunogen design, gene-based vaccine platforms and formulation of recombinant antigens with potent adjuvants. These technologies are producing encouraging results in the development of vaccines for globally important diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Here we highlight the most important developments in these areas over the past 18 months.

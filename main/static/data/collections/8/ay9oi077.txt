Influenza remains a globally important cause of febrile respiratory illness. Influenza virus activity in the community results in significant mortality, morbidity and economic disruption, particularly in those at high risk of developing complications, such as the elderly and those with underlying chronic medical conditions, including pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus. The occurrence in Hong Kong in 1997 of avian influenza H5N1 in man, which resulted in six deaths, served to remind us of the importance of continuing surveillance and preparation for the next pandemic.

PURPOSE Assess the effect of a protocol of preoperative erythropoietin (EPO) and ferrous sulfate in addition to perioperative tranexamic acid (TXA) on blood transfusions in patients with coronal or metopic craniosynostosis undergoing cranial vault remodeling (CVR) with fronto-orbital advancement (FOA). METHODS Retrospective review of all coronal and metopic craniosynostosis patients undergoing CVR and FOA from March 2010 to June 2019 was performed. Before 2014 ("Control group"), all patients received blood transfusion at the start of surgery. In 2014, a protocol of preoperative EPO and ferrous sulfate with perioperative TXA and non-automatic transfusion was instituted ("Study group"). Patient demographics and anthropometrics, perioperative hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and transfusion details were collected and compared. RESULTS Thirty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one patients were in the control group, and 15 in the Study group. Nineteen patients had metopic synostosis, 11 had unicoronal synostosis, and 6 had bicoronal synostosis. There were no significant differences between groups in demographics, operative time, intraoperative crystalloid volume, craniofacial syndromes, or sutures affected. The Study group had higher preoperative Hb (13.9 ± 1.0 vs. 12.6 ± 0.8 g/dL, p < 0.001), lower intraoperative Hb nadir (7.4 ± 1.8 vs. 9.2 ± 1.2 g/dL) lower intraoperative transfusion rate (66.7% vs. 100%, p = 0.008), lower postoperative transfusion rate (0% vs 28.6%, p = 0.03), and exposure to fewer unique units of packed red blood cells (0.7 ± 0.6 vs. 1.5 ± 0.9 units). CONCLUSION Our protocol resulted in decreased transfusion needs. These results add valuable information to the growing body of work on transfusion reduction in craniosynostosis surgery.

Memory CD8+ T cells in the immune system are responsible for the removal of external Ags for a long period of time to protect against re-infection. Na√Øve to memory CD8+ T cell differentiation and memory CD8+ T cell maintenance require many different factors including local environmental factors. Thus, it has been suggested that the migration of memory CD8+ T cells into specific microenvironments alters their longevity and functions. In this review, we have summarized the subsets of memory CD8+ T cells based on their migratory capacities and described the niche hypothesis for their survival. In addition, the basic roles of CCR7 in conjunction with the migration of memory CD8+ T cells and recent understandings of their survival niches have been introduced. Finally, the applications of altering CCR7 signaling have been discussed.

A modified natural surfactant was administered to a patient with life-threatening adult respiratory distress sydrome caused by viral pneumonia. Subsequently, there was a marked improvement in gas exchange. In order to assess the mechanism for improved oxygenation, computed tomography of the lungs was done. Quantitative analysis of the scans taken before and after surfactant administration indicates that improvement in gas exchange was largely due to the expansion of underinflated and collapsed lung areas. Although this is a single case report, it provides insight into the possible beneficial effect of instilled surfactant in severe respiratory distress from viral pneumonia.

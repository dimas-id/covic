Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus antigen was demonstrated after methanol, ethanol or formalin fixation in paraffin-embedded tissues by means of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody was induced by immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Polyclonal antibodies were obtained by purification on protein A-Sepharose of ascites fluid from a cat with FIP. Almost all cats diagnosed as suffering from FIP by postmortem and histological examination exhibited FIP virus (FIPV) antigen in macrophages in granulomas whereas FIPV antigen was only once demonstrable in another location.

A central pillar of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries continues to be the development of biological drug products manufactured from engineered mammalian cell lines. Since the hugely successful launch of human tissue plasminogen activator in 1987 and erythropoietin in 1988, the biopharmaceutical market has grown immensely. In 2014, biotherapeutics made up a significant portion of global drug sales as 7 of the top 10 and 21 of top 50 selling pharmaceuticals in the world were biologics with over US$100 billion in global sales (Table 1, [1]).

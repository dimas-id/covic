Abstract Antibiotics are antimicrobial compounds that can inhibit and even destroy bacterial and fungal growth. Antibiotics are used in both human diseases to kill bacterial and fungal pathogens and in farm animals to reduce incidences of animal diseases as veterinary drugs, promote animal weight gain, and control the zoonotic pathogens in milk, egg, meat, and meat products. Use of antibiotics in agricultural farm animals may aid bacterial antibiotic resistance. Though it is still a debatable topic, a comprehensive understanding of using antibiotics in farm animal production and the replacement of these antibiotics with some natural products is under pressure.

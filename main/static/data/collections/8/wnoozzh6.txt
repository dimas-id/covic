The emergence of resistant pathogens is a burden on mankind and threatens the existence of our species. Natural and plant-derived antimicrobial agents need to be developed in the race against antibiotic resistance. Nanotechnology is a promising approach with a variety of products. Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have good antimicrobial activity. We prepared AgNPs with trans-cinnamic acid (TCA) and povidoneâ€“iodine (PI) with increased antimicrobial activity. We synthesized also AgNPs with natural cinnamon bark extract (Cinn) in combination with PI and coated biodegradable Polyglycolic Acid (PGA) sutures with the new materials separately. These compounds (TCA-AgNP, TCA-AgNP-PI, Cinn-AgNP, and Cinn-AgNP-PI) and their dip-coated PGA sutures were tested against 10 reference strains of microorganisms and five antibiotics by zone inhibition with disc- and agar-well-diffusion methods. The new compounds TCA-AgNP-PI and Cinn-AgNP-PI are broad spectrum microbicidal agents and therefore potential coating materials for sutures to prevent Surgical Site Infections (SSI). TCA-AgNP-PI inhibits the studied pathogens stronger than Cinn-AgNP-PI in-vitro and on coated sutures. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD), microstructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the composition of TCA-AgNP-PI and Cinn-AgNP-PI. Smart solutions involving hybrid materials based on synergistic antimicrobial action have promising future perspectives to combat resistant microorganisms.

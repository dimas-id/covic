This study aimed to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN) between patients undergoing dialysis for ≤240 and >240 months. Data from all dialysis patients with non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with LRN between 2008 and 2015 in our hospital were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups, shorter- and longer-term dialysis patients, according to the preoperative duration of dialysis (≤240 vs. >240 months). Of 174 patients, 58 (33.3%) were on longer-term dialysis. Perioperative minor complications were significantly more frequent in the longer-term dialysis patients (P = 0.03). There was no significant difference between the two groups in other perioperative outcomes. Patients on longer-term dialysis more frequently had pathologically advanced RCC (P = 0.009) with poorer prognosis (P = 0.005). LRN for RCC in longer-term dialysis patients appears to be safe and feasible; however, careful follow-up is needed because these patients tend to have poorer prognosis.

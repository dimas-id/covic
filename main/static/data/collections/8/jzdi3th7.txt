BACKGROUND Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been performed using a variety of techniques evolving during the past decade. We present our initial experience and outcomes of patients undergoing transthoracic MIE using a circular end-to-side anastomosis created with the transorally directed EEA circular stapler OrVil (Covidien, New Haven, CT). Complications, including anastomotic leak and stricture occurrence, are reviewed. METHODS A retrospective review evaluated consecutive patients undergoing MIE for esophageal cancer or related disease with intrathoracic end-to-side anastomoses using the transorally directed EEA circular stapler from December 2007 to May 2010. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, staging, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, comorbidities, adjuvant therapy, complications, and survival. RESULTS During this period, 51 consecutive patients (84% male; mean age, 65 years) underwent MIE. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed in 32 patients, and 4 had intraoperative radiotherapy. Mean operative time was 338 minutes (range, 211 to 565 minutes), including the 4 patients with intraoperative radiotherapy. Operative time improved with experience (excluding intraoperative radiotherapy) from a mean of 378 minutes (patients 1 to 14) to 300 minutes (patients 37 to 51). Median hospital stay was 11 days (range, 6 to 48 days). Anastomotic leaks occurred in 5 patients (9.8%). Postoperative deaths included 1 in-hospital (2.0%) and 2 (3.9%) after discharge. Stricture was diagnosed and treated in 7 patients (13.7%). Follow-up was a median of 12 months (range, 1 to 31 months). CONCLUSIONS Transthoracic MIE using an end-to-side anastomosis with the transorally directed EEA circular stapler resulted in acceptable stricture and leak rates with good outcomes comparable to published outcomes for open surgical resections.

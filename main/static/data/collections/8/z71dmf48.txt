Cytochrome b(5) (cyt-b(5)) is essential for the regulation of steroidogenesis and as such has been implicated in a number of clinical conditions. It is well documented that this small hemoprotein augments the 17,20-lyase activity of cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1). Studies have revealed that this augmentation is accomplished by cyt-b(5) enhancing the interaction between cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) and CYP17A1. In this paper we present evidence that cyt-b(5) induces a conformational change in CYP17A1, in addition to facilitating the interaction between CYP17A1 and POR. We also review the recently published finding that cyt-b(5) allosterically augments the activity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ(5)-Δ(4) isomerase (3βHSD), a non cytochrome P450 enzyme, by increasing the enzymes affinity for its cofactor, NAD(+). The physiological importance of this finding, in terms of understanding adrenal androstenedione production, is examined. Finally, evidence that cyt-b(5) is able to form homomeric complexes in living cells is presented and discussed.

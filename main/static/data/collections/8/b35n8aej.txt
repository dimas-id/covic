PURPOSE OF REVIEW The new guidelines for assessment of asthma control emphasize two domains: impairment and risk. Exacerbations of asthma are an important component of risk but have not received as much attention as the day-to-day symptoms that make up impairment. The purpose of this review is to report what has recently been learned about exacerbations. RECENT FINDINGS Exacerbations occur in the context of both controlled and uncontrolled asthma. Exacerbations are a strong independent risk factor of further exacerbations. This suggests that unrecognized factors may be involved in susceptibility to exacerbations in addition to more commonly recognized triggers such as viruses, allergens, and poorly controlled asthma. Such factors may be the result of genetic variation. Recent evidence now shows a residual effect on lung function from an exacerbation event. There are no current specific intervention measures to prevent exacerbations but attention to management practices continues to look at the role of the emergency department in improving care. SUMMARY The presence of exacerbations is considered a risk factor of the likelihood of further exacerbations and requires assessment of the triggers identified with history of exacerbations, host factors, atopic disposition, exposure to allergens, adherence to prescribed medications, and preventive measures to reduce future risk of such an event.

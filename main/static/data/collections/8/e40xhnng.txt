Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by one of two recently discovered coronaviruses. The virus is emergent from South East (SE) Asian mammals: either the civet cat, a related species or a rat species. The virus has a long incubation period and low reproduction number (R0 value) and hence the first outbreak in 2004 was controlled by hygiene and quarantine. However, the healthcare system was compromised and the economic cost was extremely high. Fortunately, the virus is easily cultivated in Vero E6 cells and therefore the search for new antivirals and vaccines was initiated within weeks of the discovery of the virus using classic techniques of cell culture and electron microscopy. Molecular diagnostics facilitated rapid and accurate diagnosis, a key factor in containing the outbreak. The broad-spectrum molecule ribavirin was used in SE Asia in infected patients alongside corticosteroids. In retrospect, many patients survived due to careful nursing. The only currently accepted intervention is interferon. Coronavirus replicon systems should facilitate rapid screening of new inhibitors and the complex mechanism of viral replication will ensure that drugs are developed against at least five molecular targets, in particular the viral protease.

Since December 2019, numerous cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been confirmed in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China embodied a significant and urgent threat to global health. 2019-nCoV was a new, highly contagious coronavirus discovered following the outbreak of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The novel coronavirus can cause severe respiratory disease and even death. However, no specific therapeutic drugs have been developed clinically thus far. This article examines the potential of therapeutic drugs by assessing the structure of 2019-nCoV, its mechanism in invading host cells, and the anti-viral mechanism of the human autoimmune system. We also review the latest research regarding the progress of potential therapeutic drugs and provide references for new drug developments of COVID-19.

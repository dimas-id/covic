BACKGROUND Proximal middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) aneurysms are relatively deeply located in neighboring lenticulostriate arteries, which make them unsuitable for microsurgery. We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms. METHODS Between January 2003 and December 2014, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 52 patients (52 aneurysms) from four institutions who underwent endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms. Patients who underwent clinical and radiologic follow-up for more than a year after the procedure were evaluated. RESULTS The aneurysms were located in the early frontal branch, early temporal branch, and lenticulostriate artery in 28, 15, and nine patients, respectively. Endovascular coiling was achieved in 51 cases and failed in one case. Of these 51 cases, 46 (90.2%) and five (9.8%) were non-ruptured and ruptured aneurysms, respectively. Initial angiographic results revealed complete occlusion in 26 (51.0%), residual neck in 16 (31.4%), and residual sac in nine (17.6%) cases. One failed case had a symptomatic procedural complication of thromboembolism. However, there was no permanent morbidity or mortality. Two major recanalization cases (3.9%) were retreated by endovascular coiling. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, aneurysmal recurrence was significantly related to aneurysm height (OR, 1.887; 95% CI, 1.107 to 3.217; p = 0.020), width (OR, 1.836; CI, 1.127 to 2.992; p = 0.015), and neck (OR, 4.017; CI, 1.220 to 13.232, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION Endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms appeared to be a feasible treatment option with a relatively low-retreatment rate. Aneurysm size was statistically significantly associated with recurrence.

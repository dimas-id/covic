SUMMARY MuSiC is a web server to perform the constrained alignment of a set of sequences, such that the user-specified residues/nucleotides are aligned with each other. The input of the MuSiC system consists of a set of protein/DNA/RNA sequences and a set of user-specified constraints, each with a fragment of residue/nucleotide that (approximately) appears in all input sequences. The output of MuSiC is a constrained multiple sequence alignment in which the fragments of the input sequences whose residues/nucleotides exhibit a given degree of similarity to a constraint are aligned together. The current MuSiC system is implemented in Java language and can be accessed via a simple web interface. AVAILABILITY http://genome.life.nctu.edu.tw/MUSIC

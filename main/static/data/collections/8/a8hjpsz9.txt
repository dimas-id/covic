Alexandra Hospital (AH) was one of the public hospitals in Singapore that responded to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis. Being the only public hospital that remained "SARS-free", i.e., with no documented intra-institutional spread of disease, AH had to tackle a sudden, two-fold surge in hospital attendances and patient volume. Being the oldest hospital with a traditional open ward design and lack of proper isolation facilities, tough command and control policies had to be implemented to reduce the risk of a SARS outbreak. Stringent infection control measures, screening and triage, clinical procedures, and administrative policies all were important factors in helping the hospital balance the need to run routine operations while "fighting" SARS. Staff and people management also were crucial in keeping the workforce healthy and maintaining their morale and confidence during this difficult period.

Following the excision of hemorrhoidal nodes during hemorrhoidectomy, intense pain is reported to be the main postoperative problem, which can last for several weeks. Hemorrhoidopexy, an alternative treatment for hemorrhoids introduced in the late nineties, replaced hemorrhoid excision by a reduction of the hemorrhoids to their normal anatomical position, via an excision of a mucosal ring above the internal hemorrhoidal cushions. The latter excision results in minimal or no postoperative pain. In 2010, a new variant of the hemorrhoidopexy set was introduced in the European market. The variations of this set, including a detachable anvil and a lined proctoscope, aid the surgeon in performing an easier and safer hemorrhoidopexy.

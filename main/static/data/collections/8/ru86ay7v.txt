Collagen has been used in various medical fields and more recently serves as matrix for biomeshes in hernia repair. Meshes derived from organic sources have been designed to reduce foreign body reaction, seromas, adhesions, limited integration, and mesh infection that are frequently found with synthetic meshes. However, synthetic meshes made from polymer materials, e.g., polypropylene or polyester represent the standard of care in both open and laparoscopic inguinal and ventral hernia repair. This review aims to outline the current state of collagen implants and to investigate their potential to replace or compete with synthetic products. Unfortunately, literature reveals a discrepancy between cautious reports and a growing number of acclaiming studies. Special attention has therefore been paid to experimental data of adequate animal models, providing second look data and histology.

Despite the extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, poor clinical response to the treatment of acute otitis media is common. Evidence derived from numerous studies during the past two decades supports a crucial role for respiratory viruses in the etiology and pathogenesis of acute otitis media, and recent studies indicate that viruses may also have a profound adverse effect on the resolution of this disease. Viruses seem to interact with bacteria and enhance the local inflammatory process in the middle ear. Effective adjuvant therapies are needed to improve outcome in children with otitis media. Increasing knowledge of the role of viruses, viral-bacterial interaction, and host inflammatory mechanisms in otitis media may lead to major improvements in the management of this disease.

Abstract The effect of depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes as well as macrophage response following viral infections have been studied in various mouse-virus infection models, but they have not been extensively studied in chickens relevant to virus infections. When we infected day 6 chickens with H4N6 low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), we observed that H4N6 LPAIV infection increased the staining intensity of KUL01+ cells in trachea, lungs and duodenum of chickens at 3 days post-infection. Then, we used clodronate liposomes intra-abdominally in 5 day-old chickens and found significant reduction of staining intensity of KUL01+ cells in trachea and duodenum but not in lungs at 4 days post-treatment. When we infected the clodronate liposome and PBS liposome treated chickens with H4N6 LPAIV intra-nasally at day 6, we found no effect on H4N6 LPAIV genome loads in trachea, lungs and duodenum of chickens. This study indicates that although KUL01+ cell intensity are increased in respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues in chickens following H4N6 LPAIV infection, the decrease of KUL01+ cell intensity using clodronate liposomes did not change the H4N6 LPAIV genome loads in any of the examined tissues suggesting that KUL01+ cells may not be critical during H4N6 LPAIV infection in chicken.

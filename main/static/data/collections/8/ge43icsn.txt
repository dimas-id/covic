Various techniques were used to look for protective, non-cross-reactive antibodies in the sera of cats exposed to virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Antibodies reactive with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) from FIPV-exposed cats were adsorbed by several passages over an FECV-Sepharose column. In an ELISA against FECV and FIPV, the activity against both viruses was removed at the same rate; thus, no FIPV-specific antibodies could be identified. By gel electrophoresis-derived ELISA, the responses of cats surviving FIPV exposure were compared with those of cats succumbing to FIPV exposure to determine whether survival could be correlated with an antibody response against a particular virus protein. Results indicated that both groups responded in the same way to the matrix envelope protein and nucleocapsid proteins. Even though the response to peplomer in each group was weak, the survivor group responded better to this protein. Furthermore, the response of this group to the peplomer protein had the highest correlation with virus neutralization titer.

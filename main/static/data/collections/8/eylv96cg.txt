Publisher Summary Viruses in water are usually present in concentrations too low for detection by direct analysis. Virological investigation of water samples is always a multi-stage process involving concentration of viruses present followed by an appropriate detection procedure. There are several approaches to detection of viruses. Part or all of the concentrate may be inoculated into cell cultures to detect infectious cytopathogenic virus, and if this is done in a quantitative fashion the virus can be enumerated, the count being reported as plaque-forming units, the tissue culture infectious dose, or most probable number units. The virus may be isolated and identified from the cell cultures. Viruses that multiply without producing an identifiable cytopathic effect in culture may sometimes be detected by immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining. The concentrate may also be analyzed by molecular biological procedures (usually polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time-PCR). The problem then is that such techniques do not usually detect the infectious virus, and novel approaches have been made recently to meet this challenge.

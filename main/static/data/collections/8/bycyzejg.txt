As coronavirus spreads around the world, the study of its effects is of great practical significance. We collated data on daily new cases of the COVID-19 outbreaks in the six Western countries of the Group of Seven and the dates of governments' interventions. We studied the periods before and after the dates of major governments' interventions integrally based on a segmented Poisson model. The relevant results are published in the paper of "Predicting turning point, duration and attack rate of COVID - 19 outbreaks in major Western countries" [1]. Our method can be used to update prediction daily as COVID-19 outbreaks evolve. In this article, we illustrate an updated analysis with our method to facilitate reproducibility. Both datasets used and updated are provided.

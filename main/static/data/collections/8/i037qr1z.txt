In the context of viral infections, autophagy induction can be beneficial or inhibitory. Within the Paramyxoviridae family, only morbilliviruses have been investigated and are reported to induce autophagy. Here we show that morbilliviruses rapidly induce autophagy and require this induction for efficient cell-to-cell spread. Coexpression of both glycoproteins in cells expressing one of the cellular receptors was required for autophagy induction, and LC3 punctum formation, indicative of autophagy, was mainly observed in syncytia. A similar correlation between syncytium formation and autophagy induction was also observed for other paramyxovirus glycoproteins, suggesting that membrane fusion-mediated autophagy may be common among paramyxoviruses and possibly other enveloped viruses.

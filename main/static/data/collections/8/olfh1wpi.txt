The aim of this study was to evaluate intermediate-term results after microwave ablation (MWA) of renal tumours and determine the association of RENAL and modified RENAL (mRENAL) scores with oncological outcomes and complications. In May 2008-September 2014, 58 patients affected by early-stage RCC (renal cell carcinoma; T1a or T1b) were judged unsuitable for surgery and treated with percutaneous MWA. Follow-up was performed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the procedure. Technical success (TS), primary technical effectiveness (PTE), secondary technical effectiveness (STE), the local tumour progression rate (LTPR), the cancer-specific survival rate (CSSR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and safety were recorded. All lesions were evaluated using RENAL and mRENAL scores, and complications were assessed with RENAL scores. The TS rate was 100%, PTE was 93%, STE was 100%, LTPR was 15.7% at 1 year, CSSR was 96.5%, DFS was 87.9% at 5 years, and OS was 80.6%. Mean follow-up was 25.7 months (range 3-72). The mean ± standard deviation (SD) RENAL and mRENAL scores of all treated tumours were 6.7 ± 2.05 (range 4-11) and 7 ± 2.3 (range 4-12), respectively. Major complications occurred in two (2/58) and minor complications in three patients (3/58). Overall complications correlated significantly with RENAL scores; in particular, E and L represent negative predictors for safety and effectiveness. MWA is a valuable alternative for treating RCCs. The correlation with outcomes and complications of RENAL and mRENAL scores could help to customise MWA indications in RCC patients.

BACKGROUND In an effort to enable faster and, at times, more challenging surgeries without compromising patient or physician safety, medical device manufacturers have created myriad solutions to vascular ligation through the development of novel tools. The speed of development, FDA approval, and dissemination of these devices into the hands of surgeons often outpaces the ability of investigators to critically evaluate comparative effectiveness of these devices. DATABASE The Medline database was searched for energy-based vessel ligation devices. To remove any perception bias against non-Covidien instruments, critical review was applied only to the devices manufactured by our company. CONCLUSIONS We report on the variability present in published results and offer vital metrics for future studies. Standardized testing and reporting for measures of safety and efficacy of these surgical instruments awaits definition from a consensus group.

To exploit a cross passive immunotherapy for enterovirus-induced hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), the cross antiviral activity of a neutralizing antibody against enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) was investigated in vitro. White Leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized with EV71 antigens and a specific isolated immunoglobulin (IgY) was prepared from the chicken egg yolk. IgY was further purified and characterized by SDS-PAGE, ELISA, western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing. The antiviral activity and dose-response of the IgY were determined by assessing the cytopathic effect in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells in vitro. It was indicated that the levels of IgY were increased at day 7, peaked at week 7 and were maintained at a higher level for 4 weeks following immunization when compared with the negative control. The results of western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing revealed that the IgY had cross-binding properties in EV71 and CVA16 strains through targeting the envelope proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) of EV71 and CVA16. Neutralization assay results indicated that the infectivity of EV71 and CVA16 strains in RD cells was cross-blocked by IgY in a dose-dependent manner. To conclude, these findings indicate that IgY has cross antiviral activity against EV71 and CVA16 in vitro, and could potentially be developed as a passive immunotherapy for EV71- and CVA16-induced HFMD.

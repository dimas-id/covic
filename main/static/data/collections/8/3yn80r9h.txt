BACKGROUND: Goose parvovirus (GPV) is a Dependovirus associated with latent infection and mortality in geese. Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the nosogenesis of GPV in vivo. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 2.8 Ã— 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 3 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and reproducibility of the GPV fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with a high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of GPV etiology-related applications.

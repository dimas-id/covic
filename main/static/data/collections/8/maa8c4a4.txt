Abstract The sequential determination of crystal structures of the SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with its cellular receptor or neutralizing antibody opened a door for the design and development of antiviral competitive inhibitors. Based on those complex structures, we conduct computational characterization and design of RBD-mediated receptor recognition and antibody neutralization. The comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidences validate our structural bioinformatics protocols. And the calculations predict a number of single substitutions on RBD, receptor or antibody that could remarkably elevate the binding affinities of those complexes. It is reasonable to anticipate our structure-based computation-derived hypotheses could be informative to the future biochemical and immunological tests.

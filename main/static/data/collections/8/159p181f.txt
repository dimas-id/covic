The pulmonary vasculature is an anatomic compartment that is frequently overlooked in the histologic review of lung biopsy samples, other than those obtained specifically to assess pulmonary vascular disease.1 Though often of a nonspecific nature, the histologic pattern of vascular remodeling may at times suggest its underlying pathogenesis and provide clues to the cause of pulmonary hypertension.2 Disproportionately severe vascular pathology may further indicate alternate disease processes, such as congestive heart failure or thromboemboli, contributing to the patientâ€™s overall respiratory condition.

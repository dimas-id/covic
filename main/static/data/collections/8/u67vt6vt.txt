The rapid progression of COVID-19 is an organizational challenge for all hospitals. To secure the patient overflow, the Department internal medicine of the University Hospital of Lausanne increased nurse and medical workforces as well as bed capacity by 65 %, with extraordinary help from other departments. The implemented crisis management stood upon three pillars : a crisis management team, steering documents and internal communication. In this new form, the Department had already taken care of 442 COVID-19 admissions by April 16, 2020. Alongside organizational challenges, clinical issues such as rapid respiratory distress, clinical suspicions with negative PCR and treatment uncertainties in the absence of sufficient evidence were overcome. Despite the peak of the pandemic appearing to have passed, the next phase could be just as complicated.

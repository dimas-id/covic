BACKGROUND There is limited data regarding the prevalence and clinical impact of sedation-related adverse events (SRAEs) during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE). AIM Our primary aim was to measure SRAE during RFA. Secondary aims were to identify risk factors for adverse events, and to determine whether SRAEs impacted the number of RFA treatments to achieve complete eradication of dysplasia (CE-D). METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 consecutive patients undergoing initial RFA for dysplastic BE between 2008 and 2014. The main outcome measures were SRAEs and the number of RFA sessions required to achieve CE-D. RESULTS Of 120 initial RFA procedures, 83 % were performed with MAC and 17 % with GET. SRAEs occurred in 32 %, including 25 % of MAC patients (25/100) and 65 % (12/20) GET patients. The most frequent SRAE was hypotension (23 %, n = 27/120), followed by hypoxia (n = 9/120), arrhythmia (n = 4/120), and one unplanned intubation. There were no premature procedure terminations. After adjusting for length of BE mucosa and ASA score, the occurrence of a SRAE was associated with requiring more (>4) RFA sessions to achieve CE-D, OR 3.45 (95 % CI 1.49-7.99). Mean RFA sessions required to achieve CE-D was 5 ± 1 in patients with SRAE, compared to 3 ± 0.7 in patients without SRAE during the first treatment session (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS SRAE during RFA for dysplastic BE occurs at a rate typical of other advanced endoscopic procedures. Patients who experience minor events related to anesthesia during the first RFA are likely to require more RFA treatment sessions to achieve CE-D.

Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of therapy in many stages of lung cancer. Many diagnostic options have to be taken into account when a patient suffering from lung cancer presents with nonspecific, respiratory, clinical manifestations. A multidisciplinary diagnostic approach is then warranted. The top priority is to rule out those life-threatening causes, such as lung infection, that could be properly treated if a right diagnosis is early. To reach a definite diagnosis frequently requires that one or more diagnostic, pneumologic techniques are performed. Regarding to drug-induced pulmonary disease, prevention is mandatory. In this review we have tried to highlight the risk and characteristics of cytostatic-induced pulmonary toxicity caused by those agents that have been commonly employed to treat lung cancer for the last decades. When treating lung cancer patients, a high clinical suspicion of chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity should be kept in mind since an early withdrawal of the offending drug is the most efficacious therapy.

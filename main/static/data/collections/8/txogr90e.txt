Composite polypropylene-based surgical mesh materials including various synthetic polymers and naturally occurring biomaterials have been developed to ameliorate device-associated inflammatory response and associated reduced compliance of pure polypropylene meshes. This study evaluated the histomorphologic response of three composite polypropylene-based surgical meshes, Revive™, a polycarbonate polyurethane reinforced monofilamentous polypropylene scaffold, Assure™, a polycarbonate polyurethane reinforced monofilamentous polypropylene scaffold with a resorbable anti-adhesion layer of lactide caprolactone copolymer, and Proceed™, a polypropylene mesh modified with oxidized cellulose, in a soft tissue repair model in the rat. The host inflammatory response and neotissue formation were evaluated by semiquantitative histologic scoring including the amount of cellular infiltration, angiogenesis, presence of multinucleate giant cells, fibrous connective tissue formation, and host neo-extracellular matrix deposition for up to 26 weeks. All three composite surgical mesh materials showed good integration with host tissue as indicated by rapid cellular infiltration, abundant neo-vascularization, minimal shrinkage, and the lack of visible mesh degradation. The devices elicited a similar inflammatory response and the presence of a mild foreign body response in spite of the different composition and morphology of these composite mesh materials.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic efficiency of (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-Octreotate in comparison with (111)Inpentetrotide scintigraphy in the detection of neuroendocrine tumors. This study also evaluates the impact of SPECT-CT hybrid imaging on somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) interpretation and clinical management of these tumors. METHODS Fourteen patients were included in the study. All patients underwent a whole body and SPECT-CT imaging with both (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate and (111)In-pentetrotide. Images were evaluated both visually and semiquantitatively. RESULTS On patient basis, the diagnostic results of both studies were similar. The number of lesions detected by (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNICOctreotate were higher than the number of lesions detected by (111)In-pentetrotide however the difference was not significant (40/43( 93%), 36/43 (83%) p=0.109). Semiquantitative analysis showed higher tumor/organ count ratios for both whole-body and SPECT (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-Octreotate scans. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggested that, (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-Octreotate may be a better alternative to (111)In- pentetrotide due to high image quality and lower radiation dose. SPECT/CT is a valuable tool for the assessment of neuroendocrine tumors by providing the precise anatomic localization of scintigraphic findings thus improving lesion detectability and characterization.

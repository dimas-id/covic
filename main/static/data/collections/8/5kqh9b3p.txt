Abstract Mannheimia varigena was identified as the etiologic agent of meningitis in a young Belgian White Blue heifer calf. Species identification of the bacterium was done by phenotyping and molecularly confirmed by tDNA-PCR. Standard bacteriological examination might fail to differentiate species belonging to the genus Mannheimia.

INTRODUCTION This study reports the pediatric epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (IF), parainfluenza (PIV), and adenovirus (ADV) at Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre. METHODS Cases of infection, hospitalizations in intensive care units (ICUs), nosocomial infections, and lethality rates were collected from 2007 to 2010. RESULTS RSV accounted for most nosocomial infections. Intensive care units admission rates for ADV and RSV infections were highest in 2007 and 2010. During 2008-2009, H1N1 and ADV had the highest ICU admission rates. ADV had the highest fatality rate during 2007-2009. CONCLUSIONS Each virus exhibited distinct behavior, causing hospitalization, outbreaks, or lethality.

Confirmation bias is the predisposition to only consume the news, or what appears to be news, that confirms our pre-existing attitudes and beliefs, e.g. anti-vaxxers reading only anti-vaccination material. This plays out, for example, in reading only the news/postings that fit our political or social leaning. It is done to avoid cognitive dissonance as well as eventual disfavor from our social network. Confirmation bias is an important element supporting the diffusion of false news via digital platforms. It is important that we understand the underlying cognitive as well as the social mechanisms and dynamics, e.g. can the news of COVID-19 disrupt or eventually further entrench the cognitive and social dynamics of anti-vaxxer individuals and groups?.

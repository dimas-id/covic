OBJECTIVES: Snow fungus or snow mushroom or white jelly mushroom (Tremella fuciformis), the edible mushroom, was formulated into hand sanitizer in form of moisturizing alcohol‐based hand rubs (ABHR) gel. METHODS: The stable base ABHRs were developed. The preferred bases were incorporated with various concentrations of snow mushroom extract. The stable and preferred snow mushroom ABHR was moisturizing and sanitizing efficacies evaluated in 20 human volunteers in a comparison with its placebo. RESULTS: The stable hand sanitizer gel bases containing 66.5% of ethanol and 0.3% triclosan were developed and incorporated with the extract of snow mushroom polysaccharide. Of which, the preparations containing 10% of snow mushroom and 0.3% of gelling agent gained the highest preferences as assessed in 20 Thai volunteers. The snow mushroom hand sanitizer was proved to be none irritated in the same group of the volunteers as was the placebo. The snow mushroom gel significantly (P < 0.05) moist the skin better than the placebo at all time of the interval assessment until the end of the study at 180 min. The hand sanitizers were confirmed on their anti‐septic, at which the efficacies of the active and placebo ABHR were comparable (P = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Snow mushroom ABHR gel with its confirmed moisturizing and sanitizing efficacies is presented. It is meetings with the recommendation on hand hygienic improvement to combat the infections of diseases spreading. The preparation can be frequency applied with its proved skin hydrating efficacy co‐contributes in a good condition of hand hygiene.

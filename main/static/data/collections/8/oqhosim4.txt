Lipid rafts and caveolae are detergent-insoluble plasma membrane microdomains, involved in cellular endocytic processes and signalling. Several viruses, including a human pathogen, echovirus 1, and an extensively studied simian virus 40 utilize these domains for internalization into the host cells. Interaction of viruses with receptors on the cell surface triggers specific conformational changes of the virus particle and can give rise to signalling events, which determine the mechanisms of virus entry. After internalization via cell surface lipid rafts or caveolae, virus-containing vesicles can fuse with caveosomes, pre-existing cytoplasmic organelles, or dock on other intracellular organelles. These pathways may deliver viruses further to different cellular destinations, where the viral replication cycle then takes place. The information concerning the viral entry processes is important for understanding the details of the infections, for finding new targets for antiviral therapy and for elucidating the cellular internalization pathways in general.

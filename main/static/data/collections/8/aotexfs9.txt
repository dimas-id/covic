The whole world has entered a terrible crisis with a huge and increasing amount of human deaths and economic loss in fighting the pandemic of COVID‐19 caused by the novel coronavirus termed SARS‐CoV‐2. The live pathogen vaccine (LPV) strategy, which originated in ancient China for fighting smallpox, has been applied successfully in the USA military recruits for decades to control acute respiratory diseases caused by types 4 and 7 adenoviruses. This strategy has also been widely employed in veterinary medicine. These facts suggest a fast way out of the current pandemic crisis, namely that SARS‐CoV‐2 could be directly used as a live vaccine. Beyond the two traditional mechanisms to guarantee the LPV's safety (SARS‐CoV‐2 is not highly pathogenic; the LPV is inoculated bypassing the respiratory sites of pathology), three novel mechanisms to further ensure the LPV's safety are available (the virus replication is inhibited with early use of an antiviral drug; symptomatic LPV recipients are cured with convalescent plasma; the LPV is inoculated in hot seasons). This LPV strategy has multiple potential advantages over other options, and could reduce greatly the morbidity and mortality as well as economic loss caused by the pandemic. The safety and efficacy of this strategy should be investigated strictly using animal experiments and clinical trials, and even if the experiments and trials all support the strategy, it should be implemented with enough cautiousness.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The rate of PICA occlusion after flow-diverting stent placement for vertebral and vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms is not known. The purpose of this study is to determine the medium-term rate of PICA patency and risk factors for occlusion after such aneurysm treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were identified who had vertebral or vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms and who were treated by placing a flow-diverting stent across the PICA ostium. Demographic and procedural factors associated with stent placement were recorded. Patency of the PICA was evaluated immediately after stent placement and on follow-up angiography. RESULTS Thirteen patients with vertebral or vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms were treated in the study period, of whom 4 presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The average number of devices that spanned the PICA ostium was 1.77 (range, 1-3), with no immediate PICA occlusions. There were no postoperative strokes in the treated PICA territory, although there was 1 contralateral PICA-territory stroke of unclear etiology without clinical sequelae. In 11 patients with follow-up angiography at a mean of 10.6 months (range, 0.67-27.9 months), the PICA patency rate remained 100%. CONCLUSIONS Flow-diverting stent placement across the PICA ostium in the treatment of vertebral and vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms may not result in immediate or midterm PICA occlusion.

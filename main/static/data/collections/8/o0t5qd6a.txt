OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the proportion of healthcare workers with a positive serology for Influenza A(H1N1)2009 without having flu, in a Spanish hospital at the beginning of the pandemic. METHODS: A survey study carried out during August 2009 (before the peak of the pandemic in Spain) in the Hospital Costa del Sol, a second level hospital with almost 300 beds in the South of Spain. The participants were workers in the following hospital units: Emergencies, Medical Area (Internal Medicine, Chest Diseases), Surgical Area (General Surgery and Anaesthesia) of any professional category. A study was made of the proportion of healthcare workers in our hospital with positive serology for the new influenza A (H1N1)2009 virus, as determined by the haemagglutination inhibition technique (â‰¥1/40). The subjects completed a health status questionnaire, and provided a blood sample for serology testing. RESULTS: A total of 239 workers participated, of whom 25.1% had positive serology. The hospital area in which most individuals had positive serology was the Emergency Department (36.6%), while the professional category in which most individuals with a positive serology worked was that of the orderlies (41.7%). CONCLUSION: Around 25% of healthcare workers in our hospital had positive serology before the peak of the pandemic, none of them had received vaccine for Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 or had been diagnosed of influenza previously.

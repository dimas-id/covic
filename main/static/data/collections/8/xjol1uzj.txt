Evidence for the intermolecular recombination between the RNA genomes of picornaviruses and coronaviruses as well as current models of the mechanisms of these phenomena are reviewed. Biological implications of the recombination between RNA genomes are briefly discussed. Examples of the recombinant analysis of the viral genome functions are given.

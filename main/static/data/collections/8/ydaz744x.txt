Limited availability of personal protective equipment is endangering first-line health-care providers treating patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 infections. This editorial has multiple objectives in regard to this reality: First, to raise awareness of the need for safe and effective prophylaxis to protect health-care providers with insufficient personal protective equipment from repeated exposures to COVID-19. Second, to summarize the scientific evidence in support of solutions of acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) and its daughter compounds, chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide, as potential targets for said prophylactic use. Third, to propose a regimented protocol using commercially available solutions of ASC having sufficient concentrations of chlorine dioxide for virucidal activity to support safe and effective prophylactic use. And fourth, to raise awareness of and compare other potential prophylactic options currently under investigation.

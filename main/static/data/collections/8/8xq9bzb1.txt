Secure closure of wounds is vital to any plastic surgery procedure. Recent developments in suture design have incorporated the creation of small barbs along the suture strand that are intended to engage the surrounding soft tissue and "lock" the suture (and, therefore, the wound closure) into place. Early experience with this type of modified suture has shown promise for a host of wound closure indications, including the closure of skin and fat as well as superficial and deep fascia. Advantages include secure wound closure, elimination of the need for a "third hand," decreased operative time, and an improved appearance in cutaneous scars.

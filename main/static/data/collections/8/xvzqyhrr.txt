INTRODUCTION The use of biomaterials to treat anal fistula has drawn great interest. More recently, a porcine dermal matrix injection has been proposed as infill biomaterial to treat fistulas. METHODS We propose a novel approach consisting in non-cutting seton positioning followed by flap repair associated with dermal matrix injection into the fistula tracts after several weeks. RESULTS We report our experience with this two-staged procedure on 11 consecutive patients with recurrent high trans-sphincteric fistulas with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, this two-stage approach seems to be safe and effective.

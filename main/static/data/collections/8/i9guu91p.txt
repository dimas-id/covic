BACKGROUND Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is accepted as a minimally invasive treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, RFA is not fully evaluated for treating RCC in patients with von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease who cannot undergo surgery due to serious postoperative morbidity or mortality. PURPOSE To evaluate the role of RFA of RCC in patients with VHL disease previously undergoing renal surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Percutaneous RFA was performed for treating 14 RCCs in six patients who had undergone radical nephrectomy (n = 3) or repeated nephron-sparing surgery (n = 3). Treatment feasibility, complications, outcome, and the change of renal function were evaluated. RESULTS To completely ablate 14 RCCs, 23 ablations during 12 sessions were necessary. Of 14 RCCs, nine were in proximity (<5 mm) to one or more following organs: bowel (n = 4), ureteropelvic junction or pelvis (n = 2), psoas muscle (n = 2), vascular pedicle (n = 1), and pancreas (n = 1). Of 12 sessions, one major complication (pneumothorax) developed in one session (8%). No residual or recurrent tumors were identified at the ablation areas. However, new three solid tumors less than 1 cm in diameter developed during the follow-up period but ablation was withheld until these tumors had grown to more than 1 cm in size. The mean level of serum creatinine increased with 6.4% and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 12.8% after the last ablation compared to those before the initial ablation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Despite technical difficulties, percutaneous RFA is a promising treatment for VHL patients who cannot undergo surgery because of excellent treatment outcome and minimal change of renal function.

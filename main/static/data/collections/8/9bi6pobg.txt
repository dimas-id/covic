We evaluated the impact of early social distancing on the COVID-19 transmission in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area. Using an age-stratified SEIR model, we determined the time-dependent reproductive number, and forecasted the ICU beds necessary to tackle this epidemic. Within 60 days, these measures might prevent 89,133 deaths.

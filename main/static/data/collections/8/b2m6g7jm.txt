Pleomorphic virus-like particles about 100 nm in diameter with a fringe of closely applied peplomers (7-9 nm in length) were observed by electron microscopy in the stools of 20 children and adults with gastroenteritis. In most of the samples no other viral or bacterial pathogens were detected. In form and under immune electron microscopy these virus-like particles resembled the Breda virus isolated from diarrhoeic calves. These objects may be a viral pathogen of humans.

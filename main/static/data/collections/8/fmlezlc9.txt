In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there are many questions regarding the safe treatment of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Many of these questions cannot yet be answered on an evidence-based basis and this does not make patient care easy. The German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) hopes that these initial recommendations will provide support for specific issues in the care of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in view of the current threat posed by SARS-CoV-2. In order to take advantage of the dynamic worldwide gain in knowledge for our patients, the recommendations will be updated regularly. The updated versions of the recommendations are deposited on the homepage of the DGRh.

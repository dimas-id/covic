Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been introduced as a viable alternative to heart transplantation primarily through the use of intracorporeal ventricular assist devices (VADs) for support of the left ventricle. However, certain clinical scenarios warrant biventricular mechanical support. One strategy for some patients is the excision of both ventricles and the implantation of two VAD pumps as a total artificial heart (TAH). This has recently been made possible by the improvements in device design and the small profile of centrifugal devices. This TAH approach remains experimental with many important challenges such as the device settings to balance the right and left circulation, the orientation of the devices and the outflow graft with their influence on hemolysis and stability, and the outcome of chronic support using such an orientation. This protocol aims to provide a reproducible approach for total artificial heart replacement with two intracorporeal centrifugal VADs in a cow model.

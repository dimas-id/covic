We describe and analyze compartmental models for disease transmission. We begin with models for epidemics, showing how to calculate the basic reproduction number and the final size of the epidemic. We also study models with multiple compartments, including treatment or isolation of infectives. We then consider models including births and deaths in which there may be an endemic equilibrium and study the asymptotic stability of equilibria. We conclude by studying age of infection models which give a unifying framework for more complicated compartmental models.

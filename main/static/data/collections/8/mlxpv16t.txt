The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is placing significant strains on health systems, scientific communities, essential public services, and economies all over the world. In this context, the worldÂ´s scientific biomedical establishment is unleashing an unprecedented response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a battle against time, considering the thousands of human lives are lost every day. In this commentary, based on a very recent research report, we intend to highlight how a new mechanism describing the RAGE transactivation produced by Ang II-mediated ATR1 activation can run continuously and thus, reinforcing a sustained inflammation in lungs, due to the SARS-Cov-2-mediated imbalance of the ACE/And II/ATR1 pathway.

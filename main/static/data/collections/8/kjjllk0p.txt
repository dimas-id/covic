Inflammasomes are multiprotein assemblies that produce robust inflammatory responses upon stimulation with pathogen- and/or danger-associated molecular patterns. Uncontrolled inflammasome activation has been linked to the pathophysiology of a wide array of disorders including life-threatening pathogenic infections, e.g., Francisella tularensis. There has been a great deal of interest in the development of small molecule inflammasome inhibitors. Using computational modeling based on chalcone derivatives, we have developed novel tertiary sulfonylurea compounds as inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The polar enone functional alert of chalcone was replaced with a sulfonylurea scaffold while maintaining the relative positions of the two aromatic rings. These compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activation triggered by Francisella tularensis infection.

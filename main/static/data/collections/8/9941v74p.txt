In this paper, we propose a new reproducible and efficient parallel SAT solving algorithm. Unlike sequential SAT solvers, most parallel solvers do not guarantee reproducible behavior due to maximizing the performance. The unstable and non-deterministic behavior of parallel SAT solvers hinders a wider adoption of parallel solvers to the practical applications. In order to achieve robust and efficient parallel SAT solving, we propose two techniques to significantly reduce idle time in deterministic parallel SAT solving: delayed clause exchange and accurate estimation of execution time of clause exchange interval between solvers. The experimental results show that our reproducible parallel SAT solver has comparable performance to non-deterministic parallel SAT solvers even in a many-core environment.

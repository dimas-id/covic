Vaccination is an effective measure to control the diffusion of infectious disease such as COVID-19. This paper analyzes the basic reproduction number in South Korea which enables us to identify a necessary level of vaccine stockpile to achieve herd immunity. An susceptible-infected-susceptible model is adopted that allows a stochastic diffusion. The result shows that the basic reproduction number of South Korea is approximately 2 which is substantially lower than those of the other regions. The herd immunity calculated from economic-epidemiological model suggests that at least 62% of the susceptible population be vaccinated when COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.

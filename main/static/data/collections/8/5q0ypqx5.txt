The author presents a technique for performing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, accompanied by an online video. This method is suitable for a single surgeon working with a single assistant, who is also the cameraman. It starts with a hybrid medial-to-lateral or lateral-to-medial dissection of the right colon and mesentery, adapting to the actual anatomical findings and adhesions encountered in each individual patient. A step-by-step approach is described. Achieving the anatomical goals of each step facilitates the performance of the next step. An intracorporeal technique for anastomosis is demonstrated.

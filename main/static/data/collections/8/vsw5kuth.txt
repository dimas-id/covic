The recurrent and recent global outbreak of SARS-COV-2 has turned into a global concern which has infected more than one million people all over the globe, and this number is increasing in hours. Unfortunate no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which make it more deadly. An immunoinformatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B Cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which found to be 100% conserved with other SARS coronaviruses. Furthermore, the population coverage analysis has found that CD4+ T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over to CD8+ peptides in the 16 different geographical regions in the world. Notably, only 09 out of 15 peptides (LTDEMIAQY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQ, VITPGTNTS, WTAGAAAYY and QTQTNSPRRARS) that have 80% - 90% identity with experimentally identified epitopes of different organisms including SARS-CoV and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design. Moreover, docking analysis suggested that these peptides are tightly bound in the groove of HLA molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall this study allows us to determine potent peptide antigen targets in surface glycoprotein on intuitive grounds which open up a new horizon in COVID-19 research. However, this study needs experimental validation by in vitro and in vivo.

Laparoscopic methods that combine multiple surgical procedures are becoming more widely used, but few combined procedures performed through a single incision have been reported. A major difficulty with the single-incision approach is that all the instruments are necessarily oriented along the same axis. Here, we describe a patient in whom supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sacrocolpopexy and Burch colposuspension were performed during the same operative session via a single umbilical port.

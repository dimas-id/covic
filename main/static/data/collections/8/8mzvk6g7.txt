PURPOSE OF REVIEW Soy isoflavones are known to have beneficial effects on several aspects of gastrointestinal physiological functions (contractility or motility, secretion, morphology, and barrier function). In this review, we discuss the effects of soy isoflavones on the overall gut function and inflammation and assess how these effects might be implicated in the treatment of several gut-related diseases. RECENT FINDINGS Soy isoflavones influence several key aspects of gastrointestinal health: improve basal intestinal secretion, alleviate inflammation, limit intestinal morphological damage, and improve epithelial barrier function in several clinically relevant murine models of gastrointestinal diseases. Dietary supplementation with isoflavones proves to be a key means to improve the overall gut function and health. Future mechanistic studies with isoflavone interventions will help treat clinically related diseases such as cystic fibrosis and inflammatory-related gut problems such as colitis and diabetes.

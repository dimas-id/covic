BACKGROUND A growing number of older adults experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Recent technological advances allow for traditional cognitive interventions to be administered via computers and other devices. The aim of the proposed systematic review and meta-analyses is to determine the efficacy of computerised cognitive interventions for MCI and dementia in older adults. METHODS We will systematically search electronic databases and reference lists to identify randomised controlled trials. We will include studies that examine the use of computer-based cognitive interventions for adults aged over 60 with MCI or dementia. Primarily outcomes are global and domain-specific cognitive function. Secondary outcomes are attitudes (usability, understandability, acceptability of the intervention), mood and quality of life. Risk of bias will be assessed. Finally, the summary effect sizes will be reported. DISCUSSION This systematic review will summarise existing high-quality primary studies on computerised-cognitive interventions for MCI and dementia. Results from this review will provide the basis for future research in developing computer-based interventions for this population. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION PROSPERO CRD42016050236.

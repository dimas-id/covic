BACKGROUND Many epidemiological studies have investigated the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in individuals with a psychiatric disorder. In an umbrella review, we aim to systematically summarize existing systematic reviews examining the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in people with a psychiatric disorder. When information is available in the identified systematic reviews, comparisons with control groups without a psychiatric disorder will be made. Furthermore, we aim to assess the quality of the included systematic reviews. METHODS The umbrella review will be based on a comprehensive systematic search of systematic reviews of observational (cross-sectional or longitudinal) studies investigating the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in people with a psychiatric disorder. Four electronic databases (Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) will be searched. Retrieved papers will be screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Furthermore, the reference lists of all included publications will be screened. Data will be extracted by using an a priori developed data extraction form and two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias in the included systematic reviews using with the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool. A narrative data-synthesis and a subsequent meta-analysis based on the primary studies will be made. DISCUSSION For each psychiatric disorder, the data regarding the prevalence of type 2 diabetes will be summarized and discussed. When possible, comparisons with control groups will be reported and discussed. Finally, future implications and recommendations for clinical care will be presented. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION This protocol was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on December 9, 2019 (registration number: pending).

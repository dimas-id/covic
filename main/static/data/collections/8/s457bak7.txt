As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, also called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARSCoV-2) outbreak accelerates, vigorous and diverse efforts were made in developing treatment strategies. In addition to direct acting agents, increasing evidence showed some potential adjuvant therapies with promising efficacy against COVID-19. These therapies include immunomodulators (i.e. intravenous immunoglobulin, thymosin &#945;-1, IL-6, tocilizumab, cyclosporine, thalidomide, fingolimod), Chinese medicines (i.e. glycyrrhizin, baicalin, Xuebijing), anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (bevacizumab), estrogen modulating drugs, statins and nutritional supplements (i.e. vitamin A, B, C, D, E and zinc). This article reviewed the pharmacological development of potential adjuvants for COVID-19 treatment.

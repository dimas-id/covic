Abstract Keywords: predictive model; prognosis; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Deep-learning; Artificial intelligence; Chest radiograph Background: Chest radiography may be used together with deep-learning models to prognosticate COVID-19 patient outcomes Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a deep-learning model for the prediction of severe patient outcomes from COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Methods: A deep-learning model (CAPE: Covid-19 AI Predictive Engine) was trained on 2337 CXR images including 2103 used only for validation while training. The prospective test set consisted of CXR images (n=70) obtained from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients between 1 January and 30 April 2020 in a single center. The radiographs were analyzed by the AI model. Model performance was obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: In the prospective test set, the mean age of the patients was 46 (+/- 16.2) years (84.2% male). The deep-learning model accurately predicted outcomes of ICU admission/mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.96). Compared to traditional risk scoring systems for pneumonia based upon laboratory and clinical parameters, the model matched the EWS and MulBTSA risk scoring systems and outperformed CURB-65. Conclusions: A deep-learning model was able to predict severe patient outcomes (ICU admission and mortality) from COVID-19 on chest radiographs.

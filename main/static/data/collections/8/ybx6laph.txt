Background This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of lobectomy operations without using a stapler for bronchial closure. Methods Between December 2014 and August 2018, a total of 108 patients (72 males, 36 females; mean age 62.1Â±9.8 years; range, 19 to 83 years) with primary lung cancer who underwent lobar resection with robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were included in this study. Primary bronchial closure (n=7) and sleeve anastomosis (n=9) were performed in some cases. These 16 patients were compared with other lobectomy cases (n=92) who had bronchial stapling for bronchial closure. Results There was no statistically significant difference in the mean duration of operation, amount of intraoperative bleeding, length of postoperative stay in the hospital, and morbidity and readmission rates between the two groups (p=0.3, p=0.5, p=0.06, p=0.4, and p=0.63, respectively). No bronchial fistula developed in any of the patients. Conclusion Primary bronchial closure and sleeve anastomosis can be safely performed with robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery without conversion to thoracotomy, or a larger assistance incision with a similar success rate of the stapled bronchus.

Inferior vena cava filters are important tools used to help prevent life-threatening pulmonary embolisms in hospitalized patients with contraindications to pharmacological prophylactic anticoagulation. This is a case report of a patient who had an inferior vena cava filter placed after a traumatic subdural hematoma. He made a complete recovery but was lost to follow-up until he presented 1825 days after filter deployment with abdominal pain discovered to be from penetration of the filter tines outside the lumen and into adjacent structures. We describe a case complicated by fibrotic tine entrapment with penetration to surrounding structures and discuss the technical approach used to free and eventually remove the long-standing filter.

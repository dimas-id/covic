To improve resource allocation in face of the COVID‐19 pandemic, hospitals around the country are restricting the performance of elective surgery to preserve ventilators, operating rooms, ICU beds and protect anesthesiologists. For patients with severe aortic stenosis, efforts to bring treatment to symptomatic patients amid this pandemic might lead to favored use of catheter based management using minimalist techniques that do not require these elements. In this context, some patients with well tested surgical indications for valve replacement may be treated by catheter‐based methods. It is important that outcomes for these cases are followed closely both at respective sites and in national registries. As we recover from this pandemic, surgical cases should once again be driven by multi‐disciplinary discussion and clinical trial data, and not a mentality of crisis management.

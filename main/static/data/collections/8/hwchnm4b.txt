BACKGROUND Chest CT has an essential role in the detection and evaluation of novel coronary pneumonia (COVID-19) and has be regarded as a critical supplement for RT-PCR. This study explored the dynamic CT manifestations of COVID-19 at different times and the value of some laboratory indicators for clinical guidance. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective review included 44 patients who were infected with COVID-19. The dynamic chest CT and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records. The intervals between onset and CT scans and the dynamic changes of the lesions were recorded. The above data were reviewed, sorted, and analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 software. RESULTS From the time of onset, the dynamic image of the lungs became more complete. Fibrous cord shadow absorption in the lungs were observed. Experimental indicators, biochemical indicators of lymphocytes, and protein series were decreased to varying degrees, while erythrocyte sedimentation, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were increased to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Although overall mortality rates in dialysis patients have improved during the last decade or so, infections remain a leading cause of death, second only to cardiovascular disease. In addition, infections account for a major share of hospitalizations in this patient population. Receiving hemodialysis treatments in an outpatient dialysis facility significantly contributes to patients’ risks for infection. In dialysis units, patient-to-patient transmission of viral pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus can occur; proper screening and vaccination of patients can decrease the risk for transmission. Strict adherence to hand hygiene, use of appropriate personal protective equipment, transmission-based precautions, and maintaining aseptic technique while connecting the access to the hemodialysis machine can substantially decrease the likelihood of bacterial infections. With an effective infection control program in place, infection prevention becomes part of the dialysis facility’s culture and results in improved patient safety. In this installment of the Core Curriculum series, we highlight best practices that should be followed by health care workers in the dialysis unit and discuss the role of the medical director in promoting initiatives to reduce infection rates.

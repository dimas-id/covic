From 1988 to 1997, a total of 69 mouse colonies and 36 rat colonies were examined for the presence of antibodies to 14 indigenous viruses of mice and rats. Among mouse viruses, high positivity rates were observed with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus (THEMV), minute virus of mice (MVM), Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM); the prevalence rates were high in rats with Khilam's rat virus (KRV), THEMV, Toolan's H-1 virus, Sendai virus, Parker's rat coronavirus (RCV/SDA) and PVM. During the last decade, the prevalence of some agents such as MHV, Sendai virus, THEMV, PVM and MVM has apparently decreased although they were still present in 1997 (except for PVM). Another point is the constant increase of colonies found free of viruses through this decade, demonstrating the efforts of the French research community to increase the quality of hygiene in laboratory animals.

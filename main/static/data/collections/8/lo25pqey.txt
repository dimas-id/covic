For many years, open gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy was the gold standard treatment for gastric cancer. In recent years, however, laparoscopic assisted total gastrectomy with associated D2 lymphadenectomy has gained in popularity. It has a similar oncological outcome to open resection, but has all of the added advantages of a laparoscopic procedure, such as early mobilisation, less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay. This article describes the operative techniques, including key procedure steps, as well as a guide for using the new OrVil device for the laparoscopic creation of the oesophago-jejunal anastomosis. A video of a laparoscopic assisted total gastrectomy is presented.

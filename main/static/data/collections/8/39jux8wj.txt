Abstract The term Molecular mimicry describes the sequence similarity between foreign (microorganism's peptides) and self peptides (the host's antigen). This phenomenon has been recently discovered as a one of the major mechanism in which there is a break-down of self-tolerance of the immune system following autoimmunity. After a short preface, the chapter contains examples of common infectious agents and their role in autoimmune diseases. Later on, it describes the autoimmune diseases in which there was found a relation to infectious agents via molecular mimicry mechanism. The data is summarized in two tables.

PURPOSE To evaluate the reproducibility of oxygen-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the influence of different gas delivery methods, in a clinical environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve healthy volunteers were examined on two visits with an inversion recovery snapshot fast low angle shot sequence on a 1.5 T system. Coronal slices were obtained breathing room air as well as 100% oxygen with a flow rate of 15 L/min. For oxygen delivery a standard nontight face mask and a full closed air-cushion face mask were used. T1 relaxation times and the oxygen transfer function (OTF) were calculated. RESULTS The mean T1 values did not change significantly between the two visits (P > 0.05). The T1 values breathing 100% oxygen obtained using the full closed mask were significantly lower (1093 ± 38 msec; P < 0.05) compared to the standard mask (1157 ± 52 msec). Accordingly, the OTF was significantly higher for the full closed mask (P < 0.05). The OTF changed significantly on the second visit using the standard mask (P < 0.05). The full closed mask showed lower interindividual variation for both the T1 values (3.5% vs. 4.5%) as well as the OTF (12.4% vs. 22.0%) and no difference of the OTF on the second visit (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Oxygen-enhanced T1 mapping MRI produces reproducible data when using a full closed face mask.

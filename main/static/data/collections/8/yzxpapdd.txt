Abstract Recently, there has been a steady increase in the number of recognized pathogenic microorganisms, specifically bacteria. The development of genetic technologies, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and new culturing techniques has significantly widened the repertoire of known microorganisms and therefore pathogenic microorganisms. The repertoire of infectious agents has been studied in various environments including water, soil, pets, livestock, wildlife and arthropods. Using different methods, many known pathogens can be identified in these samples; therefore, the impact of emergent pathogens on humans can be examined and novel pathogens can be identified. In this special issue, we discuss the identification of emerging pathogens in the environment and animals.

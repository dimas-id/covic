The incidence and RNA electrophoretypes of rotaviral isolates obtained from infants and young children with acute gastroenteritis were studied from October, 1985 through April, 1986. Analysis of the viral RNA was carried out by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. Fourteen electrophoretypes were identified. A single dominant electrophoretype was found during the first months of the rotavirus seasonal outbreak. In contrast, a large variety of RNA patterns were observed during the latter portion of the study period. Subgrouping of rotavirus isolates by a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal-detecting antibodies showed that all strains belonged to subgroup II. Mixed rotavirus electrophoretypes appeared in 4 cases (8.16 %).

Bacteriophages are among the most numerous creatures on earth and they are omnipresent. They are thus in constant natural contact with humans and animals. However, the clinical and technological use of bacteriophages has also become more frequent, which is why all aspects of phageâ€“mammal interactions need to be explored. Bacteriophages are able to interact with mammalian phagocytes. They may inhibit the phagocytosis of bacteria, but they may also undergo phagocytosis themselves. The ability of bacteriophages to reduce reactive oxygen species production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of bacteria or their endotoxins was also confirmed. Studies show that the high immunogenicity of bacteriophages may also be employed in anti-tumor treatment. The present knowledge of phage interactions with cellular components of the mammalian immune system is sparse and insufficient, especially considering the increasing interest in the application of these viruses in human life. We believe that continuation of such research is indispensable.

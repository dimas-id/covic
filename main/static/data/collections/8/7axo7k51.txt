Abstract What began with a sign of pneumonia-related respiratory disorders in China has now become a pandemic named by WHO as Covid-19 known to be caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 are newly emerged Î² coronaviruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive viral RNA genome expressing open reading frames that code for structural and non-structural proteins. The spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope proteins are structural proteins. The S1 subunit of spike protein facilitates ACE2 mediated virus attachment and S2 subunit for membrane fusion. The presence of glutamine, asparagine, leucine, phenylalanine and serine amino in SARS-CoV-2 enhanced ACE2 binding. The N protein is composed of a serine-rich linker region sandwiched between N terminal (NTD) and C terminal (CTD). These terminals play a role in viral entry and its processing post entry. The NTD of SARS-CoV-2 N protein forms orthorhombic crystals and binds to the viral genome. The linker region contains phosphorylation sites that regulate its functioning. The CTD promotes nucleocapsid formation. Envelope proteins contain an NTD, hydrophobic domain and C terminal which form viroporins needed for viral assembly. Membrane proteins hydrophilic C terminal and amphipathic N terminal. Its long-form promotes spike incorporations and interaction with E facilitate virion production. As each protein is essential in viral functioning, this review describes the insights of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins that would help in developing therapeutic strategies by targeting each protein to curb the rapidly growing pandemic.

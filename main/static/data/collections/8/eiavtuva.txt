Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by generalized intra-alveolar bleeding originating from the pulmonary microcirculation. The finding of DAH carries an extended differential diagnosis and may be associated with a number of histopathologic patterns. The prompt recognition and diagnosis of DAH is of critical importance to the practicing clinician as accurate diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy may dramatically improve patient outcomes. This chapter reviews the diagnosis and management of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

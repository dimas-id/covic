Immunohistochemical techniques were used to investigate the cellular distribution of components of the secretory immune system, including secretory immunoglobulin, secretory piece, and J chain, as well as other immunoglobulins and nonspecific defense factors in the olfactory mucosae of salamanders and rats. In the salamander, secretory immunoglobulin M, and J chain were localized in duct and acinar cells of Bowman's glands, in B lymphocytes, and in sustentacular cells in immature regions of the olfactory mucosa. Lactoferrin and lysozyme were also present in Bowman's glands, in sustentacular cells in immature regions of the olfactory mucosa, and in blood cells in the lamina propria. Olfactory nerve section resulted in the presence of increased numbers of secretory immunoglobulin‐immunoreactive B lymphocytes and in an altered distribution of IgM, secretory piece, and lactoferrin. In the rat, secretory immunoglobulin A and J chain were localized in duct and acinar cells of Bowman's glands and in B lymphocytes in the lamina propria. Secretory piece could be demonstrated in Bowman's glands only in rats that had a prior viral infection. Other defense factors, localized in the lamina propria, included IgG in the connective tissue stroma and in B lymphocytes, IgD‐immunore‐active B lymphocytes, and IgE‐immunoreactive cells that were identified as mucosal mast cells. Lactoferrin and lysozyme were present in serous acinar cells of Bowman's glands and in blood cells. These results demonstrate that the olfactory mucosa is protected from pathogenic invasion by the secretory immune system as well as other immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and lysozyme.

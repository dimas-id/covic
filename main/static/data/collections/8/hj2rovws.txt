A 52‐year‐old male with no history of familiar sudden death arrived at our Emergency Department after syncope with loss of consciousness occurred during high fever. The thoracic high‐resolution computed tomography demonstrated bilateral multiple ground‐glass opacities. The nose‐pharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. The 12‐lead ECG presented a “coved‐type” aspect in leads V1 and V2 at the fourth intercostal space and a first degree atrio‐ventricular block. As soon as the temperature went down, the 12‐lead ECG resumed a normal aspect, maintaining a long PR interval.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the inter- and intrarater reliability of noncontrast CT (NCCT) markers [Black Hole Sign (BH), Blend Sign (BS), Island Sign (IS), and Hypodensities (HD)] and Spot Sign (SS) on CTA in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS Patients with spontaneous ICH at three German tertiary stroke centers were retrospectively included. Each CT scan was rated for four NCCT markers and SS on CTA by two radiology residents. Raters were blind to all demographic and outcome data. Inter- and intrarater agreement was determined by Cohen's kappa (κ) coefficient and percentage of agreement. RESULTS Interrater agreement was excellent in 473 included patients, ranging from 96% to 99%. Interrater κ ranged from 0.85 (95% CI [0.78-0.91]) to 0.97 (95% CI [0.94-0.99]) for NCCT markers and 0.93 (95% CI [0.88-0.98]) for SS, all p-values < 0.001. Intrarrater agreement ranged from 96% to 100%, with κ ranging from 0.85 (95% CI [0.78-0.91]) to 1.00 (95% CI [0.10-0.85]) for NCCT markers and 0.96 (95% CI [0.92-1.00]) for SS, all p-values < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS NCCT imaging findings and SS on CTA have good-to-excellent inter- and intrarater reliabilities, with the highest agreement for BH and SS.

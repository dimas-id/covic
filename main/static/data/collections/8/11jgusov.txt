PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last year, an increasing number of studies have reported on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission in Africa and Asia and in migrant workers. We reviewed original research on occupational health and safety of animal workers published from January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, with a targeted focus on infectious disease studies published in these populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies focused on occupational exposures to infectious agents, dust and allergens, pesticides, and occupational injury. Research on zoonotic MRSA used whole genomeâ€“sequencing technologies to evaluate transmission in Africa and Asia. Swine worker exposure to porcine coronavirus and emerging influenza A viruses was documented in China. 16s RNA amplicon sequencing identified distinct microbiota compositions in households with active animal farmers. Multiple bioaerosol exposures were assessed for industrial dairy workers. Occupational injury studies highlighted the struggles of Latino animal workers in the USA. SUMMARY: These studies highlighted the global expansion of zoonotic antibiotic resistance and identified novel occupational zoonoses of concern. The integration of microbiome assessment and compound mixtures into the evaluation of dust and endotoxin exposures for animal workers marks a new direction for this work.

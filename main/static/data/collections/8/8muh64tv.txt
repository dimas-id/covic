Background Uterine manipulator is a very useful tool in performing total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) for large uteri; however, in some cases, it cannot be used due to unfavorable anatomical conditions. The feasibility and safety of TLH for very large uteri without the use of uterine manipulator has not yet been established. Results We describe two emblematic cases of TLH for huge fibromatous uteri: the first one for a uterus weighing 5700 g, which is the largest uterus laparoscopically removed to date reported in literature, and the second one for a uterus of 3670 g associated with a severe lymph node neoplastic disease.In both cases, TLH was successfully and safely performed even without the use of uterine manipulator, thus allowing a rapid recovery, especially in the second case, which was essential for a fast start of the most appropriate oncological treatment, the best quality of life and undoubtedly cosmetic advantages. Conclusions Although we believe in the great usefulness of the uterine manipulator in performing TLH for huge uteri, in the present paper, we demonstrate the feasibility and safety of such complex surgery also when the use of this tool is not possible due to unfavorable anatomical condition.

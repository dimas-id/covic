INTRODUCTION In order to improve the outcome of classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC), surgeons have attempted to minimize tissue trauma. The aim of this study is to describe the technique of mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MLC) and to report the outcome of this approach when used as a routine procedure. METHODS Since January 2012, all consecutive patients undergoing MLC were included in this study. Operative and perioperative data were prospectively collected. Additionally, cost analysis was performed. RESULTS From 2012 to 2015, 200 MLC were performed (F/M: 132/68, mean age 45±16 years). Mean operative duration was 97±32min for the first 50 patients and 75±25min for the subsequent 150 patients (P<0.0001). Modifications in the number or size of trocars were necessary in nine of the first 50 procedures and in seven of the subsequent 150 procedures (P=0.003). Perioperative morbidity included gallbladder perforation (n=28) or moderate (<50mL) bleeding (n=6). Postoperative morbidity was 4%. The mean global cost for a MLC procedure was 1757±1855 euros. This cost decreased from 2946±3115 euros in the first 50 patients to 1390±1278 euros in the subsequent 150 patients (P=0.001). CONCLUSION Mini-laparoscopy can be used for routine elective cholecystectomy. This approach is associated with low morbidity and good cosmetic results.

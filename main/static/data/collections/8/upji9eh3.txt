Rheum australe (Himalayan Rhubarb) is a multipurpose, endemic and endangered medicinal herb of North Western Himalayas. It finds extensive use as a medicinal herb since antiquity in different traditional systems of medicine to cure a wide range of ailments related to the circulatory, digestive, endocrine, respiratory and skeletal systems as well as to treat various infectious diseases. The remedying properties of this plant species are ascribed to a set of diverse bioactive secondary metabolite constituents, particularly anthraquinones (emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, aloe-emodin and rhein) and stilbenoids (piceatannol, resveratrol), besides dietary flavonoids known for their putative health benefits. Recent studies demonstrate the pharmacological efficacy of some of these metabolites and/or their derivatives as lead molecules for the treatment of various human diseases. Present review comprehensively covers the literature available on R. australe from 1980 to early 2018. The review provides up-to-date information available on its botany for easy identification of the plant, and origin and historical perspective detailing its trade and commerce. Distribution, therapeutic potential in relation to traditional uses and pharmacology, phytochemistry and general biosynthesis of major chemical constituents are also discussed. Additionally, efficient and reproducible in vitro propagation studies holding vital significance in preserving the natural germplasm of the plant and for its industrial exploitation have also been highlighted. The review presents a detailed perspective for future studies to conserve and sustainably make use of this endangered plant species at a commercial scale.

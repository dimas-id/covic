In order to study structure-activity relationships among the derivatives and congeners of 5',9-anhydro-3-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)xanthine for anti-hepatitis C virus activity, a series of 5',9-anhydro-purine-isonucleosides with a substituent (s) at 6- or/and 8-position of the purine moiety were synthesized, and their anti-hepatitis C virus activity and cytotoxicity were evaluated and discussed.

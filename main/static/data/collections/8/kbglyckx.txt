Objectives In microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm (HFS), the patient is placed in the lateral or park-bench position that is complicated and uncomfortable for anesthesiologists, nurses, and even the patient. Careless retraction of the cerebellum by a spatula could be the major cause of surgical complications. In our method, a patient is laid supine avoiding the complicated positioning. The subfloccular approach from a small cranial window sited on the more lateral and basal side of the occipital cranium enables the surgeon to reach all the segments of the facial nerve root without a spatula. We introduce our surgical procedures in detail along with our excellent results. Methods A total of 100 consecutive patients experiencing primary HFS were operated on with MVD by a single surgeon in our institution from August 2012 to April 2014. Results Overall, 94 patients showed the complete disappearance or a satisfactory alleviation of HFS. De novo neurologic deficits were not encountered after surgery including hearing impairment. In 47 cases, multiple offending vessels were observed in multiple possible affected sites in addition to the root entry/exit zone. Conclusions We believe this approach is superior for the safe and precise decompression of any part of the facial nerve root.

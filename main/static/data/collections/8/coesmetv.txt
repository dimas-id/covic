Biosensors are making a large impact in environmental, food, biomedical, and in many other applications. They provide many advantages. in comparison to standard analytical detection methods (i.e., chromatographic techniques) such as minimal sample preparation and handling, faster time analysis, simpler steps of analysis, rapid detection of the analytes of concern, use of non-skilled personnel, and portability for uses in the field applications. The aim of this chapter is to focus on novel research related to the rapid detection of agents and weapons of bioterrorism and provide a comprehensive review of the research topics most pertinent to advancing devices applicable to the rapid real-time detection of toxicants and bioterrorism weapons such as microbes, pathogens, toxins, virus, or nerve gases. The ongoing war on terrorism and the rising security concerns are driving the need for newer faster biosensing devices against bio-warfare agents for both military and civil defense applications. Readers of these review article will learn new schemes of biological weapons that can lead to the construction of devices that will minimize the risk of bio-terrorism.

A new human coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS‐CoV‐2), emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and we are now facing a pandemic (WHO 2020). The virus has been found in saliva (Meng et al 2020, Sabino et al 2020). In vitro experimental findings suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 remained viable in aerosols for 3 hours (van Doremalen et al 2020).

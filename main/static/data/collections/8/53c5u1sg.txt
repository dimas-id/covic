INTRODUCTION Neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) undergoing hypothermia may benefit from adjunctive therapy with melatonin. However, melatonin safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and dosage in this sensitive population are still unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS This study assessed the PK and safety of melatonin enteral administration to neonates with HIE undergoing hypothermia. Melatonin was infused at 0.5 mg/kg in five neonates with HIE undergoing hypothermia. Infusion started 1 hour after the neonates reached the target temperature of 33.5°C. Blood samples were collected before and at selective times after melatonin infusion. Abdominal complications or clinically significant changes in patients' vital signs were not found during or after melatonin. The peak plasma concentration reached 0.25 µg/mL. The area under the curve in 24 hours was 4.35 µg/mL*h. DISCUSSION Melatonin half-life and clearance were prolonged, and the distribution volume decreased compared to adults. In silico simulation estimated that the steady state can be reached after four infusions. Hypothermia does not affect melatonin PK. In humans high blood concentrations with lower doses can be achieved compared to animal experimentation, although intravenous administration is advised in the neonate population. Our study is a preparatory step for future clinical studies aimed at assessing melatonin efficacy in HIE.

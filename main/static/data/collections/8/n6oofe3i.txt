In this population-wide study in Ontario, Canada we report on all 194,372 unique residents who received testing for SARS-CoV-2 between January 23, 2020 and April 28, 2020. We found that while more women than men were tested for SARS-CoV-2, men had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, ICU admission and death. These findings were consistent even with age adjustment, suggesting that the observed differences in outcomes between women and men were not explained by age or systematic differences in testing by sex. Instead, they may be due to sex-based immunological or other gendered differences, such as higher rates of smoking leading to cardiovascular disease.

Organ and stem cell transplantation has been one of the greatest advances in modern medicine, and is the primary treatment modality for many end-stage diseases. As our population ages, so do the transplant recipients, and with that comes many new challenges. Respiratory viruses have been a large contributor to the mortality and morbidity of solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Respiratory viruses are generally a long-term complication of transplantation and primarily acquired in the community. With the emergence of molecular methods, newer respiratory viruses are being detected. Respiratory viruses appear to cause severe disease in the older transplant population. Influenza vaccine remains the mainstay of prevention in transplant recipients, although immunogenicity of current vaccines is suboptimal. Limited therapies are available for other respiratory viruses. The next decade will likely bring newer antivirals and vaccines to the forefront. Our goal is to provide the most up to date knowledge of respiratory viral infections in our aging transplant population.

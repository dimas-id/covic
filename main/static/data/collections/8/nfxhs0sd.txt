Let me get this out right off the bat: no one solution is 100% effective in mitigating the risk of ransomware. Some technologies are claiming to have tested hundreds of samples, and that their tool is perfect in stopping all types of attacks. Iâ€™m sorry, but that is a falsehood. Why? If any single vendor had a solution that could solve the problem completely, ransomware would not be such a problem.

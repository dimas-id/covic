Objective: To describe current hospital guidelines and the opinions of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation leaders at U S children’s hospitals concerning the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019–positive pediatric patients Design: Confidential, self-administered questionnaire Setting: One hundred twenty-seven U S pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers Subjects: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center program directors and coordinators Interventions: None Measurements and Main Results: In March 2020, a survey was sent to 127 pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers asking them to report their current hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019–positive patients Respondents were also asked their opinion on three ethical dilemmas including: prioritization of children over adults for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, institution of do-not-resuscitate orders, and the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019–positive patients Forty-seven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers had enacted guidelines including 46 (100%) that offer venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 42 (89%) that offer venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019–positive pediatric patients Forty-four centers (94%) stated that the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation candidacy in coronavirus disease 2019 disease were similar to those used in other viral illnesses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza Most program directors (98%) did not endorse that children hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 should be made do-not-resuscitate and had variable opinions on whether children should be given higher priority over adults when rationing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Over half of program directors (60%) did not support the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019 Conclusions: The majority of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers have proactively established guidelines for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019–related illnesses Further work is needed to help guide the fair allocation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation resources and to determine the appropriateness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation Drs MacGregor and Antiel are co-first authors Supplemental digital content is available for this article Direct URL citations appear in the printed text and are provided in the HTML and PDF versions of this article on the journal’s website (http://journals lww com/pccmjournal) The authors have disclosed that they do not have any potential conflicts of interest For information regarding this article, E-mail: baddr@wustl edu ©2020The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies

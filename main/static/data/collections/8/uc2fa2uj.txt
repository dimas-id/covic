A clinical outbreak of bovine piroplasmosis was reported in Italy. The etiological agent was characterized as Babesia occultans, a parasite regarded as apathogenic and never detected before in continental Europe. This report paves the way for further studies to assess the occurrence of this tick-transmitted protozoan in other European regions.

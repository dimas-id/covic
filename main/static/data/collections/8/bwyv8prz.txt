BACKGROUND We conducted this study in order to evaluate whether laparoscopic appendectomy was an alternative therapeutic tool to open appendectomy for all stages of pediatric appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2000 and November 2004, the charts of 177 children who underwent appendectomy by a single surgeon were reviewed. The patients were divided into open and laparoscopic appendectomy groups. Each group was subdivided into three stages: simple appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and appendicitis with abscess. The age, gender, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, operating time, duration of postoperative hospital stay, minor and major complications, and use of intravenous analgesia were recorded. Fisher's exact and Student's t-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS There were fewer minor complications (9/32 vs. 0/20, p = 0.009) in perforated appendicitis stage and fewer major complications (9/26 vs. 1/24, p = 0.011) in appendicitis with abscess stage between open and laparoscopic appendectomy group. But surgery for each laparoscopic appendectomy group took longer to perform than for the corresponding open appendectomy group in each stage (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in other data between corresponding groups in each stage. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic appendectomy may be considered a better alternative to open appendectomy for children with perforated appendicitis and appendicitis with abscess.

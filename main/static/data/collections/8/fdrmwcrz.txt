Abstract Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus with high mortality. Immune suppression is thought to be crucial in disease progression. However, data on immune responses during SFTS are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in CD4 T-cell subsets throughout the entirety of infection and analyse their relationships with disease severity in SFTS patients. In parallel with CD4 T-cell depletion, decreased Th1, Th2 and Treg numbers, but comparable Th17-cell numbers, were observed in deceased patients compared with those in surviving patients. Additionally, increased Th2 and Th17-cell percentages in the residual CD4 T-cell population led to aberrant Th2/Th1 and Th17/Treg ratios, which were positively correlated with disease severity. Collectively, our data indicated that CD4 T-cell deficiency, Th2 and Th17 bias were closely correlated with the severity of SFTS, indicating therapeutic potential of early immune interventions to ameliorate disease severity.

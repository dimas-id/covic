BACKGROUND Leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are estimated to be the most serious complication of this procedure due to difficult healing process using non-standardized endoscopic approaches. Initially, endoscopic management recommended the use of stents. METHODS A total of 19 patients received endoscopic treatment after LSG to manage leaks. The leak was classified depending on the primary orifice's size (more or less than 10 mm) or on the presence of gastric stenosis. The primary aim was to develop a therapeutic algorithm in order to reduce the number of endoscopic procedures. RESULTS The average number of endoscopic procedures was 2.8 (range 2-5) in group A (leak size <10 mm) and 4 (range 3-7) in group B (leak size >10 mm). Two out of 13 patients had stent migration (15.4 %) and required an additional procedure, one in group A and another in group B. The average duration to achieve complete healing was 3.4 months (range 2-14 months), 2.8 months for group A and 3.9 months for group B. CONCLUSIONS Limited data can be found in the literature on leaks after LSG. A new algorithm based on leak size permits standardization of endoscopic management and reduces procedures after LSG.

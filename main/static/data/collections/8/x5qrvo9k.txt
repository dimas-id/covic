The amount of biological information accessible via the internet is growing at a tremendous rate. The biologists often encounter problems in accessing huge amount of widely spread data due to disparate formats, remotely dispersed and varying implementation on different platforms and data models. Besides that, the custom browsing and querying mechanism implemented in different data sources requires the users to uniquely query each individual database. Instead of having different custom interfaces to these public bioinformatics databases, an intuitive common integrated data access method is proposed to provide uniform transparent access to disparate biological databases. The proposed mediator-based architecture consists of three conceptual layers namely Query Formulation, Query Transformation and Query Execution.

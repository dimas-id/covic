Chyloretroperitoneum is a rare complication of urological surgery. Here we report a case of chyloretroperitoneum that occurred in a 28-year-old man post living-donor transplantation. Twenty-nine days post transplantation, perirenal fluid collection and hydronephrosis were detected and percutaneous drainage was performed. The fluid was chylous and revealed a very high triglyceride concentration (1,197 mg/dL). Total parenteral nutrition and administration of octreotide were performed, but the leakage did not improve. On the contrary, the drainage fluid gradually increased to 1,600 mL/day, and a laparoscopic fenestration was performed owing to a concern about the adverse effects of massive lymph loss. Ascites temporarily appeared but disappeared 3 months post fenestration. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of pelvic chyloretroperitoneum post living-donor transplantation. Furthermore, if chyloretroperitoneum treatment using diet control or octreotide is ineffective, laparoscopic fenestration can be considered as a treatment option.

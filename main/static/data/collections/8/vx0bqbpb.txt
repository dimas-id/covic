The pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19 virus has been a global challenge given its high rate of transmission and lack of effective therapy or vaccine. This scenario has led to the use of various drugs that have demonstrated a potential effect against the virus in vitro. However, time has not been enough to properly evaluate their clinical effectiveness. The use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and antiviral treatment and has been proposed by various groups, supported by in-vitro studies and limited patient series, without the adequate scientific rigor that precedes drug prescription. Although it may represent the only hope for many patients, it is important to know the main adverse effects associated with the use of these drugs and to better select patients who may benefit from them.

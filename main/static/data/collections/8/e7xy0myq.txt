Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cervical cancer‐promoting element that is transmitted through sexual routes. Anal, head, and throat cancers are also reported to be accompanied by HPV infection. E6 is one of the HPV nonstructural proteins, which is responsible for cell differentiation by targeting tumor suppressor genes, p105Rb and p53. E6 was reported to be stabilized by two chaperone proteins; glucose‐regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and heat shock protein 90. GRP78 is responsible for the unfolded protein response of the cells, and it was reported to be upregulated in many cancers, including cervical cancer. It was reported that knocking out GRP78 destabilizes E6 leading to faster degradation of E6 in vivo. The current work predicts the possible binding mode between E6 and GRP78 based on sequence and structural similarities.

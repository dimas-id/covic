Population dynamics are often affected by sudden environmental perturbations. Parameters of stochastic models are often imprecise due to various uncertainties. In this paper, we formulate a stochastic Lotka Volterra food chain chemostat model that includes Levy jumps and interval parameters. Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution. Moreover, the threshold between extinction and persistence in the mean of the microorganism is obtained. Finally, some simulations are carried out to demonstrate our theoretical results.

Mounting evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involves a hyperinflammatory response predisposing patients to thromboembolic disease and acute respiratory distress. In the setting of severe blunt trauma, damaged tissues induce a local and systemic inflammatory response through similar pathways to COVID-19. As such, patients with COVID-19 sustaining orthopaedic trauma injuries may have an amplified response to the traumatic insult because of their baseline hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states. These patients may have compromised physiological reserve to withstand the insult of surgical intervention before reaching clinical instability. In this article, we review the current evidence regarding pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its implications on the management of orthopaedic trauma patients by discussing a case and the most recent literature.

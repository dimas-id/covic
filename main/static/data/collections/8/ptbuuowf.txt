Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of illness and death in China. Approximately 60% of the population has a history of HBV infection, and 9.8% of persons in China are chronically infected with HBV and at risk for premature death from liver disease. Each year, an estimated 263,000 persons in China die from HBV-related liver cancer or cirrhosis, accounting for 37%-50% of HBV-related deaths worldwide. Because most HBV infections occur during infancy or early childhood, when HBV infection is most likely to become chronic, vaccination of infants beginning at birth is the key strategy for preventing chronic HBV infection. This report describes China's progress in increasing coverage among infants with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and timely administration of the HepB birth dose (i.e., within 24 hours of birth). Infant vaccination coverage with both the timely birth dose and the complete vaccine series was substantially higher among children born during 2003 than among those born during 1997; timely birth-dose coverage increased from 29.1% to 75.8%, and HepB series completion increased from 70.7% to 89.8%. Furthermore, in economically disadvantaged populations in western and middle provinces targeted by the China-Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (China-GAVI) project, reported coverage with timely HepB birth dose increased from 64% in 2004 to 81% in 2006, and coverage with the complete HepB series increased from 52% in 2001 to 92% in 2006. China has established a goal to reduce chronic HBV infection among children aged <5 years to <1% by 2010. Achieving this goal will require continued commitment to increasing vaccination coverage in impoverished regions and ensuring that infants born at home are vaccinated within 24 hours of birth.

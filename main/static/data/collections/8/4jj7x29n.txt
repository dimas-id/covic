PURPOSES Single-incision laparoscopic surgery improves the cosmetic outcome after surgery. We herein report six cases of successful single-incision laparoscopic (SILS) herniorrhaphy. METHODS Six patients, five with unilateral inguinal hernias and one with bilateral inguinal hernias, underwent SILS herniorrhaphy. A Covidien SILS port was inserted via an umbilical incision, through which three trocars of 5, 5 and 12 mm (or 5 mm) were inserted. The peritoneum was then opened with flexible scissors and electrocoagulation, after which, the preperitoneal space was dissected. A mesh was then fixed, and the peritoneum was finally closed using Covidien SILS Stitch or AbsorbaTack. RESULTS The mean length of the operation for the unilateral cases was 136 min. The increased time was due to difficulties unrelated to this methodology. However, the length of the operation in the bilateral case was 94 min. All patients were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS SILS herniorrhaphy requires experience and more time than conventional three-port herniorrhaphy. However, if the length of the operation can be shortened, then this novel surgical technique is considered to be feasible and it is expected to improve the cosmetic outcome without any additional risk.

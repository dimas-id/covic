The patient with “sinus” is common. However, an accurate diagnosis for a patient's sinus complaints may be elusive. The diagnostic uncertainty with these patients is a result of nonspecific symptoms, subtle or absent physical examination findings, and limited diagnostic testing options. Rhinitis should be distinguished from sinusitis. In acute illness, viral upper respiratory tract infection should be distinguished from acute bacterial sinusitis. For patients with chronic sinus symptoms, objective evidence of paranasal sinus inflammation should be confirmed before labeling the patient with chronic sinusitis.

Abstract International travel is associated with a risk of infections not typically seen in high-income settings. Malaria is the most important tropical infection in travelers, but epidemics of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika emphasize that clinicians need to be aware of the rapidly changing distribution of many arboviruses. A detailed travel history and a syndromic approach to the investigation and management of patients is key. Consultation with a specialist is often recommended to ensure that appropriate management and investigations are undertaken in febrile returned travelers.

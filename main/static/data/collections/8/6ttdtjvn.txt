This article considers the curious case of human behavior in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. We have observed that individuals, societies, and nations are exhibiting various irrationalities that are worth studying more closely. Applying the insights and research of reputed behavioral economists to these unprecedented circumstances, we explore possible explanations for individual and collective actions that appear, in many cases, to be highly counterintuitive. In the face of large-scale global issues, that Lazaric (2020) refers to as “grand challenges,” fraught with uncertainties and informational asymmetries, we delve deeper into the complexities of the factors that influence decision-making at various levels as we try to make sense of behavior. We wonder if reasons include the outright rejection of facts or perhaps the unwillingness to even receive information that has the potential adversely affect one’s welfare or self-interests—a tendency that Grossman and Van Der Weele (2017) term “willful ignorance.” We conclude with a few lessons and recommendations that can help understand and motivate behavior.

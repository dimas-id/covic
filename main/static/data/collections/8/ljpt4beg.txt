INTRODUCTION To report our initial experience and outcome of 7 cases of single port laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repair. METHODS Between May 2009 and June 2010, 7 patients underwent single port TAPP hernia repair for inguinal hernia. The device was placed through a single 2 cm infraumbilical incision. Patients' demographics, hernia characteristics, operative time, conversion rate, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and recurrence were measured. Five patients had unilateral and 2 had bilateral hernias. RESULTS The mean operative time was 67 minutes (range: 36 to 111 min). None of the patients required any conversion to conventional TAPP. No intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded and no recurrences have been recorded to the present with a median follow-up of 6 months (range: 2 to 8 mo). CONCLUSIONS Single port TAPP hernia repair is safe and feasible. Further study is needed to evaluate the benefits of this novel approach compared with the conventional laparoscopic approach.

Computed tomography has evolved to become the principal imaging modality in the evaluation of colorectal trauma. Direct signs of colorectal trauma are usually highly specific but relatively insensitive and, therefore, indirect signs are important in the diagnostic of colorectal injuries. In addition, prompt recognition of colorectal injury is crucial as even short delays in its diagnosis have been shown to significantly increase both morbidity and mortality. All these things make colorectal injury a challenge for radiologists. The purpose of this review is to describe and analyze the various computed tomography (CT) findings of colorectal injuries in both penetrating and blunt trauma using 64-multirow detector computed tomography technology, based on our experience in a level I trauma center. Additionally, the CT protocol methods specific to colorectal injuries are detailed.

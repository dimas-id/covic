Measles antibody titers were measured in 210 French women. Ninety-four percent had protective values (>120 mIU/mL). Geometric mean titers were significantly different (P < 0.001) between women born before and after 1983, when measles vaccination was recommended (731 and 1358 mIU/mL, respectively). geometric mean titers in 4 age cohorts decreased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing birth year. These data may help identify the appropriate age for infant vaccination.

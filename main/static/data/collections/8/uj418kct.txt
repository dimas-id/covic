OBJECTIVE To observe the method of fluorescent-polymerase chain reaction (F-PCR) and gene-hip technique in detecting coronavirus in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and its value for clinical application. METHODS Serum of 60 SARS patients, 20 samples of serum and 20 samples of gargling fluid of medical staff of the "Fever Clinic", and one cDNA specimen obtained from one SARS suspect patient were examined with F-PCR diagnosis kit and gene-chip technique for SARS coronavirus. RESULTS Three methods, including DR Chip and two F-PCR kit from Zhongshan College Da'an gene stock company and Shanghai Fortune industrial joint-stock Co, Ltd, were used, and the results were all negative for all specimens, except one cDNA specimen, which was obtained from one SARS suspect patient, virus could be amplified by F-PCR. CONCLUSION Special RNA fragment of SARS virus has not been detected in gargling fluid and serum of SARS convalescents and medical staff.

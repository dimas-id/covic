DPOP is a measure of the strength of respiratory modulations present in the pulse oximetry photoplethysmogram (pleth) waveform. It has been proposed as a non-invasive parameter for the prediction of the response to volume expansion in hypovolemic patients. The effect of resistive breathing on the DPOP parameter was studied to determine whether it may have an adjunct use as a measure of respiratory effort. Healthy volunteers were tasked to breathe at fixed respiratory rates over a range of airway resistances generated by a flow resistor inserted within a mouthpiece. Changes in respiratory efforts, effected by the subjects and measured as airway pressures at the mouth, were compared to DPOP values derived from a finger pulse oximeter probe. It was found that the increased effort to breathe manifests itself as an associated increase in DPOP. Further, a relationship between DPOP and percent modulation of the pleth waveform was observed. A version of the DPOP algorithm that corrects for low perfusion was implemented which resulted in an improved relationship between DPOP and PPV. Although a limited cohort of seven volunteers was used, the results suggest that DPOP may be useful as a respiratory effort parameter, given that the fluid level of the patient is maintained at a constant level over the period of analysis.

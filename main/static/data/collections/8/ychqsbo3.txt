We report a case of single-incision bilateral partial lung resection using the subxiphoid approach. This approach requires a 3-cm incision in the abdomen, making it aesthetically favorable. In addition, it does not cause postoperative intercostal neuropathy, and postoperative pain is minimal because the intercostal space is bypassed. Moreover, this technique enables exposure to both lungs through a single incision and has potential for widespread use if maneuverability can be increased by improving the instruments used.

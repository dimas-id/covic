Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes which can perform photosynthesis like higher plants. Their genomic organisation is very simple and thus is suitable for the study of detailed photosynthesis mechanism at a molecular level also for many other genomic manipulations relevant to benefit of living organisms. This unicellular alga, Spirulina has a thin thread like elongated structure and classified under Cyanobacteriaceae which is blue green in colour. Under microscope it looks like bunch of bright helical threads (Fig. 11.1).

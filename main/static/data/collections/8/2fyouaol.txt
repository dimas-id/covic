Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are usually accompanied by an exuberant immune response comparable to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with markedly elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines which are thought to be a major drivers of morbidity and mortality for these patients (Huang, et al 2020). Several drugs with anti-inflammatory properties (tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, anakinra, among others) have been suggested as adjuncts to supportive care in the management of COVID-19, and several clinical trials are underway (NCT04315298, NCT04317092, NCT04306705).

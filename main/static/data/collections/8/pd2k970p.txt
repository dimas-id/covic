Percutaneous transcatheter renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) is a promising treatment for refractory hypertension (HT). RDN was found in one series of clinical studies to reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) by as much as a mean of 30 mmHg with 85% of subjects experiencing sustained reductions of 10 mm or more out to two years after RDN. This degree of blood pressure reduction may reduce stroke and myocardial infarction rates and is anticipated to translate into improved life expectancy. The lowering of blood pressure by RDN has been shown to improve glycaemic control and reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Beneficial effects on renal function, sleep apnoea and heart failure are suggested as well. This report describes the first patient treated using the OneShotâ„¢ Renal Denervation System (formerly Maya Medical now Covidien, Campbell, CA, USA).

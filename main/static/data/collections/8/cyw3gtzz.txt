BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is becoming the most performed bariatric procedure; however, data available on long-term follow-up are scanty. OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 5-year efficacy of LSG on weight loss, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, and obesity-associated co-morbidities. SETTING Tertiary-care referral hospital. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed 105 obese patients undergoing LSG from January 2006 to December 2009. The preoperative evaluation included demographic characteristics, evaluation of co-morbidities, a double-contrast barium swallow, and an upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy. The following data were collected at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery: weight, improvement/remission of co-morbidities, complications, and revisional surgery. RESULTS According to preoperative body mass index (BMI), patients were divided into Group 1 (n = 61) with BMI≤50 kg/m(2) and Group 2 (n = 44) with BMI>50 kg/m(2). The follow-up rate was 94% after 5 years (n = 99). Delta BMI (BMI at follow-up-preoperative BMI) was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 at 1-3 years and 5 years (P<.001). Furthermore, at 5 years, Group 2 showed a significantly higher percentage total weight loss (%TWL) (26.6%±18.3% versus 33.5%±12.9%, P = .006) than Group 1, whereas percentage excess weight loss was similar (58.4%±21.8% versus 55.3%±19.5%, P = .5).Younger age at surgery and absence of postoperative GERD were associated with a better %TWL at 5 years (P<.001 and P = .03). CONCLUSION LSG is an effective procedure at long-term, with good weight loss outcomes and with a considerable improvement of obesity-associated co-morbidities. Younger age at surgery and absence of postoperative GERD were associated with a better %TWL at 5 years.

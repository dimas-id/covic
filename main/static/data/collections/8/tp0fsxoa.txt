Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) can have either an acute or chronic onset with an abrupt or insidious course. The diagnosis is typically achieved by physiological criteria with development of a sustained decline in expiratory flow rates for at least 3 weeks. We review the rapid development of acute BOS and bronchiectasis after respiratory syncytial virus infection in a lung transplant recipient, who had been doing well with normal pulmonary function for 3 years after lung transplantation.

Pancreatic injuries are often associated with trauma and occur most commonly in combination with other solid organ injuries. Management strategies for pancreatic injuries include conservative, endoscopic, percutaneous and surgical intervention. Literature on the laparoscopic approach to management of pancreatic trauma is rare and poorly reviewed. We describe a case report of successful and uncomplicated laparoscopic distal pancreatosplenectomy (LDP) for a patient suffering from isolated traumatic pancreatic tail transection. A literature review was performed with regards to the indications for intervention and different modalities of treatment for traumatic pancreatic lacerations. A review and comparison was also made between the scarce pre-existing reports of the laparoscopic approach to pancreatic resection in the setting of trauma. The laparoscopic approach to pancreatic resection, in the setting of trauma, can be considered as a viable alternative to open surgery. Moving forward, further studies with larger patient numbers will be needed to compare the outcomes between the open and laparoscopic approach.

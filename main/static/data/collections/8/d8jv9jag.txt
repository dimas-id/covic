BACKGROUND Dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) is a cause of infarction and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) that can lead to significant morbidity. Endovascular therapy has emerged as an adjunctive therapy in select cases but has been associated with increased hemorrhagic complications. We present our experience with a large single-center cohort of DVST cases treated with current-generation thrombectomy devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, a chart review was performed to compare presentations and outcomes of patients treated with anticoagulation alone with those treated with additional interventional therapy, using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge and at 90 days' follow-up. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were included; 37 were treated with anticoagulation alone, and 29 underwent additional interventional therapy. Patients presenting with ICH or infarction had a significantly greater likelihood of disability at the time of discharge (odds ratio [OR] of 64.5 and 45.8, respectively; P < .0001) and at 90 days (OR of 28.4 and 22.8, respectively; P < .0001). Patients presenting with ICH or infarction were more likely to be selected for endovascular therapy (P < .05). Endovascular therapy was typically performed within 24 hours of admission; 9 patients (31%) had post-treatment hemorrhage, with 2 being (6.9%) symptomatic. There were fewer patients with slight disability (mRS score â‰¤1) in the endovascular group compared with the anticoagulation group at discharge (P = .05), but outcomes were not significantly different at 90 days (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS Despite a higher rate of ICH or infarction at presentation in the endovascular group and an increased risk of postprocedural ICH, both treatment groups had similarly good functional outcomes at 90 days.

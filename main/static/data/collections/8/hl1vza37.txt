When we visited Damian Family Care Centers' Wards Island facility in New York City, collocating addiction treatment services run by Odyssey House and a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) run by Damian, all we could think was: “Why isn't this done everywhere?” Damian originated as a part of Samaritan Health Services but is now an independent not‐for‐profit corporation. It is run by people who are committed to addiction treatment and recovery. Peter Grisafi, CEO of Damian, and Henry Bartlett, vice president for government and community relations collectively have more than 75 years in the addiction treatment arena. Similarly, their colleagues at Odyssey House, Peter Provet, Ph.D., Odyssey House CEO, and John Tavolacci, Odyssey House COO, have long careers in the treatment field and embrace the Damian/Odyssey partnership as the right model for providing health care and substance use disorder treatment in an integrated setting. We visited on March 6.

Since late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, which is mainly characterized by pulmonary lesions, has spread quickly worldwide. With the spread of the novel coronavirus, the outpatient lines of hospitals have mostly shut down, which means that routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for autoimmune bullous diseases patients have been disturbed. Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention. In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern. Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.

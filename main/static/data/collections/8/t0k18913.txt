During the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in China (from January 24 to March 11, 2020), our center performed 16 organ transplants (10 kidney, 4 liver, and 2 lung transplants) harvested from deceased donors. Regarding the strategies to prevent infections of SARS-CoV-2, we implemented specific measures for the donor and recipient management, as well as prevention of hospital-acquired infections. All 16 organ recipients had a favorable outcome without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our approaches aiming to interrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the transplantation wards were successful, and allowed us to maintain the transplantation program for deceased liver, kidney, and lung organ recipients.

Transumbilical single-port laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (SPLDN) is a novel, rapidly evolving, minimally invasive treatment modality for kidney transplantation. This method causes minimal parietal injury, has cosmetic advantages, and allows rapid recovery because of low postoperative pain and short hospital stay. Like other abdominal surgeries, when conducted by experienced laparoscopic surgeons, it can meet the same graft requirements as conventional laparoscopic surgery. Here, we report the first two cases of transumbilical SPLDN at Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea. We used the umbilicus as a common path for laparoscopic procedures and as a route for specimen retrieval. The operating times were 230 and 265 minutes in cases 1 and 2, respectively. No intra- or postoperative complications were noted. In case 1, the wound length was 4 cm and duration of hospitalization was 2 days. In case 2, the wound length was only 2.5 cm, and the duration of hospitalization was only 1 day.

To determine the pathway adopted by peripherally inoculated Junin virus (JV) to reach the CNS, rat tissues were serially harvested to trace the sequence of viral progression from right hind footpad to brain. Immunoperoxidase (PAP) labeling of viral antigen, concomitantly with infectivity assays and histological examination of each selected sample, were carried out. As from the 2nd week post-infection (pi), neurological disease inducing 100% mortality at 1 month was evident. At day 5 pi, viral antigen was first detected at footpad level in epidermic and dermic cells, as well as in neighbouring myocytes; labeled macrophages infiltrating small nerve branches were also disclosed. As from 10â€“15 days pi, viral antigen became apparent along ipsilateral sciatic nerve structures and within lumbar spinal ganglion neurons, followed by a fast viral spread throughout CNS neurons that involved spinal cord and brain. Concurrent histopathology featured minimal inflammatory reaction together with generalized astrocytic activation. Hematogenous viral transport was negligible, since JV was isolated much earlier and in higher infectivity titers in neural tissues than in blood. It may be concluded that after viral replication in footpad, JV neural route was demonstrated by its PAP labeling from peripheral nerves to cerebral cortex.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the clinical effect of Arbidol (ARB) combined with adjuvant therapy on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). METHODS: The study included 62 patients with COVID‐19 admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing from January to March, 2020, and all patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they received ARB during hospitalization. Various indexes in the two groups before and after treatment were observed and recorded, including fever, cough, hypodynamia, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, diarrhea, C‐reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), blood routine indexes, blood biochemical indexes, time to achieve negative virus nucleic acid and so on. RESULTS: The fever and cough in the test group were relieved markedly faster than those in the control group (p<0.05); there was no obvious difference between the two groups concerning the percentage of patients with abnormal CRP, PCT, blood routine indexes, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (p>0.05); the time for two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests in the test group were shorter than that in the control group; the hospitalization period of the patients in the test group and control group were (16.5 ± 7.14) d and (18.55 ± 7.52) d, respectively. CONCLUSION: ARB combined with adjuvant therapy might be able to relieve the fever of COVID‐19 sufferers faster and accelerate the cure time to some degree, hence it's recommended for further research clinically.

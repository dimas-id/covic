The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 3C-like protease consists of two distinct folds, namely the N-terminal chymotrypsin fold containing the domains I and II hosting the complete catalytic machinery and the C-terminal extra helical domain III unique for the coronavirus 3CL proteases. Previously the functional role of this extra domain has been completely unknown, and it was believed that the coronavirus 3CL proteases share the same enzymatic mechanism with picornavirus 3C proteases, which contain the chymotrypsin fold but have no extra domain. To understand the functional role of the extra domain and to characterize the enzyme-substrate interactions by use of the dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy, we 1) dissected the full-length SARS 3CL protease into two distinct folds and subsequently investigated their structural and dimerization properties and 2) studied the structural and binding interactions of three substrate peptides with the entire enzyme and its two dissected folds. The results lead to several findings; 1) although two dissected parts folded into the native-like structures, the chymotrypsin fold only had weak activity as compared with the entire enzyme, and 2) although the chymotrypsin fold remained a monomer within a wide range of protein concentrations, the extra domain existed as a stable dimer even at a very low concentration. This observation strongly indicates that the extra domain contributes to the dimerization of the SARS 3CL protease, thus, switching the enzyme from the inactive form (monomer) to the active form (dimer). This discovery not only separates the coronavirus 3CL protease from the picornavirus 3C protease in terms of the enzymatic mechanism but also defines the dimerization interface on the extra helical domain as a new target for design of the specific protease inhibitors. Furthermore, the determination of the preferred solution conformation of the substrate peptide S1 together with the NMR differential line-broadening and transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement study allows us to pinpoint the bound structure of the S1 peptide.

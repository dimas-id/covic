A standard procedure for single-port laparoscopic adrenal surgery has not been established. We retrospectively investigated intraoperative and postoperative outcomes after laparoscopic adrenalectomy through mono port (LAMP) and conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy to assess the feasibility of LAMP. Between March 2008 and December 2009, 22 patients underwent adrenalectomy at the Department of Surgery, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital. Twelve patients underwent conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy and 10 patients underwent LAMP. The same surgeon performed all the surgeries. The 2 procedures were compared in terms of tumor size, operating time, time to resumption of a soft diet, length of hospital day, and postoperative complications. The 2 groups were similar in terms of tumor size (30.08 vs. 32.50 mm, P=0.796), mean operating time (112.9 vs. 127 min, P=0.316), time to resumption of a soft diet (1.25 vs. 1.30 d, P=0.805), and length of hospital day (4.08 vs. 4.50 d, P=0.447). Despite 1 patient in the LAMP group experiencing ipsilateral pleural effusion as a postoperative complication, this parameter was similar for the 2 groups (P=0.195). Perioperative mortality, blood transfusion, and conversion to open surgery did not occur. Perioperative outcomes for LAMP were similar to those for conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. LAMP appears to be a feasible option for adrenalectomy.

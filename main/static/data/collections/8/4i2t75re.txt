A caseâ€“control study was used to identify variables associated with the risk of mortality in cats housed at adoption centres. Multivariable logistic regression, based on retrospective data collected for 194 cases (cats that died or were euthanased) and 320 controls (cats that did not die) revealed an increased risk of mortality for cats admitted to adoption centres unneutered, in fair/poor health and cats born at adoption centres. Cats aged 7 weeks or less and cats aged over 7 years had an increased risk of mortality compared with cats of other ages. The risk of mortality decreased as the time in the adoption centre increased. Cats with disabilities (eg, blindness) had a higher mortality risk than cats without disabilities. Knowledge of these risk factors can inform intervention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of cat mortality at adoption centres.

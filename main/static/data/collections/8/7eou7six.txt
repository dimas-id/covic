As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a new, emerging infectious disease, guidance or consensus on liver injury are lacking(2). The definition of COVID‐19 associated liver injury in our manuscript was as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or bilirubin above the upper limit of normal (ULN), which were 50 U/L, 40 U/L, and 26 μmol/l respectively. The abnormal test results of ALT, AST and total bilirubin at baseline data were defined as liver injury in our manuscript.

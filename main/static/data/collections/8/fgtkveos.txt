Endovascular treatment is the first line treatment for intracranial aneurysms, but wide-neck aneurysms are often difficult to treat due to the difficulty in stabilizing the coils inside the aneurysm. It is singularly true for wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms (WNBA) as bifurcation branches often arise from the aneurysm neck. To overcome these difficulties, several approaches are available to treat both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms (balloon-assisted coiling and intra-aneurysmal flow disruption), while some techniques are essentially restricted to unruptured aneurysms due to the need of concomitant use of antiplatelet medications (stent-assisted coiling and flow diversion). Several ways of performing balloon-assisted coiling have been proposed for WNBA. Two stent-assisted techniques are available for WNBA (Y-stenting and the waffle-cone technique), but these techniques have yet to be evaluated in large, prospective series. Off-label use of flow diverters in WNBA has been proposed but efficacy has still to be established, and the technique presents unique potential safety issues (the potential modifications of bifurcation branches covered by the flow diverter) that has to be assessed. Intrasaccular flow disruption devices are promising tools for the endovascular treatment of WNBA. The WEB device has been extensively evaluated with prospective, multicenter studies showing high safety and good efficacy.

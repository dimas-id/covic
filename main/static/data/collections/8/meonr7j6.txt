A questionnaire survey was conducted during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic to assess the anxiety level and the perceived sources of stress among students from two universities where the outbreak occurred in the teaching hospital of one of the universities. The anxiety level caused by SARS in medical students at the teaching hospital was higher than in non‐medical students in the same university and lowest in students of the other university situated 20km away from the affected hospital.

BACKGROUND The choice of endoscopic expanded endonasal approach introduces the possibility of improved gross total resection of craniopharyngioma while minimizing surgical morbidity in a significant subset of patients. METHODS From our trans-sphenoidal surgical series of 331 cases, we retrospectively reviewed visual, endocrine and neuro-cognitive outcomes in the first consecutive eight patients (median age 63 years; range 47-73 years) with newly diagnosed supradiaphragmatic craniopharyngioma (median tumour height 23 mm; range 15-34 mm), removed by expanded endonasal approach (median follow-up 27 months; range 10-69 months). Gross total resection was attempted in all patients. RESULTS Gross total resection was achieved in 6 of 8 patients. Visual improvement was present in 6 of 8 patients of patients or in 14 of 16 eyes. New endocrinopathy, including diabetes insipidus, appeared in 5 of 8 patients. Stalk was preserved in 4 patients. Cognitive decline was present in 2 cases. Five of 8 patients retained previous quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Our early outcome results are comparable to the recent few expanded endonasal approach series, except for the incidence of new endocrinopathy and cerebrospinal fluid leak rate. This was influenced by higher number of transinfundibular tumours in our series, where stalk preservation is less likely, and not using nasoseptal flap or gasket closure in the first half of cases. Including data from the literature and ours, expanded endonasal approach shows a trend for improved gross total resection rate with less morbidity, more obviously for visual outcome and quality of life than for endocrine outcome. However, validity of expanded endonasal approach should be confirmed in a larger number of patients with a longer follow-up period.

We identified two RNA (paramyxovirus and coronavirus) and two DNA (adenovirus and herpesvirus) viruses in a common aquatic bird, the Neotropic Cormorant ( Phalacrocorax brasilianus), and determined their phylogenetic relationships to other global circulating variants. We analyzed 104 cloacal swabs from individuals collected at locations in Central Chile. Sequences were obtained from amplicons using consensus primers targeting conserved genes of the virus families Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae. A total of 20.2% of the samples was positive for coronavirus, 8.7% for adenovirus, and 3.8% for herpesvirus. No paramyxoviruses were detected. All coronaviruses were identified as viruses of the Gammacoronavirus genus, closely related to the infectious bronchitis virus clade (bootstrap clade support=75%). All adenovirus samples were identified as Aviadenovirus, related to a gull and falcon adenovirus (Bayesian posterior probability=0.86). The herpesviruses identified were related to the infectious laryngotracheitis virus ( Gallid herpesvirus 1) of the genus Iltovirus (bootstrap clade support=99%). We provide information about the diversity of viruses circulating among apparently healthy Neotropic Cormorants.

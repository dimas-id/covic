BACKGROUND Data suggest that pregnant women are not at elevated risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or developing severe disease compared with nonpregnant patients. However, management of pregnant patients who are critically ill with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is complicated by physiologic changes and other pregnancy considerations and requires balancing maternal and fetal well-being. CASE We report the case of a patient at 28 weeks of gestation with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 infection, whose deteriorating respiratory condition prompted delivery. Our patient's oxygenation and respiratory mechanics improved within hours of delivery, though she required prolonged mechanical ventilation until postpartum day 10. Neonatal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM were negative. CONCLUSION We describe our multidisciplinary management of a preterm pregnant patient with ARDS from COVID-19 infection and her neonate.

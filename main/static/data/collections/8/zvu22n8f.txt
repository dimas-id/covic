Publisher Summary Most of the inhibition bioassays or biosensors for organophosphate and carbamate pesticides are based on the amperometric detection of the enzymatic product of the reaction. Applications of amperometric biosensing strategies for pesticide detection in real or spiked food samples have been recently reported. Most of the applications have been developed for vegetable matrices. Different formats of biosensors have been used: disposable screenprinted choline oxidase biosensors using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in solution were utilized to detect pesticides. Screen-printed sensor developed using photolithographic conducting copper track, graphiteâ€“epoxy composite, and either AChE or butirrylcholinesterase was also used in the analysis of spiked (paraoxon and carbofuran) samples of tap water and fruit juices at sub-nanomolar concentration. Additionally, the developed device, which consists of the hand-held potentiostat, the multiplexer for eight-channel control and a dedicated software, can be used to detect organophosphates pesticides, such as dichlorvos and pirimiphos methyl at contamination level below the maximum residue limit settled by the European Union and also amplified DNA of F. culmorum.

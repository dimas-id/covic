The REVA-Flu-SRLF register allowed collection of data from 562 patients infected with H1N1 influenza virus 2009 and hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall mortality of these patients was 20%. The use of invasive ventilation, heart failure, and immunosuppression were associated with mortality. Three hundred forty-one (82%) among the 417 mechanically ventilated patients had an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). One hundred sixty-nine (30%) had a bacterial co-infection. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with an increased mortality in patients with ARDS. The occupancy rate associated with influenza patients crossed the threshold of 15% in many ICUs.

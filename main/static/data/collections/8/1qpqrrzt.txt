Motivation Drug immunomodulation modifies the response of the immune system and can be therapeutically exploited in pathologies such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Results DREIMT is a new hypothesis-generation web tool which performs drug prioritization analysis for immunomodulation. DREIMT provides significant immunomodulatory drugs targeting up to 70 immune cells subtypes through a curated database that integrates 4,960 drug profiles and ~2,6K immune gene expression signatures. The tool also suggests potential immunomodulatory drugs targeting user-supplied gene expression signatures. Final output includes drug-signature association scores, FDRs and downloadable plots and results tables. Availability http://www.dreimt.org Contact falshahrour@cnio.es; ggomez@cnio.es

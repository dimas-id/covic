There is a paucity of data regarding gastritis as a technical factor affecting the surgical technique. Antritis and gastritis usually cause stomach wall thickness which can interrupt stapler function or even can cause serosal tear during the dissection. We report a video presentation of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in a morbidly obese patient with antritis. Choosing black cartridge for patients with Helicobacter pylori gastritis might be the optimal technique for division of the antrum in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Further studies are required to clarify this parameter.

Human activated T lymphocytes expressing class II molecules are able to present only complex antigens that bind to their own surface receptors, and thus can be captured, internalized, and processed through the class II major histocompatibility complex processing pathway. We have used the antigen-presenting T cell system to identify the viral receptor used by hepatitis B virus (HBV) to enter cells, as well as the sequence of HB envelope antigen (HBenvAg) involved in this interaction. Results show that both CD4+ and CD8+ T clones can process and present HBenvAg to class II-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and that the CD71 transferrin receptor (TfR) is involved in efficient HBenvAg uptake by T cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the HBenvAg sequence interacting with the T cell surface is contained within the pre-S2 region. Since TfR is also expressed on hepatocytes, it might represent a portal of cellular entry for HBV infection. This system of antigen presentation by T cells may serve as a model to study both lymphocyte receptors used by lymphocytotropic viruses and viral proteins critical to bind them.

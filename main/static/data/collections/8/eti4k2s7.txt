This chapter provides a brief background of the empirical research in this volume by describing the position of companion animals in contemporary Japan and the context of the 3.11 earthquake and tsunami. Today, about 34.3% (Cabinet Office Government of Japan 2010) of Japanese households keep some kind of pet. It is evident from the multiple social surveys that a strong attachment to pets has emerged since the mid-1990s. On 11 March 2011, the Tohoku region in Japan was struck by a large earthquake and the tsunami that followed. This was the largest earthquake on record in Japan. The Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant was seriously damaged and released radiation which continues to be an ongoing issue for those living in that part of Japan. The serious damage to humans and other animals caused by the tsunami and the radioactive contamination is outlined. The author provides an overview of the study and shows research questions. Then, she reviews the relevant literature, noting that most of the studies are set in a Western context and pointing to the contributions that might be made by considering how one highly developed Asian society has responded to the plight of pet owners following a major disaster. The chapter ends by showing the structure of the book.

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) comprise six subtypes of coronavirus that are associated with a number of respiratory diseases such as common cold, pneumonia, and bronchitis. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of these six HCoV subtypes. HCoVs can result in life-threatening respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, and may cause enteric and neurologic diseases, especially in immunocompromised patients. This narrative review aimed to enrich the knowledge of health care professional regarding MERS-CoV infection epidemiology, control, and management. This review discusses MERS-CoV prevalence, clinical manifestation, modes of transmission, control measures, and management, which we identified in a search of various databases, related journals, and the published literature. It has been shown that MERS-CoV infection is likely to be transmitted among countries. Therefore, countries with a high rate of MERS-CoV infection are urged to develop and implement guidelines to minimize the spread of infection. Countries must give careful consideration to raising public awareness in regions that are affected by MERS-CoV infection and the importance of reporting any disease signs and symptoms, to receive proper care.

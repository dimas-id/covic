Abstract Epithelial cells are important target cells for coronavirus infection. Earlier we have shown that transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) are released from different sides of porcine and murine epithelial cells, respectively. To study the release of these viruses from the same cells, we constructed a porcine LLC-PK1 cell line stably expressing the recombinant MHV receptor cDNA (LMR cells). The MHV and TGEV receptor glycoproteins were shown by immunofluorescence to appear at the surface of the cells and to be functional so that the cells were susceptible to both MHV and TGEV infection. Both coronaviruses entered polarized LMR cells only through the apical surface. Remarkably, while the cells remained susceptible to TGEV for long periods, infectability by MHV decreased with time after plating of the cells onto filters. This was not due to a lack of expression of the MHV receptor, since this glycoprotein was still abundant on the apical surface of these cells. TGEV and MHV appeared to exit LMR cells from opposite sides. Whereas TGEV was released preferentially at the apical membrane, MHV was released preferentially at the basolateral surface. These results show that vesicles containing the two coronaviruses are targeted differently in LMR cells. We propose that the viruses are sorted at the Golgi complex into different transport vesicles that carry information directing them to one of the two surface domains. The apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV might be factors contributing to the difference in virus spread found between TGEV and MHV in their respective natural hosts, the former causing mainly a localized enteric infection, the latter spreading through the body to other organs.

Abstract Aims To analyze the potential mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunctions induced by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate more effective therapeutic pathways for patients with cardiovascular diseases. Data Synthesis COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage. Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia and stress response et al, all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Early identification, timely and effective treatments, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis. The pandemic of COVID-19 has been taking lives worldwide. It caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population. It targets humanâ€™s lung and causes serious damage of lungs. Based on early reports, for people with underlying heart issues, the concerns are serious. It appears people over 65 with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms. In addition, some of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cardiovascular diseases in China. As characteristic analysis of COVID-19 patients, hypertension and severe myocardial damage contribute to severity [1] and mortality of COVID-19 patients [2]. Therefore, to better understand the development of COVID-19 and the impacts of cardiovascular diseases will add valuable measures to the management of COVID-19 patients.

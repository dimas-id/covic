The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, was reported in December 2019. COVID-19 is highly contagious and has rapidly developed from a regional epidemic into a global pandemic. As yet, no effective drugs have been found to treat this virus. This study, an ongoing multicenter and blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), is being conducted at ten study sites in Heilongjiang Province, China, to investigate the efficacy and safety of Triazavirin (TZV) versus its placebo in COVID-19 patients. A total of 240 participants with COVID-19 are scheduled to be enrolled in this trial. Participants with positive tests of throat swab virus nucleic acid are randomized (1:1) into two groups: standard therapy plus TZV or standard therapy plus placebo for a 7-day treatment with a 21-day follow-up. The primary outcome is the time to clinical improvement of the subjects. Secondary outcomes include clinical improvement rate, time to alleviation of fever, mean time and proportion of obvious inflammatory absorption in the lung, conversion rate of repeated negative virus nucleic acid tests, mortality rate, and conversion rate to severe and critically severe patients. Adverse events, serious adverse events, liver function, kidney function and concurrent treatments will be monitored and recorded throughout the trial. The results of this trial should provide evidence-based recommendations to clinicians for the treatment of COVID-19.

Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials during early autumn of 1986 and 1987 evaluated the efficacy and tolerance of recombinant interferon-β(serine) (rIFN-β(ser)) nasal drops for prevention of natural rhinovirus colds. In 1986, 9 × 106 units of rIFN-β(ser) (139 subjects) or placebo (157) were adminstered once daily except Sundays for 4 w. Rhinovirus colds occurred in 2.8% of rIFN-β(ser) recipients and 6.0% of placebo recipients during the treatment period (52% reduction, P = .3). In 1987, 24 × 106 units of rIFN-β(ser) (186) or placebo (197) were given daily for 25 consecutive days. Rhinovirus colds developed in 6.3% of rIFN-β(ser) recipients and 5.3% of placebo recipients. In each study, illness frequency and number of days with subjective colds did not differ between the groups. Recipients of nasal drops of rIFN-β(ser) at either dosage did not differ in tolerance from placebo recipients. The lack of both prophylactic efficacy and nasal toxicity are in contrast to prior observations with nasal sprays of rIFN-α(2b).

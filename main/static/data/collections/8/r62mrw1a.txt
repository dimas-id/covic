Three ferroquine (FQ) derivatives, closely mimicking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been prepared. Whereas these organometallic compounds provide the expected reduced cytotoxic effects compared to FQ, they inhibit in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum far better than chloroquine (CQ). Moreover, this new class of bioorganometallic compounds exert antiviral effects with some selectivity toward SARS-CoV infection. These new drugs may offer an interesting alternative for Asia where SARS originated and malaria has remained endemic.

The US EPA and several states are considering regulatory limits for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) below 100 ng/L, increasing the importance of obtaining accurate and reliable data. This paper presents the results of two studies investigating the effectiveness of chemical preservation on ng/L concentrations of Cr(VI) in groundwater. Chemically preserved and unpreserved aliquots of a groundwater sample were spiked with a known amount of Cr(VI), then analyzed in tandem with sets of preserved and unpreserved performance test samples over 28 days. The studies showed that while Cr(VI) appears to be relatively stable over 28 days, it may be sensitive to minor matrix changes after collection. The studies also demonstrated significant challenges to measuring Cr(VI) below 100 ng/L, as the results can be subject to positive bias or contamination that may not be readily apparent. The authors concluded that Cr(VI) measurements using a US EPA published method below 100 ng/L may be categorized as semi-quantitative at best. This article is protected by copyright.

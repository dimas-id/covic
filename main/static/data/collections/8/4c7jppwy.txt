We report, to our knowledge, the first successful treatment of novel Influenza A (H1N1)/2009 chronic pericardial effusion in an adult. This patient presented on admission respiratory failure and cardiac tamponade which required non invasive ventilation and drainage. Pericardial fluid polymerase chain reaction sequences were positive for Influenza A (H1N1)/2009 virus. Any other etiologies were discarded. Recidivating pericardial effusion after medical treatment, firstly with Oseltamivir, and afterwards, with colchicine and corticosteroids during six months, was solved with pericardiectomy.

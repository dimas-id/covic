The nano silicate platelets (NSPs) of 100 × 100 × 1 nm(3) in dimension were previously derived from the exfoliation of naturally occurring sodium montmorillonite clay, and their affinity to the surface of bacteria was revealed. The unique characteristics of ionic charges (≡Si-O-Na(+)) and the presence of siloxanol functionalities (≡Si-OH) allowed the organic modification of NSP to form NSP-tethering poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) pendants through a sol-gel and living polymerization. By attaching nathphalimide-type fluorescence onto NSP-PHEMA, a new class of fluorescent organic-inorganic hybrid (NSP-PHEMA-HA), was prepared and its photoluminescence (PL) and bacterial trapping properties were characterized. The investigation of PL emission revealed that the fluorescent NSP hybrids could be used to detect bacteria and possess the potential for the biosensor applications.

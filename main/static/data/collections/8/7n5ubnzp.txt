BACKGROUND Because only a few studies have been performed to date on the invasiveness of laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) compared with open total gastrectomy (OTG), the minimal invasiveness of LATG has been unclear. METHODS The OTG cohort contained 35 cases, which were performed from April 2003 to October 2005. The LATG cohort contained 46 cases, which were performed from November 2005 to November 2008. Postoperative changes over time in various parameters relating to minimal invasiveness were evaluated. We used the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale to evaluate pain. Vital signs and a face scale were analyzed using daily maximum values on postoperative days (POD) 1-7. A hematological examination was performed on the preoperative day and POD 1, 4, 7, and 10. The number of days until oxygen saturation level (SaO2) was 95% or more in room air was used to evaluate respiratory function. RESULTS Significantly lower pain scores were obtained in the LATG group on POD 1, 4, 5, and 7. There was a significantly lower body temperature in the LATG group on POD 7. A significantly lower white blood cell count was revealed for LATG patients on POD 10, and for C-reactive protein on POD 1. Significantly higher serum total protein values were observed in the LATG group on POD 1, 4, and 7. Significantly lower blood sugar level was found in the LATG group on POD 4 and 7. The number of days until SaO2 was 95% or more in room air was significantly fewer in the LATG group. CONCLUSIONS LATG seems to be a less invasive procedure than OTG.

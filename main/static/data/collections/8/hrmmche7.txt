Recent groundbreaking progress in regenerative medicine has shown its potential to meet the two major needs of solid organ transplantation, namely the achievement of an immunosuppression-free state (IFS) and the identification of a new, potentially inexhaustible source of organs. This review illustrates how regenerative medicine technology may contribute to the achievement of IFS. There are three possible strategies: organ bioengineering, immuno-isolation and thymus bioengineering. The goal of organ bioengineering is to manufacture organs ex vivo from autologous cells. Immuno-isolation technology implements strategies aiming to prevent recognition of nonself antigens by the host immune system. Thymus organoids have been bioengineered with scaffold-seeding methods to allow deletion of T-cell clones responsible for allograft rejection. Despite the several hurdles that must be overcome, regenerative medicine technologies offer alternative strategies aimed at establishing immediate, stable and durable IFS in solid organ graft recipients.

INTRODUCTION To confirm the safety and feasibility of single-incision laparoscopically assisted appendectomy (SILA) performed by resident doctors. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 86 consecutive patients who underwent SILA between August 2010 and August 2016 at Kinki Central Hospital. During this period, 9 residents and 6 board-certified attending surgeons performed SILA. Data on the patients' characteristics and perioperative complications were collected from their medical records. RESULTS Resident doctors operated on 55% (47/86) of patients undergoing SILA. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to patient characteristics. Mean operative time in the resident and staff surgeon groups was 74 min and 71 min, respectively (p = 0.5). Median blood loss in both the resident and staff surgeon groups was 0 mL (p = 0.3). The rate of conversion to a different operative procedure was 4% (2/47) in the resident group and 3% (1/39) in the staff surgeon group (p = 1). All three above-mentioned procedures, two (4%, 2/47) in the resident group and one (3%, 1/39) in the staff surgeon group, were converted to multi-port laparoscopic appendectomy. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 5 days for both the resident and staff surgeon groups (p = 0.7). Perioperative complications developed in 9% (4/47) of the patients in the resident group and 21% (8/39) of the patients in the staff surgeon group (p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS SILA performed by residents under the guidance of a staff surgeon is safe and feasible.

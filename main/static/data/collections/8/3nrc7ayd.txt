BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a rarely described finding in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) with unclear impact on mortality. METHODS This study included patients with positive cultures of Aspergillus spp. from respiratory specimens, serological evidence of aspergillosis, or lung biopsy findings supporting aspergillosis treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1999 to June 2005. IPA was defined based on the consensus of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and the Mycosis Study Group of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors associated with mortality. RESULTS Proven or probable IPA was diagnosed in 26 patients. Hematological malignancy was found in 11 patients (42%) and immunosuppressive agents had been administered to 17 patients (65%). Among 20 culture-proven infections (77%), the most frequently encountered fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus (46%) and Aspergillus flavus (23%). The overall mortality rate was 62%. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that DIC was the only factor that was significantly associated with death attributable to IPA (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS IPA is associated with a high mortality rate, particularly for patients with DIC.

INTRODUCTION Dual coaxial lumen balloon microcatheters through which small stents can be delivered have recently been described. We report a series of a new type of dual lumen balloon catheter with a parallel lumen design enabling enhanced inflation and deflation properties through which larger stents may be deployed, including flow diverters (FD). METHODS All aneurysms that were treated with a Copernic 2L (COP2L) dual lumen balloon catheter at our institution between February 2014 and December 2016 were assessed. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, clinical and angiographic follow-up, as well as adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 18 aneurysms in 16 patients (14 women) were treated with the COP2L. Mean maximal aneurysm diameter was 6.4 mm, mean neck size was 3.3 mm (min 1; max 6.3), and mean aneurysm height/width was 1.1 (min 0.5; max 2.1). The COP2L was used for balloon-remodeled coiling exclusively in 2 aneurysms; coiling and FD stenting in 8; coiling and braided stent delivery in 3; coiling, braided and FD stenting in 1; and FD stenting without coiling in 4 (stenting alone). The rate of Roy-Raymond 1 (complete occlusion) changed from 22% in the immediate postoperative period to 100% at 3 months (mean imaging follow-up 8.2 months). There were three technical complications (3/16, 18.7%), including a perforation and two thromboembolic asymptomatic events that were rapidly controlled with the COP2L. There was no immediate or delayed morbidity or mortality (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1 in 100% of patients). CONCLUSION The COP2L is a new type of dual lumen balloon catheter that may be useful for balloon and/or stent-assisted coiling of cerebral aneurysms. The same device can be used to deliver stents up to 4.5 mm and to optimize stent/wall apposition or serve as a life-saving tool in case of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. Long-term efficacy and safety need to be further assessed with larger case-controlled cohorts.

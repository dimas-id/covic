PURPOSE: Since the state of alarm was decreed in Spain on 14 March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an extraordinary impact in paediatric hospitals. This study shows the effect of the pandemic on our practice in paediatric orthopaedics in a referral third level paediatric hospital. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective review of the official census from a third level paediatric hospital from 14 March to 14 April for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: The patients seen in our clinic during this period in 2020 decreased in by 82% (p < 0.001) compared with 2018 and 2019, however, the number of telemedicine consultations increased by 90.21% (p < 0.001). The total number of patients attending the clinic (including onsite and virtual) was reduced by 54.25% (p < 0.001). The total surgeries performed plummeted by 81% in this period in 2020 (p < 0.001) due to a reduction in elective cases of 94.6% (p < 0.001). No significant decrease was found in the number of urgent surgical cases per day in 2020 (p = 0.34). Finally, the number of orthopaedic patients admitted to our emergency department dropped by 78.6% during the state of alarm (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to our results, the pandemic has significantly affected our daily practice by decreasing elective surgeries and onsite clinics, but other activities have increased. As we have implemented telemedicine and new technologies to adapt to this setback, we should take advantage of the situation to change our practice in the future to better allocate our health resources and to anticipate outbreaks.

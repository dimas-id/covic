Based upon the scope of the original 5G ESSENCE research effort and by considering the related fundamental architecture, we develop a dedicated scenario for the implementation and demonstration of a setup for a 5G edge network acceleration in the context of a sport event, taking place in a stadium. Specifically, we demonstrate a combined 5G-based video production and video distribution scenario towards delivering benefits to both media producers/content providers and mobile operators, with those being able to offer enriched event experience to their subscribers. The production/distribution of locally generated content through the respective platform, coupled with value-added services and rich user context, enables secure, high-quality and resilient transmission in real-time, thus ensuring minimal latency. In the selected scenario, massive data traffic does not affect nor overload the backhaul connection as it is produced, processed and consumed just locally, aligned to the 5G 3GPP specifications. We also discuss details about the proposed services and functionalities of the use case, together with an approach for a potential projection to the market.

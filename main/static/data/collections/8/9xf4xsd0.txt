Whistle-blowers, who speak out in the public interest, are important players in challenging abuses of power. In science, where trust in processes and outcomes is vital, whistle-blowing is especially important. Case studies of US research whistle-blowers show the challenges they face, the reprisals they suffer, and the significant difference they make through their efforts. Legal protections for whistle-blowers are valuable but not enough on their own. Key potential allies for whistle-blowers are scientific peers, government agencies, legislators, media, and NGOs. These allies can provide corroboration, advocacy, and solidarity.

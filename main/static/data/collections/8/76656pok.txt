Smartphone magnetometer readings exhibit high linear correlation when two phones coexist within a short distance. Thus, the detected coexistence can serve as a proxy for close human contact events, and one can conceive using it as a possible automatic tool to modernize the contact tracing in infectious disease epidemics. This paper investigates how good a diagnostic test it would be, by evaluating the discriminative and predictive power of the smartphone magnetometer-based contact detection in multiple measures. Based on the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios, we find that the decision made by the smartphone magnetometer-based test can be accurate in telling contacts from no contacts. Furthermore, through the evaluation process, we determine the appropriate range of compared trace segment sizes and the correlation cutoff values that we should use in such diagnostic tests.

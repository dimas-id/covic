Content-based information retrieval is based on the information contained in documents rather than using metadata such as keywords. Most information retrieval methods are either based on text or image. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of multimodal features for cross-lingual news search in various domains: politics, health, environment, sport, and finance. To this end, we consider five feature types for image and text and compare the performance of the retrieval system using different combinations. Experimental results show that retrieval results can be improved when considering both visual and textual information. In addition, it is observed that among textual features entity overlap outperforms word embeddings, while geolocation embeddings achieve better performance among visual features in the retrieval task.

Prolonged treatment of immunocompromised influenza patients with viral neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors is required, because the immune system of such patients fails to eradicate the viruses. Here, we attempted to eradicate influenza virus from the respiratory organs of nude mice, which is a model of immunocompromised hosts, by using combination therapy of the viral polymerase inhibitor favipiravir and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor-binding site (RBS) and stem of viral hemagglutinin (HA). Although monotherapy or combination therapy of two antivirals (two mAbs or favipiravir plus a mAb) suppressed virus replication, they failed to eradicate viruses from nude mice. In contrast, the triple combination therapy of favipiravir plus anti-Stem and anti-RBS mAbs completely stopped virus replication in nude mice, resulting in virus clearance. Triple combination approaches should be considered for the treatment of human immunocompromised patients with severe influenza.

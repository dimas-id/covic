The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a huge threat to global public health because it develops rapidly. There is no specific treatment so far. Chest imaging examination is an important auxiliary examination method in diagnosis of COVID-19. To further standardize the imaging examination and diagnosis of COVID-19, Hunan Society of Radiology together with Imaging Technology Professional Committee of Hunan Medical Association reach an expert consensus document on imaging examination, diagnosis, and control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19. This document summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging examination procedure, imaging findings, CT staging, the value of imaging examination, and the methods for control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19 during imaging examination. Furthermore, it extends the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in children.

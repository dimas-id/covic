OBJECTIVE: It has recently been reported that some COVID-19 patients have long-term positive fecal nucleic acid after discharging from the hospital with negative nucleic acid in the respiratory tract, but it is unclear whether COVID-19 patients with positive long-term fecal nucleic acid tests have the risk of self-infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 25, 2020 to March 9, 2020, 5 COVID-19 patients with negative respiratory tract nucleic acid and positive fecal nucleic acid were observed and studied to explore whether these patients can re-infect themselves. Five patients with COVID-19 accompanied by diarrhea as the main gastrointestinal symptoms were carefully observed through clinical symptoms, imaging and other auxiliary examinations. The RT-PCR technology was used to continuously detect fecal and respiratory viral nucleic acids. The IgM antibody was detected on the 7th day of admission and IgM/IgG at the time of discharge. RESULTS: All 5 patients had symptoms of fever and diarrhea upon admission. The fecal nucleic acid was positive, as well as the throat swab was positive. All COVID-19 patients had positive IgM antibodies on the 7th day of admission and positive IgM and IgG at the time of discharge, and there were no abnormalities in the gastrointestinal examination on discharge. All 5 fecal nucleic acid tests were positive at the time of discharge. After continuous dynamic follow-up for 3-15 days, no clinical symptoms recurred, and the last nucleic acid test was negative. CONCLUSIONS: There is no risk of self-infection for COVID-19 patients with long-term 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive in feces.

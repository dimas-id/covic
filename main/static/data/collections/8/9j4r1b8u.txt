Tracheostomy, whether open or percutaneous, is a commonly performed procedure and is intended to provide long-term surgical airway for patients who are dependent on mechanical ventilatory support or require (for various reasons) an alternative airway conduit. Due to its invasive and physiologically critical nature, tracheostomy placement can be associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. This article provides a comprehensive overview of commonly encountered complications that may occur during and after the tracheal airway placement, including both short- and long-term postoperative morbidity.

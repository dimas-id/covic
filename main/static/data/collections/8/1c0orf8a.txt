Matrix-based yeast two-hybrid screens are an alternative to library-based screens. Recent improvements of matrix screens (also called array screens), use various pooling strategies as well as novel vectors that increase its efficiency while decreasing the false-negative rate, thus increasing reliability. In this chapter, we describe a screening strategy that systematically combines N- and C-terminal fusion proteins using a recently developed vector system.

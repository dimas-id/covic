Abstract With the advancement of intelligent manufacturing, different kinds of industrial robots have been applied in modern factories. The liquid crystal display transfer robot (LCDTR) has been widely used in LCD production lines to transport panels. Effective fault diagnosis and prognosis of the industrial robots are of great importance, since unplanned downtime caused by faulty robots significantly reduces the production capacity. Specifically, the ball screw is the critical component in the LCDTR. The failure of the ball screw can cause long downtime. Conventionally, the fault diagnosis of the ball screw is usually based on the vibration signals. However, it is extremely difficult to install the vibration sensors in the industrial robots. Therefore, in order to address this issue in condition monitoring, this paper proposes a data-driven fault diagnosis methodology using the motor current signals of the ball screw. Two time-frequency domain analysis methods are investigated, including short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The statistical features are extracted, and Fisher score is used to select features. Furthermore, the logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors are applied for the final fault diagnosis. Experiments on a real-world industrial robot dataset are carried out for validation. 100% diagnosis accuracy can be basically achieved by the proposed method, which indicates the non-stationary current signal can be effectively used to identify the health states of the ball screw in the LCDTR.

Transcaval extension of the thymoma to the right atrium has very rarely been reported, and cardiopulmonary bypass is recommended for successful resection. An invasive thymoma with intravascular invasion of the superior vena cava, and the left innominate vein extending into the right atrium was presented. Intra-atrial extension was resected through a transient external shunt from the inferior vena cava to the main pulmonary artery. We discussed the feasibility of this surgical technique and possible advantages of cardiopulmonary bypass avoidance.

BACKGROUND Leaks after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) may be due to a mismatch between staple height and tissue thickness. The aim of this study was to determine the range of gastric thicknesses in three areas of stapling. METHODS SG was performed using a 40-Fr suction calibration system 4 cm from the pylorus. Measurement of combined gastric walls was accomplished with an applied pressure of 8 g/mm(2) on the fundus, midbody, and antrum. RESULTS We enrolled 26 SG patients (15 women, 11 men; mean age 36.8 years). Body mass index (BMI) averaged 45.3 kg/m(2) overall, 44.7 kg/m(2) for males and 45.7 kg/m(2) for females. Although male patients had a thicker stomach antrum than female patients (3.12 vs. 3.09 mm), the midbody (2.57 vs. 3.09 mm) and proximal areas (1.67 vs. 1.72 mm) were thicker in female patients. However, some maximum fundus thicknesses were up to 2.83 mm in females and 2.28 mm in males. Some antra were as thick as 4.07 mm in females and 5.39 mm in males. Also, men had a longer average staple line (22.95 vs. 19.90 cm). CONCLUSION Because of the range of gastric thicknesses, a single staple height cannot be used to appose the full range of gastric wall thicknesses without potentially causing necrosis or poor apposition. To help avoid leaks, a thickness calibration device is needed to determine correct staple height.

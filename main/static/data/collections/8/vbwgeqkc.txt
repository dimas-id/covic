BACKGROUND Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling metastases measuring less than 3 cm in several adult malignancies but not yet in osteosarcoma. We report our experience of RFA in the treatment of metastases in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with osteosarcoma. PROCEDURE Sixteen patients treated for osteosarcoma in French Society of Childhood Cancer centers had undergone an RFA procedure between 2006 and 2012. RESULTS Thirteen sessions were performed in 10 patients to treat 22 lung metastases. Seven patients were in complete remission at last follow up (range 19-51 months; median, 24 months after RFA). None had a recurrence at RFA sites. We report three cases each of hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Eight sessions were performed in seven patients to treat bone lesions. PROCEDURE was intended as: curative for a small metastatic lesion (n = 3, all in remission more than 3 years after); local control of small bone lesions in multi-metastatic diseases (n = 3); analgesia (n = 1). Complications included one first-degree burn, one fracture, and one soft tissue infection. CONCLUSIONS RFA is feasible in AYA with osteosarcoma. It efficiently achieved local control of small peripheral lung metastases. Its role in the curative care of small secondary bone lesions remains to be confirmed.

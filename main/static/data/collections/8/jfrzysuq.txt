OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical use of a self-ligating loop (SLL) for partial or complete liver lobectomy in a variety of companion animal species. DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 22 dogs, 2 cats, 4 rabbits, and 1 ferret with partial or complete liver lobectomy performed with an SLL. PROCEDURES Medical records of companion animal patients that underwent partial or complete liver lobectomy with an SLL between 2009 and 2012 at the Angell Animal Medical Center were reviewed, and signalment, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histologic diagnosis, hospital discharge (yes or no), time to hospital discharge, and short-term survival rate were recorded. Follow-up information was obtained through evaluation of medical records. RESULTS 28 of 29 (97%) patients were discharged from the hospital and survived at least 5 days after discharge. Of the 29 patients, 3 underwent 2 liver lobectomies. During 4 of 32 (12.5%) lobectomies, mild intraoperative bleeding occurred on the cut surface of the liver after transection. No transection performed with â‰¥ 2 SLLs resulted in notable intraoperative bleeding. One of 29 (3.4%) patients had evidence of postoperative hemoabdomen, which was successfully treated with a single packed RBC transfusion. Expansion of the SLL diameter from 8 to 15 cm was accomplished to allow for resection of larger masses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of an SLL for partial or complete liver lobectomy in a variety of companion animal species was a safe technique and was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Expansion of the ligature loop diameter and use of multiple SLLs may be necessary for larger lobectomies.

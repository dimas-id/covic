Introduction Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are the preferred method of vascular access for chronic haemodialysis. However, excess shunting through the AVF can result in dialysis-access steal syndrome (DASS) or high-output cardiac failure. Percutaneous AVF banding is a minimally-invasive technique for treating DASS with good short-intermediate term results. Materials and methods We review a case series of percutaneous AVF banding procedures for DASS and high-output cardiac failure to illustrate the technique and limitations of this technique. Results Two representative cases from our local experience were selected to illustrate the technique in a stepwise manner. Both cases were performed for DASS, with good technical success. However, clinical success was limited in one case due to underlying arterial insufficiency. The technique, selection of appropriate banding diameter for flow reduction, limitations and complications of alternative surgical techniques are discussed. Conclusions Percutaneous AVF banding is a relatively straightforward and effective minimally-invasive technique for treatment of DASS supported by short-intermediate term data.

Introduction Symptomatic dissections (SD) of cervical arteries are still a therapeutic problem. Although endovascular management (EM) is currently a preferred method of treatment of SD, complications associated with this method of treatment in published reports are quite frequent (3-16%). Aim In this retrospective study we analyzed the results of EM with novel, double-mesh stent and protection systems (PS) for SD of the internal carotid (IC) or vertebral arteries (VA) that coexisted with hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmatic dilatation of the dissected artery. Material and methods We evaluated the results of EM in 19 patients (men 15, median age: 55, range: 25-83), presenting with SD of the IC or VA with coexisting stenosis and/or aneurysmatic dilatation of the artery in segments C1-C5 of IC or V0-V4 of VA. Twelve patients had a stroke, 6 TIA, and 3 patients a headache and/or a neck pain with Horner syndrome. Stents and PS were tailored according to the location, length of dissection and coexisting stenotic or aneurysmatic lesions. Results There were no new strokes, in-hospital deaths or other serious morbidities during the procedure and postprocedural hospital stay. There were no fatalities during 6-40 months of follow-up. In control angiographies performed after interventions all patients demonstrated a patent target artery, complete coverage of the dissection and aneurysm by stents and no new lesions in the area of the previous dissection. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that EM of SD of IC and VA with the new stents and PS is safe and effective with good early and midterm results.

The pathogenesis of encephalopathy-associated Covid-19 is still unclear. Multimodal brain MRI in 25 Covid-19 patients with neurological symptoms revealed angiographic and brain perfusion changes suggesting an under-recognized dysregulated brain perfusion not identified by morphological neuroimaging alone. Endothelial dysfunction, a key pathomechanism of dysregulated brain perfusion, may contribute to central-nervous-system disturbances in Covid-19.

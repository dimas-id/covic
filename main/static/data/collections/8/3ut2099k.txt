Fast-track surgery is claimed to reduce medical morbidity, eliminate the hospitalization needs, and shorten the convalescence period. Intraoperative bleeding as the main complication is also the primary cause of conversion from laparoscopic to open splenectomy. Intraoperative blood salvage can reduce transfusion requirements, decrease the conversion rate to open, and promote fast-tracking in laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). From November 2007 through December 2016 we collected medical data of 115 LS patients. There were three groups: 54 patients receiving routine care (we marks them as Group RT), 33 patients with fast-track care (Group FT), and 28 receiving fast-track care receiving intraoperative splenic blood salvage and autotransfusion (Group FT + ISBS). These medical data are comprised of included three phases (pre-, intra-, and postoperative). There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between RT, FT, and FT + ISBS groups. The hemoglobin level in Group FT + ISBS was significantly higher than in Group RT and Group FT. Comparing the duration of hospital stay of 3 groups, Group RT stayed for a significantly longer time than Group FT and Group FT + ISBS, Group FT + ISBSmuch shorter than Group FT. Comparing the hospitalization expense, GroupFT + ISBS significantly expended less than Group RT and Group FT. Our study shows that laparoscopic splenectomy with fast-track care is feasible, effective, and safe for patients who require splenectomy. Fast-tracking with intraoperative blood salvage improved the fast-track laparoscopic splenectomy procedure.

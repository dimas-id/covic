PURPOSE Rectal division and anastomosis are difficult steps in a laparoscopic low anterior resection. This difficulty is due to the limitations of laparoscopic instrumentation within the anatomical confines of the pelvis. Robotic technology overcomes most of these limitations to simplify the procedure. We describe our technique of controlled rectal transection and robotic purse-string placement by use of the da Vinci Robotic system. METHODS Three patients with rectal cancer who were scheduled to undergo a robot-assisted low anterior resection were selected to undergo this procedure. Safety, feasibility, and immediate postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed in all 3 patients with no intraoperative complications. One patient had a postoperative bilateral femoral neuropathy that resolved spontaneously. The mean operating time was 339.6 minutes, and all 3 patients were sent home by the fifth postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS The advanced surgical dexterity of the da Vinci Robot enables a controlled rectal transection and purse-string suture placement on the rectal stump. This achieves a right-angled rectal division and a secure, single-stapled anastomosis in a low anterior resection. The feasibility of this technique has been demonstrated in 3 patients, in whom this technique has been safely performed with acceptable results. A larger series of patients and a long-term follow-up is required to demonstrate an objective benefit.

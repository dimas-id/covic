Abstract: A 49-year-old male presented with worsening high-grade fevers, dry cough and shortness of breath, tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and was noted to have bradycardia with intermittent high-degree AV block. However, cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography were normal, making this an unusual and interesting manifestation showing myocardial involvement of this novel coronavirus.

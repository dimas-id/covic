Oxidative damages in hepatocytes may be caused by epilepsy and/or anticonvulsant drugs. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, characterized by recurrent seizures, which may increase the content of reactive oxygen species. Organic and conventional grape juices are rich in polyphenols, compounds with important antioxidant activity. It is hypothesized that organic and conventional purple grape juices may have protective effect against oxidative damage induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (a standard convulsant drug) in the liver and serum of Wistar rats. Animals (n = 16 in each group) received, by gavage, saline, organic grape juice or conventional grape juice (10 Î¼L/g of body weight) for 17 days. Subsequently, half of the rats in each group received PTZ (60 mg/kg). After 30 minutes, the animals were euthanized by decapitation. Liver and blood samples were isolated to evaluate oxidative parameters (lipid and protein oxidation, nitric oxide metabolite content, antioxidant defenses, and protein sulfhydryl content). The results of this study showed that although organic juice contains higher polyphenol content than conventional juice, both juices conferred protection against lipid and protein oxidative damage and limited the increase in PTZ-induced nitric oxide metabolite content in the liver and serum. In addition, both juices inhibited the PTZ-induced reduction in enzymatic antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) and sulfhydryl protein content in the liver and serum. In summary, both organic and conventional grape juices were able to reduce oxidative damage induced by PTZ in the liver and serum of Wistar rats.

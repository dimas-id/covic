AIM The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC), grown in serum-free conditions, to regenerate bone around titanium discs with different titanium surfaces. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ovine ADSC (oADSC) were isolated from seven sheep and cultured using serum-free and osteogenic conditions. Prior to in vivo testing, the growth and osteogenic behaviour of these cells were analysed in vitro using cell proliferation and extracellular matrix mineralisation assays. The bone regenerative capacity of autologous oADSC was evaluated in vivo on titanium discs in a sheep femur epicondyle model. Machined (MTi) and alumina-blasted (ABTi) titanium discs were used. Bone regeneration within the defects was evaluated after 1 month using histology and histomorphometry. PKH26 cell-tracking dye was used to verify the persistence of oADSC in the surgical wound. RESULTS oADSC sourced from five of seven sheep differentiated into osteoblast-like cells. Cellular proliferation was reduced only for osteogenically induced oADSC (oOS-ADSC) grown on ABTi, compared to non-induced oADSC grown on ABTi and tissue culture polystyrene (P = 0.03 and 0.02 respectively). There was no significant difference for in vitro mineralisation assays comparing oADSC with oOS-ADSC, regardless of implant surface type. oADSC labelled with PKH26 were detected 1 month after surgery within the defect. There was no difference in bone regeneration between the bone defects treated with oADSC vs. just blood clot. CONCLUSION After 1-month healing, the use of autologous oADSC did not improve bone regeneration in defects containing titanium devices with different surfaces.

Combining inhaled long‐acting β‐2 agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) seems to offer asthma control at a lower dose of ICS than achieved by ICS alone. Fine mapping of T‐cell surface markers by flow cytometry offers a detailed status of the individual's inflammatory response. The frequency of MT2 (CD4(+)CD45RA(–)CD62L(+)CD11adim) and MT1 (CD4(+)CD45RA(–)CD62L(–)CD11abright) cells in peripheral blood, and their ratio, has been shown to differ predictably in atopics and patients with leprosy, where MT2 correlates with a Th2 phenotype and MT1 with a Th1 phenotype. Stable asthmatics, requiring fluticasone propionate (FP) 750–1000 µg daily or equivalent, were randomized to receive, double‐blinded, either Seretide(®)[salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (SFC, n = 16)] 50 µg/500 µg bd or FP 500 µg bd (n = 17). If asthma was controlled based on lung function and symptoms at clinic visits every 6 weeks, ICS dose was tapered until asthma exacerbated or 0 µg was reached. The frequency and ratio of MT2 and MT1 T cells of the patients was monitored at 6 week intervals. As treatment tapered, the frequency of MT2 cells decreased (P = 0038 from first to final visit), whereas that of MT1 cells increased. The ratio of MT2/MT1 decreased (P = 0049 from first to final visit). In patients receiving LABA + ICS, the fall in MT2/MT1 ratio appeared to be more pronounced than in patients receiving ICS alone. Thus, the MT2 phenotype may be associated with stable asthma, whereas an imminent exacerbation may associate with an increase in the MT1 phenotype. LABA may allow for a greater effect of FP on the MT ratio.

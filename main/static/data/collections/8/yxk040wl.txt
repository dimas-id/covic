This chapter summarizes the results of a survey among 1,000 interviewed persons that was conducted in Germany. The aim was to obtain a current picture of the population’s expectations from self-driving (automated) vehicles. Twelve questions were asked to get an overview of the participants’ opinions on the potential of self-driving vehicles regarding climate impact, time and monetary savings, the willingness to use automated vehicles, as well as their safety and risks. The results are compared to the current state of expert knowledge. The main finding is that the German population is skeptical towards self-driving vehicles. In comparison to a scientific perspective, the population is underestimating the potential and possible benefits of automated vehicles, while the risks are assessed similarly. In the conclusions, the findings of the studyare assessed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses exploit host cell machinery by subverting host proteins and membranes and altering cellular pathways during infection. To achieve robust replication, some +RNA viruses, such as poliovirus (PV), build special intracellular compartments, called viral replication organelles. A recent work from the Altan-Bonnett laboratory [1] gave new insights into the formation of poliovirus replication organelles, which are unique subcellular structures containing many individual replication complexes as a result of dynamic cellular membrane remodeling.

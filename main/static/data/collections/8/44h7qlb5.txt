AIM Different mechanical devices for thromboprophylaxis have different flow characteristics. A new device (Vadoplex) has been developed to provide a short impulse around the calf, a concept derived from the efficacy of foot impulse technology. New devices should be compared with existing devices to establish whether it has a comparable ability to augment venous velocity. Objectives of the study were to compare the venous velocity induced by the Vadoplex with established intermittent pneumatic calf and leg compressors (Covidien and Huntleigh). METHODS The venous velocity was established in ten healthy volunteers with standardised Duplex ultraonography of the common femoral vein. Measurements were taken at rest and on standing, with each device inactive and active. RESULTS The Vadoplex induced an increased femoral venous velocity at least as enhanced as established calf and full leg sleeves. CONCLUSION Calf impulse technology is an alternative to other systems in enhancing femoral vein blood flow, itself a surrogate for assumed thromboprophylactic effect.

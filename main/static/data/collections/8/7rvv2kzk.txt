Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable infection and Pakistan due to its geographical location is vulnerable to a worst outbreak. Pakistan faces sudden hike in number of positive cases including number of healthcare professionals (HCPs) also acquired infection. Therefore, the aim of study is to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among HCPs in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. Methods An online survey-based study was conducted during the month of March among healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists and nurses. A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, Knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers) were used for data collection. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied by using SPSS version 21. Results Of 414 participants, 29.98% (n=120) physicians, 46.65% (n= 189) pharmacists and 25.36% (n= 105) nurses. Most commonly utilized information source was social media. Findings showed HCPs have good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude and good practice regarding COVID-19. HCPs perceived that limited infection control material and poor knowledge regarding transmission of COVID-19 are the major barriers in infection control practice. Factors such as age, experience and job were significantly associated with good knowledge and practice. Conclusion HCPs in Pakistan have good knowledge, reflected by positive attitude and good practice. Yet, there are areas where gaps in knowledge and practice was observed. To effectively control infection spread, well-structured training programs must be launched by government targeting all kinds of HCPs to raise their existed knowledge.

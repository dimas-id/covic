Glycyrrhizin (1), the main active principle of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) roots, is extensively used in herbal medicines, in pharmaceutical preparations and confectionery products. A feasible and reliable method which allows the simultaneous analysis of 1 and its aglycone, 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid (2), by means of an isocratic HPLC procedure is described. The system uses a C(8) column as the stationary phase, and a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, water and glacial acetic acid as the mobile phase. Good linearity was found in the concentration ranges 1–50 and 0.05–2.50 µg/mL for 1 and 2, respectively. A simple and rapid sample pre‐treatment, based on the extraction of the two analytes with a mixture of water and ethanol, was developed for the examination of liquorice confectionery products and root samples. The HPLC method was shown to be appropriate, in terms of precision and feasibility, for the quality control of the analytes in these matrices. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

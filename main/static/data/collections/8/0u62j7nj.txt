Abstract The genome of Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) consists of RNA1 and RNA2. RNA1 encodes N-terminally overlapping replication proteins, p27 and p88, which are translated in a cap-independent manner. The 3â€² untranslated region of RNA1 contains RNA elements essential for cap-independent translation and negative-strand RNA synthesis. In this study, we investigated how p27 and p88 were engaged in the replication of RCNMV genomic RNAs by using DNA vectors or in vitro transcribed RNAs in protoplasts and in a cell-free extract of evacuolated BY-2 protoplasts. Our results show a cis-preferential requirement of p88, but not of p27, for the replication of RNA1. This mechanism might help to facilitate a switch in the role of RNA1 from mRNA to a replication template.

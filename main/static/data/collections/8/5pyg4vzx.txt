Summary. We have analysed and identified different membrane‐active regions of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein by observing the effect of 18‐mer core‐derived peptide libraries from two HCV strains on the integrity of different membrane model systems. In addition, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane‐interacting peptides from the HCV core protein, both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems. Our results show that the HCV core protein region comprising the C‐terminus of domain 1 and the N‐terminus of domain 2 seems to be the most active in membrane interaction, although a role in protein–protein interaction cannot be excluded. Significantly, the secondary structure of nearly all the assayed peptides changes in the presence of model membranes. These sequences most probably play a relevant part in the biological action of HCV in lipid interaction. Furthermore, these membranotropic regions could be envisaged as new possible targets, as inhibition of its interaction with the membrane could potentially lead to new vaccine strategies.

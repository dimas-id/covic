The neutrophil provides a crucial defence against fungal infections. This numerous phagocyte is recruited rapidly to sites of infection, where it detects pathogens through a range of pathogen-recognition receptors. Phagocytosis and the generation of a range of microbicidal molecules neutralises the pathogen, following which neutrophil death by apoptosis triggers an injury-limiting resolution process facilitating the restoration of normal tissue architecture

Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are theoretically at greater risk for serious illness from COVID 19 due to the underlying pathophysiology of chronic inflammation with an increased risk of thrombosis, especially at the time of a vaso-occlusive event (1). Individuals living with SCD are also considered to be immunocompromised due to autoinfarction of their spleen or surgical splenectomy, often as a result of red cell splenic sequestration (2). In addition, patients with SCD often have comorbidities and secondary organ dysfunction that can put them at risk of significant morbidity and or mortality from the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its subsequent disease COVID-19.

AIM This study evaluated continence, constipation and quality of life (QOL) before and after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) METHOD: Between February 2012 and July 2014, patients who underwent LVR for external rectal prolapse (ERP) and/or rectoanal intussusception (RAI) were prospectively included. A standard questionnaire including the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI), the Constipation Scoring System (CSS) and QOL instruments (Short-Form 36 Health Survey, Fecal Incontinence QOL scale, Patient Assessment of Constipation-QOL) were administered before and after operation. Psychiatric patients and those with dementia were excluded from the study. Defaecography was performed 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS Fifty-nine patients were included in the study period and 44 (19 with ERP, 25 with RAI) completed the follow-up questionnaire and were reviewed after a median of 26 (range 12-42) months. There was no recurrent ERP. Postoperative defaecography showed new-onset RAI in 6 and persistent RAI in 1. One year after surgery, incontinence was improved in 30/39 patients (77%) and constipation in 19/32 (59%). The FISI scores reduced between preoperative status and 1 year after surgery [32 (13-61) vs 11 (0-33), P < 0.0001]. The CSS scores also reduced [preoperative 12 (5-18) vs 1 year 5 (1-12), P < 0.0001]. Compared with the preoperative scores, almost all of the scale scores on the three kinds of QOL instruments significantly improved over time. The presence of new-onset or persistent RAI did not have an adverse effect on the improvement of QOL. CONCLUSION LVR improves both generic and symptom-specific QOL with good functional results.

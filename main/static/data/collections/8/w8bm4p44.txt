Chickens, turkeys, ducks, quail and geese were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. No disease was observed, no virus replication was detected, and antibodies were not detected in serum. Neither virus replicated in embryonating chickenâ€™s eggs. Poultry are unlikely to serve a role in the maintenance of either virus.

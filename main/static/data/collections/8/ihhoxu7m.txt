Conidiobolomycosis is a rare fungal disease of both humans and animals, occurring mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. We describe a disseminated fungal infection in a young, apparently immunocompetent dog who initially presented for antibiotic resistant pneumonia. Histopathology and mycology identified a Conidiobolus sp., further confirmed as Conidiobolus incongruus through DNA sequencing of D1/D2 regions. This is the first report of this species causing disease in dogs and the fifth reported infection in animals.

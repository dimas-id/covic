A global pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing spread. It remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of reinfection. Rhesus macaques were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 during an early recovery phase from initial infection characterized by weight loss, interstitial pneumonia and systemic viral dissemination mainly in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The monkeys rechallenged with the identical SARS-CoV-2 strain have failed to produce detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations and histopathological changes. A notably enhanced neutralizing antibody response might contribute the protection of rhesus macaques from the reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that primary SARS-CoV-2 infection protects from subsequent reinfection. One Sentence Summary Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 might protect rhesus macaques which have undergone an initial infection from reinfection during early recovery days.

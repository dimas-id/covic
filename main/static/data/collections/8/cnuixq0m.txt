The use of postprandial triglyceride (ppTG) as a cardiovascular disease risk indicator has gained recent popularity. However, the influence of different foods or food ingredients on the ppTG response has not been comprehensively characterized. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of foods or food ingredients on the ppTG response. PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant acute (<24-h) randomized controlled trials published up to September 2018. Based on our selection criteria, 179 relevant trials (366 comparisons) were identified and systematically compiled into distinct food or food ingredient categories. A ppTG-lowering effect was noted for soluble fiber (Hedges' giAUC = -0.72; 95% CI: -1.33, -0.11), sodium bicarbonate mineral water (Hedges' gAUC = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.04), diacylglycerol oil (Hedges' giAUC = -0.38; 95% CI: -0.75, -0.00), and whey protein when it was contrasted with other proteins. The fats group showed significant but opposite effects depending on the outcome measure used (Hedges' giAUC = -0.32; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.03; and Hedges' gAUC = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.26). Data for other important food groups (nuts, vegetables, and polyphenols) were also assessed but of limited availability. Assessing for oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) recommendation compliance, most trials were â‰¥4 h long but lacked a sufficiently high fat challenge. iAUC and AUC were more common measures of ppTG. Overall, our analyses indicate that the effects on ppTG by different food groups are diverse, largely influenced by the type of food or food ingredient within the same group. The type of ppTG measurement can also influence the response.

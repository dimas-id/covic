Two sponges from the Philippines, one a Xestospongia sp. (Haplosclerida, Petrosiidae) and the other an unidentified haplosclerid sponge, both contained the unusual steroidal sulfamate esters, haplosamates A (1) and B (2), the structures of which were determined by interpretation of spectral data. Haplosamates A (1) and B (2) inhibit HIV-1 integrase with IC(50)'s of 50μg/mL and 15μg/mL, respectively.

Lymph node cells from calves immunized with purified pilus antigen of K99(+) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were fused with mouse myeloma (NSO) cells, and with non-Ig producing mouse/calf hybridomas or with a bovine Ig-producing mouse/calf/calf secondary hybridoma. Lines secreting bovine monoclonal IgG(1) specific for K99 pilus antigen in an ELISA were obtained in each case. The two lines derived from xenohybridoma fusion partners have been secreting anti-K99 bovine monoclonal antibody for over one year in continual passage. None of the antibodies cross-reacted with other pilus types including K88, CFAI, CFAII, 987P or CP; they all inhibited agglutination of horse RBC (which have a K99 receptor) in the presence of K99 antigen; they showed positive fluorescence in an indirect binding assay on K99(+) ETEC and inhibited K99(+) ETEC adhesion to piglet enterocytes. These antibodies have potential prophylactic and therapeutic use in control and treatment of diarrhoea.

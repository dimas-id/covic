PURPOSE We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare postoperative urinary catheter removal 2 versus 12 h after elective cesarean section in terms of irritative symptoms, first void time, incidence of urinary tract infection, postoperative mobilization time, and hospitalization time. METHODS A total of 134 women admitted to Duzce University Hospital for primary or recurrent elective cesarean section were randomized into two groups. A total of 62 women were enrolled in the early group, with indwelling catheter removal 2 h after cesarean section; 74 women were enrolled in the delayed group, with catheter removal 12 h after the cesarean section. The groups were prospectively compared in terms of irritative urinary symptoms, bacteriuria, hematuria, length of hospital stay, and mobilization time. RESULTS Urinary frequency (p = .04), microscopic hematuria incidence (p = .04), postoperative mobilization time (p = .01), and length of hospital stay (p = .009) were significantly lower in the early group than in the delayed group. There were no significant differences in terms of bacteruria, urinary retention, dysuria, and first postoperative voiding time. CONCLUSIONS Early removal of urinary catheters after elective cesarean section is associated with reduced mobilization time and hospital stay.

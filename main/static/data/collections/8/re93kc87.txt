During the COVID-19, psychotherapists are often exposed to traumatic material in their sessions, potentially leading to vicarious traumatization. We surveyed 339 therapists about their professional practices and experiences during the pandemic. Results showed that on average therapists experienced moderate levels of vicarious trauma, whereas about 15% experienced high levels of vicarious trauma. A higher level of vicarious trauma was associated with younger age, less clinical experience, and negative online treatment experiences. The results imply a need for personal and professional support for therapists working remotely amid a global health crisis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to investigate the added value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) evaluation and to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to Ga-DOTANOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) results. METHODS Morphological MRI (T2-weighted [T2-w] + contrast-enhanced [CE] T1-w) and DWI (T2-w + DWI) and Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT in 25 patients/30 pNETs were retrospectively evaluated. Per-patient and per-lesion detection rates (pDR and lDR, respectively) were calculated. Apparent diffusion coefficient values were compared among pNET and surrounding and normal pancreas (control group, 18 patients). Apparent diffusion coefficient and standardized uptake value (SUV) values were compared among different grading and staging groups. RESULTS No statistically significant differences in PET/CT and MRI session detection rates were found (morphological MRI and DW-MRI, 88% pDR and 87% lDR; combined evaluation, 92% pDR and 90% lDR; Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT, 88% pDR and 80% lDR). Consensus reading (morphological/DW-MRI + PET/CT) improved pDR and lDR (100%). Apparent diffusion coefficient mean value was significantly lower compared with surrounding and normal parenchyma (P < 0.01). The apparent diffusion coefficient and SUV values of pNETs among different grading and staging groups were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS Conventional MRI, DW-MRI + T2-w sequences, and Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT can be alternative tools in pNET detection. Diffusion-weighted MRI could be valuable in patients with clinical suspicion but negative conventional imaging findings. However, the consensus reading of the 3 techniques seems the best approach.

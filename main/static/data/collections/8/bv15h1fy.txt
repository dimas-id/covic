INTRODUCTION The choice of the mesh and fixation methods in laparoscopic incisional hernia repair is a crucial issue in preventing complications and recurrence. The authors report a series of 40 consecutive laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs, focusing on the use of lightweight polypropylene mesh and on the way of mesh fixation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs performed consecutively in 38 patients (16 males, 22 females) were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups depending on tacks used: Titanium tacks vs absorbable tacks. RESULTS All patients received totally laparoscopic incisional hernia repair by the use of lightweight polypropylene mesh. No major post-operative complications were reported. Post-operative pain (evaluated by VNS) was higher in Group A (titanium tacks, p < 0.05). No differences in follow-up as well as in recurrence incidence (one case in both groups, <6 months time interval) were reported. CONCLUSIONS Securestrap™ absorbable tacks are safe and effective and easy to use and did not increase the risk of mesh dislocation compared with non-absorbable tacks. The specific design well fits the lightweight polypropylene mesh Physiomesh™. Further evaluations in larger randomized studies are needed to confirm these preliminary data.

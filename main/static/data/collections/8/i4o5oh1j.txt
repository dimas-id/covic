INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Stabilization of the vaginal apex (level 1) is an important component of operations to correct pelvic organ prolapse (POP). We report functional and anatomical results and patient-reported outcomes of our technique of vaginal vault fixation at the time of vaginal hysterectomy. METHODS One hundred and nine patients-mean 69 years, range 50.4-83.8; body mass index (BMI) 26.3, range 17.7-39.5-with symptomatic stage 2-3 uterine prolapse combined with stage 3-4 cystocele underwent vaginal hysterectomy with anterior vaginal wall repair; the apex was formed with high closure of the peritoneum and incorporation of the uterosacral and round ligaments. Only absorbable sutures were used. Follow-up included clinical examination with Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system (POP-Q) scoring, introital ultrasonography, quality of life (QoL) Likert scale, and the German Pelvic Floor Questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy patients (64%) were available for a follow-up after a mean of 2.8 years (range, 1.6-4.2). At follow-up, point C was stage 0 in 55 (78.6%) women and stage 1 in 15 (21.4%). The anterior vaginal wall was stage 0 or 1 in 35 (50%), stage 2 (no cystocele beyond the hymen) in 34 (49%), and stage 3 in 1 (1.4%). Vaginal length (VL) was 9 cm. Four women (4%) were reoperated for prolapse: two for recurrent anterior compartment prolapse and two for de novo rectocele. Postvoid residuals >150 ml were seen in 21(30%) patients preoperatively and resolved postoperatively in 20. Urgency occurred in nine (13%), stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in ten (14%), and nocturia in 19 (27%). No patient had discomfort at the vaginal vault and 62 patients (87%) reported improved QoL, which did not correlate with anatomical results. Cystocele ≥ 2° at follow-up was associated with BMI >25 (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Our surgical technique without permanent material offers good apical support and functional and subjective results. Anatomical improvement was achieved in all cases of cystocele repair. Recurrent cystoceles are often asymptomatic.

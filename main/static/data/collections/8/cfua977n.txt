Treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) has evolved substantially, from open surgical 'cut-and-sew' procedures to catheter ablations to minimally invasive ablation with novel energy sources. Recurrences present a significant challenge, both to clinicians and to patients who seek a durable result and freedom from antiarrhythmic medications. Our centre performs a minimally invasive bilateral thoracoscopic epicardial ablation and atrial appendage exclusion, followed by a catheter-based endocardial electrophysiology study and ablation. Results demonstrate favourable outcomes with improvement over catheter-based ablation alone or thoracoscopic ablation alone. We will describe our surgical approach, mid-term results and a brief review of the literature surrounding this dual-modality approach to AF ablation.

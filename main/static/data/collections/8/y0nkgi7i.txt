Lung transplantation is an accepted therapeutic option for end-stage lung diseases. Its history starts in the 1940s, initially hampered by early deaths due to perioperative problems and acute rejection. Improvement of surgical techniques and the introduction of immunosuppressive drugs resulted in longer survival. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), a new complication appeared and remains the most serious complication today. CLAD, the main reason why survival after lung transplantation is impaired compared to other solid-organ transplantations is characterized by a gradually increasing shortness of breath, reflected in a deterioration of pulmonary function status, respiratory insufficiency and possibly death.

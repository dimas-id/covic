Abstract Viruses are major pathogenic agents that can cause a variety of diseases, such as AIDS, hepatitis, respiratory diseases, and many more, in humans, plants, and animals. The most prominent of them have been adenoviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, hepatitis C virus, herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency virus of type 1, and picornaviruses. This chapter presents an introductory remark on such viruses, mechanisms of their invasion, and diseases related to them. The inhibition of these viruses is of great concern to human beings. Each of these viruses encodes one or more proteases that play crucial roles in their replication, and thus they are important targets for the design and development of potent antiviral agents. The chapter, therefore, also introduces the readers to such proteases and their structures and functions. This chapter is thus a prelude to the remaining chapters in the book, which present in detail about the different viruses and their proteases.

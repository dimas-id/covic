BACKGROUND Successful cardiac surgery is highly dependent upon effective and efficient teamwork. Practical training and development will further enhance the team ability to react to a series of low-frequency occurring adverse events during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). One of our specialized educational programs focuses on training the whole team. This training is based on an original animal simulation model. The objective of this pilot study was to assess our method of training and learning in an attempt to optimize and improve team management and functioning. METHODS Four members of the same cardiac surgery team joined our program. They performed a common procedure, with a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit set up to produce several adverse incidents. Events management was analyzed and debriefed in technical and non-technical perspectives. RESULTS Management of the adverse events was significantly improved. Discussion and debriefing time was fundamental in identifying the most appropriate management for each event. Rescue procedures were assimilated and team training was found to be effective, with the time reduced by up to 50% for 3 events and by up to 70% for air embolism. CONCLUSION Our pilot program is an innovative, low-cost tool for the improvement of the management of adverse events occurring during CPB. It includes the different components of surgical education and training. Such an educational tool might be relevant for training. To confirm those encouraging results, it should be assessed in a larger surgical team panel. Further investigations are required for assessing efficiency in real conditions.

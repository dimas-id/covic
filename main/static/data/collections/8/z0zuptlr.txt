Kawasaki disease (KD) is a common vasculitic disorder usually seen in children below 5 years of age. The disease can present with protean clinical manifestations which include high grade fever (for at least 5 days), rash, redness of the lips and a typical strawberry tongue, cervical lymph node enlargement (often unilateral), swelling over the hands/feet and, later a characteristic peripheral desquamation over the fingers and toes. These clinical features appear sequentially and the findings may change from day-to-day. Thus, all these features may not be seen together at any one point of time. The diagnosis rests on the recognition of this characteristic temporal sequence of clinical events, none of which are, by themselves, pathognomonic. Establishing a diagnosis of KD may be further complicated by the occurrence of several other, seemingly unrelated, clinical features. These include irritability, neck stiffness, sterile pyuria, pneumonitis, hydrops of the gallbladder and hepatitis among many others. There is no laboratory test that can help in confirming a diagnosis of KD. Left untreated, up to 20% of children with KD can develop coronary aneurysms with catastrophic long term sequelae. It is important to diagnose KD in the first 10 days of the illness so that appropriate therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin can be Initiated. All paediatricians, and physicians looking after children, need to be aware of this condition which is now being increasingly recognized in India.

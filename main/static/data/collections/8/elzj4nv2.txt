The 2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has led to an increasing number of telemedicine clinician-patient encounters through telephone or videoconference. This provides a particular challenge in cancer care, where discussions frequently pertain to serious topics and are preferably performed in person. In this review, we use the SPIKES (Setting, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Empathy/Emotion, and Strategy/Summarize) protocol as a framework for how to approach the discussion of serious news through telemedicine. We discuss the practical and technical aspects of preparation for a remote conversation and review some differences, limitations, and advantages of these discussions. The greatest challenge with the medium is the loss of the ability to read and display nonverbal cues. Vigilant attention to proven communication strategies and solicitation of patient involvement with the discussion can allow the care provider to display empathy at a distance. Having serious discussions through telemedicine is likely unavoidable for many providers in this unprecedented time. This summary provides some strategies to help to maintain the high standard of care that we all seek for our patients who are receiving serious news.

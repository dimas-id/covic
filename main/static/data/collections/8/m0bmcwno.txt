Studies have shown a correlation between a cleaner patient environment and lower infection rates and reduced risk of transmission. Privacy curtains are potentially important sites of bacterial contamination in hospitals. Privacy curtains integrated with antimicrobial properties have been shown to increase the time to first contamination compared with standard privacy curtains. In this study, we examined the difference in bacterial colonization of different curtains. We experimentally contaminated antibacterial Fantex protective curtains and compared the bacterial counts to natural contamination of privacy curtains. There was a significant reduction in the CFU/cm2 on antibacterial Fantex protective privacy curtains after 24 hours of experimental contamination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or extended-spectrum-producing organisms (Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae), compared to standard privacy curtains. Levels of environmental contamination with S. epidermis, Streptococcus viridians, E. coli, S. haemolyticus, S. aureus, S. capitis, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, and Bacillus species were also significantly less on the Fantex curtains after two months hanging in the emergency department. Healthcare facilities may find that addressing surfaces, including use of antibacterial privacy curtains, is an effective horizontal strategy for addressing healthcare-associated infections across the board.

Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography may be required in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID足19), resulting in direct contact with the patient and risk of transmitting the infection from patients to medical personnel. Therefore, we recommend to perform problem足oriented time足limited transthoracic examinations. Whenever possible, examinations should be analyzed offline, outside the isolation zones. Transesophageal echocardiography is considered an aerosol足generating procedure and should be performed only as a lifesaving procedure. Personnel should use appropriate personal protection equipment in the immediate vicinity of the patients in accordance with the relevant guidelines.

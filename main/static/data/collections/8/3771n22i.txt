We lightly modify Eriksson's (1996) model to accommodate the home office in a simple model of endogenous growth. By home office we mean any working activity carried out away from the workplace which is assumed to be fixed. Due to the strong mobility restrictions imposed on citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, we allow the home office to be located at home. At the home office, however, in consequence of the fear and anxiety workers feel because of COVID-19, they become distracted and spend less time working. We show that in the long run, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of the home-office labor is sufficiently small only if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of the time spent on distracting activities is small enough also.

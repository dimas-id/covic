Effective antiviral immunity depends on accurate recognition of viral RNAs by the innate immune system. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) often accumulates in virally infected cells and was initially considered a unique viral signature that was sufficient to initiate antiviral response through dsRNA receptors and dsRNA-dependent effectors such as Toll-like receptor 3, retinoic acid inducible gene-1, protein kinase RNA-activated and oligoadenylate synthetase. However, dsRNA is also present in many cellular RNAs, raising a question of how these receptors and effectors discriminate between viral and cellular dsRNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that innate immune sensors detect not only dsRNA structure but also other and often multiple features of RNA such as length, sequence, cellular location, post-transcriptional processing and modification, which are divergent between viral and cellular RNAs. This review summarizes recent findings on the substrate specificities of a few selected dsRNA-dependent effectors and receptors, which have revealed more complex mechanisms involved in cellular discrimination between self and non-self RNA.

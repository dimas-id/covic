Despite their frequency, upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) constitute an area with few, if any, effective treatment remedies. Asthma and airway allergies share similar pathogenetic mechanisms to URTIs and it is not surprising, therefore, that agents used to treat allergic disorders have also been studied in URTIs. Their possible effects, limitations and hypothetical modes of action in URTIs are reviewed. In controlled clinical trials of satisfactory scientific standard, symptom reductions in both experimental rhinovirus infections and natural colds have occurred with topical anticholinergics, oral antihistamines and topical chromones. Future treatment alternatives for URTIs may include the intranasal anticholinergic ipratropium bromide, new nonsedating antihistamines and sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium). The latter has a record of safety and an absence of adverse effects that would make it an attractive alternative for this common but not particularly serious condition in otherwise healthy individuals.

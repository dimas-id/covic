In early 2012, a widespread porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) occurred in eastern China. A cell-adapted isolate, SD-M, was at the four-passage level of virulent field strain SD, which was isolated from a 2-day-old dead suckling piglet that had suffered from severe diarrhea in Shandong Province, China. We report here the complete genome sequence of SD-M. This sequence will promote a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of PEDV.

BACKGROUND Endovascular coil embolization for ophthalmic artery (OphA) aneurysms has the latent risk of occlusion of the OphA during the procedure, which can lead to loss of vision. We report clinical and angiographic results of endovascular treatment of OphA aneurysms together with the efficacy of the balloon occlusion test (BOT). METHODS From August 2005 to December 2013, 31 consecutive patients with 33 OphA aneurysms were treated in our institution. The patients were classified into two groups according to the location of the OphA within the aneurysmal sac. The BOT was performed in 28 patients using a hypercompliant balloon before endovascular coiling. Collateral circulation between the external carotid artery and the OphA was examined and visual function tests were performed before and after treatment. Patient demographics, angiographic and clinical outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Among the 28 patients who underwent the BOT, intact collateral circulation was demonstrated in 26 (92.9%) patients and complete occlusion of the OphA was obtained in three patients after coiling. Retrograde filling of the OphA with choroidoretinal blush was observed on post-procedural angiography and no specific visual symptoms were reported during the follow-up period. Complete embolization was achieved in 30 lesions (96.8%) and only five patients (16.1%) had minor recanalization. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of OphA aneurysms can be performed safely and effectively in conjunction with BOT. The BOT may give useful information to predict visual outcome in patients whose OphA is likely to be threatened by the coiling procedure and to determine the optimal treatment strategy.

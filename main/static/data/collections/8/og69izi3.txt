The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) has quickly turned into a global pandemic. Infectious viruses had been isolated from oro- or naso-pharyngeal swabs, sputum and possibly stool samples of infected individuals. Handling these clinical specimens therefore poses a biosafety risk to both healthcare professionals and laboratory workers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 under different heat conditions and report that the virus is stable at 37 C for at least 24 hours. Heating at 56 C for 30 minutes, however, effectively inactivated the virus while preserved the stability of viral RNA in both human sera and sputum samples. These findings provide critical information regarding the biology of the virus as well as a practical way to inactivate infectious virus that is potentially found in clinical specimens.

Biological contamination is considered to be great hazardous and related to national security, it is very important to strengthen physical protection against biological contamination accordingly. Key technologies of physical protection against biological contamination were described in terms of isolation, positive/negative pressure, air filtration, antibacterial material and disinfection. Present situation of research and development about Chinese physical protection equipment against biological contamination were presented involving individual protection, collective protection, disinfections, quality control and ergonomics. Finally, Chinese and overseas status about physical protection equipment against biological contamination were analyzed and compared in the areas of administration, research and market. It was concluded that Chinese physical protection equipment against biological contamination fell behind in administration, research and industrialization. As a result, some suggestions with Chinese characteristics were presented to promote development of Chinese physical protection equipment against biological contamination.

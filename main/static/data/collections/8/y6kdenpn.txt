BACKGROUND Although recent technological developments and improved endoscopic procedures have further spread the application of laparoscopic liver resection, laparoscopic anatomical liver resection still presents major technical difficulties, such as pedicle control. METHODS Subjects comprised 27 patients who underwent laparoscopic anatomical liver resection using an extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle transaction between August 2005 and February 2010. RESULTS A total of 61 Glissonean pedicles could be encircled en bloc extrahepatically, as planned. No serious complications, including major bleeding or injury of the portal triad, were encountered during procedures. CONCLUSIONS Extrahepatic Glissonean access seems to be feasible and safe for laparoscopic anatomical resection of the liver.

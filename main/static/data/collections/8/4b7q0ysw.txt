Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 5 April 2020: Notifications = 5,805; Deaths = 33. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically link. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. Early indications are that reduction in international travel, domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action are slowing the spread of the disease. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with high rates of increase observed in the European region and the United States of America. The epidemiology differs from country to country depending not only on the disease, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.

The frequency of group A bovine rotavirus (gpA BRV) in calves from 1998 to 2002 was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique in 2177 faecal samples, of which 1898 samples were diarrhoeic and 279 were of normal consistency (control group) that were collected from asymptomatic calves for comparative purposes. The animals were from beef and dairy cattle herds (n = 321) from 158 counties in seven States (Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Goiás and Rondônia) and four Brazilian geographical regions (south, south-east, centre-west, and north). GpA BRV was detected in 19.4% (369/1898; p = 0.0001) of the samples collected in calves with diarrhoea and in only 2.2% (6/279; p = 0.0001) of the faeces with normal consistency. The proportion of positive samples collected from beef and dairy cattle herds was 22.8% (205/899; p = 0.0001) and 16.4% (169/999; p = 0.0005), respectively. In relation to age, a higher prevalence of infections was found in calves up to 30 days old, where 33.0% (189/573; p = 0.0001) and 20.2% (138/683; p = 0.0001) of the diarrhoeic faecal samples from beef and dairy cattle herds, respectively, were positive for gpA BRV. These results show the possible importance of inclusion of gpA BRV in the management of neonatal calf diarrhoea in Brazilian cattle herds.

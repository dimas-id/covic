Previous studies suggested that coronavirus RNA transcription involves interaction between leader RNA and the intergenic (IG) sequences, probably via protein-RNA interactions (X. M. Zhang, C.-L. Liao, and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol., 68:4738-4746, 1994; X. M. Zhang and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol., 68:6626-6633, 1994). To determine whether cellular proteins are involved in this process, we performed UV cross-linking experiments using cytoplasmic extracts of uninfected cells and the IG (promoter) sequence between genes 6 and 7 (IG7) and the 5' untranslational region of mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. We demonstrated that three different cellular proteins (p70, p48, and p35/38) bound to the promoter sequence of the template RNA. Deletion analyses of the template RNA mapped the binding site of p35/38 at the consensus transcription initiation signal. In contrast, the binding of p70 and p48 was less specific. p35/38 is the same protein as the one previously identified to bind to the complementary strand of the leader RNA; its binding affinity to the leader was approximately 15 times stronger than that to IG7. Site-directed mutagenesis of the IG sequence revealed that mutations in the consensus sequence of IG7 (UCUAAUCUAAAC to UCGAAAC and GCUAAAG), which resulted in reduced subgenomic mRNA transcription, also caused correspondingly reduced levels of p35/38 binding. These results demonstrated that the extent of protein binding to the IG sequences correlated with the amounts of subgenomic mRNAs transcribed from the IG site. These studies suggest that these RNA-binding proteins are involved in coronavirus RNA transcription and may represent transcription factors.

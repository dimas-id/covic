Abstract Bat immunity has received increasing attention because some bat species are being decimated by the fungal disease, White Nose Syndrome, while other species are potential reservoirs of zoonotic viruses. Identifying specific immune processes requires new specific tools and reagents. In this study, we describe a new mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactive with Eptesicus fuscus immunoglobulins. The epitope recognized by mAb BT1-4F10 was localized to immunoglobulin light (lambda) chains; hence, the mAb recognized serum immunoglobulins and B lymphocytes. The BT1-4F10 epitope appeared to be restricted to Microchiropteran immunoglobulins and absent from Megachiropteran immunoglobulins. Analyses of sera and other E. fuscus fluids showed that most, if not all, secreted immunoglobulins utilized lambda light chains. Finally, mAb BT1-4F10 permitted the identification of B cell follicles in splenic white pulp. This Microchiropteran-specific mAb has potential utility in seroassays; hence, this reagent may have both basic and practical applications for studying immune process.

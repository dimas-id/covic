Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory disease virus (PRRSV) has the intrinsic ability to adapt and evolve. After 25 years of study, this persistent pathogen has continued to frustrate efforts to eliminate infection of herds through vaccination or other elimination strategies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the research on the virion structure, replication and recombination properties of PRRSV that have led to the extraordinary phenotype and genotype diversity that exists worldwide.

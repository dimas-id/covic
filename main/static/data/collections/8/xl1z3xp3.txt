A 62-year-old man, Mr. M., comes to your office with a chief complaint of a cough. He states that it started about 1 week ago with a “runny nose and scratchy throat.” The cough is dry, nonproductive, and is interfering with the patient (and his wife) being able to get a full, restful night’s sleep. Mr. M. denies any other symptoms, such as headache, sinus pressure, chest pain, and shortness of breath, but thinks that he may have had a fever “off and on the last few days.” He has taken Tylenol® and has been drinking fluids, but his cough won’t go away. The patient is requesting an antibiotic to “get this thing kicked out of my system.” Mr. M. states that he is “tired of people at work looking at me like I have the plague.”

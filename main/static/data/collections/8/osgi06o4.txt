COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, and since then, more than 3 million cases and a quarter million deaths have occurred due to it. Lately, there is a growing evidence for an ophthalmologic symptom (conjunctivitis) to be connected with the disease. This seems to happen in early stages of the infection by SARS-CoV-2, and thus, it is of major importance to understand the mechanism through which the virus can facilitate such a symptom. Here, we are proposing a molecular mechanism through which the novel coronavirus could act in order to affect the eye and use it as another, secondary but alternative, point of entry to the host organism.

To assess the current coronavirus pandemic, there is a pressing need to determine the exposure and seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 on a local and global level. Here, we demonstrate a sensitive and specific S-protein based assay that is well suited for detection of weak SARS- CoV-2-directed IgG responses, and that could identify exposed individuals with asymptomatic infection without the requirement of PCR diagnostics. Our results raise the possibility that on- going population-based studies using less sensitive state-of-the-art serological assays may significantly underestimate the frequency of exposure and seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2.

The COVID‐19 pandemic is posing a worldwide challenge to control and contain. SARS‐CoV‐2 is a highly infectious virus. Health care providers at the front lines are at high risk of getting the infection and the risk applies also to laboratory personnel as they deal with specimens that might be contaminated with infectious materiel. Cytopathology teams specifically are at high risk of dealing with contaminated material because of patients encounter during fine‐needle aspiration biopsies or Rapid On‐Site Evaluation (ROSE) for adequacy. In our article, we discuss alternative safer staining methods to the widely used Diff–Quick stain that can be utilized for ROSE to decrease the risk of viral exposure during the current COVID‐19 pandemic.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute, febrile, and multisystem vasculitis of early childhood with a striking predilection for the coronary arteries. The most significant complication is coronary artery abnormalities, including coronary aneurysms. The etiology of KD remains unknown. Many infectious agents including viruses have been postulated as possible causes of KD. But standard microbiologic techniques, molecular methods and serologic investigations have failed to identify an etiologic agent. We described a patient with atypical KD during cytomegalovirus infection.

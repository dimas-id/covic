Background and Purpose Several reports have described lower mortality rates in overweight or obese patients as compared to normal weight ones. In the past decade, several studies have investigated the phenomenon, commonly known as the obesity paradox, with mixed results thus far. We sought to determine whether outcomes differ between patients with large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) after endovascular therapy (ET) according to their body mass index (BMI). Methods We reviewed our prospectively collected endovascular database at a tertiary care academic institution. All patients that underwent ET for acute LVOS were categorized according to their BMI into 4 groups: (1) underweight (BMI < 18.5), (2) normal weight (BMI = 18.5-25), (3) overweight (BMI = 25-30), and (4) obese (BMI > 30). Baseline characteristics, procedural radiological as well as outcome parameters where compared. Results A total of 926 patients qualified for the study, of which 20 (2.2%) were underweight, 253 (27.3%) had a normal weight, 315 (34%) were overweight, and 338 (36.5%) were obese. When compared with normal weight (reference), overweight patients were younger, had higher rates of dyslipidemia and diabetes and higher glucose levels, while obese patients were younger, less often smokers, and had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes and higher glucose levels. Other baseline and procedural characteristics were comparable. The rates of successful reperfusion (modified treatment in cerebral ischemia, 2b-3), parenchymal hematomas, 90-day good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale, 0-2), and 90-day mortality were comparable between groups. On multivariate analysis, BMI was not associated with good outcomes nor mortality. Conclusion In patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, BMI is not associated with outcomes. However, patients who are overweight or obese have more comorbidities and a higher stroke risk and, thus, should strive for a normal weight.

GSK3 has been implicated for years in the regulation of inflammation and addressed in a plethora of scientific reports using a variety of experimental (disease) models and approaches. However, the specific role of GSK3 in the inflammatory process is still not fully understood and controversially discussed. Following a detailed overview of structure, function, and various regulatory levels, this review focusses on the immunoregulatory functions of GSK3, including the current knowledge obtained from animal models. Its impact on pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine profiles, bacterial/viral infections, and the modulation of associated pro-inflammatory transcriptional and signaling pathways is discussed. Moreover, GSK3 contributes to the resolution of inflammation on multiple levels, e.g., via the regulation of pro-resolving mediators, the clearance of apoptotic immune cells, and tissue repair processes. The influence of GSK3 on the development of different forms of stimulation tolerance is also addressed. Collectively, the role of GSK3 as a kinase balancing the initiation/perpetuation and the amelioration/resolution of inflammation is highlighted.

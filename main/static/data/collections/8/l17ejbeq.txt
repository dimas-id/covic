Serological detection of some pathogens in the beluga whale Delphinapterus leucas population from Sakhalinsky Bay of the Sea of Okhotsk (Sakhalin–Amur beluga whale stock) was performed in 2013–2014 after the largest recorded flood of the Amur River (among observations since 1896). The percent of this population that is immune to the causative agents of clonorchosis was 25.6%; toxoplasmosis, 11.5%; brucellosis, 38.5%; tuberculosis, 30.8%; cetacean morbillivirus infection, 16.7%; and to alpha and gamma herpes viruses each, 21.8%.

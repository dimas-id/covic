The use of onyx enabled the treatment of various intracranial vascular diseases more effectively than cyanoacrylate. The pressure cooker technique allowed definitive control of reflux and was made possible via detachable microcatheters. We present a variation of this technique called the modified pressure cooker to make reflux control easier and more reproducible and thus simplifying the procedure. We also extended the application of the technique to other diseases beyond arteriovenous malformations including dural arteriovenous fistulas and hypervascular tumors.

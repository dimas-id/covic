PURPOSE: We studied the risk factors for postoperative mortality between patients who underwent emergency or elective living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHODS: Forty-seven patients underwent LDLT in our institute, 16 for emergencies and 31 as elective procedures. The emergency LDLT status was applied to cases in which the time period between referral to our institution and transplantation did not exceed 10 days, and in which liver failure was accompanied by the presence of any degree of hepatic encephalopathy. RESULTS: With regard to preoperative factors, age (P = 0.03), the model for end-stage liver disease score (P = 0.001), preoperative tracheal intubation (P = 0.001), ratio between arterial oxygen tension and fractional inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio) (P = 0.03), steroid therapy use (P = 0.001), lymphocyte count (P = 0.02), and cases requiring hemodiafiltration (P = 0.001) differed significantly between the two groups. Postoperative pneumonia occurred more frequently in emergency LDLT patients than in elective LDLT patients (P = 0.006). Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was the main cause of postoperative death in emergency LDLT patients, and, in a univariate analysis, a preoperative status of high serum (1 → 3)-β-d-glucan (>20 pg/ml, P = 0.001), advanced age (>52 years, P = 0.02), and a low PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (<320, P = 0.01) were identified as factors predictive of IPA. CONCLUSION: Careful perioperative management, including preoperative investigation of aspergillosis and empiric antibiotic therapy, should be considered for emergency LDLT patients who fulfill IPA risk factors.

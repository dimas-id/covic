The novel coronavirus termed SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) is a major public health challenge. Many maternity units around the country are currently considering management protocols for these patients. We report a case from a tertiary Australian hospital describing an uncomplicated vaginal birth in a COVID‐19 positive mother. To our knowledge this is also the first case described of a mother with COVID‐19 not separated from her infant. Management provided supports the current Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and World Health Organization guidelines suggesting that it is possible to consider rooming in post‐delivery for COVID‐19 positive parents. Encouragement of breastfeeding appears possible and safe when viral precautions are observed.

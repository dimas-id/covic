Abstract The role of CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) in activation of dendritic cells (DCs) following mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined. The results indicate that CCL3 participates in an effective host response to MHV infection by contributing to CD11c+CD11b+CD8α− DC maturation, activation, and migration to cervical lymph nodes (CLN). Diminished CD8α− DC activation correlated with reduced IFN-γ expression by virus-specific T cells accompanied by increased IL-10 production suggesting that CCL3 contributes to an effective host response to viral infection by enhancing the T cell activation potential of DC.

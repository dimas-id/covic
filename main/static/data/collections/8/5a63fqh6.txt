Intraventricular recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IVT rt-PA) has improved outcomes for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Patients with suspected or untreated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been excluded from clinical trials. We present a patient with IVH secondary to a ruptured AVM safely treated with IVT rt-PA. A 48-year-old Hispanic male with a history of dermatomyositis presented to the emergency department with sudden left-sided weakness. En route to computed tomography (CT), he became lethargic. Computed tomography revealed extensive IVH with acute hydrocephalus, which was treated with the placement of external ventricular drain with clinical improvement. Computed tomography angiogram performed did not reveal AVM. Cerebral digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) was planned due to suspicion of AVM. Prior to DSA, patient became acutely lethargic. Computed tomography imaging revealed worsening hydrocephalus. External ventricular drain was noted to be draining. Repeat CT revealed improved hydrocephalus but with left lateral ventricle dilatation. Risks and benefits of IVT rt-PA were discussed with the family and a decision was made to treat. Three doses of 1 mg IVT rt-PA were administered with resolution of midline blood and lateral ventricular dilatation with clinical improvement. Digital subtraction angiogram revealed early draining vein on right internal carotid artery injection draining into the inferior sagittal sinus representing ruptured AVM without clear nidus. Repeat DSA with possible embolization was planned after discharge. In spite of additional in-hospital complications, the patient gradually improved and was ultimately discharged home. Our case supports the idea that the use of IVT rt-PA following an IVH caused by an underlying AVM could be further explored in carefully designed clinical trials.

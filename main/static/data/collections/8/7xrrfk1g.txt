BACKGROUND Anesthesiologists routinely perform high-risk procedures that are associated with permanent disability or death. Critical perioperative events require that the anesthesiologist perform procedures that are only used intermittently. Teaching these procedures is complicated by their infrequency and pressure to maximize operating room efficiency; therefore we created an annual 1-day anesthesiology skills lab as an innovative method of residency education. METHODS Anesthetized pigs served as the educational platform for first-year anesthesiology residents to gain hands-on experience performing regional, thoracic, vascular, and difficult airway techniques. A 20-question test was administered pre- and post-lab to assess the effectiveness of our educational intervention. Participants evaluated the quality of the educational experience (1-poor to 5-excellent). RESULTS First-year anesthesiology residents participated (n=70, 2008-2012). Residents' pre-test scores measured 50.3±2.6% (range 20-80). Following lab participation, their test scores signi ficantly improved to a mean of 84.2±1.9% (range 45-100, p<0.0001). Participants increased their knowledge and skills (mean 4.96±0.02), considered the skills lab to be a worthwhile educational experience (mean 4.99±0.01), and agreed that the lab should be repeated in the future (mean 5.00). CONCLUSIONS In vivo labs confers educational benefits which are both perceived and self-reported by the participants and objectively demonstrated by marked improvements in their post-test scores. Animal models provide high-fidelity tactile learning, real-time physiological changes, and potential for complications which builds residents' familiarity and confidence with anesthesiology-related procedures and crisis events that would otherwise involve potential patient risk. Our lab is an enriching and well-received educational tool which promotes our goal of improving patient safety.

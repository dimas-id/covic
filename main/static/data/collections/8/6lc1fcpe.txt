Cucurbits are important group of vegetables due to their nutritional significance and are also used for valuable traditional medicine. The infection of plants by Agrobacterium rhizogenes results in a hairy root (HR) phenotype characterized by rapid growth in hormone-free medium, an unusual ageotropism and extensive lateral branching. These genetically transformed root cultures (hairy roots) can produce levels of secondary metabolites comparable to that of intact plants. Hairy root cultures offer promise for high production and productivity of valuable secondary metabolites in many plants. High stability and productivity features allow the exploitation of HRs as valuable biotechnological tool for the production of plant secondary metabolites. While these chemical compounds are employed by plants for interactions with their environment, humans have long since explored and exploited plant secondary metabolites for medicinal and practical uses. The main constraint for commercial exploitation of hairy root cultivations is the development and scaling up of appropriate reactor vessels (bioreactors) that permit the growth of interconnected tissues normally unevenly distributed throughout the vessel. Emphasis has focused on designing appropriate bioreactors suitable to culture the delicate and sensitive plant hairy roots. To this end, hairy root culture presents an excellent platform for producing valuable secondary metabolites. For these reasons, this chapter describes the establishment of hairy roots and production of secondary metabolites from hairy roots of cucurbits and also phytochemicals uses for biological activity.

Abstract The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has demonstrated the urgency to rethink the health system quality to efficiently support and improve global health. Whilst efforts are now gathering pace in response to the deleterious impacts of COVID-19, gendered analysis of these impacts and response to the pandemic has been far too little. A critical consideration of gendered lenses and the respective brunt of health crises of the pandemic on men and women can improve our understanding and direction of efforts toward building robust and equitable public health response. Strategic plans for preparedness must be fully grounded in strong gender analysis in the remit of gender roles and norms, and strengthen the leadership and resourceful participation of women in the decision-making process toward addressing COVID-19 outbreak.

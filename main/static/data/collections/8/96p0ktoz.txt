A whole new pathogen, to which humans have virtually no pre-existing immunity, has caused fear all over the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) is one of the types of human novel-coronavirus of the family coronavirus. The nature of transmission of the virus makes it one of the most infectious pathogenic diseases that has ever existed. Though the human coronaviruses have existed since the discovery of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) in 1960, it has been a challenge to develop an effective cure as well as vaccine for the diseases associated with coronaviruses. Commonly, human coronaviruses cause illnesses such as intestinal and respiratory tract illnesses. Nevertheless, the symptoms reflected after infection from the coronaviruses take some time before being identified. Thus, viruses can replicate and cause more harm to the human body before being detected. Moreover, research continues to explain why some gene variations in some individuals increase the risk of some infectious diseases, while others are not affected. Looking at gene variations in people infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and studying how genes influence people's response to infection will help to develop a vaccine that will help strengthen the immune system. Knowing how the human genes respond to the virus COVID-19 will help to cure people more effectively.

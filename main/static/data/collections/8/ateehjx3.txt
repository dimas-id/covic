I read with interest the submission of Haward et al. (1) dealing with the pediatrical ethics issues during this Covid‚Äê19 outbreak. I was particularly sensitive to the chapter dedicated to neonatal which highlighted very clearly the indirect consequences of this pandemic on the paediatric population. I would like to insist on the situation in the West Indies. The numbers of adult's vital distress sharply increase the need for intensive care beds. Even the great majority of pediatric intensive care units have provided equipment and staff to support the adult units (2).

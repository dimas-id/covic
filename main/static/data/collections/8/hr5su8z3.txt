BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID‐19 outbreak, hygiene regulations have been intensified and hand sanitation has gained special attention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the onset of hand eczema during the COVID‐19 pandemic in health care workers (HCWs) directly involved in intensive care of COVID‐19 patients and HCWs without direct contact. Hereby, we aim at increasing awareness with regard to occupational hand eczema and preventive measures that can be undertaken. METHODS: A survey was distributed amongst 114 HCWs at a single surgical site and at a COVID‐19 intensive care unit of the university hospital LMU Munich, Germany. Participants were questioned with regard to the daily frequency of hand hygiene prior to and during the pandemic. Participants self‐reported onset of hand eczema and associated symptoms. RESULTS: Our study revealed a significant increase of hand washing, disinfection and use of hand cream across all participants (P‐value<.001), regardless of having direct contact with COVID‐19 patients. A high prevalence of symptoms associated with acute hand dermatitis was found in 90.4% across all HCWs, whereas hand eczema itself was underreported (14.9%). CONCLUSION: The increase of hand sanitation during the COVID‐19 pandemic impairs the skin of the hands across all HCWs, independent of direct intensive care of affected patients.

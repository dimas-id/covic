BACKGROUND Poly-4-hydroxybutyric acid (P4HB, Phasixâ„¢) is a biosynthetic polymer that degrades by hydrolysis that can be woven into a mesh for use in soft tissue reinforcement. Herein, we describe our initial experience performing complex abdominal wall repair (CAWR) utilizing component separation and P4HB mesh as onlay reinforcement. METHODS All patients undergoing CAWR between June 2014 and May 2017 were followed prospectively for postoperative outcomes. Only those patients who underwent components separation with primary repair of the fascial edges followed by onlay of P4HB mesh were included in this study. RESULTS 105 patients (52 male, 53 female; mean age 59.2 years, range 22-84) met inclusion criteria. Mean BMI was 29.1 (range 16-48); 52% patients had prior attempted hernia repair, most with multiple medical comorbidities (71% of patients with ASA 3 or greater). 30% of cases were not clean at the time of repair (CDC class 2 or greater). Median follow-up was 36 months (range 9-63). Eighteen patients (17%) developed a hernia recurrence ranging from 2 to 36 months postoperatively. Five (5%) patients developed a localized superficial infection treated with antibiotics, three (2.8%) required re-operation for non-healing wounds, and six (6%) patients developed seroma. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate a relatively low rate of hernia recurrence, seroma, and other common complications of CAWR in a highly morbid patient population. Importantly, the rate of mesh infection was low and no patients required complete mesh removal, even when placed into a contaminated or infected surgical field.

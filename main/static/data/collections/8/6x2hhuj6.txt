COVID-19 has become a major challenge to global health, and until now, no efficient antiviral agents have been developed. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation in severe patients, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused respiratory failure contributes to most mortalities. There is an urgent need for developing effective drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 caused ARDS. However, most researchers cannot perform SARS-CoV-2 related researches due to lacking P3 or P4 facility. We developed a non-infectious, highly safety, time-saving SARS-CoV-2 components induced murine model to study the SARS-CoV-2 caused ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). We also investigated mAbs and inhibitors which potentially neutralize the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19, and found that anti-IL-1α, anti-IL-6, anti-TNFα, anti-GM-CSF mAbs, p38 inhibitor, and JAK inhibitor partially relieved CSS. Besides, anti-IL-6, anti-TNFα, anti-GM-CSF mAbs and inhibitors of p38, ERK, and MPO somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung. In all, we established the murine model mimic of COVID-19, opening a biosafety and less time-consuming avenue for clarifying the mechanism of ARDS and CSS in COVID-19 and developing the therapeutic drugs.

High rate of muscular oxygen utilization facilitates the development of hypoxemia during exercise at altitude. Because endurance training stimulates oxygen extraction capacity, we investigated whether endurance athletes are at higher risk to developing hypoxemia and thereby acute mountain sickness symptoms during exercise at simulated high altitude. Elite athletes (ATL; n = 8) and fit controls (CON; n = 7) cycled for 20 min at 100 W (EX100W), as well as performed an incremental maximal oxygen consumption test (EXMAX) in normobaric hypoxia (0.107 inspired O2 fraction) or normoxia (0.209 inspired O2 fraction). Cardiorespiratory responses, arterial Po2 (PaO2), and oxygenation status in m. vastus lateralis [tissue oxygenation index (TOIM)] and frontal cortex (TOIC) by near-infrared spectroscopy, were measured. Muscle O2 uptake rate was estimated from change in oxyhemoglobin concentration during a 10-min arterial occlusion in m. gastrocnemius. Maximal oxygen consumption in normoxia was 70 ± 2 ml·min(-1·)kg(-1) in ATL vs. 43 ± 2 ml·min(-1·)kg(-1) in CON, and in hypoxia decreased more in ATL (-41%) than in CON (-25%, P < 0.05). Both in normoxia at PaO2 of ∼95 Torr, and in hypoxia at PaO2 of ∼35 Torr, muscle O2 uptake was twofold higher in ATL than in CON (0.12 vs. 0.06 ml·min(-1)·100 g(-1); P < 0.05). During EX100W in hypoxia, PaO2 dropped to lower (P < 0.05) values in ATL (27.6 ± 0.7 Torr) than in CON (33.5 ± 1.0 Torr). During EXMAX, but not during EX100W, TOIM was ∼15% lower in ATL than in CON (P < 0.05). TOIC was similar between the groups at any time. This study shows that maintenance of high muscular oxygen extraction rate at very low circulating PaO2 stimulates the development of hypoxemia during submaximal exercise in hypoxia in endurance-trained individuals. This effect may predispose to premature development of acute mountain sickness symptoms during exercise at altitude.

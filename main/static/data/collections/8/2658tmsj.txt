Surgical resection of congenital lung lesions has evolved with minimally invasive and parenchyma-preserving techniques. Although these lesions are usually small and their limits can be suspected by direct vision or palpation, there are no clear anatomic landmarks to enable a precise resection. This report presents a new technique that helps to define the limits of intralobar sequestrations, leading to a safe and anatomic thoracoscopic segmentectomy.

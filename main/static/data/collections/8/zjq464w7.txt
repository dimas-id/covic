Abstract A synthetic pathway to new acyclonucleoside phosphonates, as analogues of Adefovir, is described. The reduction of an acyclonucleoside β-ketophosphonate, readily available from the nucleobase and benzylacrylate, afforded a mixture of (R)- and (S)-β-hydroxyphosphonate derivatives which was resolved. The assignment of the absolute configuration was proposed on the basis of NMR studies and was supported by molecular modelling studies.

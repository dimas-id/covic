Pneumomediastinum usually occurs following an airleak from the lungs, or from a perforated oesophagus. We report on a 30-year-old man who developed pneumomediastinum after scuba diving. The patient presented with acute onset of throat pain, odynophagia, and hoarseness of voice. The literature is reviewed for this condition.

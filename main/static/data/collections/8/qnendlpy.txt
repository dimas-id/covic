The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first reported in Wuhan, China, in 2019 has evolved into a pandemic and public health emergency, leading to extensive fatalities and halting global economies. Older adults have emerged as a critically vulnerable population as earlier data suggests a disproportionately increased incidence of COVID-19 in this population, as well as worse health outcomes. Disease attenuating behaviors such as social distancing has been encouraged and mandated across different countries leading to downstream economic ramifications. This paper seeks to outline the economic implications of COVID-19 in the U.S. (particularly in terms of vocational, retail, and service industries), highlighting the role of nursing homes in disease dissemination. We also discuss potential costs associated with COVID-19 management focusing on the senior population who rely on Medicare benefits for health insurance.

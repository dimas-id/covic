A patient with an umbilical hernia presenting with collateral veins in the abdominal wall and umbilicus is a case that every hernia surgeon has to deal with occasionally. Several underlying diseases have been described to provoke collateral veins in the abdominal wall. However, the treatment strategy should be uniform. We herein report a case of a successful laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair in a patient with collateral veins in the abdominal wall and umbilicus. A 63-year-old man was referred to the surgical outpatient clinic with a large symptomatic umbilical hernia and collateral veins in the abdominal wall, secondary to an occlusion of both common iliac veins. Because of collateral veins in the umbilicus and the size of the hernial defect, he was offered laparoscopic hernia repair without compromising these veins. Because of the extensive abdominal wall collaterals, duplex sonography vein mapping was performed preoperatively to mark a safe collateral-free area for trocar introduction. The defect was repaired by mesh prosthesis.

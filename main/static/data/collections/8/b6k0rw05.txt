COVID-19 is a recently identified illness that is associated with thromboembolic events. We report a case of pulmonary embolism in a patient with COVID-19, treated by catheter directed thrombectomy. A 57 year old patient presented to the emergency center with severe COVID-19 symptoms and developed massive pulmonary embolism. The patient was treated with catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) and recovered completely. Coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 is present in all severe cases and is a dynamic process. We describe a case of massive/high risk pulmonary embolism, in a patient with COVID-19 receiving full anticoagulation, who was treated by percutaneous intervention. CDT can be an additional therapeutic option in patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism that present with rapid clinical collapse.

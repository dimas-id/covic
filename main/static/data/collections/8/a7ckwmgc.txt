BACKGROUND Utilization of the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) approach for scoliosis offers the patients deformity correction and interbody fusion without the additional morbidity associated with more invasive reconstructive techniques. Published reports on complications associated with these surgical procedures are limited. The purpose of this study was to quantify the intra- and postoperative complications associated with the TLIF surgical approach in patients undergoing surgery for spinal stenosis and degenerative scoliosis correction. METHODS This study included patients undergoing TLIF for degenerative scoliosis with neurogenic claudication and painful lumbar degenerative disc disease. The TLIF technique was performed along with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. The average follow-up time was 30 months (range, 15-47). RESULTS A total of 29 patients with an average age of 65.9 years (range, 49-83) were evaluated. TLIFs were performed at 2.2 levels on average (range, 1-4) in addition to 6.0 (range, 4-9) levels of posterolateral instrumented fusion. The preoperative mean lumbar lordosis was 37.6° (range, 16°-55°) compared to 40.5° (range, 26°-59.2°) postoperatively. The preoperative mean coronal Cobb angle was 32.3° (range, 15°-55°) compared to 15.4° (range, 1°-49°) postoperatively. The mean operative time was 528 min (range, 276-906), estimated blood loss was 1091.7 mL (range, 150-2500), and hospitalization time was 8.0 days (range, 3-28). A baseline mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of 7.6 (range, 4-10) decreased to 3.6 (range, 0-8) postoperatively. There were a total of 14 (49%) hardware and/or surgical technique related complications, and 8 (28%) patients required additional surgeries. Five (17%) patients developed pseudoarthrosis. The systemic complications (31%) included death (1), cardiopulmonary arrest with resuscitation (1), myocardial infarction (1), pneumonia (5), and pulmonary embolism (1). CONCLUSION This study suggests that although the TLIF approach is a feasible and effective method to treat degenerative adult scoliosis, it is associated with a high rate of intra- and postoperative complications and a long recovery process.

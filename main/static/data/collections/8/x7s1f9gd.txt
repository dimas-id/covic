The synthesis of several (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amines is reported. They were evaluated as NMDA receptor antagonists and several of them were more active than amantadine, but none was more potent than memantine. None of the tested compounds displayed antiviral activity. Two of the derivatives showed a significant level of trypanocidal activity.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, there is an ongoing debate and research regarding the possible ways of virus transmission. We conducted an epidemiological investigation which revealed a cluster of five COVID-19 cases, linked to playing squash at a sports venue in Maribor, Slovenia. Acquired data raises possibility that the transmission occurred indirectly through contaminated objects in changing room or squash hall or via aerosolisation in squash hall.

Objectives To determine an effective framework for supplying emergency drugs under various scenarios using 'modular design' and information technology. Additionally, medicinal safety was improved by combining pharmacy monitoring with a safety alert system for medication. Methods Data from various emergency events and details of the disease related to the incident were analysed using Cluster, Delphi and Decision analyses. The optimal drug combination was determined and then divided into the different modules. We established the 'drug supply expedited system in emergencies' based on the above modules, and we organised emergency drills to verify the system's effectiveness and to improve efficiency. Pharmaceutical care services were performed by rehearsing the unexpected emergency incident and associated pharmaceutical care. Results We developed a drug supply framework for 'traffic accidents, poisoning first aid, natural disasters, epidemics and mass disturbances' and established an 'emergency drug supply expedited system'. We quickly equipped the drugs that were needed for the special emergency events, and we developed a 'green channel' between the emergency and drug supply centres. Medication safety was also important for the emergencies, and clinical pharmacists played a role in medicating the safety service personnel. The utility of our findings was demonstrated through several emergency drills. Conclusions In this study, we explored the optimal drug supply and pharmacy assistance models for emergency medicine. The clinical innovation of this study was that we provided a modular supply of medical supplies for traffic accidents. We also established a drug supply information system. This study provided effective reference values for emergency drug therapy.

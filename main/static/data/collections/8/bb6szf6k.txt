Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV inhibits cell proliferation. Our previous study indicated that Akt, which is poorly phosphorylated in confluent cultures of Vero E6 cells, is phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated upon infection by SARS-CoV. In the present study, we showed that a serine residue of Akt was phosphorylated in Vero E6 cells in subconfluent culture and that Akt was dephosphorylated rapidly after SARS-CoV infection without up-regulation of its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which is one of the downstream targets of Akt, was prevented in SARS-CoV-infected cells. However, treatment with glycogen synthase kinase-3β small interfering RNA indicated that the glycogen synthase kinase-3β signaling pathway was not related to inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, which induces dephosphorylation of Akt, inhibited cell proliferation. As shown in our previous studies, apoptosis occurred in virus-infected cells within 18 h postinfection. Cellular mRNA transcription, which was reported to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, was not up-regulated in virus-infected Vero E6 cells, partially as a result of apoptosis. These results suggested that inhibition of cell proliferation is regulated by both the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and by apoptosis in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. This is the first study to analyze SARS-CoV-induced cell growth inhibition.

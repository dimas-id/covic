Background: Modulation of the immune system to prevent lung injury is being widely used against the new coronavirus disease (COVID19) despite the scarcity of evidence. Methods: We report preliminary results from the Vall dHebron prospective cohort study at Vall dHebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others. Results: 82 patients with COVID19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean (SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) ageadjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1 to 4) points. Respiratory failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5 to 11) days. The median time from symptom onset to the first dose of tocilizumab was 9 (7 to 11) days. Mortality at 7 days was 26.8%. Hazard ratio for mortality was 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5 (age adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 2.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8) if tocilizumab was administered after the onset of ARDS. Conclusion: Time from lung injury onset to tocilizumab administration may be critical to patient recovery. Our preliminary data could inform bedside decisions until more data from clinical trials becomes available.

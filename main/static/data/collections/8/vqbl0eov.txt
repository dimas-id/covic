In this paper, we analyze Beijing SARS data using methods developed from the complex network analysis literature. Three kinds of SARS-related networks were constructed and analyzed, including the patient contact network, the weighted location (district) network, and the weighted occupation network. We demonstrate that a network-based data analysis framework can help evaluate various control strategies. For instance, in the case of SARS, a general randomized immunization control strategy may not be effective. Instead, a strategy that focuses on nodes (e.g., patients, locations, or occupations) with high degree and strength may lead to more effective outbreak control and management.

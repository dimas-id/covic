Phage display (PD) is a technology based on the presentation of functional exogenous peptides on the capsid surface of bacteriophages. PD is performed by introducing a DNA sequence of interest at a specific position within a functional viral gene. In addition, peptide phage libraries are powerful tools for expressing a wide range of random peptides and for specific peptide screening. Specifically, PD applications include the analysis of binding and interactions between proteins, the identification of bioactive peptides that bind to receptors, the identification of disease-associated antigens, and the identification of cell-specific peptides. Since its emergence, PD technology has revolutionized several fields in the biological sciences, such as oncology, cell biology, and pharmacology, the innumerable applications for which will be described throughout this review.

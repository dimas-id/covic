The interaction between the nucleocapsid (N) protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and RNA was studied in an effort to define portions of the N molecule that participate in binding to RNA. N mRNAs transcribed from SP6 and T7 vectors were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Analysis of synthesized N protein in a nondenaturing gel system showed that it bound in vitro to an endogenous RNA in the reticulocyte lysate but not to its own mRNA. A set of deletion mutants was constructed in order to localize the RNA-binding activity of the N protein. It was found that removal of as much as 135 amino-terminal or 57 carboxy-terminal amino acids from the molecule had little or no effect on RNA binding. Moreover, deletion mutants lacking both termini still retained RNA-binding ability. By contrast, internal deletions or truncations extending beyond these two limits effectively abolished RNA binding by N protein. Thus, the RNA-binding region of N has been mapped to the second (central) of the three structural domains of the molecule.

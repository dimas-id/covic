The role of IL-6 in Ig production induced in the mouse by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), Toxoplasma gondii or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was assessed. Following infection with LDV, a strong activator of B cells, an early and transient IL-6 production was observed, that originated predominantly from macrophages. Whereas LDV-induced B lymphocyte proliferation appeared independent of IL-6, mice deficient for this cytokine showed a marked reduction in their total T-dependent IgG2a production when compared to their normal counterparts. By contrast, specific responses directed against either LDV or non-viral antigens administered at the time of infection were not decreased in the absence of IL-6. Similarly, polyclonal, but not anti-parasite IgG2a production triggered by T. gondii infection was strongly dependent on the presence of IL-6. Finally, T-independent total IgG3 secretion triggered by LPS was also markedly reduced in IL-6-deficient mice. These results suggest that IL-6 plays a major role in T-dependent and T-independent polyclonal Ig production following B lymphocyte activation by viruses, and parasites, but not in specific antibody responses induced by the same microorganisms.

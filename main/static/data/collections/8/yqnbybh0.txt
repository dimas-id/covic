We have investigated the effect of the transmembrane domain of three viral ion channel proteins on the lipid bilayer structure by X-ray reflectivity and scattering from oriented planar bilayers. The proteins show a similar effect on the lipid bilayer structural parameters: an increase in the lipid bilayer hydrophobic core, a decrease in the amplitude of the vertical density profile and a systematic change in the ordering of the acyl chains as a function of protein-to-lipid ratio. These results are discussed in a comparative view.

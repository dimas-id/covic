The study aims to evaluate the safety and availability of totally minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (MIIE) with single-utility incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Forty-one patients with mid-lower thoracic esophageal cancer were prospectively treated with totally MIIE. Two stages of laparoscopic-thoracoscopic procedures were performed. The first 29 patients were treated with four-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (Group 1); the others were treated with single-utility incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (Group 2). Short-term clinicopathological outcomes were examined. All patients had negative tumor margins and were pathologically staged from T1N0M0 to T3N2M0. Among Group 1, there was one conversion to open surgery. The mean duration of surgery was 268.4 ± 37.8 minutes, and mean blood loss was 207.2 ± 74.1 mL without significant differences between groups. The average thoracic or abdominal lymph node yield was 12.6 ± 7.1 or 6 ± 5.8, respectively. The median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. No mortalities occurred. Minor morbidity complicated by late-stage gastroparesis occurred in two patients (4.9%) after discharge. Major morbidities, including intestinal obstruction and anastomotic leakage, occurred in three patients (7.3%) after discharge. Among Group 2, the average operative duration was 275.4 ± 31.2 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 220 ± 94.9 mL. One patient developed late-stage anastomotic leakage. The average thoracic or abdominal lymph node yield was 14.7 ± 8.8 and 6.3 ± 5.7, respectively. No statistically significant differences were identified between Group 1 and Group 2. MIIE with single-utility incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is feasible in patients with mid-lower thoracic esophageal cancer without compromising the extent of surgical resection and perioperative outcomes.

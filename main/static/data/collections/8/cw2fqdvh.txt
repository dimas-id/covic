BACKGROUND Restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch is the definitive procedure in ulcerative colitis. The potential benefits afforded by a single incision laparoscopic (SILS) approach make it appropriate to consider. METHODS Electronic data were prospectively collected from all patients who underwent SILS restorative proctocolectomy (SILS-RPC) between June 2009 and June 2010. RESULTS Ten consecutive patients (4 male), with median BMI = 22 (range = 20-28 kg/m(2)) underwent SILS-LRPC over a 1-year period. Three had undergone a previous emergency laparoscopic colectomy. A single-port device (Covidien SILS™ or Olympus TriPort™) was positioned at the site of the existing or proposed temporary ileostomy (2.5-cm incision). The colon and rectum were extracted through the SILS site (n = 8) or transanally following a mucosectomy (n = 2). A 20-cm J pouch was constructed extracorporeally and returned via the ileostomy site. Pouch-anal anastomosis was performed intracorporeally (n = 8) or hand-sutured (n = 2) and a diverting loop ileostomy was created at the SILS port site. The median operation time was 185 min (range = 100-381). There were no conversions or additional ports required. Median time to full diet was 36 h (range = 4-48 h) with a median hospital stay of 3 days (range = 2-8 days). There were no 30-day readmissions. Complications included surgical emphysema with temperature and a panic attack. Nine stomas have been closed. All patients have spontaneity of defecation, with a median pouch frequency of four per day, including once at night. All are fully continent and able to defer during the day. One reported a dry ejaculate for 10 weeks. CONCLUSION SILS restorative proctocolectomy is safe with good early functional outcomes when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon.

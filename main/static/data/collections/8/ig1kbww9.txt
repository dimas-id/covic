The current outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has attained the dimensions of a pandemic and World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a global emergency and given it a name of COVID-19. It may remain asymptomatic, but usually presents as influenza-like symptoms initially. It spreads from zoonotic sources, which are still under investigation. Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the only available diagnostic and confirmatory lab assay for SARS-CoV-2. There is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, hence infected and suspected cases are dependent on supportive treatment along with few anti-HIV drugs. Evidence suggests that, in Pakistan, all cases have returned from Iran and Saudi Arabia after pilgrimage. The number of patients has been increasing gradually. Almost all of the neighboring countries of Pakistan are suffering from an outbreak. So, a big threat is there. Pakistani health authorities need to take critical action urgently. Moreover, it is necessary to take basic preventive measurements including hand washing, use of face masks, keeping the distance from suspected patients and avoiding unnecessary traveling to overcrowded areas. It is concluded that the developing countries might be at higher risk including Pakistan. Personnel and community-based strategy is required to avoid any serious consequences in Pakistan. We searched relevant studies and papers from Google, Google Scholar, National Institute of Health (Pakistan) and WHO by using various medical subject heading (MeSH) terms including COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, Preventive Measurements of COVID etc. All downloaded articles were carefully read and conclusions drawn.

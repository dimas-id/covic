BACKGROUND Lobectomy for benign lung disease is renowned to be technically complex and to be subjected to an increased complication rate. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the results obtained with video-assisted surgery (VATS) in benign disease are comparable to those obtained in oncologic surgery, where VATS has been validated. METHODS We have reviewed the files of 246 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy from January 2012 to August 2015. The cohort was divided into two groups according to pathology (benign or malignant). Outcome parameters on scrutiny were demographics, pathology, duration of air leak, drainage and hospital stay, conversion, and perioperative complication rate. Comparisons were made with the χ 2 test and Student's t test; any p value ≤0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS Group 1 (36 patients) included patients who underwent lobectomy for benign disease and group 2 (210 patients) patients affected by lung cancer or pulmonary metastases. The two groups differed with reference to age (p < 0.001), history of cancer (p < 0.001), history of stroke (p = 0.05), and the presence of pleural adhesions (p = 0.03). There was no difference for duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage and hospital stay, conversion rate, and perioperative complication rate. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that pathology did not impact on outcomes after VATS lobectomy. This study suggests that VATS is as a safe option in selected patients with benign disease requiring lobectomy, despite a more complex technical context.

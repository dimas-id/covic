BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) firstly announced in Wuhan of Hubei province, China is rapidly spreading to all the other 31 provinces of China and to more than 140 countries. Quarantine strategies play the key role on the disease controlling and public health in the world with this pandemic of the COVID-19 defined by the World Health Organization. METHODS: In this study, a SEIRQ epidemic model was developed to explore the dynamic changes of COVID-19 in Wuhan and mainland China, from January 27, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the quarantine strategies, two perspectives are employed from the different quarantine magnitudes and quarantine time points. RESULTS: The major results suggest that the COVID-19 variations are well captured by the epidemic model with very high accuracy in the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases and cumulative death cases. The quarantine magnitudes in the susceptible individuals play larger roles on the disease control than the impacts of the quarantines of the exposed individuals and infectious individuals. For the quarantine time points, it shows that the early quarantine strategy is significantly important for the disease controlling. The time delayed quarantining will seriously increase the COVID-19 disease patients and prolongs the days of the disease extinction. CONCLUSIONS: Our model can simulate and predict the COVID-19 variations and the quarantine strategies are important for the disease controlling, especially at the early period of the disease outbreak. These conclusions provide important scientific information for the government policymaker in the disease control strategies.

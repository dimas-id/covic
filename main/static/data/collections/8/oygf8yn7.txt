The aim of the present study was to develop an immunohistochemical method (IHC) for detection of Lawsonia intracellularis (L. intracellularis) in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded sections of intestines from pigs and to implement this method in differential diagnosis of swine diseases with diarrhea in postweaning pigs. The study was conducted on 165 sections of intestines (ileum, caecum and colon) collected from 76 pigs, representing 42 Polish pig farms. The animals included in the analysis suffered from diarrhea, with bloody or grey to brown feces, and were suspected of porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE). Sections of intestines were analyzed for the presence of L. intracellularis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and IHC. Among 165 intestinal samples from pigs with diarrhea, L. intracellularis DNA was detected by PCR in 33 (20.0%) samples. In this group, 30 samples (18.2% of all the samples tested) were also found positive in IHC, while only 3 (1.8%) were IHC-negative. One hundred thirty-two (80.0%) samples were negative in both tests. The PCR- and IHC-positive samples originated from 11 pigs, 4- to 20-week old, from 8 farms. L. intracellularis antigen was visualized by IHC mostly in intestinal crypts and/or in mononuclear cells of the lamina propria). The positive signal in epithelial cells was observed close to the luminal borders, creating typical specifically stained rims around the crypt lumina. The results of the present study further confirm the usefulness of IHC in the detection of L. intracellularis antigen in the intestinal tissues.

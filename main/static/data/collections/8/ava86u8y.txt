Abstract Introduction Recurrent wheezing is one of the leading causes of chronic illness in childhood. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Human Rhinovirus (HRV) infection in the acute attack of wheezy chest which began after a respiratory illness. Methodology The study was conducted on 200 children aged 2 months to 5 years presenting to the emergency department with an acute wheezy episode either for the first time or recurrent wheeze defined as >2 reports of wheezing in the first 3 years of life. All subjects were subjected to a complete history and clinical examination. Chest X-ray was done to all subjects. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from all subjects and the presence of HRV was determined by PCR examination. Results By PCR method, 163 patients (81.5%) were positive for viral infection. Due to viral co-infection, 49.5% (99 cases) were +ve for Respiratory Syncytial virus followed by HRV 43.5% (87 cases). Conclusion HRV was the second common viral infection in children with wheezes. Its prevalence was more in winter with higher incidence of recurrence. Compared to the other respiratory viruses, it had the higher mortality 43.7%.

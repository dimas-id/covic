Treatment options for hydrocephalus include endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). Some ambiguity remains regarding indications, safety, and efficacy for these procedures in different clinical scenarios. The objective of the present study was to pool the available evidence to compare outcomes among patients with hydrocephalus undergoing ETV versus VPS. A systematic search of the literature was conducted via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library through 11/29/2018 to identify studies evaluating failure and complication rates, following ETV or VPS. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using random effects. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochrane Q test and the I2 value. Heterogeneity sources were explored through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Twenty-three studies (five randomized control trials (RCTs) and 18 observational studies) were meta-analyzed. Comparing ETV to VPS, failure rate was not statistically significantly different with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.48, 95%CI (0.85, 2.59) for RCTs and 1.17 (0.89, 1.53) for cohort studies; P-interaction: 0.44. Complication rates were not statistically significantly different between ETV and VPS in RCTs (RR: 1.34, 95%CI: 0.50, 3.59) but were statistically significant for prospective cohort studies (RR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.30, 0.78); P-interaction: 0.07. Length of hospital stay was no different, when comparing ETV and VPS. These results remained unchanged when stratifying by intervention type and when regressing on age when possible. No significant differences in failure rate were observed between ETV and VPS. ETV was found to have lower complication rates than VPS in prospective cohort studies but not in RCTs. Further research is needed to identify the specific patient populations who may be better suited for one intervention versus another.

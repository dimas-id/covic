Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and hospital admissions in children. This study aimed to determine the viral etiology of these infections in children aged < 5 years during three successive epidemic seasons in Bulgaria. Nasopharyngeal and throat specimens were collected from children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia during the 2015/2016, 2016/2017, and 2017/2018 seasons. The viral etiology was determined by individual real-time PCR assays against 11 respiratory viruses. Of the 515 children examined, 402 (78.1%) were positive for at least one virus. Co-infections with two and three viruses were found in 64 (15.9%) of the infected children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the predominant pathogen (37.5%), followed by rhinoviruses (13.8%), metapneumovirus (9.1%), adenoviruses (7%), bocaviruses (7%), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (4.9%), A(H3N2) (4.3%), type B (4.1%), and parainfluenza viruses 1/2/3 (2.9%). RSV-B were more prevalent than RSV-A during the three seasons. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 82.6% and 70.1% of the children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, respectively. Respiratory viruses, especially RSV, are principal pathogens of ALRIs in children aged < 5 years. Diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses using molecular methods may lead to the reduced use of antibiotics and may assist in measures to control infection.

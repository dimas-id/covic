PURPOSE To analyze differences in the application and outcomes of SilverHawk atherectomy (SH) and excimer laser ablation (ELA) in the treatment of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis (ISR) in an unselected cohort of patients treated at a single center. METHODS Between January 2005 and June 2010, 81 consecutive patients (46 men; mean age 69.1 years, range 43-86) underwent directional atherectomy (41 SH, 40 ELA) for femoropopliteal ISR lesions. Data were reviewed retrospectively on procedural outcomes, major adverse events, and 1-year target lesion revascularization (TLR) obtained from medical records and supplemented with telephone calls. The primary endpoint was symptom-driven TLR at 1 year; secondary endpoints were death and amputation. RESULTS ELA was utilized more frequently than SH in longer lesions (210.4±104 vs. 126.2±79.3 mm, respectively; p=0.001), subacute presentation (55% vs. 14.6%, p=0.001), TASC D lesions (47.5% vs. 12.2%), and in patients with more angiographic thrombus (42.5% vs. 4.9%, p=0.001). Final angiographic success (<30% residual narrowing post final treatment) was similar between ELA and SH (92.5% vs. 100%, respectively, p=0.12). Bailout stenting was significantly higher with ELA vs. SH (50.0% vs. 24.4%, p=0.022). At 1 year, TLR had occurred in 48.7% of the ELA patients vs. 31.7% of the SH cases (p=0.171). Regression analysis confirmed that SH was a predictor of TLR at 1 year (hazard ratio 2.679, 95% CI 1.015 to 7.073, p=0.047). CONCLUSION Both SH and ELA continue to have a high TLR rate in treating ISR of the femoral and popliteal arteries. A higher rate of delayed failure is seen with SH and an earlier, steeper loss of TLR-free survival is seen with ELA.

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of 21 March 2020, this epidemic has spread to 179 countries with more than 200 000 confirmed cases and 8578 deaths. The outbreak has put enormous pressure on the medical establishment and even led to exhaustion of medical resources in the most affected areas. Other medical work has been significantly affected in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In order to reduce or avoid cross-infection with COVID-19, many hospitals have taken measures to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatients. For example, emergency surgery can only be guaranteed, and most other surgeries can be postponed. Patients with cancer are one of the groups most affected by the epidemic because of their systematic immunosuppressive state and requirement of frequent admission to hospital. Consequently, specific adjustments for their treatment need to be made to cope with this situation. Therefore, it is of significance to summarize the relevant experience of China in the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection and treatment of patients with cancer during the epidemic.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has changed the lifestyle of citizens of the world. In order for decision makers to manage the viral spread of COVID-19 both in the intra-national and the international frontiers, it is essential to operate based on data-driven assessments. It's crucial to do so rapidly and frequently, since the nature of the viral spread grows exponentially and can burst worldwide again. A fast and accurate health status of individuals globally during a pandemic can save many lives and bring life back to a new normal. Herein, we present a data-driven tool to allow decision-makers to assess the spread of the virus among the world population. Our framework allows health agencies to maximize the throughput of COVID-19 tests among the world population by finding the best test pooling that fits the current SIR-D status of the nation.

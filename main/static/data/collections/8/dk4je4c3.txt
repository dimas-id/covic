Mononuclear leukocytes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and regional lymphoid organs (RLOs) play a critical role in primary BTV replication and subsequent viral dissemination to distant systemic organs. The lesions in animals develop primarily as a result of vascular insult, presumably induced by the activity of viral and/or proinflammatory vasoactive mediators. Hence, the current study was designed in sheep to investigate the responses of potent vasoactivators, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and/or nitric oxide (NO) in mononuclear leukocytes of PBMCs and RLOs. The results show that BTV infection of sheep led to enhanced transcription of iNOS in PBMCs and in particular RLOs. The BTV RNAs and/or antigens were readily demonstrable in these mononuclear leukocytes, suggesting the possible role of BTV in iNOS induction. Moreover, upon in vitro infection of PBMCs with BTV-23, iNOS was up-regulated in time-dependent fashion and correlated with increased NO production. The results from these in vivo and in vitro studies thus suggest iNOS and NO produced by mononuclear leukocytes may potentially contribute to vascular-related pathology of BT.

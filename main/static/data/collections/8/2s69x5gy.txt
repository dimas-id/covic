INTRODUCTION Secure fixation of the mesh in groin hernia repair is essential to avoid mesh dislocation. The fixation, however, is also thought to be a source of chronic postoperative pain. We tested the new self-fixating mesh Parietene progrip vs. traditional suture fixating Lichtenstein repair in a double-blinded randomized study evaluating postoperative pain and the use of analgesics. METHODS Fifty patients were randomized into two groups: Patients of group A (24 patients) were operated with the new self-fixating Parietene progrip mesh without fixation sutures and patients of group B (26 patients) were operated with the traditional Lichtenstein repair. Postoperative course including pain and the use of analgesics were monitored. Patients were reinvestigated after 6 months regarding pain score and the amount of analgesics used during this interval. Primary end point was pain on the first operative day. RESULTS The visual analog scale pain score showed at the first postoperative day a significantly lower level in group A than in group B (mean 17.9 vs. 32.3 mm, p = 0.03). Additionally, the cumulative dose of postoperatively required analgesics was lower in group A than in group B. The operative time in group A was significantly shorter than in group B. Six months after the operation, a trend toward a lower pain score was observed in group A, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS This is the first randomized study to show a beneficial effect of the new self-fixating mesh on pain score. According to our investigations, operative time is reduced, which is a considerable fact with regard to economic aspects as well as the beneficial aspects for the patients. A study with a larger cohort of patients should be conducted to confirm the promising results of this exploratory study.

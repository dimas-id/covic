Abstract The ability of a health information exchange to consolidate information, collected in multiple, disparate information systems, into a single, person-centric health record can provide a comprehensive and longitudinal representation of an individualâ€™s medical history. Shared, longitudinal health records can be leveraged to enhance the delivery of individual clinical care and provide opportunities to improve health outcomes at the population level. This chapter will describe the clinical benefits imparted by the shared health record (SHR) component of the OpenHIE infrastructure. It will also characterize the potential population health benefits of the aggregate level data contained and distributed by the Health Management Information System component of OpenHIE. The chapter will further discuss the implementation of these systems.

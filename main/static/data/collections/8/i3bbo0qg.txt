RNA pseudoknot structural motifs could have implications for a wide range of biological processes of RNAs. In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frameshift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pool or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of propol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. [1] and Jacks et al. [2, 3].

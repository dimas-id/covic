We present here evidence demonstrating that four previously predicted Q-S(G) cleavage sites, encoded by the IBV sequences from nucleotide 15,129 to 15,134, 16,929 to 16,934, 18,492 to 18,497, and 19,506 to 19,511, respectively, can be recognised and transcleaved by the 3C-like proteinase. Five mature products with sizes of approximately 100 kDa, 65 kDa, 63 kDa, 42 kDa and 35 kDa are released from the ORF1b polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase-mediated cleavage at these positions. Meanwhile, expression of plasmids containing only the ORF1b region showed no autocleavage of the polyprotein encoded, suggesting that the 3C-like proteinase may be the sole proteinase involved in processing of the 1b polyprotein. These data may therefore represent a complete processing map of the polyprotein encoded by ORF1b of mRNA1.

Runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) is one of the diseases associated with many detected viruses. In Brazil, there were reports of several enteric disease outbreaks in chickens in which avian nephritis virus (ANV) was detected; however, the role of ANV in the outbreaks and whether the virus was a causative agent of these cases of enteric diseases were not determined. The aim of this study was to isolate ANV in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs (CEE) from the enteric contents of chickens showing signs of RSS. For this purpose, 22 samples of chicken enteric contents that were positive only for ANV were inoculated into 7 and 14-day-old SPF-CEE via the yolk sac route and incubated for 5 d, with a total of 3 passages. Virus isolation was confirmed by the presence of embryo injuries, detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, and visualization of viral particles using electron microscopy. Therefore, the 7-day-old inoculated embryos showed dwarfism, gelatinous consistency, hemorrhage, and edema in the embryos, whereas the 14-day-old did not show any alteration. Viral RNA was detected in the embryos of both ages of inoculation, and the same viral particles were visualized. The embryos from the mock group showed no alteration and were negative for all the tests. The viral cDNA was sequenced, and the molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that the Brazilian isolates are more related with the ANV-1 serotype group; the sequences of these isolates showed a high percentage of nucleotide (86.4 to 94.9%) and amino acid (92.3 to 98.7%) similarity with other sequences from China, Japan, Australia, and the United States that belong to this serotype previously classified group. In this study, we isolated 8 samples of ANV in SPF-CEE from enteric content samples from chickens with RSS. In doing so, we showed the pathological injuries to the embryo caused by the virus and the molecular characterization of a part of the ORF 1b gene of the virus.

The oligomerization state of the rabies virus envelope glycoprotein (G protein) was determined using electron microscopy and sedimentation analysis of detergent solubilized G. Most of the detergents used in this study solubilized G in a 4 S monomeric form. However, when CHAPS was used, G had a sedimentation coefficient of 9 S. This high sedimentation coefficient allowed its further separation from M1 and M2. Using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples, we studied the morphology of G on virus and after detergent extraction. End-on views of G on virus clearly showed triangles consisting of three dots indicating the trimeric nature of native G. End-on views of CHAPS-isolated G showed very similar triangles confirming that, using this detergent, G was solubilized in its native trimeric structure. Electron microscopy also showed that G had a “head” and a “stalk” and provided the basis for a low-resolution model of the glycoprotein structure.

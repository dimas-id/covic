Abstract Aims COVID-19 is a current globalpandemic. However, comprehensive global data analyses for its mortality risk factors are lacking. The current investigation aimed to assess the predictors of death among COVID-19 patients from worldwide open access data. Methods A total of 828 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with definite outcomes were retrospectively identified from open access individual-level worldwide data. Univariate followed by multivariable regression analysis were used to evaluate the association between potential risk factors and mortality. Results Majority of the patients were males 59.1% located in Asia 69.3%. Based on the data, older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.079; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.064-1.095 per year increase), males (aOR, 1.607; 95% CI, 1.002-2.576), patients with hypertension (aOR, 3.576; 95% CI, 1.694-7.548), diabetes mellitus (aOR, 12.234; 95% CI, 4.126-36.272), and patients located in America (aOR, 7.441; 95% CI, 3.546-15.617) were identified as the risk factors of mortality among COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Males, advanced age, hypertension patients, diabetes mellitus patients, and patients located in America were the independent risk factors of death among COVID-19 patients. Extra attention is required to be given to these factors and additional studies on the underlying mechanisms of these effects.

It has been suggested that the dimer initiation site/dimer linkage sequence (DIS/DLS) region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome plays an important role at various stages of the viral life cycle. Recently we found that the duplication of the DIS/DLS region on viral RNA caused the production of partially monomeric RNAs in virions, indicating that this region indeed mediates RNA-RNA interaction. In this report, we followed up on this finding to identify the necessary and sufficient region for RNA dimerization in the virion of HIV-1. The region thus identified was 144 bases in length, extending from the junction of R/U5 and U5/L stem-loops to the end of SL4. The trans-acting responsive element, polyadenylation signal, primer binding site, upper stem-loop of U5/L, and SL2 were not needed for the function of this region. The insertion of this region into the ectopic location of the viral genome did not affect the level of virion production by transfection. However, the resultant virions contained monomerized genomes and showed drastic reductions in infectivity. A reduction was observed especially in the reverse transcription process. An attempt to generate a replication-competent virus with monomerized genome was performed by the long-term culture of mutant virus-infected cells. All recovered viruses were wild-type revertants, indicating a fatal defect of the mutation. These results suggest that genome dimerization or DIS/DLS itself also plays an important role in the early stages of virus infection.

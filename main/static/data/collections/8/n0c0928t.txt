The current COVID-19 pandemic is having detrimental consequences worldwide. The pandemic started to develop strongly by the end of January and beginning of February 2020, first in China with subsequent rapid spread to other countries with new epicenters of the outbreaks concentrated mainly within the 30-50 degrees North latitudinal band (e.g., South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain). Simultaneously, an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing at latitudes around 40 degrees North was observed on global scale, in line with an anomalously strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. This atypical situation could have resulted in favorable meteorological conditions for a quicker spread of the virus over the latitude band detailed above. This possible connection needs further attention in order to understand the meteorological and climatological factors related to the COVID-19 outbreak, and for anticipating the spatio-temporal distribution of possible future pandemics.

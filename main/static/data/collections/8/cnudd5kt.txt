Epigastric herniation occurs through a weakness in the linea alba from the xiphisternum to the umbilicus. Frequently, the sac is empty or contains a small portion of greater omentum. We report the first case of falciform ligament herniation through an epigsatric hernial defect repaired laparoscopically.

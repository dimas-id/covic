OBJECTIVE: To evaluate corneal parameters of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients by corneal topography. METHODS: One hundred two RA patients and 60 control subjects were enrolled. Corneal topography measurements and ophthalmologic findings were examined from all participants' files. RESULTS: Corneal thickness measurements were significantly lower in the RA group (p = 0.025). All values of corneal curvatures (K1, K2, Kmean) in 3 mm, 5 mm, and 7 mm zones were found statistically significantly higher in the RA group compared with the control group. Forty-five RA patients had a dry eye. Disease duration was correlated with dry eye in the RA group. There was a significant correlation between the duration of disease in RA patients and mean corneal curvatures (p 0.012/0.010/0.007, 3/5/7 mm respectively) and central corneal thickness (p 0.025). There is no statistical difference between other topographic measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that RA patients have thinner and steeper corneas compared with control subjects. These parameters change in negative correlation as the duration of the disease increases.Key Pointsâ¢ Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease with systemic involvement.â¢ In rheumatoid arthritis, systemic involvement is affected in the eyes.â¢ When it comes to eye involvement, it comes to mind that it makes the eyes more dryness.â¢ In addition to dryness in the eyes, rheumatoid arthritis makes morphological changes in the cornea.

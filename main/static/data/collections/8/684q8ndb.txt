This paper discusses factors that are important in the natural history of five major feline viral diseases, namely, feline panleucopenia, feline viral rhinotracheitis, feline caliciviral disease, feline leukaemia virus infection, and feline infectious peritonitis. Each disease is considered in terms of the properties and infectivity of the infecting agent, the sources of infectious virus, the mode of transmission of the disease, and the methods by which the agent persists in the cat population. Finally, each disease is discussed in terms of immunity and the role of vaccination. All these factors affect the balance of the virus‚Äêhost relationship and are thus directly relevant to the epizootiology of these diseases and their control.

Abstract The authors warn that, in the context of Yemen, the closure of humanitarian lifesaving programmes and shifting support toward health security, i.e. to support COVID-19 response, at the expense of primary health care support, will undermine existing health system strengthening efforts, worsen the humanitarian crisis and will accentuate the impact of COVID-19. The authors urge the international community and the Government of Yemen to carefully consider a more comprehensive approach to support Yemenâ€™s COVID-19 response while maintaining, and strengthening, essential public health services.

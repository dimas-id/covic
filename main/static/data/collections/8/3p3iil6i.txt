RNA interference is not only very promising in identifying new targets for drug development, siRNA/shRNA themselves may be directly used as therapeutic agents. In inhibiting viral infections by RNA interference, both viral targets and cellular proteins have been evaluated. Most of the early studies in this field had chosen viral targets for RNA interference. However, recent efforts are mainly focusing on cellular proteins for RNA silencing due to the realization that a variety of viral responses substantially minimize siRNA effects. With the application of siRNA approaching, many new cellular targets relevant to HIV infection have been identified. The value of siRNA/shRNA in the treatment of AIDS is largely dependent on better understanding of the biology of HIV replication. Efforts in the identification of cellular processes with the employment of siRNA/shRNA have shed some new lights on our understanding of how HIV infection occurs. Furthermore, the relative specific effects and simplicity of design makes siRNA/shRNA themselves to be favorable drug leads.

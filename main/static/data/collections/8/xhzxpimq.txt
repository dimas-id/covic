The world is going through a transformation. We face a number of tremendous societal challenges for which traditional approaches no longer work. Mankind has gone through big changes before: moving from the agricultural economy to the industrial economy, and more recently, into the ‘experience’ economy and the knowledge economy. This chapter explores the paradigm shifts of the past and the present, to set the scene for the rest of the book. Most of all, facing the current societal challenges will require collaboration between profit and non-profit organizations as well as connected individuals, to create meaningful innovations that will guide people and society through the transformation.

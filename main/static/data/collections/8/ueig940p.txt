ABSTRACT Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a key clinical and research tool in lung transplantation (LTx). However, BAL collection and processing are not standardized across LTx centers. This ISHLT-supported consensus document on BAL standardization aims to clarify definitions and propose common approaches to improve clinical and research practice standards. Nine areas are covered: 1) bronchoscopy procedure and BAL collection, 2) sample handling, 3) sample processing for microbiology, 4) cytology, 5) research and 6) microbiome, 7) sample inventory/tracking, 8) donor bronchoscopy and 9) pediatric considerations. This consensus document aims to harmonize clinical and research practices for BAL collection and processing in LTx. The overarching goal is to enhance standardization and multi-center collaboration within the international LTx community and enable improvement and development of new BAL-based diagnostics.

Background Catheter-directed thrombolysis may prevent post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with ilio-femoral deep venous thrombosis. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected follow-up data to evaluate the results of catheter-directed thrombolysis at our institution. Method Patients admitted for venous thrombolysis were included in the study and their files screened for information regarding results and technical aspects of treatment and patient status on follow-up. A catheter was inserted under imaging guidance into the thrombosed vein. Through the catheter tissue plasminogen activator was administered. Daily catheter-based venographies were performed to monitor progression in thrombus resolution. After thrombolysis flow-limiting stenosis was stented. Patients started wearing compression stockings and were started on oral anticoagulant therapy. Follow-up visits with ultrasound, magnetic resonance venography and clinical assessment were scheduled at six weeks and three, six, 12 and 24 months. Results A total of 48 patients underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis, including 36 female patients. Median age was 28 years. Complete lysis of the thrombus was achieved in 43 cases and partial lysis in two cases and 26 stents were placed. No deaths or life-threatening bleeding events occurred. Thirty-two of the patients who achieved full lysis and were followed up remained patent at follow-up. At 12 months seven patients had symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome. Conclusion Catheter-directed thrombolysis represents a safe and effective alternative to systemic anticoagulative treatment of deep venous thrombosis with rapid resolution of the thrombus and few complications. Long-term patency shows good validity and this study suggests that catheter-directed thrombolysis is effective in preventing post-thrombotic syndrome.

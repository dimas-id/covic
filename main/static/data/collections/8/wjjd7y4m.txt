Several lines of evidence suggest that multiple sclerosis (MS), like other autoimmune diseases, may be triggered by microbial infections. Pathogens associated with development or exacerbation of MS include bacteria, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus-produced enterotoxins that function as superantigens, and viruses of the Herpesviridae (Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus 6) and human endogenous retrovirus families. However, to date, no single pathogen has been accepted as causal agent. In addition, common upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tract infections have also been associated with MS exacerbations. Although evidence of an infectious etiology as cause of MS in humans remains inconclusive, microbial agents may modulate the neuroimmunological system of genetically susceptible individuals. Decoding the epidemiological contribution of different microorganisms to MS, along with their pathogenic mechanisms, may help develop new treatment strategies and prevent relapses.

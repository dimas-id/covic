The safety and effectiveness of systemic and topical medical therapies for ocular disorders are limited due to poor ocular drug uptake, nonspecificity to target tissues, systemic side effects, and poor adherence to therapy. Intravitreal injections can enhance ocular drug delivery, but the need for frequent retreatment and potential injection-related side effects limit the utility of this technique. Sustained-release drug delivery systems have been developed to overcome these limitations; such systems can achieve prolonged therapeutic drug concentrations in ocular target tissues while limiting systemic exposure and side effects and improving patient adherence to therapy. A critical factor in the development of safe and effective drug delivery systems has been the development of biocompatible polymers, which offer the versatility to tailor drug release kinetics for specific drugs and ocular diseases. Ocular implants include nonbiodegradable and biodegradable designs, with the latter offering several advantages. The polymers most commonly used in biodegradable delivery systems are synthetic aliphatic polyesters of the poly-Î±-hydroxy acid family including polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and polylactic-co-glycolic acid. The characteristics of these polymers for medical applications as well as the pharmacological properties, safety, and clinical effectiveness of biodegradable drug implants for the treatment of ocular diseases are reviewed herein.

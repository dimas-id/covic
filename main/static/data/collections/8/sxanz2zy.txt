Advances in the management of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors have given rise to diverse modalities to treat cancer other than cytotoxic chemotherapy, including targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and cellular therapies. Currently, there are over 175 FDA-approved antineoplastic agents in the United States, many with a diverse and profound toxicity profile. Complications of antineoplastic therapy may result in the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission to provide acute symptom management. Accordingly, ICU providers caring for cancer patients should have a working knowledge of the toxicities and complications associated with antineoplastic therapy.

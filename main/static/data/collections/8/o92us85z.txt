The animal model of infection following ventral hernia repair (VHR) has previously been utilized in exploring treatments and innovative therapies, such as implantation of biologic mesh imbedded with various anti-bacterial properties. The rat model has been utilized most commonly, but prior work has failed to recreate an adequately clinically representative model of infection following VHR. Additionally, there is lack of standardization of mesh infection severity across existing literature. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe the creation of a clinically representative VHR infection model utilizing an index procedure where a hernia defect is created followed by a VHR using biologic mesh and subsequent infectious agent inoculation. Additionally, we describe the development of a standardization index to quantify severity of mesh infection: the Mesh Infection Severity Index (MISI).•Our protocol involves two procedures, an index procedure where a hernia model is created, and a subsequent procedure where an infectious inoculant is introduced.•We describe the MISI, a standardization tool we hope will allow for ease of cross-institutional data assessment.•In summary, our protocol not only serves as a more clinically representative animal model, but also includes a novel metric to standardize mesh infection severity.

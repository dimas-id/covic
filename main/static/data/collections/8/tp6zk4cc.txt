INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. Major disruption to healthcare services during the current COVID-19 pandemic will last even after its peak. Sexual and reproductive health (SRH), specially contraception, needs to be understood as an essential service. AREAS COVERED: This paper is a narrative review. Data from PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and websites of scientific societies were screened during the months of April and May 2020. It addresses the main aspects related to contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special emphasis on family planning services, extended use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, drug interactions, and thromboembolism risk. We also specified some issues focused on the Brazilian reality. EXPERT OPINION: Ensuring proper contraception use in the COVID-19 time is very important. We encourage women, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the society to consider SRH services as priority.

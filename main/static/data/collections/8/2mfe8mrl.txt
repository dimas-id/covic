PURPOSE The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many healthcare organizations to divert efforts and resources to emergent patient care, delaying many elective oncological surgeries. We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016. Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP. RESULTS We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP. These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.

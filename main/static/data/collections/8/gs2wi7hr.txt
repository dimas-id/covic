A novel bioinspired metaheuristic is proposed in this work, simulating how the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people. From an initial individual (the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates, creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either. Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance.

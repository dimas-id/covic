With the outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID-19), people's health and existing economies on a global scale are seriously threatened. Currently, most of the countries all over the world are studying extensively to better understand the antimalarial chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for therapeutic purposes due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, CQ and HCQ can have serious side effects, from psychiatric effects to sudden death. Therefore, a faster and more effective detection method is needed to monitor drug concentrations. In this review, a large study was conducted on the detection techniques and quantitative determination methods of CQ and its related metabolites. In this review, chromatography, electrophoresis, electroanalytical, spectroscopic, and immunological methods for CQ and related metabolites are discussed extensively. It is hoped that a better understanding of the CQ used for therapeutic purposes in the COVID-19 outbreak will be provided.

Background: Despite a paucity of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected COVID-19. Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods: We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc [包500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc [包550 (if QRS [包120 ms) and b) increased QTc of [包60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Results: Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62{+/-}17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448{+/-}29 ms and increased to 459{+/-}36ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18{+/-}43 ms vs -0.2{+/-}28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were not associated with critical QTc prolongation (p>0.14). Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with many-fold greater prolongation with the combination vs. azithromycin alone (17{+/-}39 vs. 0.5{+/-}40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions: Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc interval prolongation, and traditional risk indices failed to flag these patients. With the drug combination, QTc prolongation was several-fold higher compared to azithromycin alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients with these drugs should be carefully assessed prior to use.

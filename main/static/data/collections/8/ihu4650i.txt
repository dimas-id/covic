Severe malaria (SM) caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection has been associated with life-threatening anemia, metabolic acidosis, cerebral malaria and multiorgan dysfunction. It may lead to death if not treated promptly. RNASE 3 has been linked to Pf growth inhibition and its polymorphisms found associated with SM and cerebral malaria in African populations. This study aimed to assess the association of RNASE 3 polymorphisms with SM in an Indian population. RNASE 3 gene and flanking regions were amplified followed by direct DNA sequencing in 151 Indian patients who visited Wenlock District Government Hospital, Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between patients with SM (n=47) and uncomplicated malaria (UM; n=104). Homozygous mutant genotype was only found for rs2233860 polymorphism (<1% frequency). No significant genetic associations were found for RNASE 3 polymorphism genotypes and alleles in Indian SM patients. C-G-G haplotype of rs2233859, rs2073342 and rs2233860 polymorphisms was correlated significantly with SM patients (OR=3.03; p<0.001). Overall, these results suggest that RNASE 3 gene plays a role in susceptibility to severe malaria.

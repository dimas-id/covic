Cass Sunstein coined the term 'probability neglect' to characterize the cognitive bias of disregarding probability when assessing low-probability but high-impact threats He also related this cognitive bias to terrorism risk, andapplied the concept to the COVID-19 pandemic In this article, I show that such claims are not justified I argue that an alternative hypothesis could be that people who downplay the epidemiological threat and do not take precautionary measures suffer from exponential-growth bias I also show that probability theory, and thus the concept of probability neglect, cannot be easily applied to real-world problems, such as terrorist attacks or pandemics, occurring in a non-ergodic, uncertain environment

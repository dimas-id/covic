Abstract A 3-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of “lethargy” and was found to have ptosis with eventual respiratory failure and need for emergent intubation. There is a broad differential for a patient with respiratory failure, and careful physical examination and history are imperative to reduce morbidity and prevent mortality. After further evaluation and workup, the diagnosis is ultimately revealed.

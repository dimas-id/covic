AIMS Stroke endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) in patients with large proximal vessel occlusion improves clinical outcomes. We present the New Zealand ECR experience. METHODS All New Zealand patients treated with ECR since 2011 were included. Patients were considered eligible if they were independent prior to stroke and had proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. RESULTS Three hundred and twelve patients [136 women, mean (SD) age of 64 (17) years] from 11 district health boards have been treated between March 2011 and April 2018. There were 260 (83%) patients with anterior and 52 (17%) with posterior circulation arterial occlusion. One hundred and ninety-three (62%) patients were pre-treated with intravenous alteplase. The median time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 210 (range 65-985) minutes. Complete or near-complete recanalisation (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores of 3 or 2b) was achieved in 260 of 300 (87%) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score improved from a median of 18 at baseline to 7 at 24 hours. By day 90, 55% of the anterior circulation patients and 40% of the posterior circulation patients were living independently at home. Mortality rates were 20% for anterior circulation patients and 30% for the posterior circulation patients. CONCLUSIONS This study has shown that stroke endovascular clot retrieval is being provided safely and effectively in New Zealand. However, there remain discrepancies in service provision, and ongoing regional, inter-regional and inter-sector collaboration is essential to implement comprehensive and equitable ECR services across the country.

Abdominal wall hernias are prevalent in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Obturator hernias, first described by Arnaud de Ronsil in 1724, are an uncommon type of hernia where intra-abdominal contents protrude through the obturator foramen. The following case highlights a rare presentation of bilateral obturator hernias with right femoral and inguinal hernia in an 82-year-old woman post-PD. This patient presented with 5 months of bilateral thigh pain and swelling and was found to only have a right-sided obturator hernia on computer tomography (CT) scan. Intraoperatively, bilateral obturator hernias were found along with right inguinal and femoral hernias, which were all repaired laparoscopically with polypropylene mesh. Postoperatively, the patient developed a self-limiting port site hematoma and resumed PD 1 month post-surgery. Due to the high morbidity and mortality from obturator hernias, prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative. Compared with open hernia repair, laparoscopic hernia repairs are associated with quicker return to usual activities and less persisting pain and numbness. This case portrays that laparoscopic approach to bilateral obturator hernias can be considered in patients post-PD.

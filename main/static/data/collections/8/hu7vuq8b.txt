Advancements in modern technology bring many evolutions in minimally invasive surgery such as robot assisted approaches. Because of complete resection is so important in thymectomy operations, they became a new era for robotic surgery as a result of its superiorities (intuitive movements, tremor filtration, more degrees of manipulative freedom, motion scaling, and high-definition stereoscopic vision).

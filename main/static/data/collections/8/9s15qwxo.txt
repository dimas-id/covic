Abstract Natural disasters are the result of a hazard overwhelming highly vulnerable community, often resulting in mortality and morbidity. Over the past decade, over 300 natural disasters occur yearly around the world affecting millions and cost billions. The disaster cycle is a framework used to base a coordinated plan to respond, recover, prevent, and prepare for a disaster. Access to clean water, proper sanitation, food/nutrition, shelter, and the threat of communicable diseases are concerns that have the potential to be detrimental to the management of a natural disaster, slowing the recovery process.

A teriflunomide-treated multiple sclerosis patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was hospitalized and recovered in 15 days. The immunophenotyping analysis of peripheral blood cells was performed in two time points: the first was 1 month before (pre-infection) while the second was during COVID-19 pneumonia (infection). At the infection time point, no differences in the percentages of immune activation and immunesenescence of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were observed compared to the pre-infection time point. Our evaluation seems to confirm that teriflunomide control T-cells immune activation and immunosenescence suggesting that teriflunomide should not be discontinued in MS patients with an active COVID-19 pneumonia.

PURPOSE Laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy is a widely applied technique in the operative treatment of diverticular disease. Treatment guidelines recommend operation of complicated diverticulitis and after recurrent attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis. These guidelines have become subject to controversy. The objective of this study was to assess disease-related quality of life after laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively. Patients filled in a form describing their quality of life. All patients undergoing elective operation for diverticular disease between 1999 and 2006 at the Department of Surgery of the Uster Hospital, a regional medical center in Switzerland were included. The measurement tool we used is the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test or unpaired t-tests were applied to determine statistical significance of differences observed. RESULTS A total of 130 patients were included and 120 questionnaires were available for analysis. Mean follow-up was 40 months. Of the total, 48% reported a GIQLI >100 before the operation, which rose to 83% after the operation (p < 0.0001). Mean GIQLI was 95 before and 114 after the operation (p < 0.0001). Female patients reported lower GIQLI rates. Overall, 96% were satisfied with the operation. CONCLUSIONS The results in this study population show that in a majority of patients who underwent elective laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy for recurrent diverticulitis gastrointestinal quality of life improved with the operation.

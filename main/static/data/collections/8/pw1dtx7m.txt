Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become the preferred technology for representing, sharing and adding knowledge to modern AI applications. While KGs have become a mainstream technology, the RDF/SPARQL-centric toolset for operating with them at scale is heterogeneous, difficult to integrate and only covers a subset of the operations that are commonly needed in data science applications. In this paper, we present KGTK, a data science-centric toolkit to represent, create, transform, enhance and analyze KGs. KGTK represents graphs in tables and leverages popular libraries developed for data science applications, enabling a wide audience of developers to easily construct knowledge graph pipelines for their applications. We illustrate KGTK with real-world scenarios in which we have used KGTK to integrate and manipulate large KGs, such as Wikidata, DBpedia and ConceptNet, in our own work.

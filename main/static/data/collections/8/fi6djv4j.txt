In recent months, there has been a wealth of promising clinical data suggesting that a more effective treatment regimen, and potentially a cure, for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is close at hand. Leading this push are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), currently comprising inhibitors that target the HCV protease NS3, the viral polymerase NS5B, and the non-structural protein NS5A. In combination with one another, along with the traditional standard-of-care ribavirin and PEGylated-IFNα, these compounds have proven to afford tremendous efficacy to treatment-naíve patients, as well as to prior non-responders. Nevertheless, by targeting viral components, the possibility of selecting for breakthrough and treatment-resistant virus strains remains a concern. Host-targeting antivirals are a distinct class of anti-HCV compounds that is emerging as a complementary set of tools to combat the disease. Cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitors are one such group in this category. In contrast to DAAs, Cyp inhibitors target a host protein, CypA, and have also demonstrated remarkable antiviral efficiency in clinical trials, without the generation of viral escape mutants. This review serves to summarize the current literature on Cyps and their relation to the HCV viral life cycle, as well as other viruses.

Incorporation of liver transplant techniques in hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery has created an opportunity for the resection of locally advanced hepatic tumors formerly considered unresectable. A 73-year-old woman presented with cholangiocarcinoma involving inferior vena cava, all three hepatic veins, and right anterior portal pedicle, initially deemed nonoperative. This case demonstrates the first combined application of associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy and ex vivo resection to perform an R0. For diseases dependent upon resection, surgical advances and innovations expand the spectrum of interventions through interdisciplinary techniques.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2) has been reported to be involved in cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload is still elusive. We aimed to examine the role of sFRP2 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by aortic banding (AB), the expression of sFRP2 was downregulated in the hypertrophic ventricle. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) was injected through the tail vein to overexpress sFRP2 in the mouse myocardium. Overexpression of sFRP2 alleviated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as identified by the reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, heart weight/body weight ratio, and left ventricular (LV) collagen ratio. Additionally, sFRP2 decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by pressure overload. Western blot showed that sFRP2 prevented the expression of active β-catenin. The Wnt/β-catenin agonist LiCl (1 mmol/kg) abolished the inhibitory effects of sFRP2 on cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased cross-sectional area and LV collagen ratio and the deterioration of echocardiographic data. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that decreased sFRP2 levels were observed in failing mouse hearts. Overexpression of sFRP2 attenuated myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis induced by hypertrophic stimuli by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We revealed that sFRP2 may be a promising therapeutic target for the development of cardiac remodeling.

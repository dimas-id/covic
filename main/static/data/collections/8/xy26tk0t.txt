Influenza is a highly contagious, acute respiratory illness afflicting humans. Although influenza epidemics occur frequently, their severity varies (1). Not until 1933, when the first human influenza virus was isolated, was it possible to define with certainty which pandemics were caused by influenza viruses. In general, influenza A viruses are more pathogenic than are influenza B viruses. Influenza A virus is a zoonotic infection, and more than 100 types of influenza A viruses infect most species of birds, pigs, horses, dogs, and seals. It is believed that the 1918â€“1919 pandemic originated from a virulent strain of H1N1 from pigs and birds.

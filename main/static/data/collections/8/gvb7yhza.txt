Until now, there have been no relatively easy methods to measure the mass and mass distributions of nanoparticles/viruses. In this work, we report the first set of measurements of mass and mass distributions for nanoparticles/viruses using a novel mass spectrometry technology. In the past, mass spectrometry was typically used to measure the mass of a particle or molecule with a mass less than 1,000,000 Da. We developed cell mass spectrometry that can measure the mass of a cell or a microparticle. Nevertheless, there is a gap for mass measurement methods in the mass region of a nanoparticle or virus (1 MDa to 1 GDa). Here, we developed a nanoparticle/virus mass spectrometry technique to make rapid and accurate mass and mass distribution measurements of nanoparticles/viruses. This technique should be valuable for the quality control of nanoparticle production and the identification of various viruses. In the future, this method can also serve to monitor drug delivery when nanoparticles are used as carriers. Furthermore, it may be possible to measure the degree of infection by measuring the number of viruses in specific cells or in plasma.

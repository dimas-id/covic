PURPOSE: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss in diabetics. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment option for DME, although the injections are costly and require frequent visits which increases the risk for unintended treatment lapses. The aim of this study is to characterize the effects of an unintended treatment lapse in patients with DME undergoing anti-VEGF therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative case series. METHODS: This retrospective chart review compared patients seen in a multicenter institutional practice with DME exhibiting an un-intended minimum three-month lapse in anti-VEGF treatment, with a control group of DME patients receiving regular anti-VEGF treatment without lapses. The primary outcome was difference in central subfield thickness (CST) between the control group and the treatment lapse group at 6 months following treatment lapse. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were evaluated, 82 patients in the treatment lapse group and 82 patients in the control group. The average age was 65 years, and the average lapse in treatment was 6.2 ± 3.5 months (range 3-24 months). Comparison of data between the lapse and control groups revealed no significant differences in CST respectively [(359.9±108.3 μm), (335.4±94.6 μM)], p=0.066 or in visual acuity (VA) respectively [(66.5±14.3), (68.9±14.5)], p=0.136. Limitations included a relatively small sample size, retrospective nature, and only a single lapse being evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: An un-intended, single, relatively short-term lapse in anti-VEGF treatment in patients with DME did not appear to result in significant anatomic or visual compromise upon resumption of regular follow-up and treatment.

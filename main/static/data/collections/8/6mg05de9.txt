In a series of six-month surveys carried out in Kalgoorlie and Alice Springs Hospitals, rotavirus was infrequently detected both in Aboriginal and in non-Aboriginal neonates. Coronavirus-like particles were also detected infrequently, but they were found more often in Aboriginal than in non-Aboriginal neonates. The surveys did not detect any 28-nm virus-like particles.

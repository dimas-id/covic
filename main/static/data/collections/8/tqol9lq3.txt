OBJECTIVE To describe a technique for blind thoracoscopic-assisted double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) placement for achieving one-lung ventilation (OLV) using 3 different DLT designs and to evaluate whether thoracic auscultation could reliably confirm OLV in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized study. ANIMALS Mature female hound dogs (n = 6). METHODS Physical examination, baseline blood work and thoracic radiography confirmed the absence of preexisting disease in all dogs. Thoracoscopic observation was established through a subxiphoid portal and used for evaluation of differential lung lobe ventilation. Each dog was sequentially intubated using 1 of 3 DLT designs in random order; Robertshaw left-sided tube (RS-L), Carlens left-sided tube (C-L), Dr. White right-sided tube (DW-R). Incidence of initial and overall (after a maximum of 3 DLT manipulations) correct and complete OLV (CC-OLV) was recorded. After each blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement, bronchoscopic evaluation was performed to document correct DLT position. RESULT Blind DLT placement achieved overall CC-OLV in all dogs using RS-L, 66% using C-L, and all using DW-R. Successful initial left-sided OLV (L-OLV) was statistically more likely when RS-L DLTs were used compared to C-L or DW-R. Of cases where overall CC-OLV was achieved, correct DLT position was present in only 44% of intubations. CONCLUSIONS Blind DLT placement produced successful CC-OLV in all dogs using at least one DLT design evaluated. Use of thoracoscopic assistance may obviate the need for bronchoscopic observation during DLT placement in dogs. However, bronchoscopic observation may still refine DLT positioning in dogs after blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement.

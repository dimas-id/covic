The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) endomembrane is a central site for protein synthesis. Perturbation of ER homeostasis can result in an accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER lumen, causing ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). In humans, ER stress and UPR are closely associated with a vast number of diseases, including viral diseases. In plants, two arms that govern the UPR signaling network have been described: one that contains two ER membraneâ€“associated transcription factors (bZIP17 and bZIP28) and the other that encompasses a dual protein kinase (RNA-splicing factor IRE1) and its target RNA (bZIP60). Although early studies mainly focus on the essential roles of the UPR in abiotic stresses, the significance of UPR in plant diseases caused by virus infections has recently drawn much attention. This chapter summarizes the latest scenario of ER stress and UPR in virus-infected plant cells, highlights the emerging roles of the IRE1 pathway in virus infections, and outlines exciting future directions to spark more research interest in the UPR field in plants.

Techniques used for the diagnostic of upper and lower respiratory tract viral infections Techniques used for the diagnostic of upper and lower respiratory tract viral infections include conventional procedures and the new molecular tools. Serology has no interest for diagnosis. Antigen detection can be carried out by simple, easy and cheap tools. They are available at hospital and in community practice as well for the detection of influenza virus, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. To look for viruses which are non detectable by antigen detection assays (rhinovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, polyomavirus...) or in severe or complicated respiratory lower infections, the use of molecular tools is highly indicated.

Management of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide challenge - in particular in developing countries where the risk of saturation of health facilities and intensive care beds must be minimized. The first case of COVID-19 was declared in Morocco on 2 March 2020, after which a panel of Moroccan experts, consisting of medical oncologists from universities and regional and private oncology centers, was promptly assembled to conduct a group reflection on cancer patient's management. The main objective is to protect the immunocompromised population from the risk of COVID-19, while maintaining an adequate management of cancer, which can quickly compromise their prognosis. Recommendations are provided according to each clinical situation: patients undergoing treatment, new cases, hospitalized patients, palliative care and surveillance.

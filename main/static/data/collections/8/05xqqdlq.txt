OBJECTIVE We review the radiographic and CT findings in the lungs of 12 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in an effort to describe the most common radiologic findings for this disease. CONCLUSION The most common radiographic findings of SARS patients at presentation are unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral or bilateral areas of consolidation. In hospitalized SARS patients, the abnormalities tend to progress to bilateral air-space consolidation. CT may reveal parenchymal disease in patients whose radiographs show normal results.

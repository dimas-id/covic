Objective: Total 186 biologically important phenylpropanoids and polyketides compounds from different Indian medicinal plants and dietary sources were screened to filter potential compounds that bind at the active site of the therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Method: The molecular docking studies were carried out by using the Autodock Vina. The in silico ADMET and drug-likeness properties of the compounds were predicted from SwissADME server. Result: The molecular docking study of the 186 compounds with the therapeutic target proteins (Mpro, PLpro, RdRp, SGp and ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2 resulted 40 compounds that bind at the active site with dock score above -8.0 kcal/mol. Conclusion: Based on the in silico ADMET study and drug-likeness prediction of 40 compounds, we proposed petunidin, baicalein, cyanidin, 7-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid among the 186 biologically important phenylpropanoids and polyketides as potential lead compounds, which can further be investigated pharmacologically and clinically to formulate therapeutic approaches for the COVID-19.

Adhesion to biological tissues is a challenge especially when the adhesive is in contact with physiological fluids. Abdominal hernia is a disease that often requires the implantation of a mesh within the abdominal wall. To minimize pain and postsurgical complications, gluing the mesh appears to be a convenient method. For this purpose, a bioadhesive system based on solutions of chitosan and modified starch (oxidized maltodextrin) has been developed. Mixtures of these polysaccharides form either viscoelastic solutions or hydrogels, depending on various experimental parameters (chitosan concentration, starch degree of oxidation, molar ratio between amine and aldehyde functions, pH, etc.). An adhesion test was developed to assess the adherence of such systems under conditions similar to the intended use. The rheological behavior of each formulation was correlated to its adherence, and it was found that optimum adhesion is obtained for systems exhibiting an intermediate behavior between the viscoelastic solution and the gel.

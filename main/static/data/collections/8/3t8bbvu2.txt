PURPOSE To obtain a complete response with thermal ablation, the margin and entire tumor volume must be treated. Real-time ultrasound visualization is limited during ablation due to gas production. This study assesses the feasibility of fusing volumetric contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), obtained immediately prior to microwave ablation, with real-time CEUS during and following ablation in a machine-perfused porcine liver. METHODS Ten, 3-4 cm microwave ablations were performed in five explanted perfused livers. Prior to ablation, microbubbles were injected into the vasculature while an ultrasound sweep across the liver captured a volumetric image during maximum enhancement. This volumetric image was then fused to overlay the real-time ultrasound imaging. Since the perfused livers did not have tumors, a spherical marker circumscribing a target volume was placed on the images. Approximatively, 75% of the total intended circumscribed spherical volume was ablated. Following ablation, a second bolus injection of ultrasound contrast was administered demonstrating continued enhancement of the intentionally non-ablated 25%. A second volumetric image of the post-ablation CEUS was then fused to overlay the real-time ultrasound images for guidance during ablation of the remaining enhancing volume. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in 100% of the cases. The pre- and then the post-ablation CEUS volume was fused with real-time imaging during antenna placement for initial and subsequent ablation. CONCLUSION CEUS-CEUS fusion during thermal ablation is feasible and greatly improves the workflow. The approach may augment the use of dynamic CEUS for guidance, improving antenna placement, and aiding in the identification and ablation of initial and residual enhancing tissue.

This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the use of imaging to guide stroke treatment. Brain imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of stroke and identification of the mechanism of stroke, which is relevant to acute treatment, prognosis, and secondary prevention. The chief potential modalities are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Currently, most imaging occurs in hospital but mobile stroke units have expanded CT brain imaging into the prehospital field. The proven therapies for ischemic stroke are based on achieving reperfusion and the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials have now firmly established a need for imaging selection based on estimated ischemic core volume to guide reperfusion decisions in patients beyond 6 h of stroke onset. However, data also indicate that estimated ischemic core volume, in conjunction with patient factors and expected time delay to reperfusion, forms one of the most useful prognostic assessments that could alter decision-making for patients within 6 h. Current trials are also investigating agents that aim to achieve neuroprotection, reduction in edema or prevention of hemorrhagic transformation. Imaging may play a role in identifying patients likely to benefit from this next generation of interventions for stroke patients.

In this work we introduce a framework, based on three-way decision (TWD) and the trisecting-acting-outcome model, to handle uncertainty in Machine Learning (ML). We distinguish between handling uncertainty affecting the input of ML models, when TWD is used to identify and properly take into account the uncertain instances; and handling the uncertainty lying in the output, where TWD is used to allow the ML model to abstain. We then present a narrative review of the state of the art of applications of TWD in regard to the different areas of concern identified by the framework, and in so doing, we will highlight both the points of strength of the three-way methodology, and the opportunities for further research.

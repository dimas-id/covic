Infected necrosis is a potentially fatal complication of necrotizing pancreatitis. Open surgical debridement is the mainstay management of infected pancreatic necrosis. Over the last decade minimally invasive techniques have been increasingly used for the treatment of infected pancreatic necrosis and their results are encouraging. However, the optimal technique of minimal access necrosectomy and the timing of intervention have not been established yet. Patients with septic complications of acute pancreatitis represent a challenging group which requires individualized management often involving numerous techniques. We report a case of a 52-year-old patient in whom 3 minimally invasive techniques were needed for complete recovery.

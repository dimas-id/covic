Thoracal sympatectomy for hyperhidrosis and vasospastic vascular diseases is a rare method of surgical treatment. Three patients (1 male, 2 female; mean age 27.6; between 25 and 30) with palmar hyperhidrosis and/or axillary and dorsal hyperhidrosis who underwent single port thoracoscopic sympatectomy were analysed for age, sex, time of operation room, intraoperative and postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Mean operating room time was 70 min (between 30 and 120 min). Mean length of hospital stay was 1 day. No postoperative complications were noted. Single incision laparoscopic surgery for hyperhidrosis is a safe method of treatment and an alternative to laparoscopy.

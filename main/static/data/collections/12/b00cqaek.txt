Background and Objective Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) for the management of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions is gaining popularity. Our aim was to analyze and present the clinical outcomes of EES for the management of these lesions in a community hospital setting. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 56 patients with sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions who underwent EES between 2010 and 2018. Results There was male predominance (53.6%) with a mean age of 54.9 ± 13.7 years. Lesions were 45 pituitary adenomas, 5 meningiomas, 3 metastatic, 1 craniopharyngioma, 1 Rathke cyst, and 1 mucocele. Gross total excision was achieved in 57.1%, subtotal excision occurred in 37.5%, and decompression and biopsy were achieved in 5.4% patients. Postoperative vision normalized or improved in 27 patients (86.1%) and was stable in 4 patients (13.9%). Recovery of a preexisting hormonal deficit occurred in 13 (23.2%) patients, and a new hormonal deficit occurred in 9 patients (16.1%). The mean hospital stay was 6.1 ± 4.9 days. Postoperative complications included cerebrospinal fluid leak in 8 patients (14.3%). Four patients (7.1%) had meningitis. Diabetes insipidus was present in 19 patients (33.9%), and postoperative intracranial hematoma requiring evacuation was necessary in 2 patients (3.6%). The mean follow-up duration was 47.5 ± 25.8 months. Lesion progression or recurrence requiring redo surgery occurred in 5 patients (8.9%). Regarding the learning curve, the postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, meningitis, new hormonal deficits, and diabetes insipidus decreased in the second half of the patients. Conclusions EES provides an effective and safe surgical option with low morbidity and mortality for the treatment of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions in a community hospital setting.

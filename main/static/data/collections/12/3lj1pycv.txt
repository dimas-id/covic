The diagnosis of pulmonary infection caused by Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, and different species of Legionella, is often long and challenging although they are the major etiologic agents of pneumonia. For this reason, the treatment of these infections remains probabilistic. Advances in new diagnostic techniques, such as PCR sequencing, show the relative predominance of atypical organisms and serves to identify emerging pathogenic agents. Moreover, these techniques should clarify the correlation between common and atypical pathogens.

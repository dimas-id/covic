This study presents the pathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings associated with the extra-intestinal detection of canine kobuvirus (CaKV) in a 5-month-old Chihuahua puppy, that had a clinical history of bloody-tinged feces. Principal pathological findings were interstitial pneumonia, necrotizing bronchitis, and parvovirus-induced enteritis. Molecular diagnostic methods identified CaKV within the cerebellum, cerebrum, lung, tonsil, and liver. CaKV and rotavirus were not identified within the feces and intestine. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays detected antigens of CDV and CAdV-1 in the lungs. These results confirmed the extra-intestinal detection of CaKV in this puppy and represent the first extra-intestinal detection of CaKV in a dog.

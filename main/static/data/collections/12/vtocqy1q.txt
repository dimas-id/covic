With the use of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy and robotics, lung lesions can be diagnosed and resected during one surgical procedure. Global positioning system technology allows surgeons to identify and mark a thoracic tumor, and then robotics technology allows them to perform minimally invasive resection and cancer staging procedures. Nurses on the perioperative robotics team must consider the logistics of providing safe and competent care when performing combined procedures during one surgical encounter. Instrumentation, OR organization and room setup, and patient positioning are important factors to consider to complete the procedure systematically and efficiently. This revolutionary concept of combining navigational bronchoscopy with robotics requires a team of dedicated nurses to facilitate the sequence of events essential for providing optimal patient outcomes in highly advanced surgical procedures.

One of the aims of the new technologies and techniques in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is to achieve a surgery without or with minimal visible scars. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) might be considered to be a paradigm of this development but it has not yet been possible to implement this universally. Nevertheless, the resultant innovation of research into NOTES has enabled "bridge technologies" to be introduced that allow MIS to be developed with the required standards of efficiency and safety. The aim of this paper is to review the concept of single incision surgery and to classify the available tools for its development and implementation.

Anti-MDA5 antibodies have been strongly associated with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) in dermatomyositis (DM) patients, especially in the clinically amyopathic subset (CADM). We present a case of anti-MDA5 antibody-associated RP-ILD in a patient with arthritis but with no other clinical signs suggestive of DM or CADM successfully treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and corticoids. A review of the literature was also done. Despite its rarity, anti-MDA5 antibody-associated ILD should be suspected in cases of RP-ILD even without other signs of DM or CADM as prompt and aggressive treatment could improve prognosis.

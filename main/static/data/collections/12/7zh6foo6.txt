Due to a combination of increasing indications for MR imaging, increased MRI accessibility, and extensive global armed conflict over the last few decades, an increasing number of patients now and in the future will present with retained metallic ballistic debris of unknown composition.

In this article, we review the current literature pertaining to the MRI safety of retained ballistic materials and present the process we use to safely image these patients.

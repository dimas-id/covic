OBJECTIVES: This review fills the paucity of information on K. pneumoniae as a nosocomial pathogen by providing pooled data on epidemiological risk factors, resistant trends and profiles and resistant and virulent genes of this organism in Asia. METHODS: Exhaustive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar for most studies addressing the prevalence, risk factors, drug resistant-mediated genes and/or virulent factors of K. pneumoniae in Asia. Data extracted for meta-analysis were analyzed using comprehensive meta-analysis version 3. Trends data for the isolation rate and resistance rates were entered into Excel spread sheet and the results were presented in graphs. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of drug resistance in K. pneumoniae were; amikacin (40.8%) [95% CI 31.9–50.4], aztreonam (73.3%) [95% CI 59.9–83.4], ceftazidime (75.7%) [95% CI 65.4–83.6], ciprofloxacin (59.8%) [95% CI 48.6–70.1], colistin (2.9%) [95% CI 1.8–4.4], cefotaxime (79.2%) [95% CI 68.0–87.2], cefepime (72.6) [95% CI 57.7–83.8] and imipenem (65.6%) [95% CI 30.8–89.0]. TEM (39.5%) [95% CI 15.4–70.1], SHV-11 (41.8%) [95% CI 16.2–72.6] and KPC-2 (14.6%) [95% CI 6.0–31.4] were some of the resistance mediated genes observed in this study. The most virulent factors utilized by K. pneumoniae are; hypermucoviscous phenotype and mucoviscosity-related genes, genes for biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide, iron uptake and transport genes and finally, adhesive genes. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that, antimicrobial resistant in K. pneumoniae is a clear and present danger in Asia which needs strong surveillance to curb this menace. It is very important for public healthcare departments to monitor and report changes in antimicrobial-resistant isolates.

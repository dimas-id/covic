Ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum is a non-invasive tool that allows reliable estimation of gastric contents. We performed this prospective cohort study in non-elective paediatric surgery to assess whether gastric ultrasound may help to determine the best anaesthetic induction technique, whether rapid sequence or routine. The primary outcome was the reduction of inappropriate induction technique. A pre-operative clinical assessment was performed by the attending anaesthetist who made a provisional plan for induction. Gastric ultrasound was performed in the semirecumbent and right lateral decubitus positions for a qualitative assessment of gastric contents, using a 0-2 grading scale. A final induction plan was made based on this assessment. Immediately after tracheal intubation, gastric contents were suctioned through a multi-orifice nasogastric tube; these were defined as above risk threshold for regurgitation and aspiration if there was clear fluid > 0.8 ml.kg-1 , and/or the presence of thick fluid and/or solid particles. Gastric ultrasound was feasible in 130 out of 143 (90%) of children, and led to a change in the planned induction technique in 67 patients: 30 from routine to rapid sequence, and 37 from rapid sequence to routine. An appropriate induction technique was therefore performed in 85% of children, vs. 49% planned after pre-operative clinical assessment alone (p < 0.00001). Our results suggest that gastric ultrasound is a useful guide to the general anaesthetic induction technique with respect to the risk of pulmonary aspiration, in comparison with pre-operative clinical assessment alone.

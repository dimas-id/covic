OBJECTIVES This study aims to analyze the surgeons' hand spatial configuration during the use of two different instrument handles for laparoscopy, by obtaining information from the data glove CyberGlove®, and establishing existing risk levels for wrist disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty surgeons participated in this study and were distributed into three groups (novices, intermediate and experts). Each subject carried out suturing and dissection tasks on a physical simulator, using axial-handled or ring-handled instruments, respectively. Hand and wrist positions were registered by the CyberGlove® and a modified RULA method was applied to establish appropriate risk levels for wrist disorders. RESULTS We found statistically significant differences in seven of the eleven glove sensors when comparing both tasks. RULA method showed that all subjects, with the exception of the experts using an axial-handled instrument, assume a prejudicial wrist posture during the practice of suturing and dissection tasks on the simulator. CONCLUSIONS Data glove CyberGlove® allows for the distinction between two laparoscopic exercises performed with different instruments. Also, laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing when performed with an axial-handled needle holder entails a more ergonomic posture for the wrist joint. Previous minimally invasive surgical experience is a positive influencing factor on the surgeons' wrist postures during laparoscopy.

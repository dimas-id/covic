The different appearances of pneumonia such as ill-defined nodules, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations can be easily detected and differentiated with MRI. Since very small nodules and calcifications are extremely challenging due to rather thick slices and loss of signal, MRI is highly recommended as a follow-up tool, to avoid repetitive investigations using ionizing radiation. With the sensitivity of T2-weighted sequences and the potential of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, important differential diagnostic considerations can be provided. Additionally, developing complications, such as pericardial or pleural effusions, empyema or lung abscess, are easily recognized. Current and future studies are to demonstrate that MRI is well suited as a monitoring and follow-up tool during and after therapy and compares favorably with CT or other imaging methods regarding sensitivity and specificity.

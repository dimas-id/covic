INTRODUCTION: Patients who become severely ill from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) have a high likelihood of needing prolonged intubation, making tracheostomy a likely consideration. The infectious nature of COVID‐19 poses an additional risk of transmission to healthcare workers that should be taken into consideration. METHODS: We explore current literature and recommendations for tracheostomy in patients with COVID‐19 and look back at previous data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS‐CoV‐1), the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. RESULTS: Given the severity and clinical uncertainty of patients with COVID‐19 and the increased risk of transmission to clinicians, careful consideration should be taken prior to performing tracheostomy. If tracheostomy is performed, we recommend a bedside approach to limit exposure time and number of exposed personnel. Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure. CONCLUSION: Thorough preprocedural planning, use of experienced personnel, enhanced personal protective equipment where available, and a thoughtful anesthesia approach are instrumental in maximizing positive patient outcomes while successfully protecting the safety of healthcare personnel.

Minilaparoscopy was introduced already 20 years ago. In spite of reduced diameter, technical performance of modern trocars and instruments has improved substantially. While carrying out a minilaparoscopic procedure, the required position of the trocars and the surgical strategy remain the same. The most important step towards minilaparoscopy is reduction of the diameter of the laparoscopes from 10 to 5 mm. The 5 mm laparoscopes show high resolution and transport enough energy to properly illuminate the surgical field. Minilaparoscopic procedures help to improve cosmetic results and reduce postoperative pain, but postoperative complication rates are not affected. Use of one 5 mm trocar causes higher tissue tension than two 3 mm trocars and an additionally placed 3 mm trocar will not increase the complication rate. Therefore, a reduced risk of trocar hernia formation may be expected when a minilaparoscopic approach is used. Efficiency has been proven for minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hernioplasty (TAPP/TEP) whereas overall available evidence across the literature remains poor. Further miniaturization is linked directly to video editing: physical limitations in classic optic systems have already been reached; therefore, reduction of optical chip systems could be a possible alternative.

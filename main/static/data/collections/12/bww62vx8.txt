Post-transcriptional modification of viral mRNA is essential for the translation of viral proteins by cellular translation machinery. Due to the cytoplasmic replication of Paramyxoviruses, the viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is thought to possess all activities required for mRNA capping and methylation. In the present work, using partially purified recombinant RNA polymerase complex of rinderpest virus expressed in insect cells, we demonstrate the in vitro methylation of capped mRNA. Further, we show that a recombinant C-terminal fragment (1717â€“2183 aa) of L protein is capable of methylating capped mRNA, suggesting that the various post-transcriptional activities of the L protein are located in independently folding domains.

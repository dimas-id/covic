We report in this work that a cellular and humoral autoreactive response can be induced against liver‐specific self‐determinants by repeated immunization with a chimeric tissue‐specific self‐antigen carrying a heterologous T(h) epitope. Epitope spreading rendering the autoimmune reaction independent of the presence of the cognate heterologous help is also demonstrated. Although neutrophil infiltrates can be demonstrated in the livers of treated mice, no clinical sign of organ damage is observed. These findings suggest that breakage of tolerance by this means leads the process only up to the next checkpoint in the progression of autoimmune disease and that further events are required to precipitate functional organ impairment.

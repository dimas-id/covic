In 2020 during the CoronaVirus Disease19 (COVID19) pandemic caused by da SARS-CoV-2, the weakness of e-health (electronic health) (ie the lack of direct contact between physician and patient) may prove to be a strength, given the high contagiousness and relative lethality of the virus. In Italy the lack of preparation for supporting the patient load (shortage of personal protection devices, shortage of Intensive Care Unit) beds in comparison with other European Countries, and the poor early diagnostic and therapeutic activity has led us to suggest a project that uses an online platform between General Practitioners and patients in order to reduce moving infected individuals and to perform the diagnosis and treatment early on.

PURPOSE Reports have been issued recently on single incision laparoscopic hernioplasty, but no large-scale study has been conducted as yet. This study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of the single incision laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernioplasty (SIL-TEP) on a large number of cases. METHODS 512 SIL-TEPs in 471 patients were performed from June 2010 to January 2014 at Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea. SIL-TEP was performed using a glove single port device and standard laparoscopic instruments. Short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 512 hernias, 329 (64.3 %) were indirect, 144 (28.1 %) were direct, 9 (1.8 %) were femoral, and 30 (5.9 %) were combined. There were 3 (0.6 %) conversions to single or three-port laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty. Mean operative time was 41.6 min for unilateral hernias and 65.3 min for bilateral hernias. Postoperative complications occurred in 45 cases (9.6 %); 21 were wound seromas, 5 were hematomas, and 18 were urinary retentions. All were successfully treated conservatively. Mean hospital stay was 1.8 days. CONCLUSION The SIL-TEP is safe and technically feasible. Additional studies on long-term recurrence rates are needed to confirm the safety of SIL-TEP.

Laparoscopic treatment strategies for synchronous intra-abdominal malignancies have not yet been standardized. We report a successful case of two-step laparoscopic surgery for synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach accompanied by severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A 66-year-old man with COPD was diagnosed as having advanced colon cancer and early gastric cancer. On admission, he could not go upstairs (Grade III according to the Hugh-Jones classification) and his forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 600 mL (35.9%). The patient initially underwent laparoscopy-assisted sigmoidectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy, followed by laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with D1 lymphadenectomy 68 days later. The patient's each postoperative course was uneventful with no pulmonary complications, and the patient was discharged 9 and 11 days after the first and second operations, respectively. The present case demonstrates that two-step laparoscopic surgery may be a safe and feasible surgical procedure for high-risk patients with synchronous intra-abdominal malignancies.

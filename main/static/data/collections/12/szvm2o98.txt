The goal of this note is to present a simple mathematical model with two parameters for the number of deaths due to the corona (COVID-19) virus. The model only requires basic knowledge in differential calculus, and can also be understood by pupils attending secondary school. The model can easily be implemented on a computer, and we will illustrate it on the basis of case studies for different countries.

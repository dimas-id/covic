BACKGROUND Data from prior health scares suggest that an avian influenza outbreak will impact on people's intention to donate blood; however, research exploring this is scarce. Using an augmented theory of planned behavior (TPB), incorporating threat perceptions alongside the rational decision-making components of the TPB, the current study sought to identify predictors of blood donors' intentions to donate during two phases of an avian influenza outbreak. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Blood donors (n = 172) completed an on-line survey assessing the standard TPB predictors as well as measures of threat perceptions from the health belief model (i.e., perceived susceptibility and severity). Path analyses examined the utility of the augmented TPB to predict donors' intentions to donate during a low- and high-risk phase of an avian influenza outbreak. RESULTS In both phases, the model provided a good fit to the data explaining 69% (low risk) and 72% (high risk) of the variance in intentions. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived susceptibility significantly predicted donor intentions in both phases. Within the low-risk phase, sex was an additional significant predictor of intention, while in the high-risk phase, perceived behavioral control was significantly related to intentions. CONCLUSIONS An augmented TPB model can be used to predict donors' intentions to donate blood in a low-risk and a high-risk phase of an outbreak of avian influenza. As such, the results provide important insights into donors' decision-making that can be used by blood agencies to maintain the blood supply in the context of an avian influenza outbreak.

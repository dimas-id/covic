The nucleocapsid protein gene of transmissible gastroenteritis virus, 1 149 bp in length, was amplified by RT-PCR from isolated strain HB06 and cloned into pMD18-T. Sequence comparison with other transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains selected from the Gene Bank revealed that the homology of N gene complete sequence shares more than 97% in nucleotide. N gene was cloned into BamHI and EcoRI multiple cloning sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pET 20 b, and named pETN. After being induced by isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the recombinant nucleocapsid protein was expressed. The result of SDS-PAGE and Western-blot showed that the recombinant nucleocapsid protein was 47 kDa and had strong positive reactions with TGEV-specific antibody.

Abstract Normal myeloid cells of monocytic and granulocytic origin express the metallopeptidase cluster of differentiation 13 (CD13) on the surface just as leukemic blasts in most acute myeloid leukemias (AML). A minor percentage of AML patients, however, lack the surface expression of CD13 antigen. To study this difference in CD13 surface expression, specific CD13 mRNA from 44 individuals were quantified by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Absolute values for CD13 transcripts were normalised against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript levels to control for variations in sample preparation and mRNA degradation. By correlating normalised CD13 transcript levels and CD13 surface expression, a subgroup of AML patients was identified, having simultaneous diminished levels of myeloid CD13 transcripts and surface expression of the corresponding antigen. For this subgroup we suggest CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) gene expression to be restricted primarily by limited amounts of transcripts. For the majority of AML patients determinants in addition to transcript levels must be involved in regulating CD13/APN gene expression.

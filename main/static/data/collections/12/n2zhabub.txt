Respiratory viral infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. In the last two decades, there has been significant advancement in the epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. In addition, the clinical consequences of many respiratory viruses in the immunocompetent and immunocompromised host continue to be studied. Many therapeutics have also now become available, although their efficacy in transplant recipients remains uncertain. This article describes the current knowledge about respiratory viral infections as it relates to solid organ transplant, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and oncology settings.

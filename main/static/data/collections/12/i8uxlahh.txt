PURPOSE This study was done to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of microwave (MW) ablation of lung tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients underwent percutaneous MW ablation of 26 intraparenchymal pulmonary masses. All patients were judged to be inoperable on the basis of tumour stage, comorbidities, advanced age and/or refusal to undergo surgery. Ablation was performed using a microwave generator (Evident Microwave Ablation System, Covidien Ltd., Dublin). Lesions with a diameter â‰¤ 3 cm were treated with a single antenna, lesions with a diameter >3 cm were treated by positioning two or more antennae, simultaneously. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) follow-up with and without contrast administration at 1, 3 and 6 months and then yearly in combination with complete blood and metabolic tests. RESULTS Technical success was 100 %. No major complications were recorded. Asymptomatic grade-1 pneumothorax was recorded in 9 patients (37.5 %). One case of asymptomatic pleural effusion and one of haemoptysis, not requiring transfusion, were observed. No patients were diagnosed with a post-ablation syndrome. Complete necrosis was observed in 16 of 26 lesions (61.6 %). Partial necrosis was obtained in 30.8 % (8/26 lesions); in one case (3.8 %) a progression of the disease was recorded and in another case (3.8 %) a stability was observed. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience may be considered in accordance with literature dates, in terms of efficacy and safety.

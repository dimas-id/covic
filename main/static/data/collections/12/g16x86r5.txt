Perclose Closure Device (Abbott-Vascular) was attempted for femoral artery (FA) access site closure by an experienced operator. The device was felt to snap as it was pushed through the previously scarred skin and subcutaneous tissue. Perclose had broken into two pieces with the proximal portion outside the body and the distal portion embolizing to lie in the FA to distal aorta. The left FA was accessed through 8F sheath and 4-8mm Basket snare passed through a 6F multipurpose guiding catheter. The tip of the broken Perclose was caught with the snare and pulled out. The Perclose has a distal flexible sheath that is overmolded directly onto the proximal rigid guide. This junction of sheath and guide may be a weak point. Accidental pressure applied at this weak point in any Perclose device during deployment can cause breakage. Awareness of this rare complication is important for safety.

Predicting the runtime complexity of a programming code is an arduous task. In fact, even for humans, it requires a subtle analysis and comprehensive knowledge of algorithms to predict time complexity with high fidelity, given any code. As per Turingâ€™s Halting problem proof, estimating code complexity is mathematically impossible. Nevertheless, an approximate solution to such a task can help developers to get real-time feedback for the efficiency of their code. In this work, we model this problem as a machine learning task and check its feasibility with thorough analysis. Due to the lack of any open source dataset for this task, we propose our own annotated dataset, (The complete dataset is available for use at https://github.com/midas-research/corcod-dataset/blob/master/README.md) CoRCoD: Code Runtime Complexity Dataset, extracted from online coding platforms. We establish baselines using two different approaches: feature engineering and code embeddings, to achieve state of the art results and compare their performances. Such solutions can be highly useful in potential applications like automatically grading coding assignments, IDE-integrated tools for static code analysis, and others.

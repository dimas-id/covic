Disorders of the lungs and pleura are common in children and are a frequent indication for medical imaging. Over the past decade, a combination of advances in MR imaging scanner technology and increased concern about the effects of ionizing radiation has led to increased utilization of MR imaging in the pediatric population. Despite this general trend, there has been slower adoption of MR imaging to evaluate the lungs and pleura due to technical limitations including motion artifact, low signal-to-noise ratios, and signal dephasing at air-tissue interfaces. As MR imaging technology advances, many of these technical hurdles are being overcome, and MR imaging of the lungs and pleura has begun to be a feasible option for many pediatric pleuropulmonary conditions. Therefore, an up-to-date understanding of these emerging applications is important to practitioners performing MR imaging in infants and children. In this chapter, an overview of MR imaging techniques to evaluate the lungs and pleura in children is discussed. Normal anatomy and development of the lungs and pleura are described, and the MR imaging findings in a spectrum pediatric lung and pleural disease are illustrated.

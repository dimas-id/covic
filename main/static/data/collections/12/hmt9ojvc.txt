The outbreak of COVID-19 has taken a large number of lives since 2019 and the death toll continues to increase all over the world. Recent data reports that about 27 lacs of people are infected with this virus till date and around 2 lacs are dead due to this pandemic. The situation in India is no way better. In India, almost all the states have become victim of this deadly pandemic. Considering the enormous population in India, citizens here are facing acute shortage of detection kits and many are dying even before the knowledge of their infection. The present treatise proposes a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based technique for simple and rapid detection of COVID-19. The technique will be inexpensive, selective, reusable and easy to handle. It has been already implemented in our laboratory in order to detect the taste contributing agents found in tea. This article discusses the detailed methodology and the resultant analytical characteristic of the sensors developed so far and also outlines the suitability of the MIP technique towards fabrication of testing kits for rapid detection of COVID-19.

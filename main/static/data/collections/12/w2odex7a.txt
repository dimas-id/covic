PURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare the feasibility, efficacy and safety of microwave ablation and saline-linked radiofrequency (Aquamantys) in liver resection. METHODS Sixteen domestic pigs (8 per group) underwent thermoablations. Group A consisted of 8 pigs in which microwave left lateral liver resection was performed. Group B consisted of 8 pigs which underwent left lateral liver resection by the Aquamantys system. After 28 days of close follow-up, the animals were sacrificed in order to study the macroscopic and microscopic findings of each intervention on the liver edge. RESULTS An average of 47.13 min was enough for the entire operation to take place using Aquamantys, whereas an average of 59.13 min was needed in the microwave liver resection group. Mean blood loss was 40 ml (range 5-85) with Aquamantys whereas mean blood loss was 72.37 ml (range 42-100) using microwave. Postoperative complications rates were extremely low in both groups. There was no intra- or postoperative mortality. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that left lateral liver resection using Aquamantys system is technically feasible in the porcine model and proved to be highly effective and a safer hemostatic method compared to microwave ablation.

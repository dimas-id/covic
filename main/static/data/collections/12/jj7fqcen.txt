While most people make staying out of jail and prison a priority, a growing number of researchers are eager to get into correctional facilities in order to study the criminal justice system, the causes and consequences of incarceration, and the role of corrections in our society. For health researchers and their collaborators, the audience for this chapter, correctional facilities offer several unique advantages: a population at high risk of many health problems including infectious and chronic diseases, substance abuse, and mental health problems; social and physical environments that can enhance or impede well-being; a setting that is a focal point for the class, racial/ethnic, and gender differences that divide the United States; a site where health and mental health services and prevention programs are offered and can be evaluated; a controlled environment for administration of treatments such as directly observed therapy for tuberculosis; and a stopping point in the cycle of incarceration and reentry that so profoundly affects community well-being.

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), a small single-stranded DNA virus, was initially discovered in 1998 and is highly prevalent in the domestic pig population. Disease manifestations associated with PCV2 include postweaning multisystemic wasting disease (PMWS), enteric disease, respiratory disease, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), and reproductive failure. Although these clinical manifestations involve different organ systems, there is considerable overlap in clinical expression of disease and presence of lesions between pigs and within herds. It is now widely accepted that PCV2 can be further subdivided into different types, of which PCV2a and PCV2b are present worldwide and of greatest importance. This review will focus on PCV2-associated lesions in different organ systems.

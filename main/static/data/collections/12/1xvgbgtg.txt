Purpose Perianal fistula is an important health problem with devastating morbidity. For diagnosis and prevention of recurrence, perianal fistula imaging (PFI) is crucial. The aim of this study was to investigate if a Flex-M superficial coil images would provide more information than images obtained with a phased-array body coil in PFI. Material and methods Thirty-one fistulas of 29 patients were prospectively evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. A phased-array body coil was used in all patients as in routine practice, and sequences with Flex-M coil were also obtained. Afterwards, images were evaluated by two experienced radiologists who were blinded to the patients, coil and also to each other. The site of internal and external openings, and presence or absence of abscess and secondary tracts were recorded. Results The conspicuity of images was better with the Flex-M coil. Both radiologists saw more internal openings with the Flex-M coil. Cohen's κ value was 0.100 (p = 0.201) for Reader 1 and 0.110 (p = 0.361) for Reader 2 between these two coils. Additionally, numerically more internal/external openings and secondary tracts were seen by both readers. Interobserver variability was not statistically significant, and Cohen's κ values signifyied good concordance between readers. Conclusions In our study we showed that multichannel superficial phased-array coils improved imaging quality in PFI. We think that Flex-M coil can easily be used in routine clinical practice to gather better images of perianal fistulas.

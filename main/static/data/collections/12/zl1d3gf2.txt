As of April 9, 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) had caused 89,931 deaths and 1,503,900 confirmed cases worldwide, which indicates an increasingly severe and uncontrollable situation. Initially, little was known about the virus. As research continues, we now know the genome structure, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Based on this knowledge, potential targets involved in the processes of virus pathogenesis need to be identified, and the discovery or development of drugs based on these potential targets is the most pressing need. Here, we have summarized the potential therapeutic targets involved in virus pathogenesis and discuss the advances, possibilities, and significance of drugs based on these targets for treating SARS-CoV-2. This review will facilitate the identification of potential targets and provide clues for drug development that can be translated into clinical applications for combating SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract This study investigated abomasal luminal parameters in healthy and diarrheic calves by using a wireless ambulatory capsule (WAC). The acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate. Four healthy and five diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study. For APAT, calves were fed 2L of milk replacer containing 50mg acetaminophen/kg body weight, and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward. Concomitantly, a WAC in the abomasum continuously measured luminal pH, pressure, and temperature. Five hours post suckling, intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves. Abomasal pH and pressure were not significantly different, but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves. During APAT no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations (Cmax) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (Tmax) were observed. Nonlinear regression findings revealed a longer acetaminophen half-time (AAP t1/2) in diarrheic calves compared to healthy calves [564 ± 96min vs. 393 ± 84min, respectively; P = 0.04] and lower area under the concentration curve values (e.g., 60min postprandial AUC60 681 ± 244 (µg∙min)/mL vs. 1064 ± 23 (µg∙min)/mL, respectively; P = 0.04). In conclusion, abomasal luminal conditions were different between diarrheic and healthy calves. Significant differences in APAT reflected a delay in abomasal emptying in diarrheic calves. Impaired abomasal movement may induce enhanced bacterial fermentation processes as indicated by a higher abomasal temperature in diarrheic calves, which should be considered in management of their feeding.

Generally, children and teenagers do not become seriously ill with COVID-19. However, in countries with high rates of coronavirus disease, children with the syndrome COVID-19 associated inflammation syndrome referred to as PIMS-TS have been reported. Similarities noted between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences and those of other super antigens has prompted the suggestion that this might be the mechanism by SARS-CoV-ST triggers PIMS-TS. It has also been suggested that the D614G variant found more commonly in the US and across European countries may explain why PIMS-TS appears to be common in these countries. Here we analysed viral sequences from 13 paediatric COVID-19 patients of whom five were diagnosed with PIMS-TS. This is the first characterisation of viruses from PIMS-TS patients. In contrast to what has been hypothesised, we found no evidence of unique sequences associated with the viruses from PIMS-TS patients.

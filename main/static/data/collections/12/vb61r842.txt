Critically ill cancer patients on intensive units with hematological or oncological underlying diseases are a special situation: the underlying disease may be incurable, acute problems are often therapy associated and immunosuppression is regularly present. Due to evolving knowledge about special aspects of these patients and optimized supportive therapy, the prognosis has substantially improved during the last decades. General reluctance to admit cancer patients to an intensive care unit is therefore no longer justified. Reasons for admission are often infections and/or respiratory failure. Extensive diagnostic measures, causal and supportive therapy of sepsis according to current guidelines has led to improved outcome even in cancer patients. In respiratory failure, non-invasive ventilation is the key to improved prognosis if used early enough and indications, contraindications and break-off criteria are strictly followed. The prognosis of critically ill cancer patients is determined by the severity of the acute problem and not by the underlying disease.

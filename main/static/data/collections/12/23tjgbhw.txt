Several viruses cause damage to the tissue by immunopathological mechanisms. This chapter presents the principal examples of immunopathogenesis caused by the viruses, accompanied by speculations about its management. The most common mechanism of lesion development in virus induced immunopathology involves T cells. Usually, it seems that when CD8(+) T cells act as the controlling cell type, lesions are acute and the outcome is decided quickly. The classic example is provided by LCM in mice. The newest candidate may turn out to be SNV infection in humans. Lesions orchestrated primarily by CD4(+) T cells can be either acute or long-lasting. Curiously, in the LCMV example, if CD8(+) T cells are removed from the scene, immunopathological responses may still occur and these involve CD4(+) T cells. Such responses are far more chronic and of lower grade than those mediated by CD8(+) T lymphocytes. One possible sequel to chronic inflammatory responses to viruses is that autoreactive inflammatory reactions are initiated and an autoimmune disease occurs. The adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is certainly true in the field of viral pathogenesis. Preventing viral infection or manipulating immune processes during the initial phases of infection is far more successful than attempting to counteract pathological events once underway.

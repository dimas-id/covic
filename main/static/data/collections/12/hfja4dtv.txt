OBJECTIVES To investigate radiation exposure, objective image quality, and the diagnostic accuracy of a BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose CT angiography (CTA) protocol for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the standard of reference. METHODS In this prospective, IRB-approved study, 40 PAD patients (30 male, mean age 72 years) underwent CTA on a dual-source CT scanner at 80kV tube voltage. The reference amplitude for tube current modulation was personalized based on the body mass index (BMI) with 120 mAs for [BMI≤25] or 150 mAs for [2570%) was assessed by two readers independently and compared to subsequent DSA. Radiation exposure was assessed with the computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol) and the dosis-length product (DLP). Objective image quality was assessed via contrast- and signal-to-noise ratio (CNR and SNR) measurements. Radiation exposure and image quality were compared between the BMI groups and between the BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol and the low-dose institutional standard protocol (ISP). RESULTS The BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol reached high diagnostic accuracy values of 94% for Reader 1 and 93% for Reader 2. Moreover, in comparison to the ISP, it showed significantly (p<0.001) lower CTDIvol (1.97±0.55mGy vs. 4.18±0.62 mGy) and DLP (256±81mGy x cm vs. 544±83mGy x cm) but similar image quality (p=0.37 for CNR). Furthermore, image quality was similar between BMI groups (p=0.86 for CNR). CONCLUSIONS A CT protocol that incorporates low kV settings with a personalized (BMI-adjusted) reference amplitude for tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction enables very low radiation exposure CTA, while maintaining good image quality and high diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of PAD.

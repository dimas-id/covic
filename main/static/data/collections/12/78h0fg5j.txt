Neural cells, indluding astrocytes, normally do not express detectable levels of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, unlike cells of most tissues. However, upon cultivation in vitro, astrocytes begin to express class I molecules, increasing with time after plating. This spontaneous expression was examined in the present study to characterize inducible expression on astrocytes among various strains of mice. Inducible expression, either as a consequence of cultivation or standard Î³-interferon treatment, differed markedly among the strains examined. Analysis of congenic strains on a C57BL/10 (B10) background showed that expression was controlled by genes within the MHC locus. Examination of additional congeneic animals with various recombinations within the MHC showed that high or low expression of MHC molecules correlates with the presence of particular MHC class I genes. In general, H-2(a) and H-2(d) class I products are expressed much higher on astrocytes than H-2(b) and H-2(s) products. This difference in expression is not seen on spleen cells indicating tissue specificity. Moreover, levels of expression at the cell surface are reflected by the steady-state level of RNA message within astrocytes of the different strains.

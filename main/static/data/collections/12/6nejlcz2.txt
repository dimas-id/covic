Two different strains of Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) were inoculated into swine tracheal organ culture. Both viruses replicated in and destroyed the tracheal epithelium and epithelial cells. ADV antigen was first localized in ciliated epithelial cells by fluorescent antibody and immunoperoxidase examinations. Corresponding to the distribution of ADV antigen, many ADV particles were observed in ciliated epithelial cells. Results demonstrated that the tracheal epithelium infected with ADV is reduced in its ciliary activity.

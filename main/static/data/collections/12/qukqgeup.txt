PURPOSE OF REVIEW Esophageal adenocarcinoma bears one of the fastest rising incidence of any cancers and generally arises in the setting of gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's esophagus. However, early detection of neoplasia can be challenging since most patients are asymptomatic until they progress to more advanced and less curable stages, and early dysplastic lesions can be small, multifocal, and difficult to detect. Clearly, new imaging tools are needed in light of sampling error associated with random biopsies, the current standard of practice. RECENT FINDINGS Advances in endoscopic imaging including virtual chromoendoscopy, confocal laser endomicroscopy, and subsurface imaging with optical coherence tomography have ushered in a new era for detecting subtle neoplastic lesions. Moreover, in light of esophagus-sparing treatments for neoplastic lesions, such tools are likely to guide ablation and follow-up management. While there is no ideal single imaging modality to facilitate improved detection, staging, ablation, and follow-up of patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, new advances in available technology, the potential for multimodal imaging, and the use of computer-aided diagnosis and biomarkers all hold great promise for improving detection and treatment.

BACKGROUND: The N95 respirator is the most common safety tool used in hospitals to protect health care workers (HCW) from inhaling airborne particles. Focusing on HCW behavior related to respirator use is an effective route to improve HCW safety and respiratory health. METHODS: Participants were asked to perform the donning and doffing of an N95 respirator to camera. Then they were randomized to a video alone or a reflective practice intervention. After the intervention they repeated the donning and doffing to camera. A critical safety behavior scoring tool (CSBST) was developed to compare the performance of the participants over time at pretest, post-test and 1 month later for follow-up. RESULTS: The reflective practice intervention group was found to have significantly higher scores on the CSBST at post-test and follow-up than the video alone group. In the reflective practice intervention group, the participants perceived they were better at performing the N95 donning and doffing than the experts scored them. CONCLUSIONS: The CSBST is a tool to measure the performance of HCWs on a specific targeted safety behaviors. The addition of a reflective practice intervention may result in a measurable and sustained improvement in the safety behaviors demonstrated when using the N95 respirator.

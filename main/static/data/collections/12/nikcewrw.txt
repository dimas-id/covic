Abstract Ticks are medically-important arthropods that maintain and transmit numerous emerging viruses. China suffers severely from tick-borne viral diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), but the background of tick-borne viruses is very limited. Here we report the virome profiling of ticks and goat sera from SFTS-epidemic areas, and serological investigation of SFTS virus (SFTSV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV). Results revealed divergent viruses in ticks and goat sera, including SFTSV and NSDV. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the SFTSV identified here was most closely related to human SFTSV in sampling and surrounding areas, and the NSDV to the previously identified NSDV from northeast China. Serological investigation of SFTSV infection in goats revealed intensive activity in those areas. Surprisingly, two different methods of NSDV serological investigation showed no sera positive for this virus.

Lung diseases are among the most common and widespread disorders worldwide. They refer to many different pathological conditions affecting the pulmonary system in acute or chronic forms, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infections, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and many other breath complications. Environmental, epigenetic and genetic co-factors are responsible for these pathologies that can lead to respiratory failure, and, even, ultimately death. Increasing evidences have highlighted the implication of the autophagic pathways in the pathogenesis of lung diseases and, in some cases, the deregulated molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy may be considered as potential new therapeutic targets. This chapter summarizes recent advances in understanding the pathophysiological functions of autophagy and its possible roles in the causation and/or prevention of human lung diseases.

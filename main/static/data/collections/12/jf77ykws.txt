Anthropogenic environmental change is acknowledged as a primary factor in the emergence of diseases. New Zealandâ€™s history since human occupation has been characterized by extensive anthropogenic disturbance and the establishment of numerous exotic species. As a result, highly modified habitats have been created, which, in conjunction with introduced organisms, provide suitable conditions for the establishment of exotic systems likely to lead to outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease. The interactions among some disturbance factors in the New Zealand environment are discussed, and the potential public health implications.

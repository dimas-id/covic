In this paper, we presents an SEIR epidemic model with infectivity in incubation period and homestead-isolation on the susceptible. We prove that the infection-free equilibrium point is locally and globally asymptotically stable with condition R 0 < 1 . We also prove that the positive equilibrium point is locally and globally asymptotically stable with condition R 0 > 1 . Numerical simulations are employed to illustrate our results. In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for the virus, our results suggest that the governments should strictly implement the isolation system to make every effort to curb propagation of disease during the epidemic.

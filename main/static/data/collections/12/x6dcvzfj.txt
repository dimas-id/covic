Type I interferons (IFNs) are soluble molecules that exert potent antiviral activity and are currently used for the treatment of a panel of viral infections. In the case of HIV, the use of type I IFN has had limited success, and has almost been abandoned. During the last decade, a series of studies has highlighted how HIV infection may cause overactivation of type I IFN production, which contributes to the exhaustion of the immune system and to disease progression. This review describes the transition from the proposed use of type I IFN as antiviral drugs in HIV infection, to the idea that blocking their activity or production may provide an immunologic benefit of much greater importance than their antiviral activity.

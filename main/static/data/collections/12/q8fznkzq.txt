OBJECTIVE Conduct a systematic review of nonpharmacological interventions applied during sleep to enhance physical rehabilitation outcomes of individuals with a neurological diagnosis. DATA SOURCES Three online databases were searched for original research. STUDY SELECTION Intervention studies were included that used outcome measures of impairment, activity, and/or participation. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently screened 2287 titles and abstracts, reviewed 101 full texts, extracted data, and assessed study quality and risk of bias for 9 included studies. DATA SYNTHESIS All included studies were randomized controlled trials involving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with inpatient individuals with stroke and sleep apnea. Several studies also included long-term outpatient follow-ups. Results in terms of outcomes based on impairment, activity, and participation were mixed. However, several studies found that the use of CPAP following stroke and sleep apnea during early stroke recovery had benefits relative to no CPAP. CONCLUSIONS The only nonpharmacological intervention to be administered during sleep in a neurological population to improve physical rehabilitation outcomes was found to be CPAP. This review was complicated by the variety of outcome measures used, lack of physical rehabilitation description, and CPAP compliance. In general, participants who had acceptable to good CPAP compliance saw the largest improvements in physical rehabilitation outcomes. Several other promising methods of brain stimulation during sleep are discussed.

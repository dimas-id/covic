Abstract When SARS hit Singapore in 2003, we began to formulate rigorous protocols and reconfigure our facilities to prevent in-hospital transmission. This became the foundation of our practices in COVID-19. However, some adaptations were made to suit the current needs of the department, and technology has been employed for communication. This paper describes the preparation and response of nursing in Radiology Department in Singapore in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Protocols and measures taken during SARS and COVID-19 were described.Stringent infection control and prevention measures, detailed standard operating protocols for handling SARS and COVID-19 patients coming for radiological examinations and interventions, team segregation, safe distancing, efficient communication and rigorous staff surveillance are paramount to ensure patient and staff safety.Our SARS experience has shaped our preparations and response towards the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, there have been zero healthcare worker transmission in the department. The crisis has also enhanced the cohesiveness among staff due to the camaraderie and shared experience.The response and measures taken by the Radiology Department in a large acute care teaching hospital could be practiced in other similar healthcare settings.

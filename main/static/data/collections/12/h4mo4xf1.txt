Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to destruction of the attachment apparatus of the teeth. The presence of particular oral bacteria and the host inflammatory response contribute to disease progression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobe considered to be a major periodontal pathogen. Isolated Ags from P. gingivalis activate innate immune cells through TLR2 or TLR4. We challenged TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice with live P. gingivalis and studied the inflammatory response and bacterial survival. Wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice produced high levels of cytokines in response to P. gingivalis challenge, whereas cytokine levels were nearly absent or delayed in TLR2-deficient mice. Surprisingly, P. gingivalis was cleared far more rapidly in TLR2-deficient mice. In addition, TLR2-deficient mice resisted bone loss following oral infection with P. gingivalis.

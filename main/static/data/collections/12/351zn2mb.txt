Preparing for a mass casualty event starts long before the event. Being able to provide care during an event requires collecting information about processes, equipment, supplies, and personnel to anticipate different situations. Planning should include an impact analysis to identify and prioritize critical services that need to be maintained. Impact analysis is carried out in concert with the entire health care delivery organization, not by individual departments. Planning may include addressing inadequate staffing, disrupted supply chains, and loss of information systems. Care may need to be provided in alternate locations, without access to the usual information resources. Mass casualty events also depend on the availability of communications to inform others on the emergency response teams, as well as to inform patients and the public.

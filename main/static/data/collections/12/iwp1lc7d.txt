BACKGROUND: Mink circovirus (MiCV) is a newly discovered pathogen associated with mink diarrhea. The prevalence and economic importance of this virus remain poorly understood, and no specific serological assay has been developed for the diagnosis of MiCV infection. RESULTS: In this study, a recombinant capsid protein antigen expressed in Escherichia coli was utilized to establish an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). Results revealed that the assay had no cross-reactivity with other related pathogens, and the respective sensitivity and specificity of the proposed iELISA were 92.31% and 91.67% compared with those obtained of Western blot on 138 serum samples from minks. The correlation coefficient between iELISA and Western blot was 0.838 (p > 0.05). iELISA was applied to detect MiCV antibodies in 683 clinical serum samples from different farms from the major mink industry province in China, and 21 of 24 farms with 163 of 683 (23.87%) individuals were tested positive for MiCV antibodies. The positive rates of each of the 21 flocks ranged from 2.33% to 73.68%. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that iELISA was a sensitive and specific method suitable for the large-scale detection of MiCV infections in mink. This study provided an effective method for the serological diagnosis and positive rate investigation of MiCV infection.

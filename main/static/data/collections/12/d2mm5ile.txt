The investigation focuses on an on-off protocol for controlling the COVID-19 widespread. The protocol establishes a working period of 4 days for all the citizens, followed by 8 days of lock-down. We further propose splitting people into smaller groups that undergo the on-off protocol, but shifted in time. This procedure is expected to regularize the overall economic activity. Our results show that either the on-of protocol and the splitting into groups reduces the amount of infected people. However, the latter seems to be better for economic reasons. Our simulations further show that the start-up time is a key issue for the success of the implementation.

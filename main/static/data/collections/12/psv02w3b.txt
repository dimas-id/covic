The past few decades have seen the emergence of several worldwide arbovirus epidemics (chikungunya, Zika), the expansion or recrudescence of historical arboviruses (dengue, yellow fever), and the modification of the distribution area of major vector mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, raising questions about the risk of appearance of new vectors and new epidemics. In this opinion piece, we review the factors that led to the emergence of yellow fever in the Americas, define the conditions for a mosquito to become a vector, analyse the recent example of the new status of Aedes albopictus from neglected mosquito to major vector, and propose some scenarios for the future.

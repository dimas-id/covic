The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originated in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and then quickly spread to most provinces and regions in China and even spread to many countries abroad. COVID-19 is characterized by wide epidemic, strong infectivity, rapid onset and critical condition. In the face of this epidemic, all parts of the country quickly set off a peak in the fight against COVID-19, but no effective drug for COVID-19 has been developed in the short term. Recently, many hospitals have combined traditional Chinese medicine with western medicine in treatment, and the clinical effect is remarkable, which proves the antiviral effect of traditional Chinese medicine. A large number of pharmacological and clinical studies have proved that the Chinese materia medica S. flavescens has significant antiviral effect. In this paper, the mechanism of anti-coronavirus effect of S. flavescens is expounded from multiple pathways, such as type I interferon, NF-ÎºB signal pathway, ERK signal pathway, PI3K/Akt signal pathway and matrine alkaloids, etc. It is intended to provide reference for clinical treatment of coronavirus infection pneumonia and research and development of related drugs of S. flavescens.

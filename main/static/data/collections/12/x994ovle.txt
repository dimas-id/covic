The life expectancy and prevalence of malignant diseases is continuously on the rise, which inevitably leads to an increase of critically ill cancer patients. This article explains why the prognosis of cancer patients in the intensive care unit has markedly improved over the last decades, what the reasons for admission are and which risk factors affect mortality. Furthermore, the importance of correct patient selection and other specific topics will be discussed. Accordingly, acute respiratory failure for example is the most common organ dysfunction in these patients and has specific prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics. The successful management of cancer patients in the intensive care unit requires specific knowledge of the intensive care physician and an excellent cooperation with the treating hematologist and oncologist.

CASE REPORT Cystic urolithiasis is the most common form of urolithiasis reported in horses. In contrast to the gelding or stallion, clinical disease is less common in the mare and manual removal techniques are possible because of their shorter, wider urethral anatomy. However, these manual removal techniques can be traumatic and are limited by the size of the urolith. This report describes the use of a commercial laparoscopic specimen pouch to remove a cystic urolith in a mare. CONCLUSION This approach may allow the extraction of larger uroliths per urethra in the mare, while affording some protection to the mucosa of the bladder neck and urethra.

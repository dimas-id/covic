The doctor's work style reform was enacted in April 2024, and it will enter oncology field without waiting. Oncology clinics already have the 3 powers to realize work style reforms.(1)Efficiency of tasks and task shifting/task sharing that can be advanced only because of the field where team medical care has been performed.(2)Patient understanding and good public skills how to apply medical care that can be obtained only because of the field where emphasis has been placed on collaboration with patients.(3)Improve practice efficiency by introducing ICT that can be realized only in the field where it is easy to introduce ICT, and introduce AI to medical care. I hope that we can make utilize maximally these 3 strengths and promote work style reform from oncology field.

Abstract OBJECTIVE To investigate the protective effect and possible mechanism of Xuebijing Injection on myocardial injury in patients with sepsis, and to evaluate its prognostic implications. METHODS Patients with septic myocardial injury were recruited, and were randomly divided into two groups: treatment group and control group. All patients in two groups received conventional cluster treatment, the patients in treatment group additional received Xuebijing injection dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride injection, and the patients in control group received the same amount of 0.9% sodium chloride injection. At the beginning of treatment and 3, 7 and 10-day after treatment, laboratory indicators of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were respectively tested in venous blood. The patient's length of stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the mortality in 28 days were recorded. RESULTS At 3, 7 and 10-day after treatment, the improvements of cTnI, NT-proBNP and PCT in treatment group were better than those in control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The mortality of treatment group in 28 days was not significantly different from that of control group (P > 0.05). The ICU length of stay of treatment group was shorter than that of control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Xuebijing injection could improve the levels of cTnI, NT-proBNP and PCT in patients with septic myocardial injury. and it had a protective effect on myocardial injury.

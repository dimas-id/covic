Neurological symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare at onset in COVID-19. Here we report a 37-year-old man with vertigo, fever, and diarrhea symptoms as the first manifestation. F-FDG PET/CT spotted multiple ground glass opacity (GGO) lesions in the lungs, with increased tracer uptake in both lung GGOs and the whole colon. Serial CT examinations showed the emersion and dissipation of lung GGOs. We illustrate the symptoms initiation, the laboratory test results, the imaging examination, and the treatment strategy in the duration of COVID-19 with a timeline chart.

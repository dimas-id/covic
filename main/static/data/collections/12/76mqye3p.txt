When synthesizing feedback controllers for large-scale dynamical systems, often a reduction of the plant model by model order reduction is required. This is a typical task in computer-aided control system design environments. Therefore, in the last years, model order reduction became an essential tool for the practical use of mathematical models in engineering processes. For the integration of established model order reduction methods into those processes, software solutions are needed. In this paper, we describe the MORLAB (Model Order Reduction LABoratory) toolbox as such a software solution in MathWorks MATLAB(Â®) and GNU Octave, and its featured integration into established software tools used in simulations and controller design. We give benchmark examples for two important extensions of the toolbox.

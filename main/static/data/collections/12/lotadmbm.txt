BACKGROUND A temporary loop ileostomy is commonly used to protect low pelvic anastomoses. Closure is associated with morbidity and mortality. This study investigated patterns of complications after loop ileostomy closure and factors associated with morbidity and mortality. METHOD A review was performed of patients who underwent loop ileostomy closure between 1999 and 2005. RESULTS Three hundred and twenty-five patients underwent closure of loop ileostomy. Reasons for primary surgery were: anterior resection for cancer (n = 160, 49%), ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (n = 114, 35%), diverticular disease (n = 25, 8%), Crohn's colitis (n = 4, 1%) and other conditions (n = 22, 7%). Overall mortality was 2.5% (n = 8) and morbidity was 22.8% (n = 74). Thirty-two patients (10%) developed small bowel obstruction, of whom seven required operative intervention. Overall, the re-operation rate in this series was 28 patients (8.6%). Thirteen (4%) patients had an anastomotic leak of whom 12 patients had re-operation. Preoperative anaemia was significantly associated with leakage (Hb < 11 g/dl; n = 65, P = 0.033). The leakage rate was lower after a stapled anastomosis than a hand-sutured anastomosis (4/203 vs 9/122; P = 0.039). Hypo-albuminaemia (albumin < 34 g/l) was significantly associated with mortality (n = 46, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Loop ileostomy closure is associated with morbidity and mortality. Anaemia and hypo-albuminaemia may be associated with poor outcome.

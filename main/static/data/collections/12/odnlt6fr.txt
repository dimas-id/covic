A great number of people and non-equalizing medical resources, in developing countries, have become a serious contradiction. Not only does it affects the personâ€™s life, but also causes serious epidemic contagious, because patients can not get help with hospital on time. With the development of wireless communication network, patient may get medical information by wireless network device. It can alleviate contradictions between patients and medical resources. But in developing countries, population quantity is a big data. How to solve data packets in wireless communication network is a big problem when researchers face huge population. In order to solve some problems in big data communication, this paper founds availability data transmission routing algorithm. This algorithm can reduce energy consumption and overhead, then improve deliver ratio in big data communication. Compare with Spray and Wait algorithm, Binary spray and wait algorithm in opportunistic networks, this algorithm acquires good results by reduce energy consumption, overhead and deliver ratio.

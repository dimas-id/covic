Abstract Nanosensors have wide applications in the food industry. Nanosensors based on quantum dots for heavy metal and organophosphate pesticides detection, and nanocomposites as indicators for shelf life of fish/meat products, have served as important tools for food quality and safety assessment. Luminescent labels consisting of NPs conjugated to aptamers have been popular for rapid detection of infectious and foodborne pathogens. Various detection technologies, including microelectromechanical systems for gas analytes, microarrays for genetically modified foods, and label-free nanosensors using nanowires, microcantilevers, and resonators are being applied extensively in the food industry. An interesting aspect of nanosensors has also been in the development of the electronic nose and electronic tongue for assessing organoleptic qualities, such as, odor and taste of food products. Real-time monitoring of food products for rapid screening, counterfeiting, and tracking has boosted ingenious, intelligent, and innovative packaging of food products. This chapter will give an overview of the contribution of nanotechnology-based biosensors in the food industry, ongoing research, technology advancements, regulatory guidelines, future challenges, and industrial outlook.

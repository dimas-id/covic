Thyroidectomy is a common surgical procedure. Traditionally, surgeons have performed thyroidectomy on an inpatient basis. However, consistent with current trends in surgery, some practices are transitioning thyroidectomy to an outpatient setting. Although concerns for hypocalcemia and postoperative bleeding exist regardless of surgeon experience, multiple studies demonstrate that outpatient thyroidectomy is safe in the hands of high-volume surgeons. Indeed, experienced thyroid surgeons who perform thyroidectomy in an outpatient setting experience excellent patient outcomes and reduced costs. However, outpatient thyroidectomy may not be suitable for all surgeons, hospitals, or patients. When evaluating whether to implement an outpatient thyroid program, a practice should consider a number of important factors including the team performing the procedure, the hospital, and the patient. With the appropriate staff education and experience, hospital setting, and patient selection, practices in a multitude of settings can successfully develop a safe, cost-effective outpatient thyroid program.

Feline coronavirus is a highly contagious virus potentially resulting in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), while the pathogenesis of FIP remains not well understood, particularly in the events leading to the disease. A predominant theory is that the pathogenic FIPV arises from a mutation, so that it could replicate not only in enterocytes of the intestines but also in monocytes, subsequently systemically transporting the virus. The immune status and genetics of affected cats certainly play an important role in the pathogenesis. Considering the importance of genetics and host immune responses in viral infections, the goal of this study was to elucidate host gene expression in macrophages using RNA sequencing. Macrophages from healthy male cats infected with FIPV 79-1146 ex vivo displayed a differential host gene expression. Despite the virus uptake, aligned viral reads did not increase from 2 to 17 h. The overlap of host gene expression among macrophages from different cats was limited, even though viral transcripts were detected in the cells. Interestingly, some of the downregulated genes in all macrophages were involved in immune signaling, while some upregulated genes common for all cats were found to be inhibiting immune activation. Our results highlight individual host responses playing an important role, consistent with the fact that few cats develop feline infectious peritonitis despite a common presence of enteric FCoV.

PURPOSE: To share a useful intervention to minimize risk of COVID-19 infection to both healthcare workers and patients in the eye clinic. METHODS: We present our experience of virtual, within-clinic remote visual acuity assessment to reduce the risk of infection with COVID-19. RESULTS: Along with standard recommendations for personal protective equipment and hand hygiene to contain viral spread and treating only urgent cases, remote within-clinic visual acuity testing and consultations can be undertaken with minimal specialist equipment and appears to provide useful information whilst being acceptable to patients. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmology practice must adapt in order to combat COVID-19. This measure can easily be incorporated into daily practice to reduce both patient footfall within the department and close contact between patient and healthcare practitioners.

We developed and evaluated a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detecting Duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1). The amplification could be finished in 1 h under isothermal conditions at 63 °C by employing a set of four primers targeting the 2C gene of DHAV-1. The RT-LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity than the RT-PCR with a detection limit of 0.1 ELD(50) 0.1 ml(−1) of DHAV-1. The RT-LAMP assay was highly specific; no cross-reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses, bacteria, allantoic fluid of normal chicken embryos, or the livers of uninfected ducks. Thirty clinical samples were subjected to detection by RT-LAMP, RT-PCR, and virus isolation, which obtained completely consistent, positive results. As a simple, rapid, and accurate detection method, this RT-LAMP assay has important potential applications in the clinical diagnosis of DHAV-1.

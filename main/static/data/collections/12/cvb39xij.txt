OBJECTIVE To investigate the chest X-ray features and kinetic changes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS The appearing time, site, range and imaging features of pulmonary lesions in chest radiograms were observed in 118 patients with clinically confirmed SARS treated in our hospital. Meanwhile, their relation to clinical manifestations was also evaluated. RESULTS Abnormal image appeared in the radiogram in 99.2% of the patients, and it was found in 79.7% of the patients within 4 days after onset of SARS. Lesions in both lungs and multi-lobe pathological changes were noted in 52.2% of the patients. In seven non-survivors, the lesions were included multi-lung lobes, revealing earlier appearance and faster progression compared with the others. CONCLUSION The more serious clinical symptoms and poor prognosis are found in patients with earlier appearance, larger scope and faster progression of SARS lesions in the chest radiogram.

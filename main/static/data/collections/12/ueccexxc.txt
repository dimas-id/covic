The repair of organs and tissues has stepped into a prospective era of regenerative medicine. However, basic research and clinical practice in the lung regeneration remains crawling. Owing to the complicated three dimensional structures and above 40 types of pulmonary cells, the regeneration of lung tissues becomes a great challenge. Compelling evidence has showed that distinct populations of intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary stem/progenitor cells can regenerate epithelia as well as endothelia in various parts of the respiratory tract. Recently, the discovery of human lung stem cells and their relevant studies has opened the door of hope again, which might put us on the path to repair our injured body parts, lungs on demand. Herein, we emphasized the role of endogenous and exogenous stem/progenitor cells in lungs as well as artificial tissue repair for the injured lungs, which constitute a marvelous toolbox for the treatment of acute lung injury. Finally, we further discussed the potential problems in the pulmonary remodeling and regeneration.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Various endovascular techniques have been applied to treat blister-like aneurysms. We performed a systematic review to evaluate endovascular treatment for ruptured blister-like aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search and subgroup analyses to compare deconstructive versus reconstructive techniques and flow diversion versus other reconstructive options. RESULTS Thirty-one studies with 265 procedures for ruptured blister-like aneurysms were included. Endovascular treatment was associated with a 72.8% (95% CI, 64.2%-81.5%) mid- to long-term occlusion rate and a 19.3% (95% CI, 13.6%-25.1%) retreatment rate. Mid- to long-term neurologic outcome was good in 76.2% (95% CI, 68.9%-8.4%) of patients. Two hundred forty procedures (90.6%) were reconstructive techniques (coiling, stent-assisted coiling, overlapped stent placement, flow diversion) and 25 treatments (9.4%) were deconstructive. Deconstructive techniques had higher rates of initial complete occlusion than reconstructive techniques (77.3% versus 33.0%, P = .0003) but a higher risk for perioperative stroke (29.1% versus 5.0%, P = .04). There was no difference in good mid- to long-term neurologic outcome between groups, with 76.2% for the reconstructive group versus 79.9% for the deconstructive group (P = .30). Of 240 reconstructive procedures, 62 (25.8%) involved flow-diverter stents, with higher rates of mid- to long-term complete occlusion than other reconstructive techniques (90.8% versus 67.9%, P = .03) and a lower rate of retreatment (6.6% versus 30.7%, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of ruptured blister-like aneurysms is associated with high rates of complete occlusion and good mid- to long-term neurologic outcomes in most patients. Deconstructive techniques are associated with higher occlusion rates but a higher risk of perioperative ischemic stroke. In the reconstructive group, flow diversion carries a higher level of complete occlusion and similar clinical outcomes.

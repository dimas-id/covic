BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic viral hepatitis are at a higher risk for cognitive dysfunction. Little is known about the association between hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and cognitive function. METHODS: From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2002, we selected study participants (≥60 years, n = 1,529) without hepatitis B, C, or D virus infection; without previous hepatitis A vaccination; and without abnormal liver function. HAV-seropositive participants represented people with previous HAV infection. Psychomotor speed and executive functioning domain of cognitive function were measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). RESULTS: HAV-seropositive participants had lower DSST scores than HAV-seronegative participants (weighted mean, 44.4 vs 53.9, p < .001). We designated HAV-seronegative participants as the reference group. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the weighted β coefficient of DSST score was −9.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] −9.57 to −9.54, p < .001) for the HAV-seropositive participants. In a multivariable model, the weighted adjusted β coefficient of DSST score was −2.48 (95% CI −2.49 to −2.46, p < .001) for the HAV-seropositive participants. CONCLUSION: HAV seropositivity is associated with slower psychomotor speed among the U.S. community-dwelling elders.

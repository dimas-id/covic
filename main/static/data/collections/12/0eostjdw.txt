Norovirus (NoV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that causes acute gastroenteritis and is responsible for 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. No effective vaccine or treatment is available. Recent studies have shown that the nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T-705) and 2'-C-methyl-cytidine (2CM-C) inhibit NoV replication in vitro and in animal models, but their precise mechanism of action is unknown. We evaluated the molecular interactions between nucleoside triphosphates and NoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NoVpol), the enzyme responsible for replication and transcription of NoV genomic RNA. We found that T-705 ribonucleoside triphosphate (RTP) and 2CM-C triphosphate (2CM-CTP) equally inhibited human and mouse NoVpol activities at concentrations resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition (IC50s) in the low micromolar range. 2CM-CTP inhibited the viral polymerases by competing directly with natural CTP during primer elongation, whereas T-705 RTP competed mostly with ATP and GTP at the initiation and elongation steps. Incorporation of 2CM-CTP into viral RNA blocked subsequent RNA synthesis, whereas T-705 RTP did not cause immediate chain termination of NoVpol. 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP displayed low levels of enzyme selectivity, as they were both recognized as substrates by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The level of discrimination by the human enzyme was increased with a novel analog of T-705 RTP containing a 2'-C-methyl substitution. Collectively, our data suggest that 2CM-C inhibits replication of NoV by acting as a classic chain terminator, while T-705 may inhibit the virus by multiple mechanisms of action. Understanding the precise mechanism of action of anti-NoV compounds could provide a rational basis for optimizing their inhibition potencies and selectivities.

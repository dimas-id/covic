COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. COVID-19 outbreak, which caused thousands of deaths, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The infection has been reported to demonstrate different types of cutaneous manifestations including urticarial, maculopapular, papulovesicular, purpuric, livedoid, and thrombotic-ischemic lesions. Given the high mortality rate of the infection, timely and accurate identification of relevant cutaneous manifestations may play a key role in the early diagnosis and management. In this study, we provide a review with a focus on the reported cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.

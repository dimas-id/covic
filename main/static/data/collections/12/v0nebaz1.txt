Covid-19 infection is now a pandemic disease. Most patients have mild symptoms without the need for hospitalization. On average, 5% of the COVID-19-positive patients have severe respiratory symptoms. We present 3 patients aged 45, 67 and 75 years, who were admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory symptoms. We describe the presentation of the COVID-19 patients on the emergency department, the development of the disease, and the treatment of these patients on the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 is a novel condition affecting all the world, so every manifestation of disease should be reported. Neurologic manifestations of the disease are increasingly identified and this will help clinician to improve their diagnostic and therapeutic skills in dealing with COVID-19 patients. CASE: In this article we report a 41-year-old male that developed ascending paresthesia and paralysis following infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Electrodiagnostic evaluation in patient revealed demyelinating type polyneuropathy and patient diagnosed as Guillain-Barré syndrome (AIDP type) and treated with IVIG which resulted in favorable response. CONCLUSIONS: Considering this report and other reports that are mentioned in our short review, there is probably causal relationship between COVID-19 and development of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Abstract We report new sensing element based on double-etched porous silicon (DEPSi) for sensitive detection of influenza viruses (H1N1). The proposed structure provided efficient penetration of virions into sensitive layer and trapping of them. Adsorption of the viruses led to significant shift of resonant frequency of DEPSi coupled with a coil, measured by impedance spectrometer. The detection limit of virions was lower than 100 TCID50. The results can be used for invention of H1N1 sensor, which provide rapid, label-free and low-cost detection of influenza.

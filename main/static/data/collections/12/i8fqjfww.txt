More than 60 genomic loci have been implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and exome-wide association studies as conferring an increased risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the causal gene and variant is often unclear. Using the functional analysis of genetic variants in experimental animal models, we anticipate understanding which candidate gene at a specific locus is associated with atherosclerosis and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, ultimately leading to the identification of causal pathways in atherosclerosis and may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

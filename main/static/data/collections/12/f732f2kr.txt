PyRes is a complete theorem prover for classical first-order logic. It is not designed for high performance, but to clearly demonstrate the core concepts of a saturating theorem prover. The system is written in extensively commented Python, explaining data structures, algorithms, and many of the underlying theoretical concepts. The prover implements binary resolution with factoring and optional negative literal selection. Equality is handled by adding the basic axioms of equality. PyRes uses the given-clause algorithm, optionally controlled by weight- and age evaluations for clause selection. The prover can read TPTP CNF/FOF input files and produces TPTP/TSTP proof objects. Evaluation shows, as expected, mediocre performance compared to modern high-performance systems, with relatively better performance for problems without equality. However, the implementation seems to be sound and complete.

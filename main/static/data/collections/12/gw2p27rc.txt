We describe a patient in whom clinical evidence of liver and lung dysfunction developed after he received the second dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, despite no serologic evidence of viral hepatitis. However, liver biopsy specimens demonstrated both surface antigens and core antigens, possibly indicating silent hepatitis B virus infection. A search for an infective etiology for the patientâ€™s subsequent clinical deterioration in lung function did not yield pathogens; postmortem examination revealed evidence of immune complex-mediated organ injury in the liver, lungs, and kidneys.

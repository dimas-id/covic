Abstract Emergence of new virus and their heterogeneity are growing at an alarming rate. Sudden outburst of Nipah virus (NiV) has raised serious question about their instant management using conventional medication and diagnostic measures. A coherent strategy with versatility and comprehensive perspective to confront the rising distress could perhaps be effectuated by implementation of nanotechnology. But in concurrent to resourceful and precise execution of nano-based medication, there is an ultimate need of concrete understanding of the NIV pathogenesis. Moreover, to amplify the effectiveness of nano-based approach in a conquest against NiV, a list of developed nanosystem with antiviral activity is also a prerequisite. Therefore the present review provides a meticulous cognizance of cellular and molecular pathogenesis of NiV. Conventional as well several nano-based diagnosis experimentations against viruses have been discussed. Lastly, potential efficacy of different forms of nano-based systems as convenient means to shield mankind against NiV has also been introduced.

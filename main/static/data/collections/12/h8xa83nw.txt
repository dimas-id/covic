Transport of micron particles in a displacement ventilated room was simulated using both the Eulerian-Eulerian model and the Eulerian-Lagrangian model. The same inter-phase action mechanisms were included in both models. The models were compared against each other in the aspects of air velocity, particle concentration, and particle-wall interactions. It was found that the two models have similar accuracy in predicting the airflow field while each of them has its own advantage and drawback in modelling particle concentration and particle-wall interactions. The E-E model is capable of providing a mechanistic description of the inter-phase interactions, whilst the E-L model has obvious advantage in modelling particle-wall interactions. Advices were given for choosing an appropriate model for modelling particulate contaminant transport in indoor environments.

We describe the case of a 4-year-old child undergoing extensive burn surgery with refractory intraoperative hypothermia. A low-dose nitroglycerin infusion was initiated to reverse vasoconstriction and improve heat absorption, after which the child's temperature steadily improved. In hypothermic burn patients, topical vasoconstrictors may hinder surface warming efforts. A vasodilator infusion may aid in warming the pediatric patient undergoing extensive excision and grafting.

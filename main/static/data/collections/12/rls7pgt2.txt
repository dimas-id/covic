OBJECTIVE: To describe 123I-FP-CIT (DAT scan) SPECT findings in progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) patients and to compare those findings with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). BACKGROUND: PAOS is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which patients present with apraxia of speech, a motor speech disorder affecting programming and planning of speech. Patients with PAOS predictably develop Parkinsonism. DAT scan is a neuroimaging tool that assesses the integrity of presynaptic dopamine transporters in striatum and is usually abnormal in PSP and CBS. METHODS: As part of an NIH-funded grant, we performed a DAT scan on 17 PAOS patients early in the disease course. DaTQUANT software was used to quantify uptake in the left and right caudate and anterior/posterior putamen, with striatum to background ratios (SBRs). The PAOS cohort was compared to 15 PSP and 8 CBS patients. RESULTS: Five PAOS patients (29%) showed abnormalities in at least one striatal region on DAT scan. When the five PAOS patients with abnormal DAT were compared to the PSP and CBS patients, the only difference observed was lower uptake in the posterior putamen in PSP (p = 0.03). There were no differences is putamen/caudate ratio or in symmetry of uptake, across all groups. There was also no difference in MDS-UPDRS-III scores between PAOS patients with and without abnormal DAT scans (p = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal DAT scan is observed early in the disease course in approximately 30% of PAOS patients, with striatal abnormalities similar to those in PSP and CBS.

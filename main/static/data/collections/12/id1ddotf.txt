Periodontal disease is one of the most common diseases diagnosed in dogs and cats. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is a treatment alternative to extraction of strategically important teeth. The barrier membrane used in the GTR procedure is of key importance. The purpose of this case series was to evaluate a liquid polymer gel as a membrane for GTR. The polymer gel ( N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and poly [DL-lactide]) combined with 8.5% doxycycline hyclate was used in place of a traditional membrane in 4 teeth. The teeth were re-examined 6 months postoperatively for radiographic evaluation. A decrease in probing depth and new alveolar bone formation was seen 6 months postoperatively. Improvement in periodontal disease stage was seen in 2 of the 4 teeth. Larger controlled trials with histopathologic evaluation are indicated to further assess the use of this polymer as a membrane in GTR. However, the clinical outcomes of all 4 treated teeth were considered successful.

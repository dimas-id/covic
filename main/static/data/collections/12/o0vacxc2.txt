Viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and metazoa (parasitic worms and arthropods) are among the aetiological agents of zoonoses and sapronoses. Our survey only concerns the agents of microbial diseases (i.e., not the metazoan invasions and infestations), and is arranged according to systematic position. In addition, a new zoonotic disease caused by prions – variant of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease – is included.

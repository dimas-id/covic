BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy is increasingly used for pulmonary sequestration; however, there are few descriptions of safe handling of the aberrant artery. Here we clarify the safe handling of an aberrant artery using a clinical review and an experimental model. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent lobectomy for pulmonary sequestration with aberrant arteries at the Nippon Medical School between January 2008 and December 2010. This was supplemented by an experimental pressure test using vessels obtained from pigs. RESULTS We identified four patients with aberrant arteries that were successfully occluded via either stapling. In the experimental model, we divided pig vessels into small-diameter (S) and large-diameter (L) groups. The 1.0-mm-high staples were stronger in the S group than in the L group (p = 0.028). In the L group, the 2.0-mm-high staples were stronger than the 1.0-mm staples (p = 0.015). Leakage from the staple line was associated with a poorer B-shape of inserted staples. CONCLUSIONS The techniques described in this report are useful in successful minimally invasive transection of an aberrant artery (other than very thin vessels) when resecting a pulmonary sequestration by stapler only. A detailed investigation should be performed to determine the most appropriate stapler or cartridge.

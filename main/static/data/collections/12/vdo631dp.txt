Segmental liver grafts from DCD in pediatric LT have been safely used even in acute liver failure situations. Furthermore, despite the risk of antibody-mediated acute rejection, some studies have also demonstrated the safety of ABO incompatible LT in infants. The use of such grafts can be beneficial by reducing the time on the transplant waiting list but they are more susceptible to initial dysfunction and there is a lack of enthusiasm to consider their use especially for an emergency LT as a life-saving procedure. In this short article, we describe the use and successful outcome in a neonate with fulminant acute liver failure secondary to neonatal hemochromatosis who received an ABO-incompatible reduced-size DCD graft.

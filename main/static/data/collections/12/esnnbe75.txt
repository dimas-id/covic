AbstractChikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes an acute febrile illness usually accompanied by severe polyarthralgia and polyarthritis. Previous studies have shown that older age, female gender, and some comorbid conditions are associated with chronic CHIKV arthritis. However, the factors associated with acute arthralgia and arthritis are not well known. Thus, we studied the clinical manifestations associated with acute peripheral joint involvement in a group of CHIKV patients from Puerto Rico. Patients with a history of fever for < 7 days evaluated at the emergency department of a university-based hospital were tested for several pathogens including CHIKV. All patients with laboratory-positive CHIKV infection were studied. Demographic features, clinical manifestations, and comorbidities were determined. Patients with and without peripheral joint involvement were compared using bivariable and multivariable analyses. In total, 172 patients with CHIKV fever were evaluated; 52.9% were women. The mean (standard deviation) age was 21.1 years (19.3). Peripheral arthralgia and/or arthritis were seen in 156 (90.7%) patients. In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age and gender, peripheral joint involvement was associated with myalgia (odds ratio [OR] = 4.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-14.72), back pain (OR = 16.77, 95% CI = 3.07-313.82), ocular pain (OR = 8.88, 95% CI = 1.65-165.19), headache (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.06-12.53), anorexia (OR = 5.68, 95% CI = 1.87-18.97), and nausea (OR = 6.88, 95% CI = 2.05-31.49). In conclusion, in this population of patients with acute CHIKV infection, peripheral joint involvement was associated with myalgia and back pain as well as nonmusculoskeletal manifestations such as headache, ocular pain, anorexia, and nausea.

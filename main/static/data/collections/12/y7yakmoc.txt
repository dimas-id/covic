Unprecedented times call for extraordinary measures. While surgeons across the globe try to comprehend the evolving facade of the COVID‐19 pandemic and improvise surgical practice to the best of their ability, the psychological impact of the stress on their own mental health and well‐being has been underestimated. This paper aims to review the indirect and overt factors that may affect the mental health of a surgeon in the present circumstances. Furthermore, it will aim to highlight key coping mechanisms at an individual and institutional level, so as to mitigate the negative psychological impact on surgeons.

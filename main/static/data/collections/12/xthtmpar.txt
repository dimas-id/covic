Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the widespread implementation of social distancing measures. Adhering to social distancing may be particularly challenging for adolescents, for whom interaction with peers is especially important. We argue that young peopleâ€™s capacity to encourage each other to observe social distancing rules should be harnessed.

A series of 36 thiosemicarbazone analogues containing the thiochromanone molecular scaffold functionalized primarily at the C-6 position were prepared by chemical synthesis and evaluated as inhibitors of cathepsins L and B. The most promising inhibitors from this group are selective for cathepsin L and demonstrate IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. In nearly all cases, the thiochromanone sulfide analogues show superior inhibition of cathepsin L as compared to their corresponding thiochromanone sulfone derivatives. Without exception, the compounds evaluated were inactive (IC50 > 10000 nM) against cathepsin B. The most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 46 nM) of cathepsin L proved to be the 6,7-difluoro analogue 4. This small library of compounds significantly expands the structure-activity relationship known for small molecule, nonpeptidic inhibitors of cathepsin L.

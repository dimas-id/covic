Globalization has resulted in enhanced trade in livestock and livestock products leading to increased risk of diseases to livestock and human beings. The emergence of highly contagious viral diseases of livestock and poultry such as foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants, African swine fever (ASF), Newcastle disease, avian influenza and zoonotic diseases caused by viruses like Ebola, West Nile, Nipah, Hendra and swine influenza (H1N1) have necessitated the formulation of policies and regulatory frameworks for preventing ingress of exotic diseases and controlling dissemination of endemic diseases within the country. Biosecurity measures are important to maintain and improve animal health and reduce the risks. In this review, the risks of introduction of infections through livestock and livestock products, routes of transmission and general biosecurity measures to reduce these risks have been discussed.

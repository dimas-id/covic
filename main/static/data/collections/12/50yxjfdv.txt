PURPOSE The treatment of deep-seeded pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a challenging task. We describe our experience using a new detachable tip microcatheter in the embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations, pial arteriovenous fistulas, and vein of Galen malformations. We describe the safety and efficacy using a new detachable tip microcatheter in the treatment of pediatric deep brain arteriovenous malformations, pial malformations, and vein of Galen malformations. METHODS During a period of 9 months from March 2013 through January 2014, 11 pediatric patients in 14 procedures with 27 total injections were selected for treatment with a detachable tip under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compassionate use exemption and were admitted to our department for treatment of their brain AVM using a liquid embolic agent and a detachable tip microcatheter. The ages of the patients ranged from 3 months to 18 years old. RESULTS Of the 27 total injections done, the tip detached in seven cases. For the 16 n-BCA injections, the tip detached six times (37.5 %), and for the 11 Onyx injections, the tip detached one time (9 %). There were no cases of premature microcatheter detachment during normal vessel navigation. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of these detachable tip microcatheters allows for a safe and relaxed injection that permits a true circumferential occlusion, and may further permit filling a larger amount of angioarchitecture without the risk of distal migration, or vessel damage during the usual rapid removal of non detachable micocatheters.

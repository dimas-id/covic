Polymorphisms of human Fc γ‐receptor IIA (FcγRIIA) and mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) genes have been associated with susceptibility to or severity of some infectious diseases. In order to investigate whether these genetic factors might influence susceptibility to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐Cov) as well as the course and severity of the infection, we evaluated polymorphisms of FcγRIIA and MBL genes in DNA samples from a group of approximately 180 people from Hong Kong who were infected with SARS‐Cov. These included 132 patients who had moderate course of SARS infection (home subgroup), 26 patients with a severe course requiring treatment in an intensive care ward (ICU subgroup) and a subgroup of 22 patients who died from SARS (deceased subgroup). A total of 200 normal blood donors from the same region were used as controls. A significant association was found between the FcγRIIA‐R/R131 genotype and a severe course of SARS, with higher frequency of homozygosity for FcγRIIA‐R/R131 in the ICU subgroup of SARS patients when compared with controls (P = 0.03; odds ratio: 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1–9.1). In comparison with controls, a significant difference in linear trend distribution of FcγRIIA genotypes was seen among the severe SARS patients (ICU and deceased subgroups) without co‐morbidity, and the incidence of FcγRIIA‐H/H131 was lower in these patients as well. There were no significant differences in MBL genotypes and allele frequencies among SARS patients and controls. The study reveals that in addition to age and co‐morbidity, FcγRIIA polymorphism of individuals may also influence outcome after infection with the SARS‐Cov.

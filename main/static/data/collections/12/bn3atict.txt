In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels in primary dysmenorrhea patients. The study employed a cross-sectional design. Eighty-nine female university students with primary dysmenorrhea were included in the study. All patients underwent complete clinical and laboratory investigations, including serum ADMA, AMH levels, pelvic ultrasonography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis were used to evaluate associations between continuous data. Categorical associations were evaluated using χ(2) test. Correlation analysis between serum ADMA and AMH levels in the study group showed a highly significant positive relationship (Pearson correlation = 0.978, p = 0.01). Our study has shown a significant positive correlation between serum ADMA and AMH levels in primary dysmenorrhea. Serum ADMA levels may have the potential to demonstrate ovarian reserve.

Adrenocortical hormones were first prepared from the adrenal gland as a new compound by Kendall in 1935 [1]. Thirteen years later, Hench et al. [2] observed a miraculous effect of cortisone in a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis, which opened new doors to innovative treatments for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Against this background, Kendall, Hench, and Reichstein were awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. Since then, glucocorticoids have been used as a first-line therapy for immune-mediated conditions or as an adjunctive therapy in many inflammatory, infectious, or malignant diseases.

Background The trajectory of ischemic stroke patients attributable to large vessel occlusion is fundamentally altered by endovascular thrombectomy. This study aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting 3-month mortality risk in patients with ischemic stroke attributed to artery occlusion in anterior circulation who received successful endovascular thrombectomy treatment. Methods and Results Patients with successful endovascular thrombectomy (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction IIb or III) were enrolled from a multicenter registry as the training cohort. Step-wise logistic regression with Akaike information criterion was utilized to establish the best-fit nomogram. The discriminative value of the nomogram was tested by concordance index. An additional 224 patients from 2 comprehensive stroke centers were prospectively recruited as the test cohort for validating the new nomogram. Altogether, 417 patients were enrolled in the training cohort. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10), poor pretreatment collateral status (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.18-3.85), baseline blood glucose level (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.21), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 9.51; 95% CI, 4.54-19.92), and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.12) were associated with mortality and were incorporated in the nomogram. The c-index of the nomogram was 0.835 (95% CI, 0.785-0.885) in the training cohort and 0.758 (95% CI, 0.667-0.849) in the test cohort. Conclusions The nomogram, composed of age, pretreatment collateral status, baseline blood glucose level, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, may predict risk of mortality in patients with ischemic stroke and treated successfully with endovascular thrombectomy.

Bocaparvovirus (BOV) is a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses and a possible cause of respiratory, enteric, and neurological diseases in humans and animals. Here, two highly divergent BOVs (tentatively named as Himalayan marmot BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the livers and feces of wild Himalayan marmots in China, by viral metagenomic analysis. Five of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five of 99 fecal samples from these animals for HMBOV2. Their nearly complete genome sequences are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic organization and containing protein-coding motifs typical for BOVs. Based on their NS1, NP1, and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine BOV SX/1-2 (approximately 77.0%/50.0%, 50.0%/53.0%, and 79.0%/54.0% amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 formed two distinctly independent branches in BOVs. According to these results, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are two different novel species in the Bocaparvovirus genus. Their identification expands our knowledge of the genetic diversity and evolution of BOVs. Further studies are needed to investigate their potential pathogenicity and their impact on Himalayan marmots and humans.

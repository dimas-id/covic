Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) male Wistar rats were inoculated intranasally with Parker's rat coronavirus (PRC), then killed at various intervals post-inoculation (pi). PRC inoculated rats had transient respiratory signs. Intermandibular swelling was evident in some rats at 6-8 days pi. During the acute stages of the disease, inflammatory lesions were present in the respiratory tract and in the salivary and lacrimal glands. Regenerative lesions were observed in the salivary and lacrimal glands at 2 weeks pi. Inoculated rats seroconverted at 8-14 days pi, and significant coronaviral antibody titers were present in inoculated rats examined at 21 days pi with PRC. Changes in the respiratory tract and salivary and lacrimal glands were identical in incidence, distribution and nature to those observed in sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus inoculated Wistar rats. Thus, in the absence of viral isolation and characterization, "rat coronavirus infection" is a more appropriate term than either PRC infection or sialodacryoadenitis (SDA).

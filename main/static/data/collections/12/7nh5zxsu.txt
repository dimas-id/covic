Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) technique used for its portability, widespread availability, and ability to provide real-time diagnostic information procedural guidance. LUS outperforms lung auscultation and chest X-ray, and is an alternative to chest computed tomography in select cases. Cardiologists may enhance their physical and echocardiographic examination with the addition of LUS. We present a practical guide to LUS, including device selection, scanning, findings, and interpretation. We outline a 3-point scanning protocol using 2D and M-mode imaging to evaluate the pleural line, pleural space, and parenchyma. We describe LUS findings and interpretation for common causes of respiratory failure. We provide guidance specific of COVID-19, which at the time of writing is responsible for a global pandemic. In this context, LUS emerges as a particularly useful tool for the diagnosis and management of patients with cardiopulmonary disease.

Abstract Gene expression was studied in Atlantic cod fed two different diets, fish meal (FM) and dehulled and extracted soybean meal (SBM). RNA was isolated from the distal part of the mid-intestine of Atlantic cod and suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was employed to screen for genes that showed changes in expression in response to the two dietary treatments. We made a cDNA subtracted library, isolated and sequenced 192 clones. Identification of 157 clones was predicted by BLAST. Most of the clones were previously unidentified in cod. Expression of 12 selected clones was further studied by quantitative PCR. Expression of four clones showing similarity to aminopeptidase N, transcobalamin I precursor, cytochrome P450 3A40, and ras-related nuclear protein was significantly up regulated in intestine of cod fed SBM compared to cod fed FM. A trend towards up regulation of a clone with similarity to fatty acid binding protein in SBM-fed cod was also observed. No significant differences in expression were observed for: transmembrane 4 superfamily protein member, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, glutathione peroxidase, peroxiredoxin 4, SEC61, F-BOX, and 14-3-3.

While the focus of the medical community is on the management of COVID-19 and its associated complex presentations, it is critical to recognize that patients will continue to present with other medical problems that require urgent therapeutic interventions. There is growing concern that such interventions might have an impact on the natural history of COVID-19. We present a case of a patient who presented with unstable angina and multivessel coronary artery disease for which coronary artery bypass surgery was indicated and performed. Unfortunately, he succumbed to respiratory complications attributed to COVID-19. Our experience suggests concern about adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who might be infected with COVID-19. Clearly, additional investigations and experience are needed.

Recombinant viruses derived from coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus strains JHM and A59, were used to map biologic properties of the virus to viral genes. The 3' portion (about 25%) of the viral genome, including the genes coding for all of the structural proteins, controls biologic properties such as organ tropism of the virus, pattern of the virus-induced central nervous system pathology in mice, plaque morphology, and virus yield in tissue culture.

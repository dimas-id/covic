Oculoplastic surgeries encompass both emergency surgeries for traumatic conditions and infectious disorders as well as elective aesthetic procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a drastic change in this practice. Given the highly infectious nature of the disease as well as the global scarcity of medical resources; it is only prudent to treat only emergent conditions during the pandemic as we incorporate evidence-based screening and protective measures into our practices. This manuscript is a compilation of evidence-based guidelines for surgical procedures that oculoplastic surgeons can employ during the COVID-19 pandemic. These guidelines also serve as the basic framework upon which further recommendations may be based on in the future, as elective surgeries start being performed on a regular basis.

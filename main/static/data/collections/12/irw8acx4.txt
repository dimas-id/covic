Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex, lifelong condition that is disproportionately prevalent among minority populations. Haitian immigrants (HIs) living in the US with T2D have unique factors that influence diagnosis, treatment, and self-management. The purpose of this integrative review was to provide a synthesis of the research on T2D in the HI population. In a systematic literature search, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. Three themes were identified: risk factors for less self-management and/or worse metabolic control; protective factors for better self-management and/or metabolic control; and mixed results. HIs had higher HbA1c, yet better self-management, different genetic profiles, and lower levels of vitamin D and hemoglobin concentration compared to other ethnic groups. HIs also reported better dietary quality, less healthcare utilization, and higher perceived emotional/psychological stress compared to other ethnic groups. This study has implications for practice for integrating the unique cultural factors when assessing and intervening with HIs.

Often times terms such as Big Data, increasing digital footprints in the Internet accompanied with advancing analytical techniques, represent a major opportunity to improve public health surveillance and delivery of interventions. However, early adaption of Big Data in other fields revealed ethical challenges that could undermine privacy and autonomy of individuals and cause stigmatization. This chapter aims to identify the benefits and risks associated with the public health application of Big Data through ethical lenses. In doing so, it highlights the need for ethical discussion and framework towards an effective utilization of technologies. We then discuss key strategies to mitigate potentially harmful aspects of Big Data to facilitate its safe and effective implementation.

Historically, the dog played an important role as a laboratory animal in biomedical research. Although numbers are declining, the use of dogs continues to be common in pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular studies. The normal biology of the dog as both a laboratory and a companion animal has been well studied and reference values are presented here as a clinical and experimental resource. This provides the necessary background to discuss the spontaneous diseases, including infectious and neoplastic conditions, prevalent in purpose bred as well as random source dogs used in biomedical research. In addition, diseases and conditions that arise secondary to the housing and experimental manipulation of dogs is discussed with emphasis on treatment and prevention.

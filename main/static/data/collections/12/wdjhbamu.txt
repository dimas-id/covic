The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of LigaSure small jaws in superficial parotidectomy for blood loss, operative time and facial nerve function. This was a prospective non-randomized study of 35 patients with a benign parotid tumor. Sixteen patients had LigaSure small jaws parotidectomy, and 19 patients had cold knife parotidectomy. Operative time, blood loss, facial palsy and other complications were assessed. The use of LigaSure was associated with a significant reduction in mean operative time (128 min vs. 155, p = 0.04) and intraoperative blood loss (40 mL vs. 115 mL, p < 0.001). Transient facial weakness was seen in 4 of the 16 patients in the LigaSure group and in 1 of the 19 patients in the conventional group (p = 0.2). No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to hemorrhage, length of hospital stay, infection, wound healing, salivary fistula or seroma. LigaSure small jaws in parotidectomy results in significantly less blood loss and operative time compared to cold knife dissection.

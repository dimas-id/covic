BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Although endovascular treatment has become a standard therapy in patients with acute stroke, the benefit for very old patients remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was the evaluation of procedural and outcome data of patients ≥90 years undergoing endovascular stroke treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of patients ≥90 years in whom endovascular stroke treatment was performed between January 2011 and January 2016. Recanalization was assessed according to the TICI score. The clinical condition was evaluated on admission (NIHSS, prestroke mRS), at discharge (NIHSS), and after 3 months (mRS). RESULTS Twenty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. The median prestroke mRS was 2. Successful recanalization (TICI ≥ 2b) was achieved in 22 patients (75.9%). In 9 patients, an NIHSS improvement ≥ 10 points was noted between admission and discharge. After 3 months, 17.2% of the patients had an mRS of 0-2 or exhibited prestroke mRS, and 24.1% achieved mRS 0-3. Mortality rate was 44.8%. There was only 1 minor procedure-related complication (small SAH without clinical sequelae). CONCLUSIONS Despite high mortality rates and only moderate overall outcome, 17.2% of the patients achieved mRS 0-2 or prestroke mRS, and no serious procedure-related complications occurred. Therefore, very high age should not per se be an exclusion criterion for endovascular stroke treatment.

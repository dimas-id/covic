OBJECTIVE Physical activity can improve the health and well-being of individuals receiving adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, but engagement in physical activity can be low. This review synthesises the barriers and facilitators to engaging with and participating in physical activity whilst receiving treatment. METHODS The metasynthesis of qualitative studies is reported in line with the PRISMA statement. We systematically searched eight databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, CINAHL, British Library, OpenGrey, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index) from inception to November 30, 2017. A total of 1276 abstracts were retrieved and screened by two reviewers independently. Data from eligible studies were extracted and critically appraised. As this review concerns qualitative studies only, a CER-QUAL GRADE assessment was completed. RESULTS A total of 13 studies were included. Four clear themes emerged (side effects of treatment, beliefs about physical activity, focus on health not illness, and social factors) each containing both barriers and facilitators. Key facilitators to participating in physical activity during adjuvant treatment included positive physical benefits, improvements in psychological well-being, and increased self-esteem and empowerment. Further, having a knowledgeable instructor, tailored information, and a supportive environment were important to women undergoing treatment. Main barriers included fatigue and pain, as well as work and caring responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS Incorporating physical activity into treatment regimens is important. Focusing on being less sedentary and providing accurate, tailored information should be prioritised within future interventions. Having a supportive environment and accounting for the particular barriers or facilitators to engagement identified here should aid the success of future interventions.

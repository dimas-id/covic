OBJECTIVES: To design a standardized imaging diagnostic reporting mode for screening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to prospectively verify its effectiveness in clinical practice. METHODS: A new classification and standardized imaging diagnosis report mode of viral pneumonia was established by studying and summarizing the imaging findings of various kinds of viral pneumonia, combining with lesion density, interstitial changes, pleural effusion, lymph nodes, and some special signs. After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features. COVID-19 cases were screened retrospectively in the single-center. The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested. RESULTS: There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination. Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign. In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942. CONCLUSIONS: The standardized imaging diagnosis report mode based on COVID-19 chest image features is effective and practical, which should be popularized.

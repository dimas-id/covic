SARS-CoV-2, a novel ÃŸ-coronavirus, cause severe pneumonia and has spread throughout the globe rapidly. The disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is named COVID-19. To date, real-time RT-PCR is the only test able to confirm this infection. However, the accuracy of RT-PCR depends on several factors; variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of detection. Here, we developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay that detected immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM. The assay cut-off value was determined by evaluating the sera from healthy and infected patients for pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate assay performance, we detected IgG and IgM in the sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM was 71.4% and 57.2%, respectively. Therefore, combining our immunoassay with real-time RT-PCR might enhance the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19.

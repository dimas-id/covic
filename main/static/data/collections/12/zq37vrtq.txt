This study evaluated age-related trabecular meshwork (TM) height variations in the eyes of adults in different age groups. We hypothesised that a reduction in TM occurs with increasing age. This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at Yonsei University Gangnam Severance Hospital between January 2015 and June 2019. We randomly included 250 eyes of 125 patients who underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The distance from the scleral spur to Schwalbe's line in patients with normal open anterior chamber angle was measured using AS-OCT. Results were stratified based on patients' age group-&#8804;40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years. Thereafter, the results were compared among the age groups. The mean TM height of the patients was 770.929 ± 76.776 µm. TM height was 853.188 ± 94.117 µm in patients aged &#8804;40 years; it was 815.309 ± 75.723, 798.115 ± 66.040, 770.942 ± 52.774, 726.716 ± 63.979, and 715.968 ± 63.403 µm in patients aged 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years, respectively. The TM height tended to decrease with increasing age (P < 0.001). TM height was significantly shorter in older patients than in younger ones. Therefore, TM height may change with age and may contribute to increased glaucoma risk and prevalence.

BACKGROUND Early rectal tumor is usually managed by local excision. A novel method-colonoscopy-assisted transanal minimally invasive surgery via glove port (CA-TAMIS-GP)-for resecting early rectal tumor was developed and compared with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed CA-TAMIS-GP surgery on 26 patients from January 2014 to February 2016. For better analysis, we retrospectively collected data from 31 patients who underwent ESD between October 2012 and December 2013; overall, 57 patients diagnosed with early rectal tumor were included in this study. Perioperative conditions and long-term outcomes of both groups were compared. RESULTS All lesions were dissected completely and successfully without conversion to open surgery or major complications. On histopathologic examination, all specimens in this study had negative margins. All patients had uneventful postoperative recoveries, except 3 patients of CA-TAMIS-GP with minor hematochezia, which resolved spontaneously; 7 ESD patients had late-onset bleeding and 3 needed colonoscopic hemostasis; 2 patients in each group had mild fever. The CA-TAMIS-GP group had a shorter operation time, less hemorrhage, and a lower average consumable cost than the ESD group (P < 0.05); moreover, the CA-TAMIS-GP group had no recurrence or long-term complications during a follow-up of 10-32 months, whereas3 patients in the ESD group developed local recurrence during a follow-up of 24-36 months. CONCLUSIONS The CA-TAMIS-GP is a new method that is safe and effective in patients with early rectal tumor and appears to have a shorter operation time and less blood loss as compared with ESD.

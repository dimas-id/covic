Central to immune defence mechanisms is the role of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB). This is a complex biochemical topic with ever more controls revealed. NF-kB determines the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Pharmacologists step in with possible means of control. Other systems involved in defence include the cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) enzyme and perioxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Insulin receptor activation needs to be seen in context. The mTOR system directs uptake of nutrients by cells. mTOR is suppressed by rapamycin, whose usage is now quite considerable in the control of transplant rejection.

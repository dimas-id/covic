BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus crisis, COVID-19, has affected all orthopedic surgeons. Surgeons at early stages of their career are at risk of being affected differently than their more established counterparts. METHODS: We conducted an online survey for members of the Young Arthroplasty Group to determine what effects this had on their current practice. RESULTS: Nearly 40% of our surveyed group responded ranging from residents, fellows, and early career surgeons. All groups had been affected by the crisis, with different impacts on each subgroup. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had significant impact on young surgeons affecting their compensation, redeployment, and career advancement. Available resources should be offered to this group, where available, to mitigate the impact of the crisis.

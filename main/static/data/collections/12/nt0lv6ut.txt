Background: Although recognised as effective measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing and self-isolation, have been suggested to generate burden throughout the population. To provide scientific data to help identify risk-factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. Method: Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 [≤] d [≤] 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (15%) of technology solutions during the confinement period. Conclusion: These findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period and provide a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL).

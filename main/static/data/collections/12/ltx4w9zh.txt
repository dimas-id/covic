During bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) productive infection in cell cultures, partial of intranuclear viral DNA is present in nucleosomes, and viral protein VP22 associates with histones and decreases histone H4 acetylation, indicating the involvement of histone H4 acetylation in virus replication. In this study, we demonstrated that BoHV-1 infection at the late stage (at 24 h after infection) dramatically decreased histone H3 acetylation [at residues K9 (H3K9ac) and K18 (H3K18ac)], which was supported by the pronounced depletion of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) including CBP/P300 (CREB binding protein and p300), GCN5L2 (general control of amino acid synthesis yeast homolog like 2) and PCAF (P300/CBP-associated factor). The depletion of GCN5L2 promoted by virus infection was partially mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Interestingly, the viral replication was enhanced by HAT (histone acetyltransferase) activator CTPB [N-(4-Chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-ethoxy-6-pentadecylbenzamide], and vice versa, inhibited by HAT inhibitor Anacardic acid (AA), suggesting that BoHV-1 may take advantage of histone acetylation for efficient replication. Taken together, we proposed that the HAT-dependent histone H3 acetylation plays an important role in BoHV-1 replication in MDBK (Madin-Darby bovine kidney) cells.

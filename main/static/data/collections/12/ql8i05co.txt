INTRODUCTION International data indicate that arterial, venous and microvascular thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation occur in more than 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This condition is characterized by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. METHOD Blood samples from three COVID-19 patients treated in a Hungarian intensive care unit were collected and analyzed with ClotPro® tests. EX-tests, IN-test, FIB-tests, RVV-tests, and TPA-tests were performed. The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients. RESULTS Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a "shut down" phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro®. The ClotPro® parameters were consistent with the conventional coagulation tests and corresponded with the criteria of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. CONCLUSION These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy. Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy. At present, the authorization of a clinical trial that attempts to answer these questions is in progress. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(22): 899-907.

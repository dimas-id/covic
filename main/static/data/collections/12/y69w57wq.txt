Importance: Multiple sclerosis patients have been considered a higher-risk population for COVID-19 due to the high prevalence of disability and disease-modifying therapy use; however, no study has identified clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th, 2020. Setting: This is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S. Participants: The study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exposures: Multiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy. Main Outcomes and Measure: Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death. Results: For the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16/40(40%) were male, and 21/40(52.5%) were African American. 19/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6/40(15%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P=0.0121, P=0.0373). There was differing prevalence of progressive multiple sclerosis staging in those with more severe courses (severe:2/6[33.3%]primary-progressing and 0/6[0%]secondary-progressing, moderate:1/14[7.14%] and 5/14[35.7%] vs mild:0/19[0%] and 1/19[5.26%], P=0.0075, 1 unknown). Significant disability was found in 1/19(5.26%) mild course-patients, but was in 9/15(60%, P=0.00435) of moderate course-patients and 2/6(33.3%, P=0.200) of severe course-patients. Disease-modifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses (mild:17/19[89.5%], moderate:12/15[80%] and severe:3/6[50%], P=0.123). Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple sclerosis patients with more severe COVID-19 courses tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive staging, and had a higher degree of disability. However, disease-modifying therapy use was not different among courses.

Infectious diseases have been a ferocious enemy since time immemorial. To prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases, epidemic dynamics has played an important role on investigating the transmission of infectious diseases, predicting the developing tendencies, estimating the key parameters from data published by health departments, understanding the transmission characteristics, and implementing the measures for prevention and control. In this chapter, some basic ideas of modelling the spread of infectious diseases, the main concepts of epidemic dynamics, and some developing tendencies in the study of epidemic dynamics are introduced, and some results with respect to the spread of SARS in China are given.

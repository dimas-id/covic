Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndromes associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 are emerging in recent reports. We describe a patient with critical illness consistent with atypical Kawasaki disease with cardiac dysfunction and abdominal involvement presenting weeks after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection. Our patient showed unique central nervous system involvement with small vessel vasculitis and profound hypocomplementemia, both not previously reported in case descriptions and may hint at possible disease mechanisms.

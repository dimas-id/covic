The objective of this paper is to synthesize the digital interventions initiatives to fight against COVID-19 in Bangladesh and compare with other countries. In order to obtain our research objective, we conducted a systematic review of the online content. We first reviewed the digital interventions that have been used to fight against COVID-19 across the globe. We then reviewed the initiatives that have been taken place in Bangladesh. Thereafter, we present a comparative analysis between the initiatives taken in Bangladesh and the other countries. Our findings show that while Bangladesh is capable to take benefits of the digital intervention approaches, tighter cooperation between government and private organizations as well as universities would be needed to get the most benefits. Furthermore, the government needs to make sure that the privacy of its citizens are protected.

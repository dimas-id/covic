Background and Objectives Gasless laparoscopy is an alternative method to reduce the number of carbon dioxide (CO2)-insufflated, pneumoperitoneum-related problems including shoulder pain, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and decreased cardiopulmonary function. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of gasless total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with a newly developed abdominal-wall retraction system. Methods Abdominal-wall retraction for gasless laparoscopy was performed using the newly developed J-shape retractor and the Thompson surgical retractor. Surgical outcomes between gasless TLH and conventional CO2-based TLH were compared for each of 40 patients for the period from January 2017 to October 2019. Results Between gasless TLH and conventional CO2-based TLH, no significant differences were observed for age, body mass index, parity, or surgical indications. The mean retraction setup time from skin incision was 7.4 min (range: 4-12 min) with gasless TLH. The mean total operation times were 87.9 min (range: 65-170) with gasless TLH and 90 min (range: 45-180) with conventional TLH, which showed no significant difference. Estimated blood loss and uterus weight also showed no significant intergroup difference. No major complications related to the ureter, bladder, or bowel were encountered. Conclusion Our new abdominal-wall retraction system for gasless TLH allowed for easy setup and a proper operation field in the performance of laparoscopic hysterectomy.

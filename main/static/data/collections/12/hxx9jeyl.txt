Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has been identified as the essential causal agent of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, which has spread worldwide. To discover cellular protein responses of PK-15 cells to PCV2 infection, two-dimensional liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling was employed to quantitatively identify the proteins that were differentially expressed in PK-15 from the PCV2-infected group compared to the uninfected control group. A total of 196 cellular proteins in PK-15 that were significantly altered at different time periods post-infection were identified. These differentially expressed proteins were related to the biological processes of binding, cell structure, signal transduction, cell adhesion, etc. and their interactions. Moreover, some of these proteins were further confirmed by Western blot. The high number of differentially expressed proteins identified should be very useful in elucidating the mechanism of replication and pathogenesis of PCV2 in the future.

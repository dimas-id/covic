A child with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) developed fatal encephalitis associated with human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). During chemotherapy the child had a persistent HCoV-OC43 respiratory infection and later developed progressive encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for pathogens including HCoV-OC43, but a brain biopsy was HCoV-OC43-positive by metagenomic next-generation sequencing.

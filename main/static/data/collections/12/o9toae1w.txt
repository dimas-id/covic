We consider a spectrum-like two-dimensional graphical representation of proteins based on a reduced protein model in which 20 amino acids are grouped into five classes. This particular grouping of amino acids was suggested by Riddle and co-workers in 1997. The graphical representation is based on depicting sequentially the amino acids on five horizontal lines at equal separations. One-letter codes, B, O, U, X and Y, to which numerical values 1 to 5 have been assigned, are suggested as labels for the fictional amino acids that represent all the amino acids within each group. The approach is illustrated on ND6 proteins of eight species having from 168 to 175 amino acids. While visual inspection of the novel spectral graphical representations of proteins may reveal local similarities and dissimilarities of protein sequences, arithmetic manipulations of spectra offer an elegant route to graphic visualization of the degree of similarity for selected pairs of proteins.

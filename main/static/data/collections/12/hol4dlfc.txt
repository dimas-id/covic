Abstract A 1520bp region of Cochlosoma anatis mtDNA 16S gene was subjected to DNA sequencing and a 466bp portion was compared with other protozoan 16S sequences to develop PCR primers specific for C. anatis. This PCR diagnostic method allowed identification of C. anatis from house flies, Musca domestica L., turkey gut, and fecal samples within 6h after field-collected samples reached the laboratory. House flies detected carrying C. anatis using the diagnostic 374bp amplicons represented the first record of this protozoan in house flies.

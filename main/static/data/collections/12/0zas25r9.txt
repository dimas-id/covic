OBJECTIVE To report the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to examine the difference between the younger and older age groups. DESIGN Retrospective descriptive cohort study. SETTING A regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS Children younger than 18 yrs with SARS. RESULTS Twenty-one children were included, with a mean age of 10.7 +/- 5.1 yrs. Children with SARS presented with fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, chills, headache, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Examination of the chest showed minimal auscultatory findings. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mild elevations of activated partial thromboplastin time, alanine transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase. Bacteriologic and virologic studies were all negative for common pathogens. Unilateral focal opacity was the commonest finding in chest radiography. High-resolution computerized tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic tool if the chest radiograph was negative. The clinical course was less severe in comparison with adult patients. However, adolescents (age, > or =12 yrs) resembled adults in their clinical features. When compared with the younger age group, the adolescents had significantly higher temperatures, more constitutional upset, and a greater need for steroid treatment. Children younger than 12 yrs seemed less ill but had more coughing. On the whole, the outcome was favorable. CONCLUSION Severe acute respiratory syndrome affects children, but the course is less severe. Nevertheless, the disease could have a significant psychosocial impact on children because of the potential seriousness of the disease in their adult family members.

Summary Clinical challenges exist in the management of hospitalized patients returning to the UK with potential Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, particularly with its clinical overlap with influenza, as demonstrated in this case-series and cost-analysis review of returning Hajj pilgrims. These patients were hospitalized with acute febrile respiratory illness, initially managed as potential MERS-CoV infections, but were eventually diagnosed with influenza. Additional costs were small, yet enhanced infection prevention measures created significant burdens on isolation rooms and staff time. Planning for predictable events such as Hajj is important for resource management. Here, in-house MERS-CoV diagnostic testing would have facilitated earlier diagnosis and discharge.

Retraction of the left lobe of the liver without inserting an additional trocar poses a major problem in single-incision laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The adequate visibility of the crural area can be achieved by liberalizing the fibrous appendix. The main principle of this new technique is to make the crural window visible by folding the left lobe of the liver upon itself. Single-incision Nissen fundoplication may be easily performed with this new liver retraction technique.

Several cases of life threatening respiratory disease with no identifiable cause were reported from Guangdong Province, China; these were soon followed by reports from many other countries. The disease was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A novel coronavirus, isolated from the respiratory secretions of patients, has been implicated in the causation of SARS. The modes of transmission include droplet spread, close contact, and Fomites; shedding of virus from respiratory tract is the primary mode of transmission. SARS clinically presents with high-grade fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, headache, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea, and dizziness. Chest radiographs reveal unilateral or bilateral, predominantly peripheral, areas of consolidation progressing with in a short time of bilateral patchy consolidation. Preliminary reports suggest a milder illness in young children. The case definition of probable SARS cases, laboratory investigations and precautions for prevention of spread are discussed.

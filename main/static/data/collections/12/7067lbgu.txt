We reviewed our experience with the management of intussusception presenting as a complication of laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and studied the feasibility of a laparoscopic intervention to treat or prevent this condition. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 12 patients diagnosed with intussusception, following gastrectomy, from 2008 to 2017, including clinical manifestations, incidence, post-LG time-interval before diagnosis, and treatment. Totally, 12/2300 gastrectomy patients (0.52%) developed intussusception. All 12 had undergone laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer (12/1250, 0.96%) and presented with intussusception through a side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis. The mean latency period was 423.8 (range: 86 to 1500) days. Four patients underwent emergent laparoscopic reduction of the efferent loop without bowel resection, along with fixation of the reduced jejunum to the afferent loop and the small bowel mesentery, to prevent a recurrence. One patient required open surgery with manual reduction and segmental resection of the gangrenous small bowel portion. All operated patients recovered without any complications. Intussusception resolved spontaneously in the remaining 7/12 patients. We found that a laparoscopic approach can be used for preventing or managing post-LG intussusception. We found that recurrence can be prevented or treated by anchoring and fixing the (reduced) efferent loop to the afferent loop and the small bowel mesentery.

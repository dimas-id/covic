BACKGROUND It was investigated the effect of using normobaric oxygen (NO) in addition to antibiotherapy in experimental peritonitis and the changes of rectal fever (RF), WBC, CRP and procalcitonin levels were evaluated. METHODS After the preliminary research of the normal values, rats were infected by E. coli intraperitoneally. Four groups were assigned into "no therapy", "given NO", "given antibiotic", "given antibiotic + NO" groups. RESULTS The decline of RF and WBC levels on 3rd and 5th days was recorded in antibiotic + NO group versus the other groups. It was observed that group 4 was superior to the others. The positivity of periton cultures and the inflammation in the muscle were found to be less in antibiotic + NO group. No correlation was found between pathological and microbiological recovery and blood CRP level in all groups. But a significant decrease in blood procalcitonin level was determined in group 4 compared to the other groups. On day 3, procalcitonin and CRP levels increased with increasing WBC levels. On day 5, procalcitonin levels also decreased in groups with decreased WBC levels, but no significant correlation was found between CRP and WBC levels. CONCLUSION It was concluded that using of NO in addition to antibiotherapy could increase the success rate of experimental intraabdominal sepsis therapy and blood procalcitonin and WBC levels could be more beneficial than CRP levels in monitoring of the severity of the sepsis.

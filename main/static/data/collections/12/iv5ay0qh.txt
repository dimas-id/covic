When treated with formaldehyde, Tween 80, sodium oleate and Nonidet P-40, avian infectious bronchitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus as well as the human coronavirus show similar inner structures by negative staining. The first one is an inner membranous bag. This structure could be evaginated following treatments used and does not show the characteristic projections of coronaviruses. Subsequently, the inner fold could be separated from the outer membrane at the point of junction between these two membranes. Each virus does not react in the same way to the action of the different products. The transmissible gastroenteritis virus appears more sensitive to treatments than other viruses. On the other hand, the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus is the most resistant. The variable sensitivities of these viruses are not related to the type of host-cells. Also, a second internal structure, which is more dense than the viral particle, encircles partially the aperture of the internal tongue-shaped structure and seems to emerge from the viral particle through the aperture of the inner bag.

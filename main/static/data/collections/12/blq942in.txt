BACKGROUND: Aseptic technique is a core nursing skill. Sound preparation is required during pre-registration nursing education to enable student nurses to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent and control healthcare-associated infection and promote patient safety. Few studies have explored nursing students' education and training in aseptic technique. OBJECTIVES: To investigate what, when and how pre-registration nursing students are taught aseptic technique and how they are assessed in undergraduate, pre-registration nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: National cross-sectional survey exploring preparation to undertake aseptic technique in pre-registration nursing curricula in the United Kingdom. SETTING: Universities providing undergraduate, pre-registration adult nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Nurse educators. METHODS: Structured telephone interviews were conducted with nurse educators. Descriptive and inferential statistical data analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Response rate was 70% (n = 49/70). A variety of different learning and teaching methods were reported to be in use. Teaching in relation to aseptic technique took place in conjunction with teaching in relation to different clinical procedures rather than placing emphasis on the principles of asepsis per se and how to transfer them to different procedures and situations. Wide variation in teaching time; use of multiple guidelines; inaccuracy in the principles identified by educators as taught to students; and limited opportunity for regular, criteria based competency assessment were apparent across programmes. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-registration preparation in relation to aseptic technique requires improvement. There is a need to develop a working definition of aseptic technique. The generalisability of these findings in other healthcare students needs to be explored.

OBJECTIVES To describe the location, retrieval, frequency of surgery and complications associated with fishhook foreign bodies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective evaluation of the medical records of cats and dogs admitted between 2010 and 2016 after fishhook ingestion. RESULTS A total of 33 cases (2 cats and 31 dogs) were included. The most common locations were the proximal oesophagus [12/33 (36%)] and stomach [11/33 (33%)]. Endoscopic retrieval was successful in 27 of 33 cases (82%); oesophageal perforation was the only recorded complication, occurring in six of 33 (18%) cases. Surgery was performed in six cases (18%), and no early complications were recorded. The survival rate was 100%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The endoscopic removal of ingested fishhooks is highly successful. In the present study, survival to discharge was 100%, even in cases of oesophageal perforation or in cases requiring surgery.

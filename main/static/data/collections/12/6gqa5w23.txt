RATIONALE In patients with oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal bleeding, blood aspiration can make airway management difficult and lead to severe pulmonary complications. PATIENT CONCERNS A 44-year-old male patient with recurrent epistaxis underwent surgery for hemostasis. The patient aspirated blood through the endotracheal tube when he hiccupped during the surgery. DIAGNOSIS The patient was diagnosed with blood aspiration after intraoperative fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a blood clot and viscous mucus in the airways, but no sign of active bleeding. INTERVENTIONS Tracheobronchial suctioning and irrigation with normal saline was performed through the bronchoscope to remove the aspirated blood clot. Prior to emergence from anesthesia, sugammadex was administered to induce complete neuromuscular recovery and enable the patient to cough up any blood remaining in the airways. OUTCOMES The patient was successfully extubated and fully recovered with no complications. LESSONS Blood aspiration due to oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal bleeding can be diagnosed and treated by tracheobronchial suctioning via fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In addition, sugammadex can enable patients to recover spontaneous breathing, facilitate extubation, and enable patients to cough up any blood remaining in the airways.

Background and study aims In order to perform peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) safely, retained liquid and food debris must be removed before the procedure is started. We developed a novel technique using a super-slim gastroscope, and a gastric tube to remove retained food debris in achalasia patients. In this study, the safety and efficacy of this novel technique were investigated. Patients and methods Eleven patients with achalasia were enrolled in this study and underwent this novel method for esophageal clearance. Results All patients had complete clearance of the retained food debris using this method. The median procedure time (range) was 13 (6 - 30) minutes. There were no serious adverse events (AEs) and one minor AE of mucosal erythema due to mucosal suctioning. Conclusion This novel method for esophageal clearance is safe and effective in achalasia patients with large amounts of retained food debris.

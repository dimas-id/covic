Identity (ID) badges and lanyards worn by pediatric health care workers (HCWs) have been shown to be potential vectors of nosocomial bacterial infections. This cross-sectional study determined the contamination of ID badges and lanyards worn by pediatric HCWs with common respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses. The results showed that ID badges and lanyards are not significantly contaminated with common respiratory or gastrointestinal viruses and are unlikely to be a significant vector for nosocomial infection.

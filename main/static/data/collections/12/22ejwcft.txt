Many formal methods research communities lack a shared set of benchmarks. As a result, many research articles in the past have evaluated new techniques on specifications that are specifically tailored to the problem or not publicly available. While this is great for proving the concept in question, it does not offer any insights on how it performs on real-world examples. Additionally, with machine learning techniques gaining more popularity, a larger set of public specifications is required. In this paper, we present our public set of B machines and urge contribution. As we think this to be an issue in other communities in scope of the ABZ as well, we are also interested in specifications expressed in other formalisms, for example Alloy, TLA[Formula: see text] or Z.

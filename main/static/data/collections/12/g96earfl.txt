An SVIR epidemiological model with two stage characteristics of vaccine effectiveness is formulated. By constructing the appropriate Lyapunov functionals, it is proved that the disease free equilibrium of the system is globally stable when the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, and that the unique endemic equilibrium of the system is globally stable when the basic reproduction number is greater than one.

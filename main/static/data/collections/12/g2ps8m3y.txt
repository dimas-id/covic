Background: There is limited data on outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in rural United States (US). This study aimed to describe the demographics, and outcomes of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in rural Southwest Georgia.Methods: Using electronic medical records, we analyzed data from all hospitalized Covid-19 patients who either diedor survived to discharge between March 2, 2020 and May 6, 2020.Results: Of the 522 patients, 92 died in hospital (17.6%). Median age was 63 years, 58% were females, and 87% African-Americans. Hypertension (79.7%), obesity (66.5%), and diabetes mellitus (42.3%) were the most common comorbidities. Males had higher overall mortality compared to females (23% v 13.8%). Immunosuppression [odds ratio (OR) 3.6; (confidence interval {CI): 1.52-8.47, p = 0.003)], hypertension (OR 3.36; CI:1.3-8.6, p = 0.01), age ≥65 years (OR 3.1; CI:1.7-5.6, p < 0.001), and morbid obesity (OR 2.29; CI:1.11-4.69, p = 0.02), were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Female gender was an independent predictor of decreased in-hospital mortality. Mortality in intubated patients was 67%. Mortality was 8.9% in <50 years, compared to 20% in ≥50 years.Conclusions: Immunosuppression, hypertension, age ≥65 years, and morbid obesity were independent predictors of mortality, whereas female gender was protective for mortality in hospitalized Covid-19 patients in rural Southwest Georgia. Key Messages:Patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in rural US have higher comorbidity burden.Immunosuppression, hypertension, age ≥65 years, and morbid obesity are independent predictors of increased mortality.Female gender is an independent predictor of reduced mortality.

Publisher Summary This chapter presents a general overview of the anatomy, physiology, and treatment methodology for crocodilians. Most crocodilians grow to be larger than other reptile species and, therefore, have significant space requirements. Like most animals requiring an aquatic environment, crocodilians need water that is clean and free of disease. Crocodilians have a true hard palate in the roof of the mouth that ends caudally in a soft palate. This soft palate has a ventral flap which is referred to as the velum palati. The respiratory system of crocodilians consists of well-developed lungs benefiting from a very effective inspiration aided by the intercostal muscles and the septum post hepaticum. Crocodilians have a four-chambered heart as opposed to the three-chambered heart found in other reptiles and amphibians. The temperature and humidity requirements for crocodilians in captivity vary with the species. An understanding of crocodilian biology and natural history is needed to try and duplicate their natural environment. An important consideration is the allowance of circadian variations in light cycle and temperatures to mimic their natural environment. This is not the case in many commercial operations, where they are maintained at a fairly constant temperature and humidity to achieve faster growth.

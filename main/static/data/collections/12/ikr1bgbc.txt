During the outbreak and epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia, anesthesiologists are not only the high-risk group of secondary infection, but also undertake tasks to initiate clinical research so that the regular pattern of disease could be summarized, which will product clinical evidences for clinical decision-making and optimization of anesthesia therapy as soon as possible. The clinical research evidences of anaesthesia are of great importance for improving the prevention and control strategy of infectious diseases and implementing relevant measures effectively. The recommendations from the epidemiological perspective are provided on how to conduct clinical research on anesthesiology during epidemic of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in the present paper: (1) The case report and case series research should be initiated promptly once the infectious cases treated in anesthesia department are diagnosed; (2) To focus on need of evidence of decision-making of diagnosis and treatment, to summarize general rules timely and to promote the rapidly production of evidence; (3) To establish a special cohort of novel coronavirus pneumonia so that more prognosis studies could be carried out; (4) To explore the risk factors which result in hospital infection among medical staffs so that hospital infection could be controlled. The purpose of this study is to provide clinicians with methodological suggestions on how to carry out high-quality clinical research in the epidemic period of infectious diseases, and to close the gap between clinical and public health.

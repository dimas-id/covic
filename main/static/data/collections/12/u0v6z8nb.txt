BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Poland syndrome (PS) is a congenital anomaly of the thoracic wall characterised by a variable degree of unilateral agenesis of pectoralis major and minor muscles associated with ipsilateral breast, rib and upper-arm anomalies. In female patients, breast reconstruction is particularly challenging because of cranial pectoralis muscle defects and partial or complete breast agenesis. Different techniques have been used to treat the thoracic anomaly, including the positioning of an implant, fat transfer or latissimus dorsi transposition, but in some cases these techniques are not feasible resulting in a poor reconstruction. METHODS We present our experience in correction of the chest anomaly of PS in a teenage population by using a pedicled laparoscopically harvested omental flap (LOF) to cover a pectoral or breast prosthesis. Procedures were performed by a surgical team which included experienced plastic surgeons and general paediatric surgeons. Preoperative endocrinological and psychological evaluation helped to determine the best timing for the correction. RESULTS The technique was adopted in 20 patients aged 14-18 years, affected by the syndrome. In all cases, it was possible to harvest an adequate amount of pedicled omentum laparoscopically. Neither significant complications nor conversions to open surgery occurred. The aesthetic outcome of the LOF technique was, in all cases, a soft, natural-looking breast and a satisfactorily corrected infraclavicular defect. CONCLUSIONS The LOF technique is a valid alternative to reconstruction in selected PS cases. It provides a satisfactory reconstruction of the breast and pectoral region and corrects the infraclavicular defect by filling in the area. It avoids the invasiveness and morbidity of a latissimus dorsi transposition.

Infectious bronchitis virus was observed to enter cells of chicken chorioallantoic membrane by viropexis. There was no support for the suggestion that entry took place by fusion of viral and plasma membranes. The results of electron microscopy showed that virus attachment occurred both at 4° and at 37° C. Viropexis was not observed until the preparations were warmed. Similar results were obtained using chicken kidney cells. Quantitative data obtained from a plaque counting system employing chicken kidney cells indicated that attachment was the same at both temperatures and that some virus particles were taken up at 4° C. Virus uptake was triggered by attachment of the virus to the cell membrane and the subsequent process of virus entry visualised by E. M. appeared to proceed without the involvement of lysosomal enzymes. No intracellular virus was located by electron microscopy in warmed preparations when virus was treated with specific antiserum, either before or after adsorption to the cells.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to evolve through the United States and other countries, differing rates of progression and decline are occurring based on varied population densities. While some health systems are reaching a steady state of new patient cases, others are seeing a leveling off or decline, allowing for restoration of normal practices. This "reverse-surge" planning and implementation process is a colossal undertaking for health systems trying to reacquire patient access and financial stability while preserving necessary resources and maintaining precautions for another potential surge. For the otolaryngologist, reverse-surge planning involves additional workflow adjustments in the outpatient and operating room settings given the abundance of COVID-19 virus in the upper aerodigestive tract. As the reverse-surge best practices are still under development, open communication between otolaryngology colleagues and health system leadership is paramount to optimize efficiency and maintain an adequate measure of safety for patients and our health care teams.

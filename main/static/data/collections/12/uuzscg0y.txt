Thein vitro virus yield of MHV3 reached 10(7) PFU/ml in mouse DBT cells infected with a virus suspension in HEPES-buffered medium containing DEAE-dextran. The virus titer was 10(6) PFU/ml in the presence of 10 µg actinomycin D/ml. MHV3 grown in DBT cells gave three peaks of density (1.10–1.14 g/cm(3), 1.18–1.20 g/cm(3), and 1.25–1.31 g/cm(3)) in sucrose gradients. All these peaks retained infectivity.

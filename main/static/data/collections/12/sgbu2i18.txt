This article presents a novel data set on perceptions and behaviors of university students collected after the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in Vietnam. Our questionnaire design is based on employing both qualitative interview with students and survey of SARS literature, probing into the sensitivity of students toward the crisis in making crucial decisions of daily routines, as well as future travel plans in presence of a grave health concern. The data set consists of 440 valid responses from Vietnamese university students through Internet platforms (Facebook, Google Form). Besides descriptive statistics, this article also includes the results of explanatory factor analysis, which may serve as a good reference for future studies.

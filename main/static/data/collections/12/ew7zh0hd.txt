Syndecan-1, is a transmembrane heparan/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan necessary for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Its decreased level on the cell surface correlates with poor prognosis in several tumor types. Aberrant stromal localization of syndecan-1 is also considered an unfavorable prognostic factor in various human malignancies. In the presented work the question was addressed if changes in syndecan-1 expression are related to the prognosis of cervical cancer. Immunohistochemistry for syndecan-1 extracellular domain was performed on surgical specimens of primary cervical cancer. To follow the communication between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts, their mono-and co-cultures were studied, detecting the expression of syndecan-1, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmin. Immunohistochemistry of tumorous specimens revealed that while cell surface syndecan-1 expression was reduced on cancer cells, it appeared on the surface of tumor-associated fibroblasts. Until year 7, the cohort with high cell surface syndecan-1 expression had significantly longer survival. No difference in the same time-period could be detected when stromal syndecan-1 expression was analyzed. In vitro analysis revealed, that tumor cells can induce syndecan-1 expression on fibroblast, and fibroblasts showed that fibroblast-like cells are built by two cell types: (a) syndecan-1 positive, cytokeratin negative real fibroblasts, and (b) syndecan-1 and cytokeratin positive epithelial-mesenchymal transformed tumor cells. Syndecan-1 on the surface of cancer cells appears to be a positive prognostic marker. Although syndecan-1 positive fibroblasts promote tumor cell proliferation in vitro, we failed to detect their cancer promoting effect in vivo.

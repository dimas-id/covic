Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is the condition of elevated pressures in the pulmonary circulation. PH can develop acutely in patients with critical illness such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, massive pulmonary embolism, left ventricular dysfunction, or after surgery. In a cancer patient, unique etiologies such as myeloproliferative disorders, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or tumor emboli may result in PH. Early recognition and treatment of the causative condition may reverse acute PH or return chronic PH to its baseline status. Progression of the disease or its decompensation due to infection, a thromboembolic event, or other triggers can lead to admission to an intensive care unit. Regardless of etiology, the development or worsening of PH may precipitate hypoxemia, hemodynamic instability, or right ventricular failure, which can be challenging to manage or even fatal. In select cases, rapid institution of advanced treatment modalities may be warranted. This chapter reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prognosis of PH and presents a comprehensive analysis of PH and right heart failure management strategies in the critical care setting. In particular, a unique perspective on oncologically relevant PH is provided.

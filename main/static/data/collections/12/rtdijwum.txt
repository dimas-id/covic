The activity of aminopeptidase-N (APN), reported to be a major receptor for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), in enterocyte fractions harvested from the jejunal villi and crypts of newborn and weaned piglets, did not correspond with the levels of saturable virus binding previously demonstrated for the same fractions. Plasma membranes prepared from enterocytes harvested from the jejunal villi of a newborn piglet were used in the preparation of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) which blocked the binding of TGEV, but not that of the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), to ST cells. This MAb immunoprecipitated a 200 kDa non-glycosylated protein from lysates of ST cells, which was not precipitated by an anti-APN MAb. The 200 kDa protein was shown by immunostaining and fluorescence activated cell scanning to be present on ST cells and on villous enterocytes from newborn piglets, but not on MDBK cells or enterocytes from weaned piglets. APN was demonstrated by the same techniques to be present on villous enterocytes from both newborn and weaned piglets, as well as on ST cells. It was concluded that the 200 kDa protein may be a second receptor for TGEV, contributing to the high susceptibility of newborn piglets to the virus.

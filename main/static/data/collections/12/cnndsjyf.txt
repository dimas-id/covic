As of May 25, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (called COVID-19) spread to more than 185 countries/regions with more than 348,000 deaths and more than 5,550,000 confirmed cases. In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical stream representation. Thus, the dataset provides four kinds of data stream representation (DSR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences. The dataset provides the DSR of 1557 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 other instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).

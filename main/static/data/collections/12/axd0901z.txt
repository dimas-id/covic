Complement activation and inflammation have been suggested in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular lesions. We investigated serum mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) levels and polymorphisms in the MBL gene in type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients with and without diabetic nephropathy and associated macrovascular complications. Polymorphisms in the MBL gene and serum MBL levels were determined in 199 T1DM patients with overt nephropathy and 192 T1DM patients with persistent normoalbuminuria matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes as well as in 100 healthy control subjects. The frequencies of high and low expression MBL genotypes were similar in patients with T1DM and healthy controls. High MBL genotypes were significantly more frequent in diabetic patients with nephropathy than in the normoalbuminuric group, and the risk of having nephropathy, given a high MBL genotype, assessed by odds ratio was 1.52 (1.02–2.27), P = 0.04. Median serum MBL concentrations were significantly higher in patients with nephropathy than in patients with normoalbuminuria [2306 µg/l (IQR 753–4867 µg/l) versus 1491 µg/l (IQR 577–2944), P = 0.0003], and even when comparing patients with identical genotypes, serum MBL levels were higher in the nephropathy group than in the normoalbuminuric group. Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease had significantly elevated MBL levels independently of nephropathy status [3178 µg/l (IQR 636–5231 µg/l) versus 1741 µg/l (IQR 656–3149 µg/l), P = 0.02]. The differences in MBL levels between patients with and without vascular complications were driven primarily by pronounced differences among carriers of high MBL genotypes (P < 0.0001). Our findings suggest that MBL may be involved in the pathogenesis of microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes and that determination of MBL status might be used to identify patients at increased risk of developing these complications.

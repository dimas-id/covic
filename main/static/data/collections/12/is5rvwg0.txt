At present, insects are rarely used by the European food industry, but they are a subject of growing interest as an alternative source of raw materials. The risks associated with the use of insects in the production of foods and food ingredients have not been sufficiently investigated.

This review focuses on the safety aspects that need to be considered regarding the fractionation of insects for the production of foods and food ingredients.

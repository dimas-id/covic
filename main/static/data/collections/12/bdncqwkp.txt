Abstract Predicting the Coronavirus epidemic, popularly known as COVID-19, that has been explored more than 200 countries and already declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization is an invaluable task. This virus was first identified around December 2019, from central China, but later spread in the rest of the world. To ensure better healthcare service management, an accurate prediction of the uncertain gruesomeness is situational demand. In orders with limited information frameworks, demonstrating and predicting COVID-19 turns into a challenging endeavor. The primary objective of this study is to propose a hybrid model that incorporates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the COVID-19 epidemic. A real-time COVID-19 time series data has been used on the window periods January 22, 2020, to May 18, 2020. The time-series data first decomposed using EEMD to produce sub-signals and make original data denoised, and ANN architecture has built to train the denoised data. Finally, the result of the proposed model has compared with some traditional statistical analysis. The result of this investigation shows our proposed model outperforms compared with traditional statistical analysis. Thus the model might be promising for COVID-19 epidemic prediction. The government and healthcare provider can take preventive action by understanding the upcoming COVID-19 situation for better healthcare management.

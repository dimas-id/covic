INTRODUCTION Gastric bypass, without gastric resection of the distal excluded stomach, is the surgical treatment more frequently performed for morbid obesity. Several postoperative complications related to the “in situ” distal stomach have been described, and few cases of undetected gastric carcinoma located in this segment of stomach have been published. In this paper, we present our early postoperative results in patients submitted to laparoscopic gastric bypass with resection of distal stomach in patients with morbid obesity. METHODS One hundred twelve consecutive patients were included in this study. The mean body weight was 112.15±5.1 (range 78–145), and BMI was 40.5±6.9 kg/m2 (32.9–50.3). Patients were submitted to resectional gastric bypass by laparoscopic approach. The operative time was 133.7±29.1 min (range 120–240). RESULTS Postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients (10.7%) without any mortality. Early complications were observed in 11 patients while one patient presented a late complication, four patients were re-hospitalized, three of them without operation and other four of them were re-operated due to early (three patients) or late complication (one patient). One hundred patients (89.2%) were discharged at fourth postoperative day, seven patients remained in hospital between 5 and 10 days, and four patients after the tenth day due to complications. Leaks were observed in three patients. The histological study of the resected specimen was normal in only 8.9%. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resectional gastric bypass presents very similar results compared to classic gastric bypass, without significant increase of morbidity, mortality, early and late postoperative results, and therefore, it is an option for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity in countries with high risk of gastric carcinoma.

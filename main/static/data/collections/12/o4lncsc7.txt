Hold tight: Bismuth complexes including ranitidine bismuth citrate effectively inhibit the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase and DNA unwinding activities of the SARS coronavirus (SCV) helicase and dramatically reduce SCV replication levels in infected cells. This suggests that bismuth‐based drugs should be further evaluated for the treatment of SCV infections in vivo. ss=single‐stranded DNA, ds=duplex DNA.[Image: see text]

Abstract Novel human infections have continued to emerge over the past decade. Their presentation, epidemiology, and microbiology have shifted the paradigms of traditional science. In particular insights into nongenetic or paragenetic mechanisms (plasmid mediated), modes of infection have challenged biology. In reviewing the new challenges posed by these emergent events, new technologies promise some answers; however, global health security against pandemic threats, particularly given the uneven distribution of global resources for prevention, detection, and response, remains a critical area of challenge.

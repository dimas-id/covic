Aim The aim of this study was to computationally predict conserved RNA sequences and structures known as cis-acting RNA elements (CREs) located within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Materials & methods Bioinformatics tools were used to analyse and predict cis-acting regulatory elements by obtaining viral sequences from available databases. Results Computational analysis prediction revealed the presence of RNA stem-loop structures within the 3’ end of the ORF1ab region that are analogous to the previously identified SARS-CoV genomic packaging signals. Alignment-based RNA secondary structures prediction of the 5’ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified also conserved CREs. Conclusion These CREs could be used as potential targets for a vaccine and/or antiviral therapeutics developments; however, further studies would be required to confirm their roles in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

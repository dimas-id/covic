Introduction: Cardiac complications of COVID-19 are potentially life-threatening. The occurrence of myocardial injury in the context of COVID-19 is multifactorial and has generated increasing interest. Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis of the literature was performed. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Two independente reviewers evaluated the selected manuscripts for the outcome myocardial injury, defined by troponin elevation above the 99th percentile. Study heterogeneity and risk of bias were evaluated. Results: Eight studies, with a total of 1229 patients, were included. The frequency of myocardial injury was 16% (95% CI: 9% - 27%). The heterogeneity among studies was high (93%). Conclusions: Myocardial injury may occur in patients with COVID-19, with a frequency of 16% among current studies. Continuous research is needed to update these findings, as the pandemic evolves, and to define the implications of myocardial injury in the context of this infection.

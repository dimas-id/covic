OBJECTIVES During the COVID-19 pandemic, the care of hip fracture patients remains a clinical priority. Our study aims to investigate the 30-day mortality rate of hip fracture patients during the first thirty days of the pandemic in the UK. METHODS A single-center, observational, prospective study of patients presenting with hip fractures. Data collection started from 'day zero' of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and continued for thirty days. We collected data on time-to-surgery, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), COVID-19 infection status, 30-day mortality and cause of death. For comparison, we collected retrospective data during the same thirty-day period in 2018, 2019 and the previous six months (Control groups A, B and C, respectively). RESULTS 43 patients were included in the study. There was no difference in age or gender between the Study and Control groups. The 30-day mortality rate of the Study group was 16.3%, which was higher than Control groups A (P=0.022), B (P=0.003) and C (P=0.001). The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our Study group was 26%. Of the seven mortalities recorded, four patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection. In our Study group, COVID-19 infection correlated significantly with 30-day mortality (P=0.002, odds ratio 2.4). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated a significant increase in 30-day mortality amongst hip fracture patients during the first thirty days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. A positive COVID-19 test result in patients with hip fractures is associated with a 2.4-fold increase in risk of 30-day mortality. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic Level II.

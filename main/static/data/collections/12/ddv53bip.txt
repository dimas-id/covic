The global challenge to the treatment of malaria is mainly the occurrence of resistance of malaria parasites to conventionally used antimalarials. Artesunate, a semisynthetic artemisinin compound, and other artemisinin derivatives are currently used in combination with selected active antimalarial drugs in order to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives. Several methods, such as preparation of hybrid compounds, combination therapy, chemical modification and the use of synthetic materials to enhance solubility and delivery of artesunate, have been employed over the years to improve the antimalarial activity of artesunate. Each of these methods has advantages it bestows on the efficacy of artesunate. This review discussed the various methods employed in enhancing the antimalarial activity of artesunate and delaying the emergence of resistance of parasite to it.

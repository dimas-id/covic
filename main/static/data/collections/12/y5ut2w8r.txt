In this retrospective study, we evaluated the levels of a series of serum biomarkers in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (mild: 131; severe: 98; critical: 23). We found that there were significant increases in levels of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) (73.6 ± 38.3 vs 46.5 ± 14.7 pmol/L; P < .001), cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1) (2.2 ± 0.9 vs 1.9 ± 0.8 µg/L; P < .001), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (3.4 ± 2.2 vs 2.1 ± 1.2 µg/L; P < .001), carbohydrate antigens (CA) 125 (18.1 ± 13.5 vs 10.5 ± 4.6 µg/L; P < .001), and 153 (14.4 ± 8.9 vs 10.1 ± 4.4 µg/L; P < .001) in COVID-19 mild cases as compared to normal control subjects; their levels showed continuous and significant increases in severe and critical cases (HE4, CYFRA21-1, and CA125: P < .001; CEA and CA153: P < .01). Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) and CA199 increased significantly only in critical cases of COVID-19 as compared with mild and severe cases and normal controls (P < .01). There were positive associations between levels of C-reactive protein and levels of HE4 (R = .631; P < .001), CYFRA21-1 (R = .431; P < .001), CEA (R = .316; P < .001), SCC (R = .351; P < .001), CA153 (R = .359; P < .001) and CA125 (R = .223; P = .031). We concluded that elevations of serum cancer biomarkers positively correlated with the pathological progressions of COVID-19, demonstrating diffuse and acute pathophysiological injuries in COVID-19.

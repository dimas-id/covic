Abstract Background The response to COVID-19 catalyzed the adoption and integration of digital health tools into the healthcare delivery model for musculoskeletal patients. The change, suspension or relaxation of Medicare and federal guidelines enabled the rapid implementation of these technologies. The expansion of payment models for virtual care facilitated its rapid adoption. The authors aim to provide several examples of digital health solutions utilized to manage orthopaedic patients during the pandemic and discuss what features of these technologies are likely to continue to provide value to patients and clinicians following its resolution. Conclusion The widespread adoption of new technologies enabling providers to care for patients remotely has the potential to permanently change the expectations of all stakeholders about the way care is provided in orthopaedics. The new era of Digital Orthopaedics will see a gradual and non-disruptive integration of technologies that support the patientâ€™s journey through the successful management of their musculoskeletal disease.

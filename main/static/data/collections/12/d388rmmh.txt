Objectives Malignant ascites (MA) is abnormal accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and has negative effects on the quality of life. The purpose of this retrospective study is to explore feasibility, safety and efficacy of tunneled peritoneal catheter placement using both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis catheters in the palliation of MA. Methods Between October 2013-June 2016, thirty patients with resistent MA underwent tunneled peritoneal catheterisation in our interventional radiology department. Tunneled peritoneal catheter (TPC) was placed in 22 (n=22/30; %73) patients, tunneled hemodialysis catheter (THC) was placed in 8 patients (n=8/30; %27). Routine visits were scheduled for months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 of the catheterization, and the records were evaluated retrospectively. Results The overall duration of catheterization varied from 2 to 334 days (mean 66.4 Â± 68.5, median: 57 days). Catheters remained intact in 29 patients (96.7%) until the endpoint. There was one (3.3%) malfunctioning catheter among both groups. Overall, four patients developed infection, which were classified into major (n=2/30, %6.7) and minor (n=2/30, %6.7) complications according to SIR criteria. Conclusion Tunneled peritoneal catheterization using both TPCs and THCs provided a safe method with relatively high patency, and low infection and systemic complication rates in the palliation of MA.

Co-infections have an unknown impact on the morbidity and mortality of the new clinical syndrome called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) The syndrome is caused by the new pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it is probably connected with severe traces in the elements of the immune system Apart from possible Aspergillus infections, particularly in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other fungal infections could occur, probably more easily, due to the immunological dysregulation and the critical condition of these patients Probiotic preparations of Saccharomyces are broadly used for the prevention of antibiotic-associated complications, especially in the intensive care units (ICU) On the other hand, Saccharomyces organisms are reported as agents of invasive infection in immunocompromised or critically ill patients We report two cases of bloodstream infection by Saccharomyces in two patients hospitalised in the ICU, due to severe COVID-19, after Saccharomyces supplementation

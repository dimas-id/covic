During COVID-19 pandemic, an increase was observed in stress-related dermatological diseases and COVID-19 related rash, while a significant decrease was observed in cosmetological outpatient applications. However, one month after the COVID-19 outbreak began, we observed a rapid increase especially individuals under 20 years of age diagnosed with stria rubrae in dermatology outpatient clinics. The number of patients diagnosed with striae rubrae was four times higher than last month (0.1% vs 0.4%). In order to prevent the rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the closure of schools, the transition to online education and the curfew imposed under the age of 20 caused a change in lifestyle and diet in young people. The incidence of striae rubrae due to rapid weight gain increased. If not heeded, COVID-19 pandemic can cause striae rubrae pandemic.

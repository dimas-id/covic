Our hospital diagnosed the two first non‐imported COVID‐19 cases in Spain on 26(th) February. Up to date, a total of 1177 COVID‐19 patients have been hospitalized. Eight of them were referred for dermatological examination. Due to the overwhelming situation, the incidence of cutaneous manifestations in our hospitalized COVID‐19 patients is probably greater than this 0.7%(1, 2).

Minute virus of canines (MVC), also known as canine parvovirus type 1, was initially believed to be a nonpathogenic agent, since it was first isolated from canine fecal specimens in the late 1960s. However, subsequent pathological as well as epidemiological studies suggested that MVC is a pathogen of neonatal puppies and is widely distributed among domestic dogs in the United States. The virus also has been shown to cause fetal deaths. Nevertheless, the virus was not detected in dogs outside the United States until recently, presumably because of a lack of widespread availability of the only susceptible canine cell line, WRCC/3873D, used for MVC isolation. We examined 470 clinical specimens from 346 dogs by PCR and detected MVC-specific gene fragments from four diseased puppies (positive rate, 1.2%). Viruses were recovered from three PCR-positive rectal specimens by using WRCC/3873D and MDCK cells. The isolates possessed antigenic and genomic properties similar to those of the U.S. reference strain GA3 and were identified as MVC. In addition, seroepidemiological evidence that 5.0% of dogs possessed anti-MVC antibodies also indicated the presence of MVC infection among dogs in Japan. From this study and several recent European reports describing MVC field cases, it is evident that MVC is distributed among domestic dogs worldwide.

Institutions across the world are working to develop initiatives aimed at supporting the well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs) facing the psychological impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This Commentary identifies risks that HCWs are experiencing, reviews sources of fear and stress, and describes the implementation of a three-tiered model for the provision of emotional support and mental health services for clinical and nonclinical HCWs. The model recognizes the fluid, ever-evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and includes proactive, visible, and easy-to-access supportive psychological services that expand the safety net and help address immediate and future mental health challenges of HCWs.

PURPOSE To evaluate gender-related long-term outcomes in patients undergoing stent treatment of femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease. METHODS Between September 2006 and August 2010, all 517 patients (333 men and 184 women; mean age 70.6 years) undergoing primary stent placement in femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions at 2 European vascular centers were prospectively enrolled in the study. The main study outcome was primary stent patency. Secondary outcomes included secondary patency, limb salvage, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Women had a higher incidence of critical limb ischemia (32.1% vs. 16.9%, p<0.001). Lesion characteristics according to the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification were comparable in both genders (p=0.52), although total occlusions and popliteal involvement were observed more frequently in female patients (p=0.043 and p=0.001, respectively). Both genders showed similar 5-year primary patency rates (64.3% men vs. 58.1% women, p=0.11). A statistically significant difference was observed concerning the secondary patency rates in favor of men (71.9% vs. 66.8% at 5 years, p=0.005). Limb salvage rates did not vary between the groups (p=0.83). Survival rates were comparable at 5 years (83.3% and 82.6% for men and women, respectively; p=0.63), although female patients were older at their presentation (68.5 vs. 74.3 years, p<0.001). Female gender was an independent risk factor for restenosis for TASC C/D lesions (primary patency rate 39.8% in women vs. 62.0% in men; p=0.002). Finally, critical limb ischemia was an independent risk factor for restenosis in women (odds ratio 1.5). CONCLUSION Female gender was associated with a higher prevalence of critical limb ischemia, poorer secondary patency, and more frequent restenosis in TASC C/D lesions. Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal lesions provides equal results between genders in terms of primary stent patency in the long term.

Background Northern Italy is one of the epicenters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) pandemic in Europe. The impact of the pandemic and the consequent lockdown on medical emergencies other than those SARS-CoV 2 pandemic related is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiologic impact of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on hospital admission for severe emergent cardiovascular diseases (SECDs) in a single Northern Italy large tertiary referral center. Methods and Results We quantified SECDs admissions to the Cardiology Division of Udine University Hospital between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020 and compared them with those of the same time frame during 2019. Compared with March 2019, we observed a significant reduction in all SECDs admissions: -30% for ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes, -66% for non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes and -50% for severe bradyarrhythmia. Conclusions A significant decrease in all SECDs admissions has been observed during the SARS-CoV 2. pandemic and was unlikely caused by a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Fear of contagion may have contributed to the unpredictable drop of SECDs. Social education about early recognition of symptoms of life-threatening cardiac conditions requiring appropriate care in a timely fashion may help to reduce this counterproductive phenomenon.

Abstract The direct chemoselective differential functionalization of the ring-C hydroxyl groups present in the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid lycorine is described allowing for selective manipulation of the 1,2-hydroxyl groups. A mini-library comprised of synthetic and natural lycorane alkaloids was prepared and their apoptosis-inducing activity investigated in human leukemia (Jurkat) cells. Further insights into the nature of this interesting apoptosis-inducing pharmacophore are described, including the requirement of both free hydroxyl groups in ring-C.

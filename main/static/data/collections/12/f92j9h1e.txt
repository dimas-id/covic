Arthroscopic repair of bucket-handle meniscal tears is difficult due to their complex pathology. Many meniscal repair techniques such as all-inside, inside-out, and outside-in have been described for the treatment of these tears. Loss of reduction is a likely complication with the use of new-generation, all-inside suture instruments, as the tip of the needle is extracted following advancement of the first implant behind the capsule. The complication may be encountered quite often and renders the use of the meniscus repair instrument unusable and causes an irreparable iatrogenic injury in the meniscus. The application of a simpler and more efficient technique is necessary until surgical experience is gained. The aim of this study was to define a new, simpler, and more efficient combination of suturing method in the treatment of bucket-handle meniscal repairs and minimize the rate of complications which may be caused by this technique.

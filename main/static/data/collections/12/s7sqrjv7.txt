A cat was presented with a history of vomiting, decreased appetite and weight loss. Abnormal findings were poor body condition, pale mucous membranes, dehydration and a palpable abdominal mass. Abdominal ultrasound showed lymph node enlargement, a mass of uncertain origin, thickening of the muscularis layer of the small bowel, focal thickening of the ileum with loss of layering and free peritoneal fluid. Cytology revealed a piogranulomatous infiltrate and numerous macrophages containing oval or round yeast‐like cells 2 to 5 µm diameter with a central, spherical, lightly basophilic body surrounded by a clear halo, compatible with Histoplasma capsulatum, within the cytoplasm. Post‐mortem examination revealed cavity effusions, granulomatous nodules in lungs, intestine and omentum, thickened intestinal walls and intestinal perforation. Staining with Grocott and immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed numerous organisms within the granulomatous reaction. H. capsulatum has a worldwide distribution in temperate and subtropical climates. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first report of feline histoplasmosis in Europe.

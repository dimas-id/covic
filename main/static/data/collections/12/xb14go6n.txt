Pedicle screw fixation is the gold standard for the treatment of spinal diseases. However, many studies have reported the issue of loosening pedicle screws after spinal surgery, which is a serious concern. To address this problem, diverse types of pedicle screws have been examined to identify those with good fixation strength and osseointegration in spine bone. The porcine spine is a good alternative for the human spine in the evaluation of pedicle screws due to the anatomical size, mechanical characteristics, and cost. Although several studies have reported that pedicle screws are efficient in the porcine model, no study has described detailed protocols for the evaluation of a pedicle screw using the porcine model. Here, we describe a detailed method for evaluating transpedicular screws using an in vivo porcine lumbar spine model. The technical details for anesthesia, spine surgery, and harvest provided here will facilitate with the evaluation of the transpedicular screw fixation model.

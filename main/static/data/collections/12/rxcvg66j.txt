BACKGROUND In large, long-term series of laparoscopic pediatric groin hernia repairs, the recurrence rate is commonly higher compared with the open herniotomy. Thus, we refined our laparoscopic technique from a simple hernia sac ligation into combined posterior wall repair for pediatric groin hernias. METHODS Between March 2010 and March 2013, 41 consecutive infants and children with primary inguinal hernia were treated surgically with our refined mini-laparoscopic hernia technique. The mean patient age was 4.5 years. Before hernia repair, there were synchronous bilateral hernias in 4 (9.7 %), left inguinal hernias in 14 (34.2 %) and right inguinal hernias in 23 (56.1 %). The mini-laparoscopic hernia repair was carried out with three 3.5 mm trocar ports including 3 mm telescope and 3 mm instruments. RESULTS Totally 61 repairs were performed. The mean follow-up period was 12 months. The mean operation time was 45 min. None of the repaired groin hernias had a recurrence or procedure-related complication during the period of follow-up. None of them experienced a chronic pain postoperatively. To date there was no scrotal or testicular complication detected by regular ultrasonographic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our refined laparoscopic technique is a safe and effective method in the management of groin hernias in infants and children with a minimal early recurrence rate.

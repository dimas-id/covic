In light of the accumulating evidence on the negative predictive value of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a group of experts from the fields of intensive care medicine, emergency medicine, internal medicine and infectious diseases frame a position statement on the role of suPAR in the screening of patients admitted to the emergency department. The statement is framed taking into consideration existing publications and our own research experience. The main content of this statement is that sUPAR is a non-specific marker associated with a high negative predictive value for unfavourable outcomes; levels < 4 ng/ml indicate that it is safe to discharge the patient, whereas levels > 6 ng/ml are an alarming sign of risk for unfavourable outcomes. However, the suPAR levels should always be interpreted in light of the patient's history.

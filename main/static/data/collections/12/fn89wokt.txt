Serum samples of 253 fattening pigs out of 44 different herds with respiratory signs were examined for antibodies to Aujeszky's disease virus by ELISA, swine influenza virus (HI test), porcine respiratory coronavirus (ELISA) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (IPMA). One single case of Aujeszky's disease was detected at slaughter. On the other hand 24.5% of the animals proved to be positive for swine influenza, although no vaccine is licensed in Austria, and 63.6% reacted positively to porcine respiratory coronavirus. None of the sera showed antibodies to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, which has not as yet been identified in the Austrian swine population.

Background: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged in Wuhan and spread rapidly in China. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Shaoxing, and provide an insight into the treatment of COVID-19 across China and elsewhere. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center, study, we enrolled 16 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University between February 24 and January 25, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological feature, and treatment data were all collected. Outcomes were followed up until March 16, 2020. Results: Among the 16 patients with COVID-19 infection, 11 patients (68.8%) had traveled or lived in Wuhan or surrounding areas, and 2 (12.5%) patients had exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The average age of the patients was 44.1 (16.5) years, and there were 10 women (62.5%) and 6 men (37.5%). More than half had chronic diseases [9 (56.3%)]. The most common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 infection were fever [12 (75%)] and cough [8 (50%)]; 11 (68.8%) patients had lymphopenia, and 12 (75%) had elevated C-reactive protein. On admission, abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) or chest X-ray images were revealed among all patients, and 11 (68.8%) of 16 patients had bilateral involvement. All patients were given psychological counseling, 15 (93.8%) patients were administered with antiviral therapy, 8 (50%) received empirical antibiotic treatment, and 5 (31.3%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation [1 (6.3%)], acute respiratory injury [4 (25%)], acute renal injury [1 (6.3%)], septic shock [1 (6.3%)], liver dysfunction [5 (31.3%)], electrolyte disturbance [8 (50.0%)], and hospital-acquired pneumonia [3 (18.8%)]. None of the 16 patients died of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions: Compared with the symptoms of the initial patients with COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, the symptoms of the patients from Shaoxing city were relatively mild. Currently, there is no effective drug treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and psychological counseling cannot be ignored. Drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 infection need to be developed as soon as possible.

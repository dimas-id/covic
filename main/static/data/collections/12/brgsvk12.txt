Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel virus which can cause respiratory tract disease in infants or children. Recently, the prevalence of this virus has been studied worldwide. In this study, 18 of 252 (7.14%) nasopharyngeal suctions from infants or children between 1 month and 9 years of age with respiratory tract illness were HBoV-positive by PCR. Three positive samples were selected for sequencing the entire coding sequences using a new conserved set of primers. The results showed that the most conserved regions of HBoV are the NS1 and NP1 genes, whereas VP1 and VP2 showed frequent variations. However, the complete coding sequences showed that the variations did not depend on the origin of virus found. The complete coding sequences determined in this study can resolve the problem of an HBoV detection method, which can be advantageously implemented in laboratory detection.

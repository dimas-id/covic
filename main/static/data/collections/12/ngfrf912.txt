Abstract From 71 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found three presymptomatic patients and 10 entirely asymptomatic infections. In two of the three incubation period patients, the viral titer in the presymptomatic period was very high (Ct value <20). The median days to first negative RT-PCR in the entirely asymptomatic carriers was 4.5 (range 2.5â€“9) days and all asymptomatic carriers reached a first Ct>35 RT-PCR within 14 days after diagnosis. Patients who have COVID-19 may already be infectious before there are symptoms, and 14 days of isolation after diagnosis may be sufficient in entirely asymptomatic cases.

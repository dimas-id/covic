Sleep is a fundamental physiological process necessary for recovery from acute illness. Unfortunately for hospitalized patients, sleep is often short, fragmented, and poor in quality, and may be associated with adverse outcomes including inpatient delirium. Many factors contribute to poor sleep in the hospital setting, including preexisting sleep deprivation, sleep disordered breathing, environmental noise and light, patient care activities, and medications. Sleep disordered breathing increases the risk of potentially life-threatening cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic consequences, and therefore should be diagnosed and treated in hospitalized patients. Mitigating the sequelae associated with poor sleep quality and sleep disordered breathing requires early identification of modifiable factors impacting a patient's sleep, including engagement of a multidisciplinary team. In this article, we review the current knowledge of sleep in hospitalized patients with a detailed focus on patients with sleep disordered breathing.

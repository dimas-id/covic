Abstract The landscape of advanced endoscopy continues to evolve as new technologies and techniques become available. Although postgraduate advanced endoscopy fellowships have traditionally centered on ERCP and diagnostic EUS, the breadth of training has increased over the years in response to the ever-growing demand for therapeutic endoscopy. The increasing diversity and complexity of emerging endoscopic techniques accompanied by the shift in focus toward competency-based medical education requires innovative changes to the curriculum that will ensure adequate training yet without compromising best patient practices. The purpose of this review is to highlight the expansive array of advanced endoscopic procedures and the challenges of both defining and measuring competence during training. All authors are interventional endoscopists at their respective institutions performing these complex procedures, as well as training fellows in these techniques. We share our perspectives based on our experience navigating through these issues at our institutions and discuss strategies to standardize training and how to potentially incorporate these measures toward the process of credentialing and privileging in endoscopy.

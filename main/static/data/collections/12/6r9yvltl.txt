Tibial shaft fractures are common injuries in emergency departments (EDs). Although many of these fractures require surgery, nearly all are stabilized in the ED with a long leg splint or bivalved cast. Long leg splinting is often challenging for a single health care provider. Further, even with assistance or previously described techniques for fracture reduction and stabilization, fracture angulation may occur, potentially leading to pain for the patient, fracture displacement, or further soft tissue injury. The authors propose a method for splinting tibial fractures that avoids fracture angulation, is cost-effective and quick, and can be easily performed by a single health care provider.

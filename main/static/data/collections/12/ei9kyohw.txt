Target lesion revascularization (TLR) for BRS failure is burdened with a high rate of adverse events. DES implantation appears to be the safest treatment option following BRS failure. A real world observational study with a minimum of 2-year follow-up would be required to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes in patients with a BRS failure and to assess the best treatment option in case of TLR.

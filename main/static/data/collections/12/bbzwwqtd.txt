BACKGROUNDS/AIMS Postoperative diaphragmatic hernia, following liver resection, is a rare complication. METHODS Data of patients who underwent major hepatectomy for liver tumors, between 2011 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The literature was searched for studies reporting the occurrence of diaphragmatic hernia following liver resection. RESULTS Diaphragmatic hernia developed in 2.3% of patients (3/131) with a median delay of 14 months (4-31 months). One patient underwent emergency laparotomy for bowel obstruction and two patients underwent elective diaphragmatic hernia repair. At last follow-up, no recurrences were observed. Fourteen studies including 28 patients were identified in the literature search (donor hepatectomy, n=11: hepatectomy for liver tumors, n=17). Diaphragmatic hernia was repaired emergently in 42.9% of cases and digestive resection was necessary in 28.5% of the cases. One patient died 3 months after hepatectomy, secondary to sepsis, from a segment of small bowel that perforated into the diaphragmatic hernia. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, diaphragmatic hernia should be considered as an important complication, especially in living donor liver transplant patients. Diaphragmatic hernia should be repaired surgically, even for asymptomatic patients.

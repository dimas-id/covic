The neurologic manifestations concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly penetrated. Anosmia and ageusia are one of the common acute neurologic symptoms, which develop in the early stage of COVID-19. However, it is not reported that how immunosuppressive agents affect these symptoms. We report olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) treated with etanercept during COVID-19. A 53-year-old female showing AS controlled with tumor necrosis factor-Î± inhibitor, etanercept, had been diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, presenting cough and rhinorrhea. One month after diagnosis, she complained about hyposmia and hypogeusia two days before the seronegative conversion of SARS-CoV-2, which were confirmed by a neurological examination. We speculate that the etanercept may have delayed the development of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in the patient.

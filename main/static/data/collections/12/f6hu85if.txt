Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was identified in intestinal samples collected from piglets with diarrhea in Thailand in 2015. Two Thai PDCoV isolates, P23_15_TT_1115 and P24_15_NT1_1215, were isolated and identified. The full-length genome sequences of the P23_15_TT_1115 and P24_15_NT1_1215 isolates were 25,404 and 25,407 nucleotides in length, respectively, which were relatively shorter than that of US and China PDCoV. The phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome demonstrated that Thai PDCoV isolates form a new cluster separated from US and China PDCoV but relatively were more closely related to China PDCoV than US isolates. The genetic analyses demonstrated that Thai PDCoVs have 97.0-97.8 and 92.2-94.0% similarities with China PDCoV at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, but share 97.1-97.3 and 92.5-93.0 similarity with US PDCoV at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Thai PDCoV possesses two discontinuous deletions of five amino acids in ORF1a/b region. One additional deletion of one amino acid was identified in P23_15_TT_1115. The variation analyses demonstrated that six regions (nt 1317-1436, 2997-3096, 19,737-19,836, 20,277-20,376, 21,177-21,276, and 22,371-22,416) in ORF1a/b and spike genes exhibit high sequence variation between Thai and other PDCoV. The analyses of amino acid changes suggested that they could potentially be from different lineages.

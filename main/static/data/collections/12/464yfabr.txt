Metagenomics could detect SARS-CoV-2 in all eight nasopharyngeal/throat swabs with high/low viral loads, and rhinovirus in a co-infected patient. The sequenced viruses belonged to lineage B1. Because metagenomics could detect novel pathogen and co-infection, and generate sequence data for epidemiological investigation, it is an attractive approach for infectious-disease diagnosis.

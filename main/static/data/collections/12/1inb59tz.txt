OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship of femoral vascular closure device (VCD) use to bleeding and ischemic events in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) via different anticoagulation strategies. BACKGROUND It is unknown whether femoral VCD reduce major bleeding after primary PCI for STEMI using bivalirudin anticoagulation. METHODS We compared VCD-treated patients with propensity-matched controls in the HORIZONS-AMI trial with respect to net adverse clinical events (NACE), defined as the composite of major bleeding unrelated to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and major adverse cardiac events (comprised of death, reinfarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, and stroke), at 30 days and 1 year. RESULTS Among 3,602 patients enrolled in HORIZONS-AMI, 2,948 underwent primary PCI via femoral arterial access and 896 (30%) received VCDs, of whom 642 were included in our model along with 642 propensity-matched controls. At 30 days, VCD-treated patients had significantly less NACE (6.7% vs. 10.8%, HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42-0.89, P = 0.009), driven by a lower rate of non-CABG related major bleeding (5.0% vs. 8.1%, HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.94, P = 0.02). Bleeding reduction was maintained at one year and consistent in magnitude regardless of randomization to bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (P for interaction = 0.84). CONCLUSION In patients undergoing transfemoral primary PCI for STEMI, VCD use was associated with significantly lower non-CABG major bleeding irrespective of anticoagulation strategy.

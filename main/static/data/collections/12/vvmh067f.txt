PURPOSE: Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) is associated with the exacerbation, timing, and onset of asthma. The goal of this study was to elucidate the impact of MP on eosinophil-related hyper-reactive amplification in atopic children. METHODS: We studied 48 patients with MP (26 atopic, 22 non-atopic), between 3 and 12 years of age. Serial changes in blood eosinophil counts, serum interleukin-5 (IL-5), and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were measured in atopic and non-atopic children with MP upon admission, recovery, and at 2 months post-recovery. Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; eosinophil counts were measured using an autoanalyzer. RESULTS: Serial changes in serum IL-5, ECP, and total eosinophil counts were significantly higher in atopic patients, relative to non-atopic controls (Pâ‰¤0.001). Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were significantly higher in atopic patients at all three time points tested, while eosinophil counts were higher in the clinical recovery and follow-up phases, but not in the acute phase. Furthermore, among atopic patients, serum ECP levels were significantly higher in the recovery and follow-up phases than in the acute phase. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated significant differences in eosinophil counts, serum IL-5, and serum ECP levels between atopic and non-atopic children with MP at admission, recovery, and 2 months after clinical recovery. These outcomes are suggestive of eosinophil-related hyperreactivity in atopic children, with this status maintained for at least 2 months after MP.

Introduction Vedolizumab has proven efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], but long-term mucosal healing in Crohn's disease [CD], as well as the incidence of colorectal neoplasia in IBD, among patients treated with vedolizumab have not been studied. We aimed to document mucosal healing and to explore the risk of colorectal neoplasia with vedolizumab maintenance therapy. Methods Surveillance colonoscopy was prospectively scheduled for patients with longstanding ulcerative coltis [UC] or CD at a tertiary referral centre, in the open-label extension phase (vedolizumab 300 mg intravenously [IV] every 4 weeks) of the Gemini studies [GEMINI LTS, study number NCT00790933]. Mayo score ≤ 1 or ulcer disappearance [in CD] was defined as mucosal healing. Targeted biopsies were graded for inflammation and dysplasia. Results Of 68 patients [29 CD/39 UC] treated for ≥ 1 year [median 3.2 years, range 1.1-6.1], 58 [24 CD/34 UC] were endoscopically monitored. Durable endoscopic healing corrected by non-responder imputation was found in 7/24, 29% [CD] and 17/34, 50% [UC]. Combined histological and mucosal healing was observed in 5/24 [CD] and 11/34 [UC] of those with endoscopic healing. Low-grade dysplasia was detected in 10% of patients and high-grade dysplasia in the resection specimen of one patient with biopsy-proven low-grade dysplasia. Conclusions Long-term endoscopic and histological healing was observed in a proportion of patients treated with vedolizumab long-term. The dysplasia risk with vedolizumab deserves further study.

AIM To identify which technique is better for avoiding biliary reflux and gastritis between uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II reconstruction. METHODS A total of 158 patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer at the First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China) between February 2015 and February 2016 were randomized into two groups: uncut Roux-en-Y (group U) and Billroth II group (group B). Postoperative complications and relevant clinical data were compared between the two groups. RESULTS According to the randomization table, each group included 79 patients. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between groups U and B (7.6% vs 10.1%, P = 0.576). During the postoperative period, group U stomach pH values were lower than 7 and group B pH values were higher than 7. After 1 year of follow-up, group B presented a higher incidence of biliary reflux and alkaline gastritis. However, histopathology did not show a significant difference in gastritis diagnosis (P = 0.278), and the amount of residual food and gain of weight between the groups were also not significantly different. At 3 mo there was no evidence of partial recanalization of uncut staple line, but at 1 year the incidence was 13%. CONCLUSION Compared with Billroth II reconstruction, uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction is secure and feasible, and can effectively reduce the incidence of alkaline reflux, residual gastritis, and heartburn. Despite the incidence of recanalization, uncut Roux-en-Y should be widely applied.

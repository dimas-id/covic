BACKGROUND We hypothesized that the addition of a recruitment maneuver to protective ventilation (PVRM) would result in lower pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses than traditional ventilation or protective ventilation (PV) alone in patients undergoing lung surgery. METHODS Sixty patients who underwent scheduled thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomly assigned to three groups: traditional ventilation, PV, or PVRM. Ventilations were performed using a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg for the traditional ventilation group and either 8 mL/kg (two-lung) or 6 mL/kg (one-lung, OLV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O for the PV and PVRM groups. The RM was performed 10 min after the start of OLV. Fiberoptic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed twice in dependent and non-dependent lungs: before the start and immediately after the end of OLV. Blood samples were collected at the same time points. The levels of cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, were measured. RESULTS After OLV, the level of TNF-α in the BAL fluid of dependent lungs was significantly higher in the PV than in the PVRM group (P = 0.049), whereas IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 levels were not significantly different among the groups. In non-dependent lung BAL fluid, no cytokines were significantly different among the groups. After OLV, IL-10 serum levels were significantly higher in the traditional ventilation than in the PVRM group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Lower inflammatory responses in the ventilated lung and serum were observed with PVRM than with traditional ventilation or PV alone. Larger multi-center clinical trials are warranted to confirm the effects of different ventilatory strategies on postoperative outcomes.

Due to growing interest in murine functional genomics research, there is an increasing need for physiological stable in vivo murine models. Of special importance is support and control of ventilation by artificial respiration, which is difficult to execute as a consequence of the small size of the animal and the technically demanding breathing pattern. In addition, numerous genetically altered mice show depressed spontaneous ventilation or impaired respiratory responses. After an introduction in murine respiratory physiology we describe options for ventilatory support, its monitoring and the potential side effects. This review will provide an overview on current possibilities in the field of airway support in mouse research.

INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has rapidly gained popularity in the field of bariatric surgery, mainly due to its low morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, 4 to 6 trocars are used. Single-access surgery has emerged as an attempt to decrease incisional morbidity and enhance cosmetic benefits. We present our initial 7 patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy using a novel technique for liver retraction. METHODS Patients who underwent single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between March 2009 and May 2009 were analyzed. A 4-cm left paramedian incision was used. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed in a standard fashion using a 40 French bougie. RESULTS Seven patients underwent single-incision sleeve gastrectomy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. They were all female with a mean age of 34 years. Preoperative BMI was 49 kg/m² (range, 39 to 64). There were no intraoperative complications. Mean operative time was 103 minutes. Estimated blood loss was minimal. All 7 patients were discharged on postoperative day 2 and were doing well without any complications at 3.1 ± 0.7 months after surgery. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is safe and feasible and can be performed without changing the existing principles of the procedure. Our technique for internal liver retraction provides adequate exposure and is reproducible. Development of improved standard instrumentation is required for this technique to become popular.

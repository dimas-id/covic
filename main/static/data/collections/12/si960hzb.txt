Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S induced typical MHV spongiform lesions in brainstem 28 days following intranasal inoculation of adult A/J, BALB/cByJ, CBA/J, C3H/HeJ and C3H/RV, but not SJL mice. In all but SJL mice, brain lesions occurred at or near the infectious dose level, based on seroconversion by the indirect immunofluorescence assay. During the acute phase of infection (day 5), lesions were limited to the nose and brain in most genotypes. Exceptions were BALB mice, which had mild hepatitis and SJL mice, which had lesions restricted to the nose. No mortality occurred in any genotype. Following intranasal inoculation of adult mice, MHV-1, -3, -A 59,-JHM and -S all caused brain lesions at 28 days after inoculation. MHV-1 and-3 caused lesions that were usually restricted to the anterior olfactory tracts, while MHV-A 59, -S and -JHM also caused more generalized and pronounced lesions involving the midbrain and pons. These studies suggest that avirulent MHV-S given intranasally to most mouse genotypes is a good model for induction of brain infection in the absence of mortality. They also confirm observations made by others in which MHV-JHM, -S and -A 59 are relatively more neurotropic than other MHV strains, such as MHV-1 and -3.

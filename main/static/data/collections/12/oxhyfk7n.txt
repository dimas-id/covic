The cell cycle of endothelium EAhy 926 cell culture infected with influenza virus has been studied. Cytometric analysis of cell culture synchronized by contact inhibition revealed the elongation of the S phase of the cell cycle in EAhy 926 cells under the influence of influenza virus. This result was shown in an EAhy 926 culture infected with influenza virus and treated with nocodazole. Comparison of a lung carcinoma A549 cell line in which influenza virus causes G(0)/G(1) arrest and of an endothelial EAhy 926 cell line in which the same infection leads to S-phase elongation allows it to be suggested that different effects of influenza virus on cell cycle dynamics depend on the origin of infected cells.

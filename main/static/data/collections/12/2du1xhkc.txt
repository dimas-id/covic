Human norovirus (HuNoV) is a principal cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Its global prevalence is underscored by more serious morbidity and some mortality in the young (<5 years) and the elderly. To date, there are no licensed vaccines or approved therapeutics for HuNoV, mostly because there are limited cell culture systems and small animal models available. Recently described cell culture systems are not ideal substrates for HuNoV vaccine development because they are not clonal or only support a single strain. In this study, we show Vero cell-based replication of two pandemic GII.4 HuNoV strains and one GII.3 strain and confirm exosome-mediated HuNoV infection in Vero cells. Lastly, we show that trypsin addition to virus cultures or disruption of Vero cell host genes can modestly increase HuNoV replication. These data provide support for Vero cells as a cell culture model for HuNoV.

OBJECTIVE: To highlight the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke secondary to postulated COVID-19 mediated vasculopathy with concomitant ECMO related bleeding complications. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has shown to be a systemic illness, not localized to the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma. Stroke is a common neurological complication. In particular, critically ill patients on ECMO are likely at higher risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: 38-year-old man presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Due to severe respiratory failure, he required ECMO support. Subsequently, he was found to have left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Overall, his clinical course improved, and he was discharged with minimal neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Although intracranial hemorrhage is a known complication of ECMO, patients with COVID-19 infection may be at a higher risk of cerebrovascular complications due to vasculopathy.

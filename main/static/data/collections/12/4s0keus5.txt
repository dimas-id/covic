The overwhelming majority of RNase activity is engaged in catabolic processes. Viruses have no metabolism of their own, but rely completely on host cellular energy and substrate provision to support the biochemical processes necessary for virus replication. It is therefore obvious that RNA hydrolysis does not represent an obligate step in the viral life cycle that would have to be governed by viral proteins. Accordingly, RNases are found only rarely in the viral proteomes and serve special functions. In this chapter, several virus-specific RNases will be described and their role in the viral life cycle discussed. The text will concentrate on RNases of members of the nidoviruses, herpesviruses, pestiviruses, and several viruses with segmented negative-strand RNA genome including influenza virus. These enzymes are involved in specific steps of viral gene expression, viral genome replication, shutoff of host cellular gene expression, and interference with the hostâ€™s immune response to virus infection.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease characterized by several important systemic problems such as severe pneumonia. One of mechanisms responsible of these systemic problems is the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6(Conti et al., 2020). The binding of virus to TRL (Toll Like Receptor) can determine the release of pro-IL-1beta with successive activation and production of active mature IL-1beta, responsible of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis(Conti et al., 2020). The interstitial pneumonia is linked to an over-production of IL-6. Based on this principle, several researchers started the use of an anti-arthritis drug, tocilizumab, for its anti-IL-6 action.

The scientific literature of coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly expanding. There is a growing evidence on the discrepancy between clinical symptoms and radiologic findings in many patients. This case report gives details about a patient with only mild symptoms but relatively severe radiological findings. The 75-year-old patient suffering from oncologic disease had a planned a F18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron-emission tomography/computer tomography scan with a routine oncological indication where incidental radiomorphologic findings of pneumonia suspect for COVID-19 were detected. After immediate isolation, the patient was transferred to the corresponding medical department, where further investigations verified the diagnosis of COVID-19. With this case, our aim is to raise the awareness for the importance of the instant evaluation of chest computer tomography series when performing planned imaging examination, especially in frail patients. With this practice, potential radiomorphologic findings of pneumonia suspect for COVID-19 could be identified in time, which fundamentally determines further patient management steps.

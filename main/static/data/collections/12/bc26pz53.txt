AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To determine what is known about hypertension among adults living in Haiti. BACKGROUND Hypertension is the leading cause of morbidity, the identified cause of heart failure in 45% of patients and is associated with more than 70% of cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions in Haiti. DESIGN An integrative review of the literature. METHODS Searching four databases from 2007 to 2018, Whittemore and Knafl's method was used to review the literature. Three nurse researchers independently reviewed and appraised each publication applying the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Appraisal tool. RESULTS Eight publications were identified and appraised for level and quality of evidence. The synthesis of the literature yielded common themes of (i) high prevalence of hypertension among adults living in rural areas, (ii) public health challenges, (iii) lack of knowledge and awareness of hypertension and (iv) barriers to effective treatment. CONCLUSION Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease in Haiti that is understudied and warrants attention. To better serve this vulnerable population, culturally tailored prevention strategies and disease management programmes are recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE There is a lack of quality evidence to guide nurses in the management of hypertension for this vulnerable population. Identification of barriers to effective treatment among this underserved population will assist nurses and other healthcare professionals in identifying best possible practices for patient care in clinical settings across Haiti.

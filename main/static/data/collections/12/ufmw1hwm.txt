Social media plays an important role in alerting and educating the public during disease outbreaks. By increasing awareness of the disease and its prevention, it can lead to a modification of behaviour which then affects contact/incidence rates. Social media data may also be used when formulating, developing and parameterising models. As mobile technology continues to evolve and proliferate, social media is expected to occupy an increasingly prominent role in the field of infectious disease modelling to improve their predictive power. This article presents a review of existing models incorporating media in general and highlights opportunities for social media to enhance traditional compartmental models so as to make the best use of this resource in controlling the spread of disease.

The incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections (OIs) has dramatically declined with the ability to achieve viral suppression and immune reconstitution with potent antiretroviral therapy. However, a large number of patients remain at risk for OIs because they are diagnosed at late stages of HIV disease, fail to stay in treatment, or fail to maintain viral suppression. Clinicians should remain vigilant for OIs and for changes in recommended management strategies. Issues that often arise in this regard include how to interpret polymerase chain reaction diagnostic results in individuals with HIV infection; whether primary prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex is still needed; whether clinicians should screen asymptomatic patients for cryptococcal antigen; and need for amphotericin B in treatment regimens for cryptococcal meningitis. This article summarizes a presentation by Henry Masur, MD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program held in Washington, DC, in April 2018.

We developed a label-free, real-time, and highly sensitive nucleic acid biosensor based on fiber optic particle plasmon resonance (FOPPR). The biosensor employs a single-strand deoxyoligonucleotides (ssDNA) probe, conjugated to immobilized gold nanoparticles on the core surface of an optical fiber. We explore the steric effects on hybridization affinity and limit of detection (LOD), by using different ssDNA probe designs and surface chemistries, including diluent molecules of different lengths in mixed self-assembled monolayers, ssDNA probes of different oligonucleotide lengths, ssDNA probes in different orientations to accommodate target oligonucleotides with a hybridization region located unevenly in the strand. Based on the optimized ssDNA probe design and surface chemistry, we achieved LOD at sub-nM level, which makes detection of target oligonucleotides as low as 1 fmol possible in the 10-Î¼L sensor chip. Additionally, the FOPPR biosensor shows a good correlation in determining HLA-B27 mRNA, in extracted blood samples from patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), with the clinically accepted real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The results from this fundamental study should guide the design of ssDNA probe for anti-sense sensing. Further results through application to HLA-B27 mRNA detection illustrate the feasibility in detecting various nucleic acids of chemical and biological relevance.

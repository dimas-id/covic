The construction of quantum computer simulators requires advanced software which can capture the most significant characteristics of the quantum behavior and quantum states of qubits in such systems. Additionally, one needs to provide valid models for the description of the interface between classical circuitry and quantum core hardware. In this study, we model electron transport in semiconductor qubits based on an advanced CMOS technology. Starting from 3D simulations, we demonstrate an order reduction and the steps necessary to obtain ordinary differential equations on probability amplitudes in a multi-particle system. We compare numerical and semi-analytical techniques concluding this paper by examining two case studies: the electron transfer through multiple quantum dots and the construction of a Hadamard gate simulated using a numerical method to solve the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation and the tight-binding formalism for a time-dependent Hamiltonian.

Plant molecular farming depends on a diversity of plant systems for production of useful recombinant proteins. These proteins include protein biopolymers, industrial proteins and enzymes, and therapeutic proteins. Plant production systems include microalgae, cells, hairy roots, moss, and whole plants with both stable and transient expression. Production processes involve a narrowing diversity of bioreactors for cell, hairy root, microalgae, and moss cultivation. For whole plants, both field and automated greenhouse cultivation methods are used with products expressed and produced either in leaves or seeds. Many successful expression systems now exist for a variety of different products with a list of increasingly successful commercialized products. This chapter provides an overview and examples of the current state of plant-based production systems for different types of recombinant proteins.

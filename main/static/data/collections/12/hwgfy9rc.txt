BACKGROUND Most morbidity and mortality are caused by a pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and its prevention is the major concern. We applied the omental roll-up technique around pancreaticojejunostomy and investigated the effectiveness of this technique to prevent a pancreatic fistula. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Tertiary hepatobiliary and pancreas surgery clinic, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul. PATIENTS Between March 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011, 68 patients underwent PD. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the surgical application of the omental roll-up technique around the PJ site: group 1 (those who did not undergo the omental roll-up technique) compared with group 2 (those who did undergo the omental roll-up technique). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The occurrence of a pancreatic fistula. RESULTS No differences were noted in the clinical characteristics, including patients' demographics and operation-related factors, between the 2 groups. A pancreatic fistula occurred in 23 of 39 patients in group 1 (59%) and in 6 of 29 patients in group 2 (20.7%). Group 2 had a significantly lower incidence of pancreatic fistula (P = .002), and these fistulas were classified as being grade A using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula Definition showing a transient high amylase level in the drainage fluid without significantly affecting the patient's recovery. Drain removal was performed earlier in group 2 (P < .001). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 23.4 days in group 1 compared with 15.9 days in group 2 (P = .009). Overall mortality was 1.5%; however, no deaths were related to a pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSIONS The omental roll-up technique for the PJ site definitely reduced the occurrence of a pancreatic fistula. Therefore, the omental roll-up technique is a simple and effective strategy to prevent a pancreatic fistula.

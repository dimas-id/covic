Abstract Analysis of the protein composition of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), purified by an improved procedure, by polacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed three major structural proteins (of MW 84,000, 50,000, and 29,000d) and a minor one of MW 220,000d. The three major proteins constitute about 98% of the total viral protein and all three were shown to be glycoproteins. One of the major proteins (MW 29,000d) and the minor protein were shown to be associated with subviral particles isolated by treatment of virus with the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40. Only traces of the other two proteins were detected in the subviral particles. Synthesis of virus-induced proteins in TSWV-infected tobacco leaves was studied by labeling infected and healthy tissue with [3H]and [14C]valine, respectively. The labeled tissues were then fractionated into crude subcellular fractions and protein patterns of healthy and infected tissues were compared by coelectrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Only one virus-specific protein (of MW 49,000d) was detected in the virus-enriched fractions; this corresponded with the viral structural protein of MW 50,000d.

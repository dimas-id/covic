Geometric attacks are still challenging issues in image watermarking. In this paper, the robustness of different insertion position and shape of the watermark are evaluated in watermarking scheme based on Fourier-Mellin transform. We propose diagonal, rectangular, and circular insertion of the mark. The robustness of these techniques against geometric deformations such as rotation, scaling and translation (RST) is evaluated. Results show that the circular insertion performs better for translation and scaling attacks, while the diagonal insertion is better for rotations and RST attacks. The last point makes the diagonal insertion to be preferred in industrial applications since the combination of RST attacks often occurs in many applications such as printing the image on a physical support, and scanning it (print-scan attack).

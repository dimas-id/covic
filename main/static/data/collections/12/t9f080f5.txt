Abstract Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at-risk for both COVID-19 and secondary cardiovascular outcomes. Their increased cardiovascular risk may be mitigated through physical activity, but public health measures implemented for COVID-19 can make physical activity challenging. We objectively measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, continuously measured by FitbitTM step-counts, in children with CHD. Step-counts were markedly lower in late March and early April 2020, compared to 2019 and to early March 2020. It is vital to understand how precautions for COVID-19 will impact the health of children with CHD, especially if they persist long-term.

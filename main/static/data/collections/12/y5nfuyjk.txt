With the rise in prevalence of obesity, most general surgeons will have to face the problem of the obese patient with an abdominal wall defect. Treatment of these bariatric patients raises unique challenges, and at this time there is still no consensus on the best treatment option. This study was performed in a high-volume bariatric and minimally invasive surgery center at a tertiary care facility in the USA. Twenty-eight morbidly obese patients treated at our facility between 2003 and 2008 were separated into four groups according to anatomic features and symptoms. Patients with the following characteristics were classified as having a favorable anatomy: body mass index not exceeding 50 kg/m(2), gynecoid body habitus, reducible hernias found in a central location, abdominal wall thickness less than 4 cm, and the defect's largest diameter not exceeding 8 cm. All other patients were classified as having an unfavorable anatomy. In this study, we report a systematic treatment approach for the morbidly obese patient presenting with a ventral hernia based on whether the hernia is symptomatic or asymptomatic, as well as the distinct characteristics of the hernia and body habitus features. We followed up on these patients postoperatively for at least 2 years, with a mean follow-up period of 30 months. Only a total of three hernia recurrences were observed. Successful treatment of ventral hernias in morbidly obese patients should be individualized based on the patient's symptoms and defined hernia characteristics.

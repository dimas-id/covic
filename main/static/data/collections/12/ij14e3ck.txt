INTRODUCTION In case of massive splenomegaly, laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) becomes challenging, uncomfortable and risky both for the surgeon and for the patient. As a consequence of ongoing research to obtain efficient and cheaper "scarless surgery", single-port technique and hand-assisted devices were developed and improved in this field. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present the clinical case of a patient affected by idiopathic myelofibrosis (MF) and splenomegaly who was admitted to our Department to perform a splenectomy for a suspected 5-cm splenic lesion. DISCUSSION The splenic longitudinal diameter measured 26 cm. The patient underwent splenectomy by laparoscopy, combining a single-port access and a gel-port device. The operation was completed laparoscopically. The operating time was 220 min and the estimate blood loss was 100 ml. The patient was discharged at 11 post-operative day in overall good conditions. Upon pathological analysis the splenic lesion was a localization of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma in the context of MF. CONCLUSION this novel "hybrid technique" of splenectomy, combining the advantages of reduced number of abdominal incisions of the single-port technique to those of the hand assistance, is feasible in massive splenomegaly with good results. Furthermore, the use of the sovrapubic retrieval incision as the introduction site for the hand assisted device is convincing, since it's useful for both tasks. Further studies with large casuistries are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of the technique.

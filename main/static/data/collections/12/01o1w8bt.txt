With the rapid expansion of the Web and the advent of the Internet of Things, there is a growing need to design tools for intelligent analytics and decision making on streams of data. Logic-based frameworks like LARS allow the execution of complex reasoning on such streams, but it is paramount that the computation is completed in a timely manner before the stream expires. To reduce the runtime, we can extend the validity of inferred conclusions to the future to avoid repeated derivations, but this is not enough to avoid all sources of redundant computation. To further alleviate this problem, this paper introduces a new technique that infers the impossibility of certain derivations in the future and blocks the reasoner from performing computation that is doomed to fail anyway. An experimental analysis on microbenchmarks shows that our technique leads to a significant reduction of the reasoning runtime.

Hernia emergencies are commonly encountered by the acute care surgeon. Although the location and contents may vary, the basic principles are constant: address the life-threatening problem first, then perform the safest and most durable hernia repair possible. Mesh reinforcement provides the most durable long-term results. Underlay positioning is associated with the best outcomes. Components separation is a useful technique to achieve tension-free primary fascial reapproximation. The choice of mesh is dictated by the degree of contamination. Internal herniation is rare, and preoperative diagnosis remains difficult. In all hernia emergencies, morbidity is high, and postoperative wound complications should be anticipated.

Understanding food choice is critical to developing effective health promotion efforts to counter the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Although physiologic, environmental, and social factors influence the development of health conditions, routine decisions, such as food choice, also contribute substantially over time. Behavioral scientists believe that these routine decisions represent a key opportunity to improve population health. We conducted a scoping review of both health and business literature to identify themes in the food choices of young adults aged 19-24 y in the United States. Informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute processes for scoping reviews, we conducted a structured search of 8 health and business databases on 18 April 2017. The databases were PubMed, Business Source Complete, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and ABI/Inform Collection. Eligible literature captured real-world dietary choices of the general population of young adults between 1 January, 2007 and 31 December, 2017. Records were screened in Covidence. Data was extracted into Excel and key findings thematically analyzed. The search returned 9085 records. Ninety-nine records met the eligibility criteria. Themes identified in the foods chosen by young adults include inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, choosing international flavors and food formats, convenience foods, frequent snacking, the selection of healthy foods based on perceptions of what is healthy rather than the nutrient or calorie content of foods, an interest in sustainable production methods, the desire to customize/tailor foods, foods young people find interesting, and regional foods. This research identified common food choices that can help inform the tailoring of health promotion efforts; however, more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and principles shaping these choices.

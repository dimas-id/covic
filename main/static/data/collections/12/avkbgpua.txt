Background The aim of the study was to compare the mini-open to the classic open repair techniques for Achilles tendon ruptures. Methods We retrospectively evaluated at a minimum of 2 years follow-up 32 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures; 17 underwent mini-open surgery (Group A) and 15 the open technique (Group B). Results No difference in Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score and in modified Leppillahti score was observed. With respect to the contralateral side the width of the operated Achilles tendon was 4.07 mm thicker in Group A and 7.67 mm in Group B (p<.05); the calf circumference reduction was respectively 10 mm and 23.75 mm (p<.05). Iso-kinetic peak force measurement of the calf muscle strength showed a loss of 8.21% in Group A versus 17.25% in Group B (p <.05). The mean Patient Satisfaction Score was 96.76 in Group A and 88.67 in Group B (p<.01); respectively 82.3% vs 66.7% of patients were able to return to previous levels of sporting activity. There were two post-operative complications in Group B and one in Group A. Conclusion Mini-open technique minimizes the risk of complications, leads to an improved tendon healing process and functional recovery with higher patient satisfaction. Level of evidence IV.

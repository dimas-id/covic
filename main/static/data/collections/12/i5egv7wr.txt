Middle East respiratory syndrome is an infection caused by a novel coronavirus. The primary source of the virus is infected camels in several countries in the Arabian peninsula. The infection is acquired by coming into contact with infected animals, animal products, or with patients who have the syndrome. Mortality for this syndrome is 30% to 40%, and treatment is supportive because no antiviral therapy exists.

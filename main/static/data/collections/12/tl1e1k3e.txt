Bovine enteric Corona virus (BEC) multiplies spontaneously with very high efficiency in HRT 18 cells; this line established from human rectum adenocarcinoma presents some properties of the differentiated brush border cell of the intestinal villi. Titers obtained are very high (5 x 10(7) TCID 50/ml virus strain F15). The virus produced had the characteristic of BEC: shape, spikes, density 1.19, hemadsorption and hemagglutination of rat erythrocytes. Human and dog enteritic corona viruses replicate also in HRT 18 cells.

PURPOSE: Every advanced oxidation process (AOP) has its limitations in water purification. Novel designs with simultaneous application of different AOPs can offer better solutions for cleaner water. METHODS: We have comparatively studied two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) on decolourisation of Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) azo dye pollutant from water: gas plasma treatment by low power atmospheric pressure plasma using novel plasma needle configuration, and semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalysis using titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) nanopowders. Additionally, simultaneous application of two advanced oxidation processes on azo dye decolourisation was studied. RESULTS: It was found that plasma treatment is very efficient system for the dye removal even for low flow rates (1 slm) of the Ar as feed gas. The presence of 10% of O(2) in Ar flow intensified dye oxidation process and shortened required time for total decolourisation. When plasma and catalyst were simultaneously applied, TiO(2) was activated with a few Watts plasma source as well as 300 W UV lamp source. The synergic effect of two AOPs was more pronounced for higher feed gas flow rates, resulting in improved decolourisation efficiency. CONCLUSION: Plasma needle can efficiently remove Reactive Orange 16 azo dye from water with a power consumption of only few Watts. With the addition of TiO(2) the removal efficiency is significantly improved. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a key class of cellular regulators, involved in the modulation and control of multiple biological processes. Distinct classes of lncRNAs are now known to be induced by host cytokines following viral infections. Current evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs play essential roles at the host‚Äêpathogen interface regulating viral infections by either innate immune responses at various levels including activation of pathogen recognition receptors or by epigenetic, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional effects. We review the newly described mechanisms underlying the interactions between lncRNAs, cytokines, and metabolites differentially expressed following viral infections; we highlight the regulatory networks of host antiviral responses and emphasize the need for interdisciplinary research between lncRNA biology and immunology to deepen understanding of viral pathogenesis.

Recently, interest in supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) has increased due to its high throughput and the development of new system improving chromatographic performances. However, most papers dealt with fundamental studies and chiral applications and only few works described validation process of SFC method. Likewise, evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) has been widely employed in liquid chromatography but only a few recent works presented its quantitative performances hyphenated with SFC apparatus. The present paper discusses about the quantitative performances of SFC-ELSD compared to HPLC-ELSD, for the determination of plasticizers (ATBC, DEHA, DEHT and TOTM) in PVC tubing used as medical devices. After the development of HPLC-ELSD, both methods were evaluated based on the total error approach using accuracy profile. The results show that HPLC-ELSD was more precise than SFC-ELSD but lower limits of quantitation were obtained by SFC. Hence, HPLC was validated in the Â± 10% acceptance limits whereas SFC lacks of accuracy to quantify plasticizers. Finally, both methods were used to determine the composition of plasticized-PVC medical devices. Results demonstrated that SFC and HPLC both hyphenated with ELSD provided similar results.

We report a case of Legionella pneumonia in an immunocompetent child. Legionella pneumonia is a rare pathology among children,and even rarer when they are immuno-competent; a few cases have been reported in the literature. This is explained by the fact that infection occurs primarily to immuno-suppressed patients. Legionella bacteria are not systematicaly sought for in front of child's atypical pneumonia, contrary to Mycoplasma or Chlamydiae. In addition, a number of cases are probably not even noticed because either not serious (Pontiac fever), spontaneously cured, or cured with macrolides prescribed in the case of suspected pneumonia with Mycoplasma.

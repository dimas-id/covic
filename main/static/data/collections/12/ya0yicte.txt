Single incision laparoscopy is currently performed mostly for basic laparoscopic procedures involving single abdominal quadrants. The aim of this case report is to show that single incision laparoscopic techniques can be utilized for complex abdominal laparoscopic procedures with a large target organ and a working space involving all quadrants of the abdominal cavity. A single incision laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy with an ileorectal anastomosis and intraoperative CO(2) colonoscopy was performed for a patient with synchronous adenocarcinoma of the cecum and the sigmoid colon. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4 and had no immediate postoperative complications. Single incision laparoscopy is feasible for complex colorectal procedures. Some of the techniques used may be adapted further to achieve colonic resection via a natural orifice in the future.

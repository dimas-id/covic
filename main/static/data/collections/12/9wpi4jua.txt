Neuromuscular emergencies are a distinct group of acute neurological diseases with distinct characteristic presentations. Patients who suffer from this group of diseases are at immediate risk of losing protection of their native airway as well as aspirating orogastric contents. This is secondary to weakness of the muscles of the oropharynx and respiratory muscles. Although some neuromuscular emergencies such as myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barr√© syndrome are well understood, others such as critical illness myopathy and neuropathy are less well characterized. In this chapter, we have discussed the pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, and management options in patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit. We have also emphasized the importance of a thorough understanding of the use of pharmacological anesthetic agents in this patient population.

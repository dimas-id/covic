Influenza activity during the traditional Victorian influenza season from May to October 2004 was low with no well-defined peak. Surveillance was based on sentinel general practice influenza-like illness (ILI) notification with laboratory confirmation, locum service ILI notification and laboratory reporting of influenza detections. Eight hundred and fifteen consultations for ILI were reported from 38 general practices and 216 consultations for ILI were reported from the locum service. The average weekly rate of influenza-like-illness from sentinel surveillance was 5.4 cases per 1,000 consultations, representing normal seasonal activity. Influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant circulating sub-type, 88 per cent of which were identified as A/Fujian/411/2002-like and 12 per cent as A/Wellington/1/2004. All influenza B was B/Shanghai/361/2002-like. There was some mismatch with the 2004 influenza vaccine, which contained A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus, A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like virus, and B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like virus.

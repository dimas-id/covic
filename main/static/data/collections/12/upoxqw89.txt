Transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip (Abbott) is largely an elective procedure. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed challenges to health care systems; in many cases elective interventions have been curtailed. Patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and cardiogenic shock are high-risk surgical candidates and at risk of a poor outcome without intervention. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the Society of Coronary Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) recently proposed joint guidance on triage of structural heart disease (SHD) interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present two illustrative cases of severe MR and cardiogenic shock that were successfully treated with MitraClip amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with good outcomes at short term follow-up.

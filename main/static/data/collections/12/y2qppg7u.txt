We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the letter from Dr. Inès Harzallah, et al. Antiphospholipid antibody assays including lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin and anti–β2‐glycoprotein I have also been performed in dozens of our patients, however, very few of them got positive results, we don't think that antiphospholipid antibody exists universally in COVID‐19 patients. In addition, two of the three reported cases with antiphospholipid antibodies mentioned in the letter [1] also seem to meet the International Society on Haemostasis and Thrombosis (ISTH) criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation [2], the causality between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis in these cases is still uncertain.

There is a growing international awareness of the health risks associated with water, and particularly in developing countries. For example: (i) a child dies in Africa every 30s due to malaria—a disease related to stagnant water, (ii) every year flooding causes many deaths world-wide, with infant mortality due to diarrhea from contaminated flood waters posing the biggest threat, and (iii) poor sanitation and its relation to hepatitis A continues to be a serious problem. A revealing measure of the extent of such global problems is that more than half of the hospital beds in the world today are occupied by people with water-related diseases. Addressing these issues mandates an interdisciplinary approach by the world’s scientific and engineering community. In this spirit a workshop was held in Phoenix to provide a forum where epidemiologists, hydraulics researchers and other stakeholders of varied backgrounds (e.g., policy makers, environmental groups etc.) could all participate in a debate on a future agenda for hydro-epidemiology. The principal outcome of the workshop was a significant appreciation of the potential for interdisciplinary research and development in hydro-epidemiology and the major contribution that hydraulics professionals could offer, in partnership with the public health community, in addressing such water related disease control and prevention challenges.

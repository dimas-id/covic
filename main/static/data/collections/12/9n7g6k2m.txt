To investigate the molecular mediators of poliovirus tissue tropism, the correlation between poliovirus replication and poliovirus receptor expression was examined in a primary human tissue system. Earlier work [M. Freistadt, H. Fleit, and E. Wimmer, Virology 195: 798â€“803 (1993)] showed that the cellular receptor for poliovirus is present in 87% of primary human monocytes and that peripheral blood mononuclear cells support poliovirus replication. In the current work, monocytes, obtained by adherence or by a novel negative selection procedure using specific monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte surface antigens, supported poliovirus replication. However, total virus yield was low and infectious centers assays revealed that a minority (6%) of monocytes become productively infected. Viral yield from monocytes was lower than from the heterogeneous mononuclear cells; however, when uninfected lymphocytes were added back to infected monocytes, the higher viral yield was restored. The purity of the cells did not significantly affect the number of cells infected. These results suggest that more poliovirus is produced per cell from activated rather than unactivated monocytes. Furthermore, poliovirus replication in monocytes may reflect genuine in vivo replication and comprise a system in which to determine molecular mediators of poliovirus tissue tropism.

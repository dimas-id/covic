Purpose: The COVID-19 Pandemic has literally left the world breathless in the chase for Pharmacotherapy. With the vaccine approval likely more than a year away and novel drugs in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage. A potential drug discussed both in geopolitical and global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We intend to systematically weigh and analyze the existing evidence of HCQ in the light of published and pre-print data available so far. Methods: PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases and official clinical trial Registries of the United States, China, WHO ICTRP were electronically searched for studies for the use of HCQ in patients with COVID-19. Pre-proof article repositories like MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and ChemRxiv were also included in the search. The literature was critically appraised. Results: Total 71 articles were available as of 15 th April of which articles of relevance (three invitro studies, two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one follow-up study, three reviews, ten short communications) and 88 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed. HCQ seems to be efficient in inhibiting of SARS CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines; there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. Conclusions: The in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Currently literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of HCQ in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.

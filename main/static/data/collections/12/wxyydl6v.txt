Respiratory point-of-care tests (POCT), detecting influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), were implemented in response to recent RSV outbreaks at a regional haemato-oncology unit in Glasgow. We provide a descriptive study of pre- and post- POCT implementation, which suggests POCT reduce the time taken to receive results and increase diagnostic rates in outpatients. It is likely that the reduction in turn-around-time afforded by POCT also lead to a faster time to antiviral treatment, prompt isolation and a reduction in the number of hospital acquired infections.

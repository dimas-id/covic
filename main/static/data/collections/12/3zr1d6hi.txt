The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted every aspect of society in a way never previously experienced by our nation's orthopaedic surgeons. In response to the challenges the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery has taken steps to adapt our Board Certification and Continuous Certification processes. These changes were made to provide flexibility for as many Candidates and Diplomates as possible to participate while maintaining our high standards. The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery is first and foremost committed to the safety and well-being of our patients, physicians, and families while striving to remain responsive to the changing circumstances affecting our Candidates and Diplomates.

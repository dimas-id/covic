BACKGROUND: Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), characterized by fever and/or hemorrhage, is a zoonotic viral disease with high mortality. The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. CCHF is a life-threatening disease observed endemically over a wide geographical regions in the world, and there is limited information about pulmonary findings in CCHF patients. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the pulmonary findings belonging to a large CCHF patient cohort and to determine if there is any relationship between laboratory findings and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 165 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF and examined through chest X-ray (CXR) due to respiratory symptoms at their first examination and/or during their hospitalization were included in this study. In addition to demographical and laboratory findings of the patients, chest X-rays were also examined. RESULTS: Of the 165 patients examined, 96 were male (58.2%) and 69 were female (41.8%). The mean age was 51.64 ± 17.95 years (4–81 years). Single and/or multiple pathological findings were detected in 93 patients (56.4%) as a result of chest X-ray during their first examination. On chest X-ray, consolidation in 74 patients (44.8%), pleural effusion in 64 patients (39.8%), ground glass opacity in 49 patients (29.7%), and atelectasis in 30 patients (18.2%) were detected. CONCLUSION: According to the results of our study, it can be suggested that radiological examination in lungs should be performed primarily with CXR and pulmonary involvement (pleural effusion and consolidation) affects survival in CCHF negatively.

Reversible circuits are one of the technologies that can provide future low energy circuits. The synthesis of an optimal reversible circuit for a given function is an np-hard problem. The meta-heuristic approaches are one of the most promising methods for these types of optimization problems. In this paper, a new approach for ACO reversible synthesis is presented. Usually, authors build an ACO system with the use of truth table or permutation representation of the reversible function. In this work, a Walsh spectral representation of a Boolean function is used. This allows dividing search spaces into smaller “promising” areas with well-defined transition operations between them. As a result, we can minimize the enormous search space and generate better solutions than obtained by ACO synthesis with classical reversible function representation. The proposed approach was applied to benchmark reversible functions of 4,5 and 6 variables and compared to other meta-heuristic results and best-known solutions.

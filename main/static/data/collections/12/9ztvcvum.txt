OBJECTIVE To review published literature describing the global use of topical antipsoriatics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Search for English-language articles in Embase, Pubmed, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library. RESULTS Fifty-four selected publications were found, describing psoriasis patients' use of topical antipsoriatics, using six different methods to collect data. The eight most frequently used topical treatments from the regions North/South America, North/Central/South Europe, Asia, Middle East and Australia were: corticosteroids used by 16-79%, complementary and alternative medicines used by 10-62%, phototherapies used by 0.4-75%, calcipotriol used by 4.2-73%, corticosteroid/calcipotriol combinations used by 3.3-71%, tar used by 0.8-66%, anthralin used by 15% and emollients used as monotherapy by 1-23%. Rates of patient-reported adherence to topical remedies ranged from 51% to 90% and rates of patient-reported satisfaction with topical as it pertains to symptom control ranged from 12% to 52%. CONCLUSION The identified use patterns are varying and reflect a lack of data from large parts of the world and noncomparable studies using heterogeneous study designs. However, this study emphasizes the importance of medical professionals involvement of the patient with respect to choosing prescribed topical treatment and the possibility of patients' use of alternative treatments. More drug utilization studies, both survey and register based, from different parts of the world are needed to provide more conclusive evidence about patients' use of topical antipsoriatics.

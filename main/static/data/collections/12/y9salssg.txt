PURPOSE To compare peri-operative outcomes between laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) and laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) for the treatment of uterine fibroids. METHODS Retrospective cohort study including 400 women who underwent LH or LM for the management of uterine fibroids. RESULTS LH patients were older, with higher BMI and larger uterine size but LH was associated with shorter operative duration (80.2 vs. 115.7 min, p < 0.0001), lower blood loss (215 vs. 316 ml, p < 0.0001), and shorter hospital stay (1.81 vs. 2.12 days, p = 0.0003). Seven LM patients (3.2%) had blood loss >1000 ml compared with no LH patients and five LM patients (2.3%) required blood transfusion compared to 1 (0.5%) LH patient. Three LM patients (1.9%) and no LH patients required conversion to laparotomy. Bladder injury occurred in three LH cases (1.6%) and no LM cases. When the data was restricted only to women aged 44 years or over, LH was again associated with significantly lower operative duration and estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS Particularly in perimenopausal women, the decision to perform myomectomy can be controversial. These data suggest that there are potential advantages to LH over LM, including reduced operation length, blood loss and hospital stay but increased risk of urinary tract injury.

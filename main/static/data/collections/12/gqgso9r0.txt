PURPOSE We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of figure of eight (FoE) suture for groin access closure in cryoballoon (CB) ablation and its impact on the lab workflow. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent CB ablation in our institution from June 2018. From June 2019, we have been consistently using FoE suture for hemostasis (FoE+ group), and before that conventional manual compression was utilized (FoE- group). Ablations were performed under uninterrupted oral anticoagulant strategy. Both femoral veins were punctured, and a single introducer was placed in each vein. In the FoE- group, after ablation, protamine was administered, and manual compression was applied. In the FoE+ group, the suture was placed in both groins without protamine administration and manual compression. All patients were in decubitus position until the next morning. RESULTS A total of 190 consecutive patients (73.2% male, 59.7 ± 11.0 years old) were evaluated, 90 being in the FoE+ group. There was no difference in the mean procedure duration between two groups (72.7 ± 23.1 min vs 73.7 ± 27.1 min, p = 0.784). However, the total lab time was significantly longer in FoE- group (132.9 ± 35.3 min vs 109.9 ± 32.6 min, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in complication rates. No major vascular complications were found in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS Utilization of FoE sutures for hemostasis seems to be a safe and effective after cryoballoon ablation. It abolishes the need for protamine administration which can cause serious adverse events. As manual compression is unrequired, EP lab workflow improves due to significantly shortened total lab time per patient.

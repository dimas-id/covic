The purpose of this study was to profile gene expression in periapical lesions during root canal treatment (RCT). Periapical lesions were induced experimentally by exposing the pulp in Sprague-Dawley rats. After 3 wk, the animals received root canal filling (RCF) and were sacrificed 1 or 4 wk later. From the periapical tissues, total RNA was extracted and processed for cDNA-microarray analysis. The lesions were histologically and radiographically confirmed to expand 4 wk after pulp exposure (inflammation phase) and to stabilize 4 wk after RCF (healing phase). In approximately 30,000 genes on the microarray, 203 genes were up-regulated to more than 5-fold (e.g., IL-1beta), and 864 genes were down-regulated to less than 20% of baseline level (e.g., caspase 8) in inflammation phase. Compared with inflammation phase, we found that 133 genes were up-regulated (e.g., IL-1alpha) and 50 genes were down-regulated (e.g., defensin alpha5) in healing phase. Corresponding to the gene expression profiles, accumulation of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta was observed in the periapical lesions by immunohistochemistry. These gene profiles might be useful in diagnosing the healing process of periapical lesions.

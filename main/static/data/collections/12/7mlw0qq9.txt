BACKGROUND We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the outcomes of Lichenstein hernia repair using either self-gripping mesh or techniques of sutured mesh fixation. METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for all clinical trials and observational studies that compared self-gripping mesh versus sutured mesh fixation in Lichtenstein hernia repair. Combined outcomes were pooled as odds ratios or mean differences in a fixed-effect model, using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software for Windows. RESULTS Twelve randomized, controlled trials and 5 cohort studies (n = 3,722 patients) were included in the final analysis. The two groups, using self-gripping mesh or sutured mesh fixation, did not differ significantly in terms of recurrence rate (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.18-2.44; P = .54) or postoperative chronic groin pain (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.54-1.05; P = .09). The operative time was less in the self-gripping mesh group (mean difference = -7.85, 95% confidence interval -9.94 to -5.76; P < .0001). For safety analysis, there were comparable risks between self-gripping mesh and sutured mesh fixation groups in terms of postoperative infection (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.53-1.23; P = .32), postoperative hematoma (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.7-1.36; P = .9), and urinary retention (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.18-2.44; P = .54). CONCLUSION Data from our analysis did not favor either of the two fixation techniques over the other in terms of recurrence or postoperative chronic groin pain. Decreased operative time in the self-gripping mesh group cannot justify a recommendation for its routine use. Longer follow-up studies are needed to compare the risk of long-term recurrence for both meshes.

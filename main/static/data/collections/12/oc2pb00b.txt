Introduction The novel coronavirus (COVID19) can result in several neurological complications. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is one of them and has been reported from different parts of the world in this pandemic. It is an acute post-infectious polyneuropathy. The review aims to summarize the demographic features, clinical presentation, diagnostics workup, and management strategies of COVID-19 associated GBS reported in the literature. Material and method We searched Medline, PubMed Central, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar using pre-defined keywords, with no time limits and in the English language only. We aimed to include all kinds of manuscripts. The last search was done on 18th May 2020. Demographics, clinical features, diagnostic workup, management, and outcomes were documented in the datasheet. Results We identified 24 cases of COVID-19 associated GBS. Most of the cases were reported from Italy followed by the USA. The majority were males (18 /24) The age ranged from 23 -84 years. The clinical presentation was typical sensory-motor GBS in most. Nine patients had facial palsy of which five had bilateral involvement. Two patients had bilateral abducent nerve palsy while two presented as paraparetic GBS variant with autonomic dysfunction. Electrodiagnostics was performed in 17 patients only and 12 had typical features of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulins were the preferred mode of treatment in most of the patient. There was one death, and most were discharged to rehabilitation or home. Conclusion GBS is a frequent neurological complication associated with COVID-19. There is no clear causative relationship between GBS, and COVID-19 at present, and more data are needed to establish the casualty. However, most cases have a post-infectious onset with male preponderance. Most of the cases have a typical presentation but some may present in an atypical way. Prognosis is generally good.

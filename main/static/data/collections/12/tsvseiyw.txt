Abstract Children are frequently admitted to hospital wards with viral infections. Many are not life-threatening to the index case, but the spread to vulnerable patients who are already at higher risk should be avoided. To do so requires active awareness and availability of rapid diagnosis (i.e. the same day). Cohorting and handwashing have been found to be the best measures to prevent spread of respiratory syncytial virus (responsible for considerable morbidity every winter) in hospital wards.

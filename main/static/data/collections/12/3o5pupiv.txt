The aim of this study was to perform the molecular characterization of the eleven genes of a G6P[5] bovine group A rotavirus (RVA) strain detected in a diarrhea outbreak from a vaccinated beef cattle herd. The outbreak affected 80 % of calves between 15â€“30 days old. RVA was identified by RT-PCR in 12 (70.6 %) out of 17 diarrheic fecal samples evaluated. The rotavirus wild-type strain had the genotype constellation G6(IV)-P[5](IX)-I2c-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2e-H3a. This study confirms the importance of homotypic immunity against the bovine RVA P[5] genotype in neonatal diarrhea in cattle herds that are regularly vaccinated against rotaviruses.

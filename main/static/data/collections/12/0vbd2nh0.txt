The social restrictions during the COVID-19 crisis led to many therapists providing therapy remotely, despite some therapistsâ€™ concerns regarding its efficacy, technical challenges and their ability to build a strong therapeutic relationship online. This survey study reports on the experiences of 141 therapists who transitioned to providing video therapy during the pandemic. Aspects of the therapeutic relationship (e.g. working alliance, real relationship), experienced anxiety and professional self-doubt, attitudes towards and intention of video therapy use in the future were assessed. Although therapists reported some anxiety and self-doubt, most felt that online sessions had a sufficient working alliance and a strong real relationship. Therapists with more online therapy experience, lower levels of self-doubt and anxiety, and those who experienced a strong online real relationship during the pandemic, or thought their patients viewed it positively, tended to be more accepting of video therapy. Therapists were largely undecided as to whether they planned to use video therapy in the future; however, those with prior video therapy experience were more likely to endorse future utilization. Training is needed, especially for therapists with less online therapy experience, in order to foster a better experience and to support effective use of online therapy in the future.

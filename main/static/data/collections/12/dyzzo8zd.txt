Seven foals aged 18 days to 3 1/2 months had either single or multiple full-circumference segments or long antimesenteric bands of necrotizing duodenitis, sharply delineated from adjacent viable duodenum. Perforation of the necrotic wall had occurred in all foals, leading to acute fibrinous peritonitis. On the mucosal surface severe diffuse, acute inflammation and ulceration involved the anterior half of the duodenum. Two further foals, aged 28 and 30 days, had lesions that are believed to be a chronic form of this disease. Both foals had a thickened duodenal wall, with large areas of mucosa replaced by granulation tissue. In addition one had several strictures associated with firm adhesions between the duodenal serosa and adjacent structures, together with ascending cholangiohepatitis and pancreatitis. Eight foals had gastric ulcers that were considered to be of less significance than the duodenal lesions. No etiologic agent could be found by aerobic or anaerobic bacterial culturing, negative contrast electron microscopy for viruses, or immunofluorescence staining for equine herpesvirus 1, equine adenovirus, or equine coronavirus. The possible involvement of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is discussed.

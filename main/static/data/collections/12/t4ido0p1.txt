Economically, foot-and-mouth disease is the most important viral-induced livestock disease worldwide. The disease is highly contagious and foot-and-mouth disease virus replicates and spreads extremely rapidly. Recent outbreaks in previously foot-and-mouth disease-free countries and the potential use of foot-and-mouth disease virus by terrorist groups have demonstrated the vulnerability of countries and the need to develop control strategies that can rapidly inhibit or limit spread of the disease. The current vaccine, an inactivated whole-virus preparation, has a number of limitations for use in outbreaks in disease-free countries. This review discusses the potential of the antiviral agent, Type I interferon, to produce rapid protection and proposes a combination strategy of an antiviral agent and a foot-and-mouth disease vaccine to induce both immediate and long-lasting protective responses.

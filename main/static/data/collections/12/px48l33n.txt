Abstract The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) patients and their care, especially given the potential for severe COVID-19 disease in those with a depressed immune status. Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis have been particularly affected by this pandemic due to their need to travel multiple times a week to receive treatment. Although patients on home dialysis are able to avoid such exposure, they face their own unique challenges. In this review, we will discuss the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic for patients on home dialysis, the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of their care, and the resultant rapid adaptations in policy/health care delivery mechanisms with implications for the future care of home dialysis patients.

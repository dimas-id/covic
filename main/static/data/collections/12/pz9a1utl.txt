Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), newly discovered since December 2019(Chen et al, 2020; Guan et al, 2020; Lu et al, 2020). According to WHO situation report (<https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports>) on 1 April, 2020, a total of 823626 cases and over 40000 death had been documented globally, rapidly evolving into a pandemic. As reported by previous studies, patients with pre-existing health conditions are more likely to progress to severe COVID-19 pneumonia(Guan et al, 2020; Huang et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2020; Zhao et al, 2020b). Here we report a COVID-19 case with pre-existing acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL).

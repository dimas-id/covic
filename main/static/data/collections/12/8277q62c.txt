Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, especially in younger patients. Our hypothesis was that intestinal SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 expression depends on patients’ age. We examined duodenal biopsies from 43 healthy human adults. ACE2 gene expression was directly correlated with age (Spearman’s r = 0.317, p = 0.039). With each year, duodenal ACE2 expression increased by 0.083 RU. The higher intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression in older patients may impact on their susceptibility to develop intestinal symptoms.

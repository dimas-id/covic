Bats are now known as the source of several diseases in humans, but few studies regarding immune responses and factors associated with bats have so far been reported. In this study, we focused on STAT1, one of the critical components in interferon (IFN)-signaling and antiviral activity, which is often targeted by viral proteins to reduce antiviral activity and increase viral replication. We found that Rousettus aegyptiacus STAT1 (bat STAT1) is phosphorylatable and translocates to the nucleus when stimulated with human IFN-α (hIFN-α). Furthermore, phosphorylation of bat STAT1 and inhibition of nuclear translocation was observed in IFN-stimulated cells infected with the HEP-Flury strain of rabies virus, in the same manner as in other mammals. Additionally, quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that bat STAT1 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver, while low in muscle and spleen.

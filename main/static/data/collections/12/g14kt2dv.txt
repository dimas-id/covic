Treating tropical diseases: Structure‐based design afforded highly active triazine nitrile inhibitors of the protozoan cysteine proteases falcipain‐2 and rhodesain. Optimization of the occupancy of the S1, S2, and S3 pockets of these enzymes yielded inhibitory constants in the low nanomolar activity range. The new ligands are selective against other related proteases and exhibit in vitro activities against the protozoan parasites.[Image: see text]

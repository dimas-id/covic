BACKGROUND. Occupational therapy is often part of the multi-disciplinary approach within the Developmental, Individual-differences, Relationship-based (DIR) FloortimeTM Model. The model addresses the emotional development of children, which is considered to be critical for the other child developmental areas. PURPOSE. This review serves to inform practitioner decision-making about the use of this model, as no systematic reviews exist on child development outcomes. METHODS. The systematic search included Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and Cochrane. For critical appraisal, the McMaster Critical Review was utilized. FINDINGS. Nine studies were identified with varying quality levels. Outcomes were mostly reported for increased socio-emotional development. IMPLICATIONS. The evidence base for this model is emerging from a published research perspective. It is recommended that the use of this model be supported by sound clinical reasoning processes, intervention fidelity, use of valid outcome measures, and regular monitoring. Higher quality research is urgently needed to progress the research base for this intervention.

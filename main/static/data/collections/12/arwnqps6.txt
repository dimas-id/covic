The media play a key role in promoting public health and influencing debate regarding health issues; however, some topics seem to generate a stronger response in the public, and this may be related to how the media construct and deliver their messages. Mass media coverage of COVID-19 epidemic has been exceptional with more than 180,000 articles published each day in 70 languages from March 8 to April 8, 2020. One may well wonder if this massive media attention ever happened in the past and if it has been finally proven to be beneficial or even just appropriate. Surgical site and implant-related infections represent a substantial part of health care-associated infections; with an estimated overall incidence of 6% post-surgical infection, approximately 18 million new surgical site infections are expected each year globally, with 5 to 10% mortality rate and an astounding economic and social cost. In the current mediatic era, orthopaedic surgeons need to refocus some of their time and energies from surgery to communication and constructive research. Only raising mediatic awareness on surgical site and implant-related infections may tune up the volume of silent epidemics to a level that can become audible by governing institutions.

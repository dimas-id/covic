The discipline of strategy has a language and set of diagnostic frameworks. These are used to guide the development and assessment of strategy. Some of the key frameworks are presented here. Because this language is seldom used by the universities to communicate their strategies, it leaves the impression that some of the core concepts of the discipline were not used to guide the development of these strategies. This chapter also addresses the issues of the likely disruptive influence of MOOCs on university education and the role that rankings are playing in measuring performance guiding future strategy.

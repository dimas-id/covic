PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to describe a novel technique using amniotic membrane suture-fixated onto custom-designed symblepharon rings in a patient with acute toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). METHODS A 61-year-old man developed bilateral symblephara and severe ocular surface inflammation from Stevens-Johnson syndrome/TEN secondary to allopurinol. Eight days after admission, he was treated with placement of custom-designed symblepharon rings, designed by one of the authors (A.A.), covered with amniotic membrane. This method was used to allow for efficient placement of the membrane and to minimize operative time and perioperative risks due to his worsening systemic condition. RESULTS On postoperative day 49, his visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Both eyes were quiet with only small symblephara noted temporally. CONCLUSIONS The use of amniotic membrane suture-fixated to custom-designed symblepharon rings provides sufficient coverage of the ocular surface, leading to excellent visual and clinical outcomes by reducing inflammation and protecting the ocular surface from the cicatrizing sequelae associated with ocular-involving TEN. This novel technique is less invasive, more time efficient, and likely safe for even the most critically ill patients with significant risk for mortality, thus allowing any treating ophthalmologist to comfortably perform this important sight-saving procedure.

The Department of Respiratory Medicine of Nippon Medical School Hospital and the Working Committee of Clinical Simulation Laboratory have held training sessions for chest tube drainage since 2007. The training program consists of the preparation of a training manual, a small-group session, and a review of the process of chest tube drainage using a checklist of steps after the session. A total of 21 medical interns of Nippon Medical School Hospital participated in training sessions from April 2010 through February 2011. A questionnaire survey at the end of the session revealed that most participants rated highly both the explanations given by the instructors and the descriptions in the manual for comprehensibility. Only 3 interns felt that they had successfully acquired the clinical skill, and the other 18 interns felt that they had somewhat acquired the skill. Research after the interns had completed the program of the department showed that 80% of interns had performed chest tube drainage for patients during the rotation. The interns assessed the training program as useful, and some interns felt they could perform the skill with confidence or without anxiety. Other systematic programs of skill training for medical interns are recommended to ensure definite acquisition of basic skills.

The historical background of the present UK legislation is briefly reviewed, and the current legal situation as it pertains to the UK and European Community is summarised. The reasons for the inclusion of antibiotics in feed are outlined and discussed. In the first case, feedstuffs may have to be medicated for reasons of disease prevention and control. In large herds, especially in loose housing, mass medication by injection is not possible and even minimal disease herds will become infected with airborne pathogens from time to time. In the second case, continuous low-level feeding of antibiotics to growing pigs (growth promoters) suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria and allows healthier pigs to grow faster and more efficiently, thus producing cheaper food at the same time as improving welfare. The legal requirements regarding medicines available only on prescription are outlined and discussed. The fears and worries of the general public are noted and found to be overstated because of misconceptions and misunderstanding. It is concluded that food and milk produced today will remain safe provided the safety rules are adhered to.

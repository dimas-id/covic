The graph structure of biomedical data differs from those in typical knowledge graph benchmark tasks. A particular property of biomedical data is the presence of long-range dependencies, which can be captured by patterns described as logical rules. We propose a novel method that combines these rules with a neural multi-hop reasoning approach that uses reinforcement learning. We conduct an empirical study based on the real-world task of drug repurposing by formulating this task as a link prediction problem. We apply our method to the biomedical knowledge graph Hetionet and show that our approach outperforms several baseline methods.

Extrarenal pseudoaneurysms of transplanted kidneys are very rare but can have devastating consequences. In the past, these extrarenal pseudoaneurysms have often led to graft loss as well as significant morbidity and mortality. The role of advanced diagnostic imaging studies and of modern radiologic interventional management has not been studied. In this case series, we present four cases of extrarenal pseudoaneurysms of transplanted kidneys, describe the clinical scenarios and imaging that led to the angiographic diagnosis, and discuss the various endovascular and surgical approaches to management.

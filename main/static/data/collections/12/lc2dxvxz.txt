BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relative cross-protection conferred by infection with different groups of viruses through studies of sequential infections in humans. We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI). METHODS: Men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point. ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens in nasal wash samples, and survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI. RESULTS: Prior infection with adenovirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], .14–.44) or influenza virus (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38–.73) conferred relative protection against subsequent FRI episode. Results were statistically significant even after adjustment for the interval between enlistment and FRI (P < .001). Adenovirus-positive participants with FRI episodes tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and influenza virus (P = .062–.093), while men with influenza virus–positive FRI episodes tended be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus (P = .044) and influenza virus (P = .081). CONCLUSION: Prior adenovirus or influenza virus infection conferred cross-protection against subsequent FRI episodes relative to prior infection due to other circulating viruses.

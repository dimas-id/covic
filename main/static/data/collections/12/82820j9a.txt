Epidemiological outbreak data is often captured in line list and contact format to facilitate contact tracing for outbreak control. epicontacts is an R package that provides a unique data structure for combining these data into a single object in order to facilitate more efficient visualisation and analysis. The package incorporates interactive visualisation functionality as well as network analysis techniques. Originally developed as part of the Hackout3 event, it is now developed, maintained and featured as part of the R Epidemics Consortium (RECON). The package is available for download from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and GitHub.

Posttranslational modifications are increasingly recognized as key strategies used by bacterial and viral pathogens to modulate host factors critical for infection. A number of recent studies illustrate how pathogens use these posttranslational modifications to target central signaling pathways in the host cell, such as the NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways, which are essential for pathogens' replication, propagation, and evasion from host immune responses. These discoveries open new avenues for investigating the fundamental mechanisms of pathogen infection and the development of new therapeutics.

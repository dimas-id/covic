INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) has established itself as a safe method for the management of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Laparoscopic suturing is a time-consuming intraoperative task during LSC. Self-retaining barbed sutures (SBSs) are known to reduce the operative time in laparoscopic cases. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBS during the performance of LSC. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty female patients with symptomatic POP were treated with LSC by an expert surgeon. The preoperative evaluation included the International Continence Society POP-quantification (POP-Q) and the prolapse-specific quality-of-life questionnaire Mesh fixation was performed with SBS anteriorly on the anterior vaginal wall and posteriorly on the levator ani muscle. A 5-mm titanium tacking device was used for promontofixation. The peritoneum was also closed with an SBS. RESULTS Mean patient's age was 63 years (range: 50-79 years). According to POP-Q, system 3 patients (15%) had Stage I, 12 patients (60%) had Stage II, 3 patients (15%) had Stage III, and 2 patients (10%) had Stage IV prolapse. Concomitant hysterectomy was performed in 14 patients, respectively. Mean operative time was 99.75 (range: 65-140) min, mean blood loss was 57.75 (range: 30-120) ml. One patient had a bladder perforation intraoperatively, and three patients developed transient fever postoperatively. One patient had a recurrent cystocele and three patients recurrent rectocele. CONCLUSIONS The current study renders the use of SBS during LSC to be safe and efficient. Further comparative studies would elucidate the impact of the use of SBS in LSC.

Spleen is one of the important lymphoid organs with wide variations of morphological and physiological functions according to species. Morphology and function of the spleen in bats, which are hosts to several viral strains without exhibiting clinical symptoms, remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to examine the spleen morphology of fruit bats associated with their physiological functions. Spleen histological observations were performed in three fruit bats species: Cynopterus titthaecheilus (n = 9), Rousettus leschenaultii (n = 3) and Pteropus vampyrus (n = 3). The spleens of these fruit bats were surrounded by a thin capsule. Red pulp consisted of splenic cord and wide vascular space filled with blood. Ellipsoids in all three studied species were found numerously and adjacent to one another forming macrophages aggregates. White pulp consisted of periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS), lymphoid follicles and marginal zone. The lymphoid follicle contained a germinal centre and a tingible body macrophage that might reflect an active immune system. The marginal zone was prominent and well developed. This study reports some differences in spleen structure of fruit bats compared to other bat species previously reported and discusses possible physiological implications of the spleen based on its morphology.

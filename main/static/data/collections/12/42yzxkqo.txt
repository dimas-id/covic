Abstract Influenza pandemics generally occur at 30-40 year intervals and it has been nearly 40 years since the last one. A global pandemic will result in devastating social, economical, and health consequences. Preparedness is crucial to minimize the threat to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Vaccines, antivirals, and infection control measures are important elements of prevention. Antivirals, often given presumptively, are the mainstay of therapy.

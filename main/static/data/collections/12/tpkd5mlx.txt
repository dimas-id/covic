From the pandemic scenario of COVID-19 disease cases in all over the world, the outbreak prediction becomes very complex for the emerging scientifically research. Several epidemiological mathematical models of spread are increasing day by day to forecast correctly. Here, the classical SIR modelling approach is carried out to study the different parameters of this model in case of India county. This type of approach analyzed by considering different governmental lock down measures in India. There are some assumptions were taken into account for fitting the model in Python simulation in each lock down scenario. The predicted parameters of SIR model showed some improvement in each case of lock down in India. The outcome results showed the extreme interventions should be taken to tackle this type of pandemic situation in near future.

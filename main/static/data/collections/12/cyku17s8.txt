A 67-year-old male patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted to a hospital in northern Taiwan for progressive dyspnea and productive cough with an enlarged left upper lobe tumor (5.3 × 6.8 × 3.9 cm(3)). Previous chest auscultation on outpatient visits had yielded diffuse wheezes. A localized stridor (fundamental frequency of 125 Hz) was captured using a multichannel electronic stethoscope comprising four microelectromechanical system microphones. An energy-based localization algorithm was used to successfully locate the sound source of the stridor caused by tumor compression. The results of the algorithm were compatible with the findings obtained from computed tomography and bronchoscopy (mean radius = 9.40 mm and radial standard deviation = 14.97 mm). We demonstrated a potential diagnostic aid for pulmonary diseases through sound-source localization technology based on respiratory monitoring. The proposed technique can facilitate detection when advanced imaging tools are not immediately available. Continuing effort on the development of more precise estimation is warranted.

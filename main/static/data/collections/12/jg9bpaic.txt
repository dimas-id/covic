Although laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has spread across surgical disciplines, this has not been the case for the repair of uterovaginal prolapse. We describe the use of this technique for mesh sacrohysteropexy to correct a global prolapse classified as stage II on the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system. The procedure involved intraoperative modification of a commercially available single incision port. At the 18 months followup, the patient was free of symptoms and had no objective prolapse.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of heated humidified ventilation on mucociliary function during general anaesthesia. METHODS Male patients (ASA physical status 1 or 2), scheduled for elective radical retropubic prostatectomy, were allocated to receive sevoflurane general anaesthesia with conventional or heated humidified ventilation. Bronchial mucus transport velocity was assessed via fibreoptic bronchoscope and methylene blue dye at 3h after induction of anaesthesia. RESULTS Median (SE) bronchial mucus transport velocity was significantly higher in the heated humidified group (n = 26) than the conventional ventilation group (n = 24) (1.7 [0.3] mm/min vs 0.9 [0.1] mm/min). CONCLUSION Heated humidified ventilation effectively maintains mucociliary clearance of patients during sevoflurane general anaesthesia.

INTRODUCTION: High rates of concurrent gastrointestinal manifestations have been noted in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the association between these digestive manifestations and need for hospitalization has not been established. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19. A total of 207 patients were identified; 34.5% of patients noted concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, with 90% of gastrointestinal symptoms being mild. RESULTS: In a multivariate regression model controlled for demographics and disease severity, an increased risk of hospitalization was noted in patients with any digestive symptom (adjusted odds ratio 4.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.68â€“13.94). DISCUSSION: The presence of digestive symptoms in COVID-19 is associated with a need for hospitalization.

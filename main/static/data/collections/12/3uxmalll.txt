PURPOSE The aim of this paper is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endovascular revascularization of malignant superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) and simultaneous implantation of a totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) using a dual venous approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospectively, 31 patients (mean age 67 ± 8 years) with malignant CVO who had undergone revascularization by implantation of a self-expanding stent into the superior vena cava (SVC) (Sinus XL®, OptiMed, Germany; n = 11 [Group1] and Protégé ™ EverFlex, Covidien, Ireland; n = 20 [Group 2]) via a transfemoral access were identified. Simultaneously, percutaneous access via a subclavian vein was used to (a) probe the lesion from above, (b) facilitate a through-and-through maneuver, and (c) implant a TIVAP. Primary endpoints with regard to the SVC syndrome were technical (residual stenosis < 30%) and clinical (relief of symptoms) success; with regard to TIVAP implantation technical success was defined as positioning of the functional catheter within the SVC. Secondary endpoints were complications as well as stent and TIVAP patency. RESULTS Technical and clinical success rate were 100% for revascularization of the SVS and 100% for implantation of the TIVAP. One access site hematoma (minor complication, day 2) and one port-catheter-associated sepsis (major complication, day 18) were identified. Mean catheter days were 313 ± 370 days. Mean imaging follow-up was 184 ± 172 days. Estimated patency rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 100% in Group 1 and 84, 84, and 56% in Group 2 (p = 0.338). CONCLUSION Stent-based revascularization of malignant SVCS with concomitant implantation of a port device using a dual venous approach appears to be safe and effective.

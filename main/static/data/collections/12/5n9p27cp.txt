To measure the levels of access to continuing professional education (CPE) among the health workers, an index (continuing professional education access index: CEAI) was constructed. The CEAI is composed of six indicators: (i) availability of CPE; (ii) distribution of CPE; (iii) informational access; (iv) geographical access; (v) economic access; and (vi) preparedness to release staff. When developing the equation of the CEAI, these six component indicators were weighted in accordance with the order of importance reported by the earlier studies. To test its validity, the CEAI was applied to the CPE status in three regions of Ghana. The results of this application revealed that there was greater discrepancies in the CEAI values according to the type of health facilities. The type of health facilities with the greatest CEAI (= 0.609) implying the best access to CPE was clinics while training/research institutes resulted in the lowest CEAI (= 0.447). Regional variation among the three regions was not significant. A simple linear regression between CEAI and adjusted number of CPE opportunities per health worker produced an extremely high conformity in the model (R (2) = 0.960). This may indicate the validity of the proposed CEAI model to the large extent.

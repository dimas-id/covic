COVID‐19 leads to mortality of several patients and the cytokine storm is reportedly critical in the patients. In order to reduce the cytokine storm, we would like to propose the IL6 receptor antagonist therapy for the COVID‐19 patients. Two humanized monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trial following IL6R antagonist therapies namely tocilizumab and sarilumab. However, researchers and physicians should look for more IL6 receptor antagonists for the therapy of cytokine storm syndrome SARS‐CoV‐2 infected persons to enhance the therapeutic options for cytokine storm.

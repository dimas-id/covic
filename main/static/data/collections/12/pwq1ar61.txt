Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents with a broad clinical spectrum, varying from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonitis, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death(Guan, et al 2020). Accumulating evidence suggests that in severe COVID-19, an acute hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by fever, hypoxia and increased serum inflammatory markers, occurring 5-10 days from the first symptoms, is the major driver of morbidity and death(Zhou, et al 2020b). Hyperinflammation is not specific to COVID-19. Similar syndromes were previously described in respiratory disease associated with other coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012(Castilletti, et al 2005, Tseng, et al 2005).

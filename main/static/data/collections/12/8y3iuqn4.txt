Abstract Natural ventilation is an effective strategy to control thermal comfort in buildings, and can be enhanced depending on the window style. The combination of natural ventilation and window can also facilitate the removal or dilution of gaseous pollutants from indoor sources in newly decorated buildings. However, the windows on the same facade may cause gaseous pollutant cross-transmission during single-sided natural ventilation between households on different floors close to the source. Although some research has focused on the pollutant cross-transmission in buildings, the simplification of windows into rectangular openings often affects accurate knowledge of pollutant transmission characteristics. Therefore, this investigation explored gaseous pollutant cross-transmission through real windows during single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation in a multistory building. Six types of windows were modeled for the indoor pollutant of gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilized to solve characteristics of pollutant transmission inside and outside the multistory building. The results indicated that the ventilation rates, thermal profiles and pollutant transmission inside and outside the building varied for each window type, although the open window areas were identical. The re-entry ratio of exhausted air entering upper floors and the infection risk of epidemic viruses caused by airborne cross-transmission was sensitive to ventilation rates and window configurations, while the sensitivities for window configurations varied case by case. The comparisons also revealed that the specification of ambient temperature and pollutant release rate ultimately did not affect the evaluation of pollutant cross-transmission using CFD.

Pyogenic spondylodiscitis includes a spectrum of spinal infections such as discitis, osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, meningitis, subdural empyema, and spinal cord abscess. This is a rare complication of sacral colpopexy, but can lead to devastating consequences for the patient. We present two cases of pyogenic spondylodiscitis following sacral colpopexy. In addition, we discuss 26 cases of pyogenic spondylodiscitis reported in the literature from 1957 to 2012. Techniques to decrease rates of infection include proper identification of the S1 vertebra, awareness of the suture placement depth at the level of the sacrum and at the vagina, and early treatment of post-operative urinary tract and vaginal infections. Awareness of symptoms, timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach to management is essential in preventing long-term complications.

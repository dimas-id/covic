Bacterial strain WT00CT is an endophytic bacterium that was isolated from the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.). The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes demonstrated that strain WT00CT was a member of the genus Herbaspirillum. This strain is microaerobic, gram-negative and non-pigmented, and its cells are rod shaped, with a polar flagellum. It grew optimally at 34-37 Â°C, pH 5.0-8.0 and 0-1.5% NaCl (w/v). The G + C content of its genomic DNA was 62.36 mol%. C16:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0 were major fatty acids. The strain WT00CT contained six polar lipids, namely DPG (diphosphatidylglycerol), PE (phosphatidylethanolamine), PG (phosphatidylglycerol), PC (phosphatidylcholine), GL (glycolipid) and APL (aminophospholipids), and its respiratory quinone was Q8. The strain WT00CT had a genome size of 6.08 Mb with a total ORF of 5,537, in which one gene cluster (36 genes) encoding a type IV secretion system was absent in other members of the Herbaspirillum genus. ANI values of genomic comparison between the strain WT00CT and other Herbaspirillum species were 75-96%. Based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data presented here, the strain WT00CT represents a novel species in the Herbaspirillum genus, for which the name Herbaspirillum camelliae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of H. camelliae sp. nov. is WT00CT (AB 2018017 T and KCTC 62527 T).

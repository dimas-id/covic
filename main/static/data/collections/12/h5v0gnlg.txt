PURPOSE Evaluation of the technical success rate and complications when retrieving dislocated intravascular foreign bodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 1999 and 2015 38 patients (21 female; 17 male; Age: 17 - 92; Average 54.3 years) underwent an extraction of intravascular dislocated foreign bodies, which were not lost during a radiological intervention. The extracted material included 29 port catheters, 3 tips of tunneled dialysis catheters, 2 stents, 2 guide wires, 1 CVC tip and 1 AS occluder device. Various catheters for repositioning and extraction were used. The access was transarterial as well as transvenous. Technical success was defined as complete removal of the foreign body. RESULTS The technical success rate was 92.1 % (35 of 38). In 17 patients an additional catheter was necessary to reposition the foreign body in order to make it accessible for the extraction catheter. In one case a stent was relocated and remodeled within the patient and was not extracted. In another case we experienced a dislocation of a small fragment of the port catheter into the distal parts of the pulmonary artery, which couldn't be extracted. A guide wire could not be extracted as it was already adhered with the vessel wall. Peri-interventional complications were not documented. CONCLUSION The percutaneous extraction of dislocated intravascular foreign bodies is technically successful and poor of complications. Interventional therapy can avoid surgical removal. KEY POINTS • The percutaneous extraction of dislocated intravascular foreign bodies is technically successful and safe.• In most cases surgical removal can be avoided.• The gooseneck-snare catheter was mainly used for the extraction of intravascular foreign bodies.

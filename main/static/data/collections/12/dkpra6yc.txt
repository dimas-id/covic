BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Tubridge flow diverter is a novel device developed in China and aimed at reconstructing the parent artery and occluding the aneurysm. We conducted this study to evaluate its feasibility, safety, and efficacy for the treatment of large or giant internal carotid artery aneurysms, which are still challenging with conventional therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical and angiographic data of 28 patients with 28 large or giant internal carotid artery aneurysms treated with Tubridge flow diverters were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-three Tubridge flow diverters were successfully implanted except for 1 poor midstent opening; the result was a technical success rate of 97.0% (32/33). Follow-up angiographies were available for 25 aneurysms; the mean follow-up was 9.9 months (5-24 months). Of the 25 aneurysms, 18 (72.0%) were completely occluded, 6 (24.0%) were improved, and 1 (4.0%) was unchanged. All of the visible covered branches and parent arteries were patent, with no stenosis or obliteration. During a follow-up of 6-30 months (mean, 19 months), symptoms were resolved in 13 patients, improved in 6 patients, and unchanged in 4 patients. Five patients experienced transient clinical deterioration due to a postoperative increased mass effect. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were both zero. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience shows that the Tubridge flow diverter is a safe and effective tool for treating large and giant internal carotid artery aneurysms. However, multicenter randomized trials and studies involving a long-term follow-up are necessary.

Tonsillectomy is one of the commonly performed otolaryngological operations. Despite a range of different techniques post-operative pain remains a major side-effect of this operation. Coblation assisted tonsillectomy is a latest technique of tonsillectomy. This technique is said to be associated with less intra-operative bleeding and less postoperative morbidity. We conducted a study in 100 patients to compare the pain scores between coblation assisted and bipolar diathermy tonsillectomy by FLACC score and Wong Baker scale score. The data so collected was statistically analysed using a t test and p values were calculated. The p value was highly significant (p < 0.001) for both scores in coblation assisted tonsillectomy 6 h postoperatively and on 1st postoperative day (p < 0.05). On 7th post-operative day however there was no significant difference in post-operative pain score using FLACC score in both groups but Wong baker scale scores were still significant. We concluded that post-operative pain was less with coblator assisted tonsillectomy as compared to bipolar diathermy tonsillectomy at least in early post-operative period.

Objective: To investigate the relationship between novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and kidney injury. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on COVID-19 confirmed patients in the Central Theater Command General Hospital of Chinese PLA on March 12, 2020. A total of 87 hospitalized COVID-19 confirmed patients were enrolled in the study, and they were hospitalized at least one week. The recorded information included clinical data and indicators of kidney-related laboratory tests. Results: The average age of patients was (65.2±17.1) years, and 34.5% (30/87) patients were ≥ 75 years old and 31.0% (27/87) patients were 60~74 years old. Male and female patients accounted for 59.8% (52/87) and 40.2% (35/87), respectively. There were 29.9% (26/87) and 12.6% (11/87) patients who had already showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) at admission. Moreover, 25.3% (22/87) and 4.6% (4/87) patients still exhibited mild elevation of BUN and SCr one week after admission. However, 28.7% (25/87) patients showed an elevation of BUN one week later after admission, though their BUN levels were normal at admission. Likewise, 16.1% (14/87) patients showed an elevation of SCr one week later after admission, while their SCr levels were normal at admission. Only two patients had an increase of SCr ≥26.5 μmol/L, and both of them were over 75 years old. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon. However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

Abstract Objectives To evaluate the influence of temperature on the infectivity of COVID-19 in Japan. Methods We evaluated the relationship between the accumulated number of patients per 1,000,000 population and the average temperature in February 2020 in each prefecture by Poisson regression analysis. We introduced the monthly number of inbound visitors from China in January 2020 in each prefecture as an additional explanatory variable in the model. Results Both monthly inbound visitors from China in January 2020 and mean temperature in February 2020 are associated with the cumulative number of COVID-19 case on March 16, 2020. Conclusions Our analysis showed a possible association between low temperature and increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further evaluation would be desirable at a global level.

Synthesis of amino acid conjugates of glycyrrhizic acid with the use of N-hydroxyphthalimide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and tert-butyl esters of L-amino acids (valine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and methionine) was performed followed by deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid. The target amino acid conjugates were isolated by column chromatography on silica gel in 40â€“45% yield. The structure of the prepared compounds was confirmed by IR and (13)C NMR spectroscopy.

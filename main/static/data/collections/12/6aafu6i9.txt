BACKGROUND Multiple case series managed by a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) approach to cholecystectomy have been published, reporting that this new procedure is easily reproducible and safe. Currently, variations on surgical technique are being tested. This report describes the largest series of single-skin- and single-fascial-incision cholecystectomies using a multichannel port. METHODS Between July 2008 and December 2009, 55 patients underwent SILS cholecystectomy by two experienced general surgeons at a single institution. The operative time, surgical technique, conversion rate, specimen pathology, and postoperative complications were reported. RESULTS The reported series consisted of 43 women (78%) and 12 men (22%) with a mean age of 44.2 years (range, 22-89 years). The body mass index (BMI) of the patients ranged from 16.1 to 46.8 kg/m2 (mean, 29.1 kg/m2). The mean operating room (OR) time was 66.5 min (range, 30-140 min). An improvement in OR time was observed over the course of the study. The first 19 cases were managed through a single incision but with two fascial defects for port placement. The last 36 cases were performed through a single skin incision with a single fascial incision. In five cases, an extra port had to be placed, and one case was converted to open surgery. To date, no port-site hernias, wound infections, small bowel obstructions, or other postoperative complications have been observed. CONCLUSION The authors believe that the single-skin- and single-fascial-incision technique will prove superior to creation of multiple fascial defects in terms of future port-site hernias and will replace prior techniques using multiple fascial incisions.

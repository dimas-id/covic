Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is responsible, along with an inadequate immune response of the host, for Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), one of the most frequent and deadly infectious feline disease worldwide. This study analyzed the genetic characteristics of the spike (S) gene of 33 FCoVs circulating in Northern Italy between 2011 and 2015 in cats with or without FIP. In order to reconstruct the most probable places of origin and dispersion of FCoV among Italian cats, a phylogeographic approach was performed based on 106 FCoV S gene partial sequences from cats, including the 33 novel Italian sequences and 73 retrieved from public databases. Only FCoV type I was found in the Italian cats. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of FCoV was 2.4 × 10(-2) subs/site/year (95% HPD: 1.3-3.7 × 10(-2)), confirming the high genetic variability in the circulating strains. All the isolates clustered in a unique highly significant clade that likely originated from USA between the 1950s and the 1970s, confirming the first descriptions of the disease in American cats. Our results suggest that from USA the virus likely entered Germany and thereafter spread to other European countries. Phylogeography showed that sequences segregated mainly by geographical origin. In the 2010s Italian sequences clustered in different subclades, confirming that different strains cocirculate in Italy. Further studies on archival samples and other genetic regions of FCoV are suggested in order to confirm the present results and to reconstruct a more in-depth detailed virus dispersion pattern for the definition of possible control measures.

BACKGROUND The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of continuous bowel decompression using an indwelling transanal tube (ITT) for preoperative management in infants with long-segment (L)- or total (T)-type Hirschsprung's disease (HD). CASE PRESENTATION Between 2012 and 2015, seven patients with L- or T-type HD underwent preoperative bowel management by continuous bowel decompression using an ITT during waiting period for curative surgery. Continuous bowel decompression was done using an ITT, a 10-12F flexible dual lumen tube placed through the rectum up to the dilated colon under fluoroscopic guidance and secured to the bilateral buttocks. The ITT tips were located at least in a dilated colon or the cecum if there was no radiographic transitional zone. The ITT was left open for continuous drainage, and its patency was checked by regular suction until the curative operation. The patient status and complications of this preoperative management were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS The median duration of decompression management was 65 (17-137) days. During decompression period, neither abdominal distention, enterocolitis, nor other complications occurred and six patients could stay at home until the curative operation. The weight-for-age Z-score at curative surgery was the same as or higher than that at birth in five patients. ITT replacement was needed three times per patient on an average for accidental ITT removal, ITT stenosis, or ITT hardening. CONCLUSIONS Bowel management by continuous bowel decompression using an ITT is easy, safe, and effective for preoperative management in patients with L- or T-type HD and may permit single-stage surgery rendering colostomy or enterostomy unnecessary.

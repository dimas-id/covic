In this paper, we introduce an interactive telecommunication system that supports video/audio signal acquisition, data processing, transmission, and 3D animation for post stroke rehabilitation. It is designed for stroke patients to use in their homes. It records motion exercise data, and immediately transfers this data to hospitals via the internet. A real-time videoconferencing interface is adopted for patients to observe therapy instructions from therapists. The system uses a peer-to-peer network architecture, without the need for a server. This is a potentially effective approach to reducing costs, allowing easy setup and permitting group-rehabilitation sessions. We evaluate this system using the following steps: (1) motion detection in different movement patterns, such as reach, drink, and reach-flexion; (2) online bidirectional visual telecommunication; and (3) 3D rendering using a proposed offline animation package. This evaluation has subjectively been proved to be optimal.

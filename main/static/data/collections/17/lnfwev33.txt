BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of applying the respiratory “critical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated management model” in severe stroke-associated pneumonia and evaluate its effect. METHODS: From January to September 2018, 24 patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, who were admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit of the Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Department of Henan Provincial People’s Hospital, were randomly divided into two groups: integrated management group and control group. According to the admission criteria of the respiratory “critical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated model” prescribed by the above-mentioned hospital, patients were grouped. The professional respiratory therapy team participated in the whole treatment. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and oxygenation index of these two groups were dynamically observed, and the average hospital stay, 28-day mortality and patient satisfaction were investigated. RESULTS: Patients in the integrated management group and control group were similar before treatment (P > 0.05). After treatment, the main indicators, the APACHE II score, CPIS score and oxygenation index, were significantly different between the integration group and control group (P < 0.05). The secondary indicators, the average hospitalization days and patient/family member satisfaction scores, were also significantly different between the integration group and control group (P < 0.05). However, the 28-day mortality wasn’t significantly different (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, it was feasible to implement the respiratory “critical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated management model”, which could significantly improve the treatment effect, shorten average hospitalization days and improve patient/family satisfaction.

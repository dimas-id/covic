Objective To investigate the early clinical characteristics and diagnosis of and therapeutic approaches for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods The clinical manifestations and treatment of 62 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Hainan Province People's Hospital during the period from January 21 to February 10, 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The COVID-19 patients were classified into 3 groups: general, severe and critical types according to the disease severity and the white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were compared between the 3 groups. The 62 patients were given symptomatic and supportive, antiviral, hormonal and Chinese herbal treatment. Results 79.03% (49/62) of patients had a history of traveling or living in Wuhan. The incubation period was (6.85±4.45) d. The clinical features including fever (80.65%), dry cough (62.9%), fatigue (25.81%), shortness of breath (19.35%), and dyspnea (14.52%), sore throat (9.68%), nasal congestion and runny nose (9.68%), muscle soreness (8.06%), diarrhea, vomiting (3.23%), and nausea (4.84%). 95.16% (59/62) of patients had normal or relatively low white blood cell counts. There were statistically significant differences in the counts of leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes between the 3 groups of the patients (P&lt;0.05). 77.78% (7/9) of the critically ill patients with lymphocyte counts below 0.8×109/L. 90.32% (56/62) of patients typically presented with single or multiple lung lobes/ segments showing ground glass shadow. The average time for CT and CR showing progress and starting to improve and absorb was (9.05±3.75) d and (14.94±7.32) d, respectively. The total course of disease among the 57 discharged patients was 9-38 d, with an average of (21.05±7.17) d. The length of hospital stay was 8-34 d, with an average hospital stay of (15.32±6.49) d. After treatment, the time of the negative mutation of the novel coronavirus was (11.56±6.56) d. Obvious dyspnea occurred in 9 critically ill patients, among them 7 patients needed invasive ventilator support and 2 non-invasive ventilator support. Conclusions In the early clinical stage of COVID-19, fever is the main manifestation. Individual patients are asymptomatic. CT is characterized by ground glass-like changes. Critical patients have significant dyspnea, which can be accompanied by kidney damage. If lung imaging suggests a rapid progress of inflammatory exudation, CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy) and respiratory support therapy can be given on an individual basis.

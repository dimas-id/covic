BACKGROUND To assess the outcome of retro-rectus repair of complex abdominal wall repair (CAWR) in a single institution in relation to the use of biologic and synthetic mesh. METHOD A retrospective review was undertaken of complex abdominal wall repairs performed by a single surgical team, assessing the outcome of the retro-rectus repair and factors affecting the outcome. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2013, 57 (33 male) patients underwent CAWR retro-rectus repair. The material used was assessed as either synthetic or biologic (cross-linked porcine dermal collagen). The Ventral Hernia Working Group grades were similar between groups of patients having a repair with synthetic and biologic mesh. Median follow-up in the synthetic group was 18 months (1-80.5) and 18.4 months (0.5-70.7) in the biologic group. There was no statistical difference in seroma, wound infection or haematoma rates. No fistulae occurred in either group. Overall recurrence was 3.4% and there was no statistical difference between groups. CONCLUSION The retro-rectus repair technique is associated with a low rate of recurrence and is now the technique of choice. The choice of material, biologic or synthetic, in Ventral Hernia Working Group grades 1-3 remains controversial.

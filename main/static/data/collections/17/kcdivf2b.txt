OBJECTIVE To describe laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy in the African lioness (Panthera leo). STUDY DESIGN Descriptive clinical study. ANIMALS Female lions (n = 16). METHODS Lionesses were randomly divided into 2 groups: O = ovariectomy (n = 8) and S = salpingectomy (n = 8) for laparoscopic surgery. Two Veress needle placement techniques were used. RESULTS Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy were performed without complications. The poorly developed mesosalpinx and ovarian bursa rendered the uterine tube more accessible for salpingectomy compared to the dog making the procedure easier in the lioness. Similarly, salpingectomy is a relatively easier procedure compared with ovariectomy especially when the modified Hasson technique for Veress needle placement is used. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy can be safely performed in the African lioness.

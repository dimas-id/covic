We report a young man with a history of deep coma secondary to an extensive superior sagittal sinus thrombosis despite full systemic anticoagulation. Endovascular treatment combining a 5 Max ACE reperfusion catheter (Penumbra) and Solitaire (Covidien) retrieval device permitted revascularization of the superior sagittal sinus with restoration of anterograde venous flow. This treatment led to the disappearance of cytotoxic edema on MRI and to a neurological improvement with a modified Rankin scale score of 2 after two months. Our experience shows that this technique provides a useful and safe tool after failure of anticoagulation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

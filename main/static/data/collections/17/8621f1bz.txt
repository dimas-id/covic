UNSTRUCTURED: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has placed a significant burden on the healthcare systems. Michigan has been one of the top states affected by COVID-19. We described the curbside testing procedure implemented at Beaumont Hospital, a large hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. We aimed at evaluating its safety and efficiency. We reported on time to medical decision, time spent documenting electronic medical records (EMR), overall time of screening, and emergency center return evaluations. Because of the large volume of patients and testing that was required near the beginning of this pandemic, curbside screening became a safe and efficient way of delivering SARS-CoV-2 testing as it allowed for a medical decision within a median of 15 minutes from arrival. Less than 10% of these patients returned to the emergency center for evaluation at a minimum of 7 days follow up. Our curbside testing model encourages the incorporation of this model at other high-volume facilities during an infectious disease pandemic.

Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) represents less than 10 % of thromboembolic events, but has been associated with higher incidence of asymptomatic pulmonary embolism. Data regarding UEDVT and its treatment is limited. Our objective was to investigate UEDVT incidence, diagnosis, and treatment in our bariatric patient population. We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery at our institution. Variables analyzed included patient demographics, body mass index (BMI), history of venous thromboembolic event (VTE), type of procedure, and other comorbidities. One thousand five hundred three patients were included in the study. Twenty patients developed VTE events, of which five suffered UEDVT. Although infrequent, awareness of UEDVT is necessary in order to initiate treatment in a timely fashion and to prevent major complications.

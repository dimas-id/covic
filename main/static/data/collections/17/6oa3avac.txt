The aim of this paper is the numerical solution of a 2D chemotaxis model by a parallel numerical scheme, implemented on a GPU technology. The numerical discretization relies on the utilization of a finite difference scheme for the spatial part and the explicit Euler method for the time integration. Accuracy and stability properties are provided. The effectiveness of the approach, as well as the coherence of the results with respect to the modeled phenomenon, is provided through numerical evidence, also giving a performance analysis of the serial and the parallel implementations.

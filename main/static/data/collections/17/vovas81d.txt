Molecular recognition by RNA aptamers has been exploited to control gene expression in response to small molecules in mammalian cells. These mammalian synthetic riboswitches offer attractive features such as small genetic size and lower risk of immunological complications compared to protein-based transcriptional gene switches. The diversity of gene regulatory mechanisms that involve RNA has also inspired the development of mammalian riboswitches that harness various regulatory mechanisms. In this report, recent advances in synthetic riboswitches that function in mammalian cells are reviewed focusing on the regulatory mechanisms they exploit such as mRNA degradation, microRNA processing, and programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

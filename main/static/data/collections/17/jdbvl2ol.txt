Nepali people are one of the ethnic minority immigrants of Hong Kong. This epidemiological investigation aims to determine and compare the knowledge level and hand hygiene (HH) behaviour of the Nepali people and the population of their host country (i.e., native Chinese population of Hong Kong). A total of 1008 questionnaires were collected via an online platform. The overall knowledge level of the native population towards HH was considerably higher than that of the Nepali respondents. Lower levels of knowledge in young and older people were noted. Reduced HH knowledge was also observed in people with low educational level or with comorbid illness(es). Significant differences between groups were noted in the self-reported hand washing behaviours. Regarding hand drying, more Nepalese than native Chinese respondents always/sometimes dried their hands on their clothing irrespective whether after performing handwashing in public washrooms or at home. Misconceptions and suboptimal practices on HH were prevalent in the two populations. The findings of this comparative study offer valuable information for the development of culturally sensitive health educational programs to enhance HH practices for the ethnic minorities and native Chinese population.

Abstract The recombinant antigen obtained by cloning and expressing two IBV nucleocapsid protein fragments (143-414 aa, 281-414 aa) in Escherichia coli was used for the detection of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) specific antibodies in chicken sera by the indirect ELISA (rNpIBV-ELISA). As a result of testing 1524 serum samples the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of rNpIBV-ELISA when comparing those of the routine whole IBV ELISA have been shown to be 93.81% and 87.36%, respectively. The agreement value was 91.5%.

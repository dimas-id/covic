The Wuhan City has ended the lockdown and people have been allowed to resume working since April 8 if meeting a set of COVID‐19‐associated tests including SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid test (NAT) of nasopharyngeal swabs, chest CT scan or a SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific serological test. Here, we reported the positive rate of COVID‐19 tests based on NAT, chest CT scan and a serological SARS‐CoV‐2 test, from April 3 to 15 in one hospital in Qingshan Destrict, Wuhan. We observed a ~10% SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific IgG positive rate from 1,402 tests. Combination of SARS‐CoV‐2 NAT and a specific serological test might facilitate the detection of COVID‐19 infection, or the asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected subjects. Large‐scale investigation is required to evaluate the herd immunity of the city, for the resuming people and for the re‐opened city. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

COVID-19 has created the need for population-level screening, and telemedicine is ideally positioned to enable this. As telemedicine has evolved over the last decade, remote monitoring emerged as a new and powerful modality. COVID-19 requires scaled interactions with populations in near real-time. Remote monitoring has specific operational and design features that are well suited for the COVID-19, especially the asynchronous communication. Monitoring can be used in particular to gather pandemic data and obtain real-time clinical feedback. As telemedicine continues to grow and evolve, remote monitoring is emerging as a valuable tool for payers, providers, and public health officials alike.

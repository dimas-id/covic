This report aims to review current data on single-incision (single-port) laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for bariatric surgery. A comprehensive research of Pubmed database and Cochrane library on SILS bariatric surgery was conducted. Twenty-eight articles met inclusion criteria (3611 patients). Intraoperative and clinical outcomes for SILS sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and adjustable gastric banding (AGB) seem comparable to conventional laparoscopy. SILS for SG was safe and feasible with good outcomes. The same stands for RYGB but more studies are necessary for safe conclusions, while additional trocars are necessary to perform the procedure. AGB is feasible and safe by SILS but the declining number of annual procedures will probably limit the use of SILS. Major studies are unavailable for SILS and other bariatric procedures.

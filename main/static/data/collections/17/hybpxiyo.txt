We thank Dr. Cienfuegos and colleagues for their comments on our recent publication "COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and the small bowel". Cienfuegos et al. have treated several COVID-19 patients with thromboembolic complications, including bowel ischemia. The authors correctly highlight the importance of this complication in COVID-19 patients, which has also been documented in autopsy studies.

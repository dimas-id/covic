To explore the discrepancy in computed tomography (CT) manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients outside the original district (Wuhan, China) between cases with imported infection and second-generation infection, 22 patients with COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Nanchong, China, 938 km away from the original district (Wuhan, China) of this disease were enrolled. All patients underwent initial and follow-up CT after admission during the treatment, and were divided into 2 groups. Group A and B were composed of 15 patients with a history of exposure to the original district (Wuhan, China) in short-term (i.e., imported infection), and 7 with a close contact with the patients with confirmed COVID-19 or with the healthy individuals from the original district (i.e., second-generation infection), respectively. Initial CT features including extent score and density score between groups were statistically compared. We found that all patients in group A and 3 of 7 patients in group B had abnormal CT findings while 4 of 7 patients in group B had not. Patients with abnormal CT findings were more frequent in group A than in group B (Pâ<â.05). On initial CT, pure ground glass opacity (GGO), and GGO with consolidation and/or other abnormalities were found in 20% (3/15) and 80% (12/15) patients in group A, respectively, while 1 (14.3%), 2 (28.6%), and 4 (57.1%) had pure GGOs, GGO with focal consolidation, and normal CT appearances in Group B, respectively. Patients with extent and density scores of &#8805;5 were more frequent in group A than in group B (all P-valuesâ<â.01). Additionally, 3 of 4 (75%) patients with normal initial CT findings had focal pure GGO lesions on follow-up. In conclusion, COVID-19 in patients with a history of exposure to the original district can be severer than with the second-generation infection on CT.

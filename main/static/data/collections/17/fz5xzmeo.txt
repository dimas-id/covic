In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to maintain self-isolation, the vast majority of outpatient services are closed, and the inpatient clinics have limited the workload admitting almost only urgent cases. Outpatients, including ones with various sleep disorders, are left without access to the specialized examinations. This will lead to the late diagnosis and untimely therapy prescriptions. In such conditions, it is relevant to take into account new instrumental diagnostic methods that could be used by the patient themselves to register their vital parameters at home. The obtained data can be transmitted via the Internet to the attending physician for further analysis followed by prescriptions when required. One of these methods is bioradiolocation, which allows noncontact recording of breathing patterns, heart rate and movement of a person during sleep, as well as detection of various sleep disorders and determination of sleep stages. This method is easy to use, and can be recommended for home-screening by patients. Sleep has a significant immunomodulating function, and sleep assessment is important in both patients at risk and afflicted with novel coronavirus infection. Thus, the use of bioradiolocation method at home for non-contact sleep monitoring may be relevant in case of closure of outpatient facilities and will provide the doctor with objective data on sleep patterns and patterns of breathing, motor activity, the presence and amount of respiratory disturbances during sleep.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic continues to have extensive effects on public health as it spreads rapidly across the globe. Patients with head and neck cancer are a particularly susceptible population to these effects, and we expect there to be a potential surge in patients presenting with head and neck cancers after the surge in COVID‐19. Furthermore, the impact of social distancing measures could result in a shift toward more advanced disease at presentation. With appropriate anticipation, multidisciplinary head and cancer teams could potentially minimize the impact of this surge and plan for strategies to provide optimal care for patients with head and neck cancer.

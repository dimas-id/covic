Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increased pressure on testing resources, understanding the clinical and epidemiological features closely associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is vital at point of care to enable risk stratification. We demonstrate that an internally derived and validated clinical decision rule, COVID-MATCH65, has a high sensitivity (92.6%) and NPV (99.5%) for SARS-CoV-2 and could be used to aid COVID-19 risk-assessment and resource allocation for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

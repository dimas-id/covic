PURPOSE : Using a porcine model, this feasibility study was undertaken to evaluate the histopathological characteristics of lesions created in the proximity of the pulmonary veins after ablation with a new endoscopic-guided radiofrequency device. METHODS : Five adult female swine underwent endoscopic surgical ablation on the epicardial surface of the beating heart. Histologic sections taken from around the pulmonary vein pedicle, representing 10 separate anatomic sites, underwent independent qualitative histopathological evaluation as well as quantitative histomorphometric measurement of lesion depth and section thickness. RESULTS : Sections from all five animals had histologically identical lesions, with the majority of ablation foci having pronounced thermal injury characterized by deep and extensive zones of acute myocardial necrosis in the absence of tissue charring. Fifty-seven percent (13 of 23) of the lesions were completely transmural and 91% (21 of 23) of the sections demonstrated â‰¥70% transmurality. No collateral injuries were noted. CONCLUSIONS : This irrigated, suction-stabilized unipolar radiofrequency device can produce histologically transmural lesions around the pulmonary veins and is amenable to endoscopic-guided application on the beating heart.

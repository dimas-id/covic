Abstract Interdisciplinarity employs multiple academic fields of knowledge in order to create a comprehensive understanding of a globally relevant phenomenon, a region, or its people, and to find solutions to concrete problems. Interdisciplinarity evolved in the 20th century in response to the institutionalization and segmentation of academic research and major transitions in society. Many geography departments have interdisciplinary profiles, but the daily practice of interdisciplinarity depends on the networks of individual academics. The results of interdisciplinary collaboration include research books, textbooks, and journal articles, the market of which continues to diversify. Authors of interdisciplinary textbooks and teachers of interdisciplinary classes must pay special attention to teaching philosophy and communication skills in order to satisfy the needs of a heterogeneous body of students interested in interdisciplinary learning. Interdisciplinarity means different things in different contexts, and practices and challenges vary. Some see interdisciplinarity as an exciting opportunity, while others feel threatened by the downsides of crossing disciplinary boundaries.

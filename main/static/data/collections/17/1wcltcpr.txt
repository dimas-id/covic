The rapid spread of coronavirus disease COVID-19 in many countries causes citizens of daily inconvenience, and even life-threat for elderly population The invasion of the main pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;2019-nCov), into human body causes different levels of impact to various patients One of the most important issues for COVID-19 is how to defend this virus with the ability to foresee the infected targets Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19 So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCov or not is through rRT-PCR (qPCR) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome The heavy loading of rRT-PCR (qPCR) machine and handling labor have tight-packed the instruments as well as the man power almost in every country Therefore, the alternative approaches are eagerly waiting to be developed In this review article, we sort out some state-of-the-art novel approaches that might be applied for a fast, sensitive and precise detection of SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCov not only to help the routine laboratory testing but also to improve effective quarantine

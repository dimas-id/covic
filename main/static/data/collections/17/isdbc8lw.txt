The objective of this study was to compare fluid leakage across endotracheal tube cuffs using a three-dimensional (3D)-printed human tracheal model that anatomically simulates the human trachea. We made two models based on computed tomography data of the neck and chest. Using a Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo™ (HL), ThinCuff(®) (TC), and Mallinckrodt TaperGuard™ (TG), we sequentially measured the amount of fluid leakage across each endotracheal tube cuff after applying saline or viscous liquid above the cuff. The TG allowed significantly less leakage than the HL and TC with both saline and the viscous liquid. Our study, using a 3D-printed tracheal model, indicated that a conical-shaped endotracheal tube cuff significantly reduces fluid leakage across the cuff compared with conventional cylindrical-shaped cuffs made of polyurethane or polyvinylchloride, contrary to the results of a previous study using a solid cylindrical structure.

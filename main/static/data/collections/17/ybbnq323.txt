Abstract A severe respiratory ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus was recently emerged in China. Here, we reported the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 19 suspect cases. We compared the positive ratio of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid amplification test from different samples including oropharyngeal swab, blood, urine and stool with 3different Fluorescent RT-PCR kits. Nine out of the 19 patients were detected 2019-nCoV infection using oropharyngeal swab samples, and the virus nucleic acid was also detected in eight of these nine patients using stool samples. None of positive results was identified in the blood and urine samples. Thses three different kits got the same result for each sample and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4% in the suspect patients. Therefore, it is possible that the really infected patients have been missed by using nucleic acid detection only. It might be better to make a diagnosis combining the Computed Tomography scans and the nucleic acid detection together.

Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea and dehydration in sucking piglets and has a high mortality rate. An immunochromatography (IC) assay, known as a lateral flow test, is a simple device intended to detect the presence of target pathogens. Here, we developed an IC assay that detected PEDV antigens with 96.0% (218/227) sensitivity and 98.5% (262/266) specificity when compared with real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using FAM-labeled probes based on sequences from nucleocapsid genes. The detection limits of the real-time RT-PCR and IC assays were 1×102 and 1×103 copies, respectively. The IC assay developed herein did not detect non-specific reactions with other viral or bacterial pathogens, and the assay could be stored at 4°C or room temperature for 15 months without affecting its efficacy. Thus, the IC assay may result in improved PED detection and control on farms, and is a viable alternative to current diagnostic tools for PEDV.

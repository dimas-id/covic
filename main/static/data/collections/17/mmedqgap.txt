OBJECTIVE To establish reference intervals for whole blood and plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in healthy cats between the ages of 1 and 10 years using a cage-side colloid osmometer. DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTINGS University veterinary teaching hospital. ANIMALS Sixty-three healthy cats. INTERVENTIONS Phlebotomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Whole blood COP mean was 24.4 (±2.78) mmHg and plasma COP mean was 24.3 (±2.59) mmHg. Reference interval for our study population of feline whole blood COP was 18.9 to 30.4 mmHg, and for our study population of feline plasma COP was 18.3 to 30.8 mmHg. Difference of paired whole blood COP and plasma COP was +0.23 ± 1.68 mmHg (P = 0.32). There was no significant difference when comparing COP from neutered male and neutered female cats. Total protein and albumin were significantly correlated with whole blood COP (total protein to whole blood COP P < 0.0001, r = 0.53; albumin to whole blood COP P <0.0001, r = 0.68) and plasma COP (total protein to plasma COP P = 0.0025, r = 0.41; albumin to plasma COP P < 0.0001, r = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS No significant difference was found between mean whole blood and plasma COP in this study population of cats. Even though not statistically significant, evaluation of paired whole blood COP and plasma COP did reveal a slight difference; therefore, it seems prudent to maintain sample consistency for serial evaluations in cats.

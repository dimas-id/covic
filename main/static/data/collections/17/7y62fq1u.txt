Human bocavirus (HBoV) was first described in 2005 in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with respiratory tract infection. Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of HBoV in respiratory tract samples of children world-wide. HBoV has recently also been detected in blood and fecal samples. Most studies so far have studied virus prevalence, and only a few reports provide data regarding the linkage of HBoV to disease. These reports indicate that HBoV infection is indeed associated with acute respiratory tract symptoms, but also that HBoV may persist in the respiratory tract for a longer time than other respiratory agents, resulting in frequent detection of low load HBoV carriage. This phenomenon has complicated the use of PCR diagnostics, which has been the only available diagnostic method. Development of alternative diagnostic strategies such as serology will be important for future studies of HBoV and its association with disease.

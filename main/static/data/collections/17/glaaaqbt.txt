The literature suggests that COVID-19 provokes arterial and venous thrombotic events, although the mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we describe patients with confirmed coronavirus infection associated with multisystemic infarction, focusing on splenic infarction. More data are required to elucidate how COVID-19 and thrombotic disease interact and so that preventive and early diagnosis strategies can be developed. LEARNING POINTS: Thrombotic disease as a complication of COVID-19 must be suspected by clinicians, and recognized and monitored by radiologists. Thrombosis is often the initial manifestation of SARS-CoV-2, hence the importance of early diagnosis to avoid complications and reduce morbidity and mortality.

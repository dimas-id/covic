With increased incidence of diagnosis of small renal masses, partial nephrectomy has been preferred over radical nephrectomy as the surgical treatment of choice. The transition from open to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy had been challenging for many urologists. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy(RLPN) is increasingly used to facilitate this transition . In this review, we examine the recent technical advances and clinical outcomes in RLPN. Many series had successfully reported the feasibility of using the da Vinci Surgical (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) System in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Recent advances had focused on reducing risk of renal damage by shortening the warm ischaemia time. These techniques included unclamped excision, selective arterial clamping and improved renorrhaphy methods. Operative times and warm ischaemia times have also improved once the learning curve are overcome, which is less steep than conventional laparoscopy. With longer follow-up and more widespread experience, the outcome of RLPN could be favourable compared to conventional laparoscopy. Improving techniques had made this surgery a safe and efficacious treatment option for small renal masses.

An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus has been reported worldwide and become a global health problem; hence, the diagnosis and differentiation of this virus from other types of coronavirus is essential to control of the disease. To this end, the analysis of genomics data plays a vital role in introducing a stronger target and consequently provides better results in laboratory examinations. The modified comparative genomics approach helps us to find novel specific targets by comparing two or more sequences on the nucleotide collection database. We, for the first time, detected ORF8 gene as a potential target for the detection of the novel coronavirus. Unlike previous reported genes (RdRP, E and N genes), ORF8 is entirely specific to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and has no cross-reactivity with other kinds of coronavirus. Accordingly, ORF8 gene can be used as an additional confirmatory assay.

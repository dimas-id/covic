During a longitudinal study of the epidemiology of rotavirus infection in a calf rearing unit, excretion of virus in faeces was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 40 of 48 (83 per cent) unweaned calves aged between three days and five weeks. Fifty per cent of the infected calves had no clinical signs of disease. Enterocytes containing rotavirus antigen and intestinal lesions were found in all of 12 clinically normal calves selected for necropsy between days 1 and 4 of virus excretion. Stunting and fusion of villi, exfoliation, disarrangement and vacuolation of enterocytes and the presence of cuboidal enterocytes were observed in infected calves but not in rotavirus-free control calves. Lesions predominated in the upper small intestine, where rotavirus was most abundant, especially on the first two days of virus excretion. The numbers of enterocytes infected with rotavirus diminished before the lesions resolved.

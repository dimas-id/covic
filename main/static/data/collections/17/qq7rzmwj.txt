While epidemiological models have traditionally assumed that diseases spread by the mass action principle, actual contact networks within social groups do not meet this assumption. Theoretical models have shown that disease dynamics could vary considerably under different types of contact networks, but these models face challenges in terms of their evaluation due to the difficulty of collecting empirical data. The honeybee colony with its elaborate social organization and large repertoire of diseases provides an ideal setting to explore how the structure of the contact network contributes to the transmission of a disease.

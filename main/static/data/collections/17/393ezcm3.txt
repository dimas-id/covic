Information-centric networking (ICN) has gained attention from network research communities due to its capability of efficient content dissemination. In-network caching function in ICN plays an important role to achieve the design motivation. However, many researchers on in-network caching have focused on where to cache rather than how to cache: the former is known as contents deployment in the network and the latter is known as cache replacement in an ICN element. Although, the cache replacement has been intensively researched in the context of web-caching and content delivery network previously, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to ICN due to the fine granularity of cacheable items in ICN, which eventually changes the access patterns. In this paper, we argue that ICN requires a novel cache replacement algorithm to fulfill the requirements in the design of high performance ICN element. Then, we propose a novel cache replacement algorithm to satisfy the requirements named Compact CLOCK with Adaptive Replacement (Compact CAR), which can reduce the consumption of cache memory to one-tenth compared to conventional approaches.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Animal studies using open surgical models indicate that collagen solder is capable of fixation of surgical meshes without interfering with tissue integration, increasing adhesions, or increasing inflammation intraperitoneally. This study describes development of instrumentation and techniques for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy using laser-assisted soldering technology. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Anesthetized 20 kg to 25 kg female Yorkshire pigs underwent laparoscopy with a 3-trocar technique. Parietex TET, Parietex TEC, and Prolene mesh segments (5 x 5 cm) were embedded in 55% collagen solder. Segments were inserted by using a specially designed introducer and affixed to the peritoneum by using prototype laser devices (1.45 micro, 4.5 W continuous wave, 5-mm spot, 55 degrees C set temperature) and a custom laparoscopic handpiece (IPOM). Parietex PCO mesh was inserted and affixed using the Endo-hernia stapler (Control). Animals were recovered and underwent second-look laparoscopy at 6 weeks. Mesh sites were harvested after animals were euthanized. RESULTS The mesh-solder constructs were easily inserted and affixed in an IPOM approach. Prolene mesh tended to curl at its edges as the solder was melted. Postoperative healing was similar to that in Control segments in all cases. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Collagen-based tissue soldering permits normal wound healing and may mitigate or reduce the use of staples or other foreign bodies for laparoscopic mesh fixation, prevent tissue ischemia and possibly nerve entrapment, which result in severe postoperative pain and morbidity. Laser-assisted mesh fixation is a promising alternative for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. Further development of this strategy is warranted.

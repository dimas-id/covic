INTRODUCTION Bochdalek hernia is a type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia that typically presents in childhood - the clinical manifestation of symptoms and diagnosis in adults is extremely rare. There are fewer than 20 cases of right-sided Bochdalek hernia reported in adults in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION We review a case of a 38-year-old woman with a right-sided Bochdalek hernia who was experiencing abdominal pain and pleural effusion. The diagnosis of Bochdalek hernia was made by chest X-ray and computed tomography. The right lobe of the liver and flexura hepatica of the colon were herniated into the thorax cavity. The hernia was treated via thoracotomy assisted with laparoscopy and she made an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSION We report a rare case of a right-sided Bochdalek hernia for which our patient was treated successfully. Even though rare, this disorder should be recognised, examined and treated appropriately to avoid complications.

Patients with diabetes mellitus have been reported to be at a high risk of complications from SARS-CoV2 virus infection (COVID-19). In type 2 diabetes, there is a change in immune system cells, which shift from an anti-inflammatory to a predominantly pro-inflammatory pattern. This altered immune profile may induce important clinical consequences, including increased susceptibility to lung infections; and enhanced local inflammatory response. Furthermore, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzyme is highly expressed in the lung, and that it may have additional actions besides its effects on glucose metabolism, which might exert profound pro-inflammatory effects. We briefly review the impact on the inflammatory system of DPP4 for its possible detrimental effect on COVID-19 syndrome, and of DPP4 inhibitors (gliptins), currently used as glucose lowering agents, which may have the potential to exert positive pleiotropic effect on inflammatory diseases, in addition to their effects on glucose metabolism. Thanks to these ancillary effects, gliptins could potentially be "repurposed" as salutary drugs against COVID-19 syndrome, even in non-diabetic subjects. Clinical studies should be designed to investigate this possibility.

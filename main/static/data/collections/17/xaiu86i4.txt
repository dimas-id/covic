Objectives Children pose challenges to obtain quality EEG data due to excessive artifact. Collodion is used in EEG electrodes due to its water resistance and strong adhesive qualities. This study was done to evaluate differences in artifacts between the collodion and paste method. Methods 115 subjects (children age >3 years) were randomized into paste and collodion groups and artifacts evaluated at baseline and every hour over 30 s increments. Age, sleep state, and number of electrodes with artifact were also documented. T-test was performed to determine differences in the various parameters between the two groups. Results 61 subjects were in the paste group and 54 in the collodion group. Mean of total seconds of artifact from 0 to 24 h were 41.8 s in paste group versus 30.3 s in collodion group (P = 0.02). Children >11 years old had less artifact than younger children from 0 to 24 h (24.3 versus 41.2 s, P = 0.03), and from 24 to 48 h (33.1 versus 43.1 s, P = 0.03). There was a significant effect of sleep vs. awake state recordings on artifact from 0 to 24 h (30.3 versus 50.2 s, P = 0.01). Conclusion Electrode problems are common with both collodion and paste in prolonged AEEG monitoring. However, for studies less than 24 h, collodion may be a better alternative. Significance Our study provides evidence that in some cases collodion may be a better alternative to paste in terms of decreased artifacts.

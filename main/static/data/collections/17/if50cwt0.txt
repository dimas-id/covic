Only two strains (Shintoku and porcine-like WD534tc) of group C rotavirus (GCR) from cattle have been reported to date. A GCR designated the Yamagata strain was the only pathogen detected in an outbreak of adult cow diarrhea accompanied by a decrease in milk production. The nucleotide sequences of the VP6 and VP7 genes from strain Yamagata were determined. Comparative sequence analysis showed that the sequence identities between strains Yamagata and Shintoku were markedly high in both VP6 gene (98.1%) and VP7 gene (93.5%), and that these strains belonged to the same clusters which were distinguished from GCRs from different host species in phylogenetic trees of these genes. These results suggested strongly that cattle species is one of the natural hosts of GCR infection, and that GCRs are a cause of adult cow diarrhea.

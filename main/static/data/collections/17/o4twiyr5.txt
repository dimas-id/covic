PURPOSE In endoscopic surgery, limited views and lack of tactile sensation restrict the surgeon's abilities and cause stress to the surgeon. Therefore, an intra-operative navigation system is strongly recommended. We developed an augmented reality (AR) navigation system based on preoperative CT imaging. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness, feasibility, and accuracy of this system using laparoscopic splenectomy in children. METHODS Volume images were reconstructed by three-dimensional (3D) viewer application. We used an optical tracking system for registration between volume image and body surface markers. The AR visualization was superimposed preoperative 3D CT images onto captured laparoscopic live images. This system was applied to six cases of laparoscopic splenectomy in children. To evaluate registration accuracy, distances from the marker position to the volume data were calculated. RESULTS The operator recognized the hidden vascular variation of the splenic artery and vein, accessory spleen, and pancreatic tail by overlaying an image onto a laparoscopic live image. The registration accuracy of six cases was 5.30 ± 0.08, 5.71 ± 1.70, 10.1 ± 0.60, 18.8 ± 3.56, 4.06 ± 1.71, and 7.05 ± 4.71. CONCLUSION This navigation system provides real-time anatomical information, which cannot be otherwise visualized without navigation. The registration accuracy was acceptable in clinical operation.

BACKGROUND The emergency treatment of incisional hernias can be accomplished by a laparoscopic approach in order to avoid the common complications following open techniques. METHODS From January 2001 to September 2007, we performed 48 emergency laparoscopic treatments of incarcerated hernias. RESULTS In our hospital, 320 patients with incisional hernia and 65 patients with primary abdominal wall hernia were treated laparoscopically. Forty-eight patients (30 females and 18 males) underwent emergency surgery. The mean operative time was 62 min (range 45–80 min). The average length of hospital stay was 4 days (range 3–6 days). We had eight post-surgical seromas, all of which were treated successfully by needle aspiration. We saw no mesh sepsis and no metabolic or surgical complications. We had no recurrence nor the need for a second operation. Mortality was nil. CONCLUSIONS The results of this series prove the feasibility of emergency laparoscopic surgery in incarcerated incisional hernias using new-generation meshes.

To study the effects of concurrent infection of Cryptosporidium parvum with rotavirus and coronavirus in comparison to single infection of rotavirus and coronavirus, electrocardiographic parameters and serum electrolytes and microelements are compared between eight calves with concurrent infection and ten calves with single infection. Calves with single infections had higher serum concentrations of sodium and calcium, and less potassium, copper, and iron, which was not statistically significant. They also had significantly shorter P and QRS wave amplitudes and longer T wave duration in electrocardiogram patterns.

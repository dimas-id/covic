We propose a mesoscale model structure for the coronavirus nucleocapsid, assembled from the high resolution structures of the basic building blocks of the N-protein, CryoEM imaging and mathematical constraints for an overall quasi-spherical particle. The structure is a truncated octahedron that accommodates two layers: an outer shell composed of triangular and quadrangular lattices of the N-terminal domain and an inner shell of equivalent lattices of coiled parallel helices of the C-terminal domain. The model is consistent with the dimensions expected for packaging large viral genomes and provides a rationale to interpret the apparent pleomorphic nature of coronaviruses.

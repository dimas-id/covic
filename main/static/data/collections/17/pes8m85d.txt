Abstract Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most popular nonalcoholic beverages, consumed by over two-thirds of the world's population because of its refreshing, mild stimulant and medicinal properties. It is processed in different ways in different parts of the world to give green, black, oolong, and pu-erh tea. Among all tea polyphenols, epigallocatechin-3-gallate has been responsible for much of the health promoting abilities of tea including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumour, anti-oxidative, protection from cardiovascular disease, anti-obesity, and anti-aging properties. In the present review, the antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities of different types of tea and their polyphenols are reported, highlighting their mechanisms of action and structureâ€“activity relationship. Moreover, considering that the changing patterns of infectious diseases and the emergence of microbial strains resistant to current antibiotics, there is an urgent need to find out new potent antimicrobial agents as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy. The synergistic effect of tea polyphenols in combination with conventional antimicrobial agents against clinical multidrug-resistant microorganisms has also been discussed in this review.

Viral infections (especially respiratory infections) are not rare in critically ill non-immunocompromised patients. Efficient and rapid virologic diagnosis tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are now widely available. Herpesviridae (herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus) are the most frequent viruses detected among non-immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, causal relationships between detected viruses and outcomes are still debated, with a variable level of demonstration among the different viruses. The aim of this review was to assess the role of viruses in causing mechanical ventilation-acquired pneumonias in non-immunocompromised ICU adult patients. We also discuss the possible physiopathology of these viral infections, as well as the opportunity for therapeutic interventions.

During the epidemic of COVID-19, the management model of colorectal cancer has to be changed at our center due to relatively limited medical resources. Outpatient visits are reduced under well protected after appointment, and rigorous investigation of epidemiological history and clinical symptoms are needed. We prefer a simple and convenient treatment regimen, which may also be postponed appropriately. Minimally invasive CRC surgery combined with a perioperative program of enhanced recovery after surgery should be recommended. We also focus on mental health treatments and healthy lifestyle education. In addition, routine follow-up can be moderately delayed. In total, adequate doctor-patient communication is also recommended throughout the treatment.

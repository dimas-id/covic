Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are a collection of autonomous nodes with a limited battery life. They are used in various fields such as health, industry, home automation. Due to their limited resources and constraints, WSNs face several problems. One of these problems is the optimal coverage of a observed area. Indeed, whatever the domain, ensuring optimal network coverage remains a very important issue in WSNs, especially when the number of sensors is limited. In this paper, we aim to cover a two-dimensional Euclidean area with a given number of sensors by using genetic algorithm in order to find the best placement to ensure a good network coverage. The maximum coverage problem addressed in this paper is based on the calculation of the total area covered by deployed sensor nodes. We first, define the problem of maximum coverage. For a given number of sensors, the proposed algorithm find the best position to maximize the sensor area coverage. Finally, the results show that the proposed method well maximize the sensor area coverage.

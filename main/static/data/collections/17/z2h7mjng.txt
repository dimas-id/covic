Nowadays, detecting the presence of bioterrorism and biohazard agents in environmental and food samples is of great concern, due to their toxicity, and because many of them are prone to be used in terrorism attacks. The use of functionalized magnetic beads (MBs) in the development of electrochemical immuno‚Äê and genosensors has resulted in innovative and powerful detection strategies that may be applied to environmental, food and clinical analysis. This review describes current research on the combination of functionalized MBs with electrochemical detection for the development of magnetobiosensors applied to rapid, sensitive and specific detection of bioterrorism and biohazard agents.

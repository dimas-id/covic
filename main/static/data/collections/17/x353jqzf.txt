Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) present distinct physiological and social considerations for the emergency physician. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these considerations may generate unique challenges for emergency physicians managing patients with SCIs. Physiological disruptions may alter the way SCI patients present with COVID-19. The same disruptions can affect management of this vulnerable patient group, perhaps warranting early aggressive treatment. The medical picture will often be complicated by unique social characteristics. The reliance on caregivers for activities of daily living can, as an example, increase the human resource requirement of an ED. Considering the vulnerabilities and complexities of patients with SCI, the community should prioritise prevention of COVID-19 infections in this group. In the event that they do present to an ED, planning for and understanding their complexities will facilitate optimal management.

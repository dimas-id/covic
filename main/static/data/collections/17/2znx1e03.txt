Several areas of feline gastroenterology deserve critical attention in the near future. For example, as compared with the dog, little is known about the various causes of malabsorptive disease in the cat. So frequently, intestinal biopsy samples reveal nothing more than intestinal thickening with fibrosis and nonspecific mild cellular infiltration, and the inciting cause is never determined. It is, perhaps, wrong to be critical about the use of the bark of Berberis vulgaris and the root of Rheum in modern feline gastroenterology, since most of us occasionally use unconventional therapies. It has been rumored that I have been known to advocate the daily addition of a tablespoon of pumpkin-pie filling to the food of cats suffering from recurrent constipation and acquired megacolon. The rumors are true, and colonic evacuation is sometimes promoted with the use of this unusual bulking agent after traditional drug therapy has failed. We all have our weaknesses!

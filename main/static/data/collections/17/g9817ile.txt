BACKGROUND: At present thoracotomy with femoro-femoral bypass is an established approach for minimally invasive open heart surgeries, but thoracotomy with conventional cannulation is yet to be established. We performed 54 cases of ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure via anterolateral thoracotomy approach with central cannulation. Here we are describing our results and experience of VSD closure via anterolateral thoracotomy approach. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate early outcomes of VSD repair via anterolateral thoracotomy with central cannulation. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, descriptive type of study. Fifty four patients (31 males, 23 females) underwent VSD repair from November 2016 to November 2018 via anterolateral thoracotomy with age ranges from 3 to 22 years (mean age 10.57 + 8.88 years). Mean body weight was 22.29 + 13.44 kg (range 10 to 48 kg). The VSD was perimembranous in 47 patients, subpulmonic in 2, muscular in 2, and inlet in 3 patients. RESULTS: There was no operative or late mortality. The mean incision length was 7.16 ± 02.08 cm (range, 5 cm to 9 cm). Average duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was 61.72 ± 14.20 min (range, 48–78 min), and aortic cross-clamp time was 38.51 ± 13.08 min (range, 26–56 min). The average postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 1.83 ± 1.32 days (range, 1–3 days), and hospital stay was 4.92 ± 1.82 days (range, 4–7 days). CONCLUSION: Anterolateral thoracotomy with conventional central cannulation can be a safe alternative to median sternotomy with superior cosmetic results for the repair of VSDs.

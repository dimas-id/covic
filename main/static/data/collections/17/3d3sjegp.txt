Abstract Prevention and control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) has become a high priority for most healthcare organizations. Mathematical models can provide insights into the dynamics of nosocomial infections and help to evaluate the effect of infection control measures. The model presented in this paper adopts an individual-based and stochastic approach to investigate MRSA outbreaks in a hospital ward. A computer simulation was implemented to analyze the dynamics of the system associated with the spread of the infection and to carry out studies on space and personnel management. This study suggests that a strict spatial cohorting might be ineffective, if it is not combined with personnel cohorting.

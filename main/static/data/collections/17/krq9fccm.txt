OBJECTIVE: The COVID‐19 pandemic seems to be developing into a planetary‐scale mental health experiment, undermining the foundations of our being human, obliging us to keep physically apart from one another, and inducing us to see other people as a potential threat. METHODS: In the world of pediatric oncology, we have found ourselves up against new challenges. In this article, we discuss the difficulties found in conducting psychological support sessions while complying with physical distancing rules, as well as wearing protective face masks, and even gloves; or while using modern remote communication telecommunications. RESULTS: The classic reasons behind requests for psychological support have been compounded by other, novel problems, such as: fewer relational resources for families at home, less chance to socialize, hospital stays with only one parent, the suspension of all teaching and group activities on the ward, economic difficulties caused by the pandemic, the rising levels of family conflictuality and generalized anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to find new solutions that can be promptly implemented, reconfiguring the way we humanize our hospital wards.

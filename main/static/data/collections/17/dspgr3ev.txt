If you are like me, you probably have a morning routine that involves information. Perhaps before you even get out of bed, you grab your phone or tablet and hit your “cycle” of apps: email, news, social media, and perhaps company reports and analytics. Sometimes it seems like you spend more of your time cycling through things than actually reading them. Wouldn’t it be nice to tie all of that together? In this chapter, we’ll do exactly that by having R build a daily briefing for us, and we’ll discuss ways to get it to us in the morning (or anytime we need it) as quickly and easily!

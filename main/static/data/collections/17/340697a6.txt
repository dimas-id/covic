The exposome is a complicated scientific research topic but an easily understandable concept for health. By integrating multiple external forces that act upon us, it is possible to take a holistic view of our health. The exposome model provides a way to organize and integrate the many new challenges we face in our day-to-day lives. This chapter provides examples of how the exposome can be incorporated into the lives of our families, communities, and countries, including educating the public across multiple sectors. The reader will find simple and scientifically sound recommendations for reducing chemical exposures and improving one’s exposome. Since one’s genome is relatively fixed, an improvement in one’s exposome will undoubtedly lead to an improvement in one’s health.

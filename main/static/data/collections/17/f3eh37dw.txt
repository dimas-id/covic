We describe the treatment and follow-up results of 30 children with culture-proven melioidosis seen during 1994-1999. Twelve patients had septicemia, and 18 patients had localized infection. Ceftazidime with or without trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were used for the acute treatment of severe melioidosis. Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was given in the eradication phase in 4 patients with septicemia and in 12 patients for the treatment of localized infection. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in combination with doxycycline were given to 4 patients, whereas doxycycline alone was given to 2 patients older than 8 years old. No serious adverse reaction was reported. Three patients died suddenly. Twenty-five patients could be followed up; 24 patients were well.

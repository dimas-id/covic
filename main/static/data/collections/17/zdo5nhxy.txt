STUDY OBJECTIVE Platelets play a pivotal role in metastasis of tumor cells. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane on platelets activation of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery, and the effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane on platelets-induced invasion of lung cancer cells. DESIGN Prospective and randomized study, and in vitro experiment. SETTING University-affiliated teaching hospital and laboratory. PATIENTS Forty-six patients scheduled for lung cancer radical surgery. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to two groups of 23 patients each and were received sevoflurane (group SEV) or isoflurane (group ISO) during surgery, respectively. In vitro, lung cancer cells were treated with platelets in the presence or absence anesthetics. MEASUREMENTS Platelets activation were determined by detecting glycoproteinIIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), CD62P, and platelets aggregation rate (PAR) pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. Invasion ability of lung cancer cells were evaluated by Transwell assay. RESULTS The levels of GPIIb/IIIa, CD62P, and PAR were reduced markedly in group SEV during perioperative period compared with group ISO. In vitro, activated platelets contributed profoundly to the invasive ability of lung cancer cells. Sevoflurane, but not isoflurane, inhibited platelets-induced invasion of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, sevoflurane suppressed the platelets activity in vitro. CONCLUSION Sevoflurane attenuates platelets activation of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. In vitro, sevoflurane suppresses platelets-induced invasion of lung cancer cells via decreasing platelets activity.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this case report is to present a minimally invasive technique for solving an anastomotic colorectal stenosis using Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (T.E.M.) in combination with laparoscopy. SUMMARY Often a re-intervention is indicated for the resolution of an anastomotic (sub-) obstruction. This re-intervention is associated with the morbidity and mortality of a laparotomy and a prolonged hospital stay. In the case here presented, a 68-year-old man underwent a laparoscopic rectosigmoid resection for a rectal adenocarcinoma. An end-to-end circular stapled colorectal anastomosis was performed. At first without any postoperative problems, the patient presented with a stenosis of the anastomosis 6 months postoperatively. This stenosis did not result in a total obstruction but was sufficiently advanced to cause faecal impaction and discomfort, which was confirmed using a retrograde gastrografine bowel study. Colonoscopic dilatations were insufficient and after several days the patient experienced a recurrence of the original stenosis. A minimally invasive re-intervention with T.E.M. was performed in combination with laparoscopy to solve the stenosis. To our knowledge, this technique has not yet been described. CONCLUSION In this paper we describe a possible minimally invasive technique to avoid laparotomy after colorectal or colo-anal anastomotic stenosis. Both the duration of the hospital stay and patient morbidity can be reduced in this way.

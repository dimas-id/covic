Single port access surgery (SPAS) presents surgeons with added challenges that require new surgical tools and surgical assistance systems with unique capabilities. To address these challenges, we designed and constructed a new insertable robotic end-effectors platform (IREP) for SPAS. The IREP can be inserted through a Ã˜15 mm trocar into the abdomen and it uses 21 actuated joints for controlling two dexterous arms and a stereo-vision module. Each dexterous arm has a hybrid mechanical architecture comprised of a two-segment continuum robot, a parallelogram mechanism for improved dual-arm triangulation, and a distal wrist for improved dexterity during suturing. The IREP is unique because of the combination of continuum arms with active and passive segments with rigid parallel kinematics mechanisms. This paper presents the clinical motivation, design considerations, kinematics, statics, and mechanical design of the IREP. The kinematics of coordination between the parallelogram mechanisms and the continuum arms is presented using the pseudo-rigid-body model of the beam representing the passive segment of each snake arm. Kinematic and static simulations and preliminary experiment results are presented in support of our design choices.

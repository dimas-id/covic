With about 10 million active disease cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2018, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most threatening infectious diseases. Yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to reduce morbidity and mortality by 90 and 95%, respectively, between 2015 and 2035. Although diagnostics, therapeutics, and a vaccine are available, it is beyond doubt that better intervention measures are needed to accomplish this ambitious goal. The vaccine bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) partially protects infants against TB, but it is virtually ineffective against pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults. The efficacy of this vaccine, however, has not yet been fully exploited. In addition, new vaccine candidates are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Because a quarter of all people are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), new vaccines must be applied not only prior to infection (pre-exposure vaccination) but also after infection (postexposure vaccination). Prevention of infection, prevention of disease, and prevention of recurrence are currently assessed as clinical endpoints. Because protection against TB is primarily mediated by T lymphocytes, TB vaccine development focuses on protective T cell responses. Protein adjuvant formulations, viral vectors, and killed and live bacterial vaccines are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Moreover, therapeutic vaccination is clinically tested, notably in adjunct to canonical drug therapy to multiresistant TB. It is likely that a single vaccine cannot accomplish the various indications and that different vaccination strategies are required.

We evaluated the prevalence of respiratory virus infection (RVI) in 403 illnesses of 364 persons hospitalized over a 2-year period with acute respiratory conditions using virus-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays in addition to cell culture and serology. RVIs were identified in >75% of children under 5 years of age and 25 to 37% of adults. The molecular assays doubled the number of infections identified; picornaviruses were the most frequent in patients of all ages, followed by respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses.

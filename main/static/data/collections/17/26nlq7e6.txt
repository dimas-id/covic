Medical schools in the UK have been forced to dramatically restructure teaching and assessment amidst the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As part of this, some have opted to assess progression through open book examinations (OBE). I aim to share my thoughts as an unsettled 4th year medical student about to embark on my first set of clinical exams conducted in this format. The difficulties associated with preparing for examinations under such unique and challenging circumstances cannot be underestimated. Working from home, during social distancing, surrounds students with the extra family stresses that we are all facing during this pandemic. This combined with a new, unfamiliar examination format will inevitably lead to students feeling daunted. While some would argue that an OBE may reward good problem solvers, students still require a strong foundation of knowledge. The luxury of reference will not be afforded in all clinical settings thus leading to concerns regarding students skimming over essential learning points. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the increased opportunity for academic misconduct resulting from an open book assessment format. Why are medical schools placing undue stress on students who could instead focus their attention on living compassionately for others during this difficult time?

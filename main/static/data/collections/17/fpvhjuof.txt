This chapter reviews extensively gastrointestinal bleeding that require intensive care unit admission. Its management, including with assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), is emphasized as well as the use of proton pump inhibitors and H(2)-receptor blockers to prevent further hemorrhage. Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), an acute reduction in blood flow to the intestine leading to inadequate perfusion, is reviewed. Acute pancreatitis, an inflammatory process of the pancreas, having alcoholism, gallstones, hyperlipidemia, trauma, and infections as the most common etiologies, is also reviewed.

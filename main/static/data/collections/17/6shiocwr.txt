In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, many older people across the world are being asked to self-isolate to protect their health. This has led to a rapid reconfiguration of health promotion services, which are diverse in focus, and may include exercise, dietary interventions or psychosocial interventions, towards remote delivery, for example by phone or using computers. Whilst currently they are unable to be safely delivered any other way, there are concerns that these remote interventions may replace face-to-face interventions beyond the end of social restrictions. We advocate caution with taking this forward, particularly for frailer older people.

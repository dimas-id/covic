Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major pathogen that causes hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) as well as neurological complications, such as encephalitis. The chemokines involved in the migration of leukocytes have increasingly been implicated in infectious diseases of the central nervous system. Few studies have evaluated the levels of chemokines in HMFD children with EV71-related encephalitis. In the present study, we evaluated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MIG, MCP-1 and IP-10 in 99 children with EV71-related encephalitis and 22 children with febrile convulsion (FC). We found that the concentrations of IL-8, RANTES, MIG and IP-10 were significantly higher in HFMD children with encephalitis compared to patients with FC. Additionally, these four chemokines were dramatically reduced during convalescence. Inversely, the level of MCP-1 was lower in encephalitis patients than FC patients and was not significantly reduced during convalescence. Additionally, MIG was strongly correlated with IP-10 in encephalitis patients. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CSF MIG and IP-10 in distinguishing encephalitis from FC were 0.869 and 0.876, and the corresponding sensitivities/specificities were 67.7%/100.0% and 67.7%/95.5%, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that chemokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection.

Newcastle disease Virus (NDV), a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, and Influenza virus, from the Orthomyxoviridae family, are two main avian pathogens that cause serious economic problems in poultry farming. NDV strains are classified into three major pathotypes: velogenic, mesogenic, and lentogenic. Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are also divided into: low pathogenic (LPAI) and highly pathogenic (HPAI) strains. Both viruses are enveloped, single stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses which give similar symptoms ranging from sub-clinical infections to severe disease, including loss in egg production, acute respiratory syndrome, and high mortality, depending on their level of pathogenicity. This similarity hinders diagnosis when based solely on clinical and post mortem examination. Most of the currently available molecular detection methods are also pathogenspecific, so that more than one RT-PCR is then required to confirm or exclude the presence of both pathogens. To overcome this disadvantage, we have applied a One Step Duplex RT-PCR method to distinguish between those two pathogens. The main objective of the project was to develop a universal, fast, and inexpensive method which could be used in any veterinary laboratory.

Approximately 4.5% to 7% of the population will have simple hepatic cysts, but only 5% of these will require treatment. Drainage options include interventional, laparoscopic, and open techniques ranging from simple aspiration to liver resection. We present a case where a giant hepatic cyst was treated laparoscopically and omentum was fixed in the defect using fibrin glue to prevent recurrence. A 69-year-old female patient presented with a recurrent simple hepatic cyst after percutaneous aspiration had failed. Her symptoms were related to the size of the cyst. Laparoscopic drainage was performed with cyst wall excision. Omentum was fixed in the defect using fibrin glue. She was discharged after 24 hours without complication. There are many ways to treat nonparasitic liver cysts. The laparoscopic approach limits morbidity with excellent results. The use of fibrin glue to secure omentum in the defect is a simple technique to limit recurrence.

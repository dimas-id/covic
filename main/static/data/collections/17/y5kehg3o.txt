OBJECTIVE To report the newly developed reconstruction technique after laparoscopic total gastrectomy: intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil; Covidien), and evaluate its feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes. METHODS After LTG (3 patients with gastric carcinoma in the body) or LPG (2 patients with gastric carcinoma in the cardiac and fundus, respectively, and 1 with cardiac stromal tumor), the anvil was then inserted transorally into the esophagus by using the OrVil system. Double-stapling esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy with a circular stapler was performed intracorporeally. RESULTS The operations were uneventful. The operative time was (183.3+/-25.8) min, and blood loss was (128.3+/-90.2) ml. Postoperative fluorography revealed no anastomotic leakage or stenosis. Patients resumed an oral liquid diet on postoperative day (4.0+/-1.1), and were discharged on day (9.0+/-2.6). Patients were followed at 28 days and no complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction or LPG with esophagogastrostomy using the OrVil system appear to be safe and reliable with satisfactory short-term outcomes.

Hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), unlike other Coronaviruses, readily agglutinates a variety of red blood cells. The reaction differs from that of the Myxovirus/Paramyxovirus groups in several respects. Unlike the Myxoviruses, HEV agglutinated red cells treated with receptor destroying enzyme. No neuraminidase activity was demonstrated with HEV and there was no apparent elution of the virus from agglutinated cells. Mucins and animal sera inhibited the agglutination reaction markedly. Ultra violet light exposure sufficient to destroy infectivity had no effect on hemagglutination. Density gradient studies showed that the hemagglutinin was closely associated with the virus particle.

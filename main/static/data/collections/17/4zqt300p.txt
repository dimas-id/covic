BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare placebo (PBO) and 7 therapeutic regimens—namely, bronchodilator agents (BAs), hypertonic saline (HS), BA ± HS, corticosteroids (CS), epinephrine (EP), EP ± CS, and EP ± HS—to determine the optimal bronchiolitis treatment. METHODS: We plotted networks using the curative outcome of several studies and specified the relations among the experiments by using mean difference, standardized mean difference, and corresponding 95% credible interval. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to separately rank each therapy on clinical severity score (CSS) and length of hospital stay (LHS). RESULTS: This network meta‐analysis included 40 articles from 1995 to 2016 concerning the treatment of bronchiolitis in children. All 7 therapeutic regimens displayed no significant difference to PBO with regard to CSS in our study. Among the 7 therapies, BA performed better than CS. As for LHS, EP and EP ± HS had an advantage over PBO. Moreover, EP and EP ± HS were also more efficient than BA. The SUCRA results showed that EP ± CS is most effective, and EP ± HS is second most effective with regard to CSS. With regard to LHS, EP ± HS ranked first, EP ± CS ranked second, and EP ranked third. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend EP ± CS and EP ± HS as the first choice for bronchiolitis treatment in children because of their outstanding performance with regard to CSS and LHS.

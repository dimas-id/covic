BACKGROUND: The risk factors for multi-drug resistant infection (MDRI) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) remain unclear. It’s necessary to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for MDRI in PICU, to provide insights into the prophylaxis of MDRI clinically. METHODS: Clinical data of 79 PICU children with MDRI were identified, and 80 children in PICU without MDRI in the same period were selected as control group. The related children’s characteristics, clinical care, microbiologic data, treatments provided, and outcomes of the patients with were reviewed and collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the potential risks of MDRI in PICU. RESULTS: Of the diagnosed 79 cases of MDRI, there were28 cases of CR-AB, 24 cases of MRSA, 22 cases of PDR-PA,3 cases of VRE and 2 cases of CRE respectively. Univariate analyses indicated that the length of PICU stay, the duration of mechanical ventilation > 5 days, parenteral nutrition, coma, urinary catheter indwelling, invasive operation, 2 or more antibiotics use were associated with MDRIs (all p < 0.05); The logistic multiple regression analyses indicated that coma, parenteral nutrition, 2 or more antibiotics use and the duration of mechanical ventilation > 5 days were independent risk factors associated with MDRI (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This present study has identified several potentially modifiable risk factors for MDRI in PICU, it’s conducive to take appropriate measures targeting risk factors of MDRI for health care providers to reduce MDRI.

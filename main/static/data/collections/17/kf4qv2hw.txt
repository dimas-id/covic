Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency intervention to maintain circulation and breathing in an unresponsive individual suffering from cardiopulmonary arrest. However, CPR is not without its own risks. Injuries secondary to compression and ventilation are well documented in the medical and scientific literature. Most of these injuries are minor, but some can result in significant morbidity and even death. It is important to identify those injuries that could be secondary to CPR versus inflicted traumatic injuries of child maltreatment.

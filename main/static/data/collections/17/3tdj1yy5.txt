Neuroimaging manifestations of COVID-19 are being reported with increasing frequency with recent reports of associated atypical leukoencephalopathies. We add to this literature by describing a COVID-19 + patient who demonstrated imaging findings typical for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The inflammatory syndrome associated with novel corona virus infection has shown markedly increased levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers. This has also been described in a proposed mechanism for PRES, where elevated inflammatory markers result in endothelial injury causing interstitial fluid extravasation typical of PRES. We expect that other cases of PRES will be observed in this population given the scope of the Covid-19 pandemic.

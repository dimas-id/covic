Abstract Purpose This study investigated the outcomes of antimicrobial de-escalation (ADE) based on mortality and the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogen occurrence in patients with culture-negative pneumonia presenting with sepsis and septic shock. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and possessing negative microbiological culture results at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea from March 2008 to July 2018. Results We identified 107 patients with culture-negative pneumonia. The Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) mean scores were 20.3 ± 8.6 and 9.6 ± 3.3, respectively. Among the patients, 40 (37.4%) underwent ADE. The APACHE II, SOFA, and follow-up SOFA scores did not differ significantly between the groups, and no differences were found in ICU mortality and MDR pathogen occurrence (27.5% vs 41.8%, P = .137 and 15.0% vs 16.9% P = .794, respectively). Conclusions We observed similar ICU mortality and MDR pathogen occurrence in patients with culture-negative pneumonia presenting with sepsis/shock regardless of whether they received ADE. Additionally, ADE lowered the antimicrobial burden.

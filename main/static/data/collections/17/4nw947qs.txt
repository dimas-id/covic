BACKGROUND The medial wall of mammalian veins is generally thin and fragile compared with the thick muscle seen in arteries. This makes venous microanastomoses time consuming and challenging. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using the BioWeld(®) Tube in conjunction with a surgical glue (butyl-2-cyanoacrylate) in performing sutureless venous microanastomoses. METHODS The feasibility and effectiveness of microvascular anastomoses in a rabbit jugular vein model were investigated in six animals, using the BioWeld(®) Tube in conjunction with butyl-2-cyanoacrylate surgical glue. Patency and tissue repair mechanisms at the anastomotic site were assessed 1 week after the procedure. RESULTS All anastomoses remained patent at 1 week. Muscle necrosis occurred only in areas where the tissue was subject to the fold-and-bond procedure. CONCLUSION The study showed the feasibility and short-term effectiveness of the BioWeld(®) Tube in facilitating venous anastomoses.

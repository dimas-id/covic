Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are similar coronaviruses, causing diseases characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and death from severe dehydration in piglets. Thus, they have caused huge losses to the swine-breeding industry worldwide. Nowadays, they are easily transmitted among the continents via vehicles, equipment, and cargo. Both viruses establish an infection in porcine enterocytes in the small intestine, and their spike (S) proteins play a key role in the virus-cell binding process under unfavorable conditions when the intestine with a low pH is filled with a thick layer of mucus and proteases. Sialic acid, proteases, and low pH are three main inducers of coronavirus infection. However, the details of how sialic acid and low pH affect virus binding to the host cell are not determined, and the functions of the proteases are unknown. This review emphasizes the role of three factors in the invasion of TGEV and PEDV into porcine enterocytes and offers more insights into Alphacoronavirus infection in the intestinal environment.

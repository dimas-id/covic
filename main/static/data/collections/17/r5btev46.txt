Abstract: An 11‐year‐old boy developed severe hypersensitivity reaction to phenobarbitone resulted in fulminant hepatic failure. During the course of illness, he developed clinical features compatible with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that may have complicated the recovery of his underlying hypersensitivity reaction, which was subsequently controlled with intravenous immune globulin and corticosteroids.

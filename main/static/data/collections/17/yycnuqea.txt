Even though joint health and safety committees (JHSCs) have been in existence in Ontario workplaces for almost 30 years and healthcare workers are at high risk for workplace injury, there has been little research done related to JHSC functioning in Ontario's healthcare sector. In his recent review of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Toronto, Justice Archie Campbell found that JHSCs in Ontario hospitals were not fulfilling their intended roles and responsibilities. The objective of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the role, resources, structure and functioning of JHSCs in Ontario hospitals.

ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES Current demographic information from China reports that 10-19% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were diabetic. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line agents in diabetics due to their nephroprotective effects but administration of these drugs leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), responsible for viral entry of severe-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome, coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data is lacking to determine what pulmonary effects ACEIs/ARBs may have in patients with diabetes, which could be relevant in the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of pulmonary adverse drug effects (ADEs) in diabetic patients taking ACEI or ARBs to help provide guidance as to how these medications could affect outcomes in acute respiratory illness, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS 1DATA, a unique data platform resulting from collaboration across veterinary and human healthcare, utilized an intelligent medicine recommender system (1DrugAssist) developed using several national and international databases, to evaluate all ADEs reported to the FDA for patients with diabetes taking ACEIs or ARBs. RESULTS Mining of this data elucidated the proportion of a cluster of pulmonary ADEs associated with specific medications in these classes, which may aid healthcare professionals in understanding how these medications could worsen or predispose patients with diabetes to infections affecting the respiratory system specifically, COVID-19. Based on this data mining, Captopril was found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared to other ACEIs (P = 0.005) as well as ARBs (P = 0.012), though other specific drugs also had important pulmonary ADEs associated with their use. CONCLUSION These analyses suggest that pharmacists and clinicians will need to consider specific medicationâ€™s adverse event profile, particularly captopril, and how this profile may affect infections and other acute disease states that alter pulmonary function, such as COVID-19.

PURPOSE Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a widely accepted to treat the varicose vein. However, outcome studies for occlusion rate and patterns of the saphenous vein after RFA are scarce. The purpose of our study is to report the results of RFA in patients with varicose vein. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes after RFA using ClosureFAST (Covidien) catheter. We evaluated the occlusion rate and patterns with duplex scanning after RFA. RESULTS A total of 200 limbs (148 patients) underwent RFA. The truncal veins were ablated in 163 great saphenous veins (GSV) and 41 small saphenous veins (SSVs). The mean age was 52.1 ± 11.9 years and female to male ratio was 125 : 87. At the mean follow-up of 13.9 months, the CEAP score, VCSS, and QoL score were significantly improved 2.33 ± 0.78 to 1.29 ± 0.96 (P < 0.0001), 3.48 ± 0.98 to 0.63 ± 1.16 (P < 0.0001), and 6.91 ± 6.69 to 3.38 ± 4.74 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The occlusion rate was 94.6% (53/56) in GSV and 94.5% (17/18) in SSV. The most common occlusion pattern in GSV was total occlusion of main trunk with patent superficial inferior epigastric vein in 41.1%. And, the most common pattern in SSV was the total occlusion of SSV with stump in 66.7%. CONCLUSION RFA is an effective modality in the treatment of varicose vein. At the mean follow-up of 13.9 months, the occlusion rate was 94.6%in GSV and 94.5% in SSV. There are several patterns of saphenous occlusion after RFA.

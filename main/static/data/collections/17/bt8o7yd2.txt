We present 2 infants with the rare association of long congenital tracheal stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary hypertension. We describe a step-by-step assessment of the patients and the necessary procedures for a successful concomitant repair of both cardiac and tracheal malformations. The use of a helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) for the induction of anesthesia and pre-cardiopulmonary bypass is discussed.

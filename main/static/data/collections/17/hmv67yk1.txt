PURPOSE Various techniques for minimally invasive thyroid surgery have been described over the last decade. As interest in single-port access laparoscopic surgery (SPA™) continues to grow, the authors present their technique and short-term outcomes for single-port access transaxillary totally endoscopic thyroidectomy in the management of benign thyroid tumors in a series of 4 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Four consecutive patients from a prospectively maintained endoscopic thyroidectomy database were analyzed under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS All the patients were young women with no prior neck surgery. A single-port totally endoscopic thyroidectomy was performed for thyroid adenoma in 2 cases and for nodular goiter in 2 cases. Retraction, exposure, and extraction were possible in all cases. The average operating room time was 92.5 minutes. Postoperative pain scores on postoperative day 1 were all 1/10. No patient experienced complications. The median hospital stay was 1.75 days. The mean specimen size was 2.7 cm × 2.375 cm × 2.625 cm. The patients were uniformly pleased with the cosmetic results of the operation. CONCLUSIONS Single-port access transaxillary totally endoscopic partial thyroidectomy appears to be safe and feasible. This technique may provide both an attractive way to reduce injury to the anterior neck tissue and a method for ideal cosmetic effect.

Abstract: This chapter discusses the role of composite nonwoven filters in different structural forms such as combining mechanical support and durability with filtration, providing two or more layers of different filtration efficiency and combining different separation technologies/functionality into one filter medium. In many situations, composite nonwovens might fulfill multiple objectives. Applications of composite nonwovens are quite diverse and increasing in the area of air, liquid and engine filtration. The developmental objectives of composite filtering media are lower energy consumption, longer filter life, high filtration capacity, greater dust holding (in depth filtration) and easy cleanability (of surface filter), satisfying more than one functional requirement and easier maintenance.

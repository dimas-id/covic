BACKGROUND Laparoscopic liver surgery is now an established practice in many institutions. It is a safe and feasible approach in experienced hands. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been performed for cholecystectomies, nephrectomies, splenectomies and obesity surgery. However, the use of SILS in liver surgery has been rarely reported. We report our initial experience in seven patients on single incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH). PATIENTS AND METHODS From October 2010 to September 2012, seven patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic liver surgery. The abdomen was approached through a 25 mm periumbilical incision. No supplemental ports were required. The liver was transected using a combination of LigaSureâ„¢ (Covidien-Valleylab. Boulder. USA), Harmonic Scalpel and Ligaclips (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.). RESULTS Liver resection was successfully completed for the seven patients. The procedures consisted of two partial resections of segment three, two partial resections of segment five and three partial resections of segment six. The mean operative time was 98.3 min (range: 60-150 min) and the mean estimated blood loss was 57 ml (range: 25-150 ml). The postoperative courses were uneventful and the mean hospital stay was 5.1 days (range: 1-13 days). Pathology identified three benign and four malignant liver tumours with clear margins. CONCLUSION SILH is a technically feasible and safe approach for wedge resections of the liver without oncological compromise and with favourable cosmetic results. This surgical technique requires relatively advanced laparoscopic skills. Further studies are needed to determine the potential advantages of this technique, apart from the better cosmetic result, compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach.

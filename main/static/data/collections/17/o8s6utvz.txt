The American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare (AASWSW) on June 2 adopted the following resolution by vote of its members: “AASWSW objects strenuously to the Trump Administration decision to withdraw the United States from WHO [the World Health Organization]. This decision is ill‐founded and must be reversed. It will harm the health of Americans and will lead to additional deaths during the COVID‐19 pandemic.” The Trump administration's decision to withdraw the United States from WHO threatens the health of people everywhere, the AASWSW stated. The withdrawal of the United States will greatly weaken WHO's efforts to eradicate disease and improve health care on a worldwide basis. It also will particularly harm public health efforts in the United States to combat the COVID‐19 pandemic, they stated.

OBJECTIVE This paper discusses the evolution of pervasive healthcare from its inception for activity recognition using wearable sensors to the future of sensing implant deployment and data processing. METHODS We provide an overview of some of the past milestones and recent developments, categorized into different generations of pervasive sensing applications for health monitoring. This is followed by a review on recent technological advances that have allowed unobtrusive continuous sensing combined with diverse technologies to reshape the clinical workflow for both acute and chronic disease management. We discuss the opportunities of pervasive health monitoring through data linkages with other health informatics systems including the mining of health records, clinical trial databases, multiomics data integration, and social media. CONCLUSION Technical advances have supported the evolution of the pervasive health paradigm toward preventative, predictive, personalized, and participatory medicine. SIGNIFICANCE The sensing technologies discussed in this paper and their future evolution will play a key role in realizing the goal of sustainable healthcare systems.

Aortic valve disease in the setting of a left ventricular assist device presents unique challenges. We present the case of a patient who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation to replace a stenotic aortic valve to facilitate left ventricular assist device explantation. Thirty-three days later, the porcine pericardial valve cusps were fused and a thick pseudomembrane had occluded the left ventricular outflow tract, forcing the explant to be aborted.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as COVID-19, has spread to 184 countries with almost 1.5 million cases as of mid-April 2020 since first reported (1). The clinical features of this disease are not completely understood, however severe illness is thought to predominantly occur in adults with advanced age and those with underlying comorbidities (2). Sickle cell disease (SCD), an immunocompromised condition, puts patients at higher risk for respiratory infections and subsequent pulmonary complications such as acute chest syndrome (ACS) (3).

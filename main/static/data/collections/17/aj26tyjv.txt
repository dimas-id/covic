BACKGROUND Improvement of neck contour is a primary goal of patients who seek rejuvenation of the face and neck. Subplatysmal structures, including fat, the digastric muscle, and the submandibular salivary glands (SMSGs), may contribute to the appearance of a disproportionately large neck. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and predictability of necklift combined with reshaping and repositioning of the subplatysmal structures. METHODS The records of 504 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Surgical maneuvers for subplatysmal necklift were described comprehensively and supplemented with videos. The subplatysmal anatomy was detailed by means of 2 cadaver dissections. RESULTS A total of 430 patients (85.3%) underwent subplatysmal necklift. The most commonly treated structures were fat (423 patients [83.9%]), the SMSGs (307 patients [60.9%]), and the digastric muscle (91 patients [18.1%]). The most common complications were weakness of the lower lip depressor (29 patients [5.7%]), followed by sialoma of the parotid gland (10 patients [2%]). No patients experienced subplatysmal hematoma. CONCLUSIONS Subplatysmal necklift is a safe, effective, and reliable option for patients who desire improved cervical contour. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4 Therapeutic.

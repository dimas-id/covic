PURPOSE OF REVIEW Few studies have examined disparities in autism services and functional outcomes over the life course. Transition to adulthood is an especially important developmental period, as it sets up trajectories of adult functioning. This systematic review summarizes patterns of service use and transition outcomes according to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic characteristics over the transition to adulthood. RECENT FINDINGS Forty studies were included. Low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth on the autism spectrum were less likely to participate in transition planning meetings, enroll in postsecondary education, find competitive employment after high school, live independently, participate in social activities, and receive health care transition services than their White and higher income peers on the autism spectrum. Racial/ethnic minority and low-income youth on the autism spectrum were more likely to be disconnected from educational, occupational, and social activities upon entering adulthood. Future research should explore the mechanisms underlying these disparities as a first step to addressing them.

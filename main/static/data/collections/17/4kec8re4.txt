Determining the epigenetic program that generates unique cell types in the kidney is critical for understanding cell-type heterogeneity during tissue homeostasis and injury response. Here, we profiled open chromatin and gene expression in developing and adult mouse kidneys at single cell resolution. We show critical reliance of gene expression on distal regulatory elements (enhancers). We define key cell type-specific transcription factors and major gene-regulatory circuits for kidney cells. Dynamic chromatin and expression changes during nephron progenitor differentiation demonstrated that podocyte commitment occurs early and is associated with sustained Foxl1 expression. Renal tubule cells followed a more complex differentiation, where Hfn4a was associated with proximal and Tfap2b with distal fate. Mapping single nucleotide variants associated with human kidney disease identified critical cell types, developmental stages, genes, and regulatory mechanisms. We provide a global single cell resolution view of chromatin accessibility of kidney development. The dataset is available via interactive public websites.

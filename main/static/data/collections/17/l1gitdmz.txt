The authors describe the evolution of the secretion of anti-Rotavirus antibodies vaccine given three weeks before and repeated at the moment of parturition. Rota virus antibodies were detected at a high level during the three months test period with the Indirect Immunofluorescence Test, the seroneutralisation test and the immunofluorescence test. The four untreated animals excreted only rota-antibodies till day 6 post partum. Seroneutralising antibodies were detected in the milk of the vaccinated animals at a level of 10â€“50% of the colostral level till day 90. The aspecific stimulation of the excretion of anti-Rotavirus antibodies in the milk after inoculation of the only adjuvant fraction of the vaccine is confirmed. The excretion level, however, was significantly lower than after Rotavirus vaccination.

The data reviewed demonstrate that viral and mycoplasma infections induce a spectrum of functional abnormalities in airways. Acute virus infections cause wheezing illnesses in both children and adults. Changes in peripheral airway function during infection with similar organisms are observed in other subjects, usually normal adults. The pathogenesis of these responses is unclear. Pathologic data do show that infection with these pathogens damages the airway epithelium. These changes appear to increase permeability of the respiratory epithelium to protein antigens and consequently may contribute to increased frequency of attacks in asthmatic subjects. In addition, increased mucosal permeability may enhance delivery of inhaled drugs to effector sites in airway walls to induce exaggerated bronchoconstrictor responses in clinical challenge situations. Whether changes in the epithelium during infection, inducing greater antigen entry into the interstitium, results in subsequent development of specific allergy is not known and requires further study.

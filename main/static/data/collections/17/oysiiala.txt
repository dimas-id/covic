Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of Emergency Preparedness & Response (EP&R) education, training, capacity building and infrastructure development in India. During the pandemic, pharmacy professionals (PPs) in India have continued to provide medications, supplies and services. India's public-private healthcare system is complex and of variable quality. Lacunae in pharmacy education, training, and lack of resolution around pharmacist roles present challenges in providing health services to patients. Such lack of differentiation creates challenges around role specifications and appropriate placement of PPs in patient care and on EP&R task forces or representation at the policy level. This study aimed to gain rapid insights from PPs in India regarding their roles and preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey comprising 20 questions regarding EP&R and Operations management was developed using the QualtricsÂ® survey software and administered to a sample of PPs. Survey results indicate that PPs were actively involved in essential pharmacy services despite minimal EP&R training. Based on lessons learned during COVID-19, lacunae in knowledge, training and regulations were identified and recommendations are provided to broaden PP roles and enable them to be better prepared and actively engaged in EP&R for future emergencies.

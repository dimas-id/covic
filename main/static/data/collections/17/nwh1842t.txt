Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is an emerging infectious disease.It was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then broke out on a large scale around the world.This study aimed to assess the clinical significance of two different nutritional indices in 245 patients with COVID 19. Methods: In this retrospective single center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID 19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death . Results: 212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe CONUT group than in the moderate, mild , and normal CONUT groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95%CI (1.124 10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI(0.581 0.896),P=0.003) were independent predictors of all cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95% CI(2.147 273.327), p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81%; AUC 0.753; 95% CI(0.644 0.862);respectively).The PNI cutoff value was 40.58 (81.80 and 66.20%; AUC 0.778; 95% CI(0.686 0.809); respectively).We use PNI and the COUNT score to assess malnutrition, which can have a prognosis effect of COVID 19 patients. Conclusion:The CONUT score and PNI could be a reliable prognostic marker of all cause death in patients with COVID 19. Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; nutrition; indicies; prognosis

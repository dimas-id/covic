Mouse models of human disease form a link between genetics and biology. However, mice and humans differ in many aspects of immune system biology. These differences might explain, in part, why many successful preclinical immunotherapy studies in mice turn out to be unsuccessful when used in clinical trials in humans. Pioneering studies in the late 1980s demonstrated the reconstitution of human lympho-hematopoietic cells in immunodeficient mice. Since this time, immunodeficient mice are being tested as hosts for human hematopoietic organs or cells in an effort to create an in vivo model of the complete human immune system. Such Humouse models could permit us to generate and test novel human vaccines.

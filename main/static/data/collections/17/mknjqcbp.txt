The Solitaire-FR (eV3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) retrievable stent (SFR), designed for mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke, recently received Food and Drug Administration approval in the USA. Clot retrieval is performed by deploying the SFR through a microcatheter directly into the thrombus, to capture the clot and restore perfusion. In order to perform this maneuver, a balloon guide catheter must be used to apply negative suction and reverse flow within the cervical arteries, thus minimizing the chance of antegrade blood flow dislodging the thrombus from the stent. This technique requires at least an 8-French system that can increase the risk of arterial injury at the access site particularly in older patients with smaller or highly atherosclerotic peripheral arteries, and may provide inadequate aspiration in the vertebrobasilar system where only one vertebral artery is accessed and aspirated. The author describes a technique whereby a 6-French tri-axial system is used to deliver the SFR through a Penumbra Aspiration Microcatheter (Penumbra, Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) to provide intracranial aspiration in close proximity to the stent.

The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States has forced federal and local governments to implement containment measures. Moreover, the severity of the situation has sparked engagement by both the research and clinical community with the goal of developing effective treatments for the disease. This article proposes a time dynamic prediction model with competing risks for the infected individual and develops a simple tool for policy makers to compare different strategies in terms of when to implement the strictest containment measures and how different treatments can increase or suppress infected cases. Two types of containment strategies are compared: (1) a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of citizens for a long period; and (2) an adaptive containment strategy whose strict level changes across time. We consider how an effective treatment of the disease can affect the dynamics in a pandemic scenario. For illustration we consider a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases assuming a 4% mortality rate compared with a 2% mortality rate if a new drug is available. Our results show compared with a constant containment strategy, adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and reduce maximum daily number of cases. This, along with an effective treatment plan for the disease can minimize death rate.

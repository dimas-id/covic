Cytokine storm is a life-threatening complication of Covid-19 infection. Excessive cytokines are the products of hyperactive immune inflammatory response mounted by the host against the virus. There is no agreed treatment for cytokine storm. Three therapeutic agents with proven immune-modulatory properties in regular use in a wide range of inflammatory disorders (high dose intravenous immunoglobulin, Rituximab and thalidomide) are proposed for the treatment of cytokine storm. Safety and efficacy of the proposed treatment should be assessed by randomised controlled clinical trials. The use of the proposed treatment is expected to reduce the mortality rate and alter the overall management of the pandemic.

Summary There are obviously important and reciprocal relationships between atopy and infections. Atopy predisposes to infections of the target organ, i.e. the site of the allergic reaction. As allergic inflammation prepares the terrain for these infections, it is particularly important to fight against allergic inflammation by eliminating allergens and irritants from the atopic subject's environment. In some cases, topical anti-inflammatory drugs, such as cromoglycate or corticosteroids spray or ointment, must be used. Reciprocally, infections of the target organ accentuate atopic diseases by superimposing their specific inflammatory phenomena onto those of the allergic reaction, by amplifying this reaction and by creating hyperreactivity of the target organ. The possible role of Chlamydia pneumoniae infections in the pathogenesis of certain severe forms of chronic asthma could attribute a place to macrolides in the treatment or even the prophylaxis of asthma.

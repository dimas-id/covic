Abstract A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) for detection of the soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV) was developed using a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against STIV and anti-STIV rabbit serum. Using DAS-ELISA, the detection limit of STIV was found to be 103 PFU/ml. The positive rate of 15 STIV samples was 100%, while the positive rate of 100 other aquatic virus samples was 0%. These data show that DAS-ELISA is highly specific and sensitive for the detection of STIV. In clinical tests, 128 samples isolated from pond-reared turtles were subjected to DAS-ELISA and PCR. The overall agreement between the results obtained by DAS-ELISA and PCR was 98.4%. The results indicate that the DAS-ELISA method could be used for diagnosing diseases caused by STIV.

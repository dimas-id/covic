Abstract When presenting with flu-like illnesses, the existing eligibility criteria set within the guidelines, bar such individuals from donating blood. All the same, when healthy-looking ‘asymptomatic’ rather 'innocent blood donors' [IBDs] come forward to donate blood, they’ll pose a serious threat to the health of the blood community. These IBDs may be completely unaware of their viral status at the time of donation. We, therefore, created a "Can I Donate?" self-estimation tool [SAT] within the context of the outbreak of COVID-19, to facilitate an estimation of the seriousness of the present pandemic, its implications for blood safety and to encourage self-deferral by these IBDs if they found themselves to be unsuitable for blood donation.

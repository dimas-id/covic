BACKGROUND: We conducted this systemic review and meta-analysis in an attempt to evaluate the efficacy and safety of umifenovir in COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI and medRxiv database. We included both retrospective and prospective studies. The mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied to assess the effectiveness of umifenovir for COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 1052 patients were included in our final studies. Compared with control group, umifenovir is associated with higher negative rate of PCR on day 14 (RR:1.27; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.55). However, umifenovir is not related to nucleus acid negative conversion time(MD: 0.09; 95% CI: -1.48 to 1.65), negative rate on day 7(RR:1.09; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.31), incidence of composite endpoint (RR:1.20; 95% CI: 0.61 to 2.37), rate of fever alleviation on day 7 (RR:1.00; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.10), rate of cough alleviation on day 7 (RR:1.00; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.18), or hospital length of stay (LOS) (MD: 1.34; 95% CI: -2.08 to 4.76). Additionally, umifenovir was safe in COVID-19 patients (RR for incidence of adverse events:1.29; 95% CI: 0.57 to 2.92). The results of sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were similar to pooled results. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support the use of umifenovir for improving patient-important outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

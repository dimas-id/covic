This paper considers the application of machine learning to automatically generating heuristics for real polynomial constraint solvers. We consider a specific choice-point in the algorithm for constructing an open Non-uniform Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (NuCAD) for a conjunction of constraints, and we learn a heuristic for making that choice. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned heuristic. We hope that the approach we take to learning this heuristic, which is not a natural fit to machine learning, can be applied effectively to other choices in constraint solving algorithms.

Pulmonary infections are caused by a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The most common lung infections in immunocompetent hosts are caused by pyogenic bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae), common respiratory viruses, and mycoplasma. These infections are usually diagnosed by clinical and microbiologic studies, including cultures and serology tests. Lung biopsy is rarely used in these diagnoses. Patients with life-threatening pneumonia, especially those who are immunocompromised, are more likely to undergo lung biopsy to rule out unusual infections not easily diagnosed using conventional microbiologic methods and for which treatment strategies may be different. Pathogens more likely to be diagnosed using lung biopsy for which there are characteristic pathologic changes are highlighted in this chapter and listed in Table 4.1.

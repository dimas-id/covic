OBJECTIVE To observe the clinic symptom improving time in uncertain SARS patients and the therapeutic effect of integrative Chinese and western medicine (ICWM) in treating SARS. METHODS The clinic symptoms, chest film and tongue figure of 40 uncertain SARS patients treated with ICWM were observed and T-lymphocyte subsets, serum coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody in 20 patients were tested dynamically. RESULTS All the symptoms, such as fever, sweating, fatigue, cough without phlegm, etc. were obviously improved after treatment. Lung shadow in chest film began to be absorbed 4.54 +/- 2.85 days, and obviously absorbed 7.74 +/- 4.68 days after treatment. CD3, CD4 and CD8 in 20 patients, which were lower than the normal range when hospitalization, began to increase 3 days later and gradually recovered to the normal in 6-10 days. Serum coronavirus nucleic acid was positive in 3 patients, coronavirus antibody positive in two and both were positive in one. CONCLUSION ICWM can improve the symptoms and regulate the immune function in uncertain SARS patients.

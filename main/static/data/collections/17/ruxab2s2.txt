PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate the safety, efficacy, and retrievability of Option inferior vena cava (IVC) filters. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients (N = 516; 247 women; mean age, 67.1 y ± 15.1; range, 19.5-101.6 y) who received an Option filter between August 2009 and March 2015 at a single health care system were analyzed. RESULTS The study duration was 68 months, with median clinical follow-up of 7.1 months (range, 1 d to 61.8 mo). During follow-up, 73 of 83 patients (88.0%) underwent successful filter retrieval, 153 died (including three after successful retrieval), and 293 remained alive with filters in situ. Seventeen cases of breakthrough pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred (3.4%). Among 323 patients with direct filter imaging, there were two cases of tilt > 15°, one case of filter deformity, 16 cases of intracaval migration > 2 cm, and no cases of filter fracture. There were six cases of caval occlusion, nine cases of thrombus trapped inside the filter, and 57 cases of limb penetration on computed tomography scans or radiographs of the IVC. Retrieval failures were attributed to filter tilt or tip embedment in the caval wall (n = 4), complete IVC thrombosis (n = 3), thrombus inside the filter (n = 2), or inability to disengage filter legs (n = 1). Recurrent deep vein thrombosis occurred in 34 patients, including 32 with filters in situ and two whose filters had been removed. CONCLUSIONS Most Option filters were left in situ for permanent indications. Rates of successful retrieval, device-related complications, and breakthrough PE were similar to those associated with other retrievable filters.

Objective: To explore the application value of chest multi-detector spiral CT (MDSCT) in diagnosis and follow-up of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: The first time chest MDSCT images of 40 common type COVID-19 patients and 20 times re-examinations of MDSCT during follow-up of 15 patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The first time MDSCT showed that the distribution of lesions were mainly bilateral (36/40, 90.00%) and subpleural extramedullary (38/40, 95.00%), involved 5 lobes in 28 cases (28/40, 70.00%), which were patchy, flaky and irregular shaped in 36 cases (36/40, 90.00%). Among 40 patients, 16 cases were in the early stage, 24 cases of the progressive stage, no case in the dissipation stage. Early stage MDSCT showed multiple ground glass opacity (GGO) in both lungs, 18.75% (3/16) cases with thin consolidation, 31.25% (5/16) cases with obvious consolidation. All progressive stage cases were found with varying degrees of consolidation. Fifteen patients underwent MDSCT follow-up, the absorption of lesions changed from the progressive stage to the dissipated stage in 4 cases, while lesions progressed in 11 cases. Conclusion: MDSCT can be used to evaluate the changes of lung condition, which is valuable for early diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19.

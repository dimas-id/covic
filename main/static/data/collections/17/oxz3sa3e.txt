Most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are aged over 70 years old, and half of those who die are over 83 years old Older patients do not always present with typical symptoms (fever, cough and dyspnoea) but sometimes are and remain asymptomatic (contact screening), or have aspecific presentations (altered general condition, falls, delirium, unusual fatigue) Rectal swab, which minimizes exposition risk, appears useful in long-term care patients with diarrhea Older age is associated with worse prognosis, but the analysis should be refined by means of prognostic indexes that account for the heterogeneous health, functional, and cognitive status of the elderly population Gathering elderly patients' wishes and assessing their remaining life expectancy allows to anticipate care decisions according to the level of tension in the health system

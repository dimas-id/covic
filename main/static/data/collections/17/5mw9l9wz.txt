Asthma has puzzled and confused physicians from the time of Hippocrates to the present day. The word “asthma” comes from a Greek word meaning “panting” (Keeney 1964), but reference to asthma can also be found in ancient Egyptian, Hebrew, and Indian medical writings (Ellul-Micallef 1976; Unger and Harris 1974). There were clear observations of patients experiencing attacks of asthma in the second century and evidence of disordered anatomy in the lung as far back as the seventeenth century (Dring et al. 1689).

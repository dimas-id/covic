OBJECTIVE To evaluate feasibility and outcome of a laparoscopically assisted vaginal pull through procedure for suprasphincteric high urogenital sinus malformation with hydrometrocolpos and normal external genitalia. METHODS A tension-free anastomosis of the vagina to the perineum was realized after laparoscopic mobilization of the vagina, separation from the bladder neck at the confluence and pull-through via an externally introduced expandable trocar, thereby avoiding perineal or perirectal dissection. RESULTS The approach resulted in good cosmetic and unimpaired functional outcome. Voiding cystourethrography showed normal lower urinary tract anatomy. No disturbances of bladder function could be detected 2 years after surgery. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic assisted vaginal pull-through is a new approach for high UGS that significantly improved exposure of the uretro-vaginal junction, allowed extensive mobilization of the vagina and showed excellent cosmetic and functional result.

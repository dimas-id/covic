Metabolites are the essential substrates for epigenetic modification enzymes to write or erase the epigenetic blueprint in cells. Thus, the availability of nutrients and activity of metabolic pathways strongly influence the enzymatic function. Recent studies have shed light on the choreography between metabolome and epigenome in the control of immune cell differentiation and function, with a major focus on histone modifications. Yet, despite its importance in gene regulation, DNA methylation and its relationship with metabolism is relatively unclear. In this review, we will describe how the metabolic flux can influence epigenetic networks in innate and adaptive immune cells, with a focus on DNA methylation cycle and the metabolites S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and α-ketoglutarate (αKG). Future directions will be discussed for this rapidly emerging field.

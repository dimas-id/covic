There are limited data regarding outcomes of patients underwent kidney autotransplantation. This study aims to investigate outcomes of such patients. The nationwide inpatient sample database was used to identify patients underwent kidney autotransplantation during 2002 to 2012. Multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to investigate morbidity predictors. A total of 817 patients underwent kidney autotransplantation from 2002 to 2012. The most common indication of surgery was renal artery pathology (22.7%) followed by ureter pathology (17%). Overall, 97.7 per cent of operations were performed in urban teaching hospitals. The number of procedures from 2008 to 2012 were significantly higher compared with the number of them from 2002 to 2007 (473 vs 345, P < 0.01). The overall mortality and morbidity of patients were 1.3 and 46.2 per cent, respectively. The most common postoperative complications were transplanted kidney failure (10.7%) followed by hemorrhagic complications (9.7%). Obesity [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 9.62, P < 0.01], fluid and electrolyte disorders (AOR: 3.67, P < 0.01), and preoperative chronic kidney disease (AOR: 1.80, P = 0.03) were predictors of morbidity in patients. In conclusion, Kidney autotransplantation is associated with low mortality but a high morbidity rate. The most common indications of kidney autotransplantation are renal artery and ureter pathologies, respectively. A kidney transplant failure rate of 10.7 per cent was observed in patients with kidney autotransplantation. The most common postoperative complication was hemorrhagic in nature.

Introduction: Few centers worldwide have advanced single-incision pediatric endosurgery (SIPES) for pediatric age group. Up to our knowledge this is the first study assessing the safety of SIPES cholecystectomy in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) done by surgical residents. Aims: To determine the feasibility, safety, and expediency of SIPES cholecystectomy in children with SCD performed by surgical residents. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of all SIPES cholecystectomies performed in our unit from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2018. We compared the outcome of SIPES cholecystectomy done by fellows and residents. SIPES Covidien 5-12 mm port was inserted through umbilicus. Long 50 cm laparoscope, straight regular instruments, and transabdominal gallbladder traction suture were used in all patients. The cystic duct and artery were identified and divided. The gallbladder is then dissected off the liver and extracted from the abdomen through the port. Results: Forty-three SCD patients underwent SIPES cholecystectomy for 7 years. Mean HbS was 37.56%. Mean age was 10 years. Twenty-four cases (56%) and 19 (44%) were performed by 8 fellows and 10 residents, respectively. Nine other procedures were done simultaneously with cholecystectomy and were excluded from the mean operative time (MOT). The MOT for all cases was 85 minutes, 78 minutes for fellows and 94 minutes for residents (P value is <.001). One extra port was inserted in 2 patients at the beginning of the series. Conclusion: SIPES cholecystectomy in children with SCD is safe and feasible if done by residents under supervision. Stepwise training is essential in this challenging surgery. Involving residents with other SIPES procedures and hands-on minimally invasive surgery single port workshops help them in improving their skills.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic. We conducted a systematic review to reveal the contribution of dermatologists in COVID-19 research. Two hundred and ninety-eight articles were included and classified into cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, operating experience against COVID-19, mechanisms and treatment of COVID-19, disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE)-related skin diseases, and other topics. The value of these articles and their impact on clinical impact were discussed and we hope that dermatologists can have a better understanding of these areas from this study.

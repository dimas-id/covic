Background and purpose: COVID-19 is an emerging viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Bacterial or fungal superinfections of the lung may cause complications in clinical manifestations, treatment, and increase the mortality rate In this article, we reviewed previous studies on invasive aspergillosis (IA) in viral infections and in adjustment with COVID-19 Also, the necessity of IA diagnosis to increase the survival rate in involved patients is discussed Materials and methods: Electronic databases, including Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, influenza, invasive aspergillosis, and invasive fungal infections Results: Reports from China showed 3 2% to 27 1% fungal co-infection in COVID-19 patients Patients with COVID-19 who developed severe pneumonia were found with considerably higher rates of viral, bacterial, and fungal co-infections than those with mild pneumonia Also, intestinal normal fungal flora was reported to be significantly different between COVID-19 patients and normal subjects Conclusion: While the main focus of physicians is on bacterial superinfection control in COVID-19, ignoring life threatening fungal infections may increase the mortality rate Therefore, we profoundly recommend early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in COVID-19 patients

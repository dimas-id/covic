This chapter includes diseases of animals in the order Rodentia, in which there are over 2000 species representing 40% of all mammals. This incredibly diverse order includes members inhabiting every continent, either naturally or in human-made environments. While rodents have been the cause or implicated in disease transmission that has lead to human pandemics, such as the Black Death, and the decimation of certain animal species, like island-dwelling birds; genetically modified rodents have contributed significantly to the advancement of biomedical research and human health. There are more than 50 species of endangered rats, mice, voles, squirrels, and marmots. The recent extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys represents the first human-induced rodent extinction linked to climate change. Rodents are the reservoir host of several human and domestic pathogens of concern listed by OIE. Herein, we highlight those diseases of rodents that lead to clinically important gross and microscopic lesions.

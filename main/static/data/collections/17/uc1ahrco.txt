With great interest we read and commend the study done by Russo and colleagues, highlighting their findings that nicotine induces an increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) and is mediated by α7-subtype nicotinic receptors (α7-nAChR) [1]. It raises the concern that all electronic nicotine-delivery systems may put users at greater risk of succumbing to COVID-19.

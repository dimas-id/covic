BACKGROUND The MERS-CoV is a novel human coronavirus causing respiratory syndrome since April 2012. The replication of MERS-CoV is mediated by ORF 1ab and viral gene activity can be modulated by RNAi approach. The inhibition of virus replication has been documented in cell culture against multiple viruses by RNAi approach. Currently, very few siRNA against MERS-CoV have been computationally designed and published. METHODS In this review, we have discussed the computational designing and delivery of potential siRNAs. Potential siRNA can be designed to silence a desired gene by considering many factors like target site, specificity, length and nucleotide content of siRNA, removal of potential off-target sites, toxicity and immunogenic responses. The efficient delivery of siRNAs into targeted cells faces many challenges like enzymatic degradation and quick clearance through renal system. The siRNA can be delivered using transfection, electroporation and viral gene transfer. Currently, siRNAs delivery has been improved by using advanced nanotechnology like lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles. CONCLUSION The efficacy of siRNA-based therapeutics has been used not only against many viral diseases but also against non-viral diseases, cancer, dominant genetic disorders, and autoimmune disease. This innovative technology has attracted researchers, academia and pharmaceuticals industries towards designing and development of highly effective and targeted disease therapy. By using this technology, effective and potential siRNAs can be designed, delivered and their efficacy with toxic effects and immunogenic responses can be tested against MERS-CoV.

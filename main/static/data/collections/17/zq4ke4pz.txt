AIM The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of diabetes and obesity on cerebral autoregulation in pregnancy. METHODS Cerebral autoregulation was evaluated in women with gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or overweight (body mass index ⩾ 25 kg m(-2)) and compared to a cohort of euglycaemic pregnant women. The autoregulation index was calculated using simultaneously recorded cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery and blood pressure. Autoregulation index values of 0 and 9 indicate absent and perfect autoregulation, respectively. RESULTS Autoregulation index in women with either diabetes (n = 33, 6.6 ± 1.1) or overweight (n = 21, 6.7 ± 0.6) was not significantly different to that in control patients (n = 23, 6.6 ± 0.8, p = 0.96). CONCLUSION Cerebral autoregulation is not impaired in pregnant women who have non-vasculopathic diabetes or overweight. This suggests that the increased risk of pre-eclampsia in diabetic and overweight women is not associated with early impaired cerebral autoregulation.

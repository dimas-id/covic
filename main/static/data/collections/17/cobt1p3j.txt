A novel bounded search transformation-based synthesis approach is presented that finds a reversible circuit implementation for a given reversible function. Methods for simplifying the circuit post-synthesis are presented. Quantum implementation constraints are also considered. Experimental results for all 2-input 3-valued functions show the effectiveness of the new approaches compared to earlier transformation-based synthesis approaches. Other examples are given to show both the effectiveness and limitations of the new approach which point to a number of key areas for further research.

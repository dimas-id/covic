Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) is a unique nucleic-acid modification possessing very high binding affinity and excellent specificity toward complementary RNA or DNA oligonucleotides. The remarkable properties exhibited by LNA oligonucleotides have been employed in different nucleic acid-based therapeutic strategies both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we highlight the applications of LNA nucleotides for controlling gene expression.

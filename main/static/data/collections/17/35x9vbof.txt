Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 in China, various measures have been adopted in order to attenuate the impact of the virus on the population. With regard to spine surgery, French physicians are devoted to take place in the national plan against COVID-19, the French Spine Surgery Society therefore decided to elaborate specific guidelines for management of spinal disorders during COVID-19 pandemic in order to prioritize management of patients. A three levels stratification was elaborated with Level I: Urgent surgical indications, Level II: Surgical indications associated to a potential loss of chance for the patient and Level III: Non-urgent surgical indications. We also report French experience in a COVID-19 cluster region illustrated by two clinical cases. We hope that the guidelines formulated by the French Spine Surgery Society and the experience of spine surgeons from a cluster region will be helpful in order optimizing the management of patients with urgent spinal conditions during the pandemic.

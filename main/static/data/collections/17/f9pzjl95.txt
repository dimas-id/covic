BACKGROUND Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) has demonstrated to be feasible and safe in the presence of very large uteri. However, it is currently difficult to establish the upper uterine weight limit for successful performance of a laparoscopic hysterectomy. CASE PRESENTATION Here we report the case of a TLH performed for a very large fibromatous uteri weighing 5320 g in a 40-year-old Caucasian woman. The surgery had no complications with an operating time of approximately 220 min. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 in very good condition. To our knowledge, the present paper is the only to describe a uterus of this size removed by laparoscopic hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS Our case demonstrates that uterine size is not a determinant for a final surgical decision to use laparoscopic hysterectomy. Therefore, if not contraindicated by the patient's comorbidities or peculiar anatomical conditions, we believe that laparoscopic hysterectomy could be performed in the presence of large uteri without hypothetical weight limits.

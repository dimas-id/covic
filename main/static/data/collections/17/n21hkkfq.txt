Eight nine-week-old specific-pathogen-free pigs which had been infected with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and four uninfected littermates were challenged with TGEV. The previous PRCV infection failed to protect them against the enteric TGEV infection. Virus excretion in faeces was detected by an ELISA in all the pigs for three to six consecutive days after inoculation. Although little diarrhoea was observed, the infection extended through much of the small intestine of one of the previously infected pigs four days after inoculation. Challenge with TGEV caused a secondary neutralising antibody response. By using a peroxidase conjugate of a monoclonal antibody which recognises a specific antigenic site on TGEV, antibodies against TGEV could be distinguished from antibodies against PRCV in an ELISA blocking test.

Abstract In its forty years history (1976â€“2016), the West African region has recorded the most devastating form of the Ebola virus disease. The sparse knowledge of healthcare professionals and general public combined with lesser responses from international community are major factors for the dissemination of the disease. In the context of this outbreak, there is a need to highlight the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists, especially in the African healthcare setting. Moreover, the prerequisite of diagnostic kits for the timely detection of the infection as well as pharmacists' awareness of the current therapeutic regimen are recommended.

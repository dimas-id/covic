Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new form of atypical pneumonia, which has become a major health crisis in East Asia and Canada, with the potential for becoming the next worldwide epidemic. Until the validation of diagnostic kits is completed, clinical findings, contact history, and radiologic findings are the key to diagnosis of this disease. The imaging findings on conventional radiographs and computed tomography (CT) in the acute phase as well as during recovery are presented.

In the present study we describe the rapid development of an attenuated live vaccine for GA08, a new serotype of infectious bronchitis virus, using a heat-treatment method. Incubation of the GA08 strain of IBV at 56 degrees C and passage in embryonated eggs was used as a method to fast track the attenuation process. The virus was incubated in a 56 degrees C water bath and aliquots were removed every 5 min for up to 1 h, and then each aliquot was inoculated into 10-day-old embryonated eggs. Virus with the longest incubation time that produced lesions in the embryos was harvested, again incubated at 56 degrees C as described and passaged in embryonated eggs. Attenuation of the virus, designated GA08/GA08HSp16/08, was verified in 1-day-old specific pathogen free chicks. A 10x dose of the vaccine was found to be safe for 2-week-old broiler chicks of commercial origin. The efficacy of the heat-treated attenuated virus was determined by vaccinating broiler chicks of commercial origin at 1 and 14 days of age intraocularly/intranasally. Vaccinated birds that were challenged with 10(4.5) median embryo infectious doses of pathogenic GA08 virus/bird at 28 days of age were protected from the disease, and challenge virus was only detected in the trachea of one of 21 birds by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction at 5 days post challenge. The attenuation process took 10 weeks to complete, which is a substantially shorter time than required to attenuate infectious bronchitis virus by serial passage in embryonated eggs without heat treatment (38 weeks or more).

Maternal and child morbidity and mortality are a major public health, development and human rights challenge globally and in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. The Region is diverse, with high-, middle- and low- income countries, many suffering from political instability, conflicts and other complex development challenges. Although progress has been made towards Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5, it has been uneven both between and within countries. This paper makes an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to improving maternal and child mortality and morbidity with a focus on the Region. In answer to the question whether we can reduce the burden of maternal and child morbidity and mortality in the Region: yes, we can. However, commitment and collaboration are needed at the country, regional and international levels.

Since human coronavirus (HCoV)-like particles were detected in the stool specimens of acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing enterocolitis children with electron microscopy, the relationship between HCoV and the pediatric gastrointestinal illness had been recognized. In recent years, the overall detection rates have been low and have varied by region. HCoVs have not been considered as the major pathogens in pediatric acute gastroenteritis. HCoVs detected in children with acute gastroenteritis have included 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have also been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in children. Although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route, it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between HCoVs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases. Furthermore, pathological features have not been clear. Till now, our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is limited. However, diarrhea and vomiting have been seen in pediatric cases, particularly in newborns and infants. It has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection.

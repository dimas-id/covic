Two trials separately measured the bioavailability and impact on inflammation of a supplement taken daily containing 510 mg Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 344 mg Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 1000 IU of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D; 25(OH)D), for healthy and Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) populations. Both trials were double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled with cross-over. Participants were randomly allocated to groups A (placebo then supplement) or B (supplement then placebo). Both included a washout. Fatty acid (N-3 PUFAs) and vitamin D serum levels, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and stool calprotectin were measured before and after each treatment period. Outcome measures were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models, including terms for treatment, period, and a treatment-by-period interaction. The supplement significantly increased serum levels in healthy and CD groups for EPA (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), Docosapentaenoic acid (p < 0.001 and 0.005), DHA (p < 0.001 and 0.006), the omega-3 index (p < 0.001 and 0.001), and (vitamin D (p < 0.001 and 0.027). CRP and calprotectin measures showed no evidence of a treatment effect on inflammation; however, model estimation was imprecise for both outcomes, hence further research is required to elucidate potential inflammation effects. The nutrient supplement increased serum levels of key N-3 PUFAs and vitamin D in both populations, showing the preparation was readily bioavailable.

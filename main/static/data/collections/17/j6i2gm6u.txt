In the study, the effect of the TLR4 agonist Immunomax was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In particular, Immunomax was shown to polarize mouse bone marrow macrophages from the M0 and M2 states into the M1 state (ARG1 and iNOS mRNA expression levels were used to identify the mouse M1 and M2 phenotypes). Next, we investigated the prophylactic antiviral effect of Immunomax in both a model of mouse respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and a model of RSV-induced bronchial asthma (BA) exacerbation. In the experiment with RSV-induced BA exacerbation, Immunomax-treated mice were characterized by a significant decrease of the viral load in lung homogenates, an increased amount of M1 macrophages in the lung, a tendency toward Th2-dependent ovalbumin-specific IgG1 antibodies decrease in blood serum, a significant increase in RSV-activated CD4+ T cells secreting IFNÎ³ (Th1 cells), and a simultaneous significant decrease in the amount of CD4(+) cells secreting IL-4 (Th2 cells) in the mouse spleen, which were detected by ELISPOT 1.5 months after experiment. These findings suggest that treatment with the TLR4 agonist Immunomax polarizes the immune response towards antiviral Th1 and may be used for short-term antiviral prophylaxis to prevent acute respiratory viral infections in asthmatics.

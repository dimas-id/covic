The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests developed by Charite (Germany), HKU (Hong-Kong), China CDC (China), US CDC (United-States), and Institut Pasteur, Paris (France) was assessed on SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatants and clinical samples. Although all RT-PCR assays performed well for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RdRp Institut Pasteur (IP2, IP4), N China CDC, and N1 US CDC were found to be the most sensitive.

To systematically review studies of managing meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) with azithromycin and pool clinical outcomes to show its effectiveness. Eligible studies were retrieved from five main electronic databases. Symptom score was the primary outcome, while clinical signs and objective measurements were secondary outcomes. Pooled rates for adverse events were also calculated. Improvements in each outcome after administering either oral azithromycin (OA) or topical azithromycin (TA) were pooled and measured by standard mean difference (SMD) to show the overall effectiveness. Then the effectiveness was sub-grouped by TA and OA. In addition, pooled outcomes after administering TA and oral doxycycline (OD) were compared with assess their effectiveness. Finally, 18 eligible studies were included. The overall pooled symptom scores were significantly reduced after administering both TA and OA [P < 0.0001; SMD = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.15-1.92)]. Similarly, the overall combined eyelid signs, plugging of the meibomian gland, meibum quality, and tear secretion were also distinctly improved. However, significant improvements for tear break-up time (TBUT) and corneal staining (CS) were achieved by TA (TBUT: P = 0.02; CS: P = 0.02) but not by OA (TBUT: P = 0.08; CS: P = 0.14). The pooled adverse event rates for TA and OA were 25% and 7%, respectively. Moreover, TA was comparable to OD to treat MGD regarding symptom score, TBUT and tear secretion. This study showed that MGD could be treated effectively with oral or topical azithromycin by improving symptoms, clinical signs, and stabilization of tear film. Topical azithromycin seemed to be superior over oral azithromycin or doxycycline in improving the quality of tear film in the short term.

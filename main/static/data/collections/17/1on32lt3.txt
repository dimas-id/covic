BACKGROUND Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other viruses remain occupational risks for both surgeons and patients in the operating room environment. In the past, this concern attracted great attention, but recently, this subject has been given much less attention. METHODS Review of the literature over the past 50 years on occupational risks of viral infection in the operating room. RESULTS Transmission of HIV still looms as a potential pathogen in the operating room, but no case has been documented in the United States. Infection with HBV can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine. Chronic HCV infection is present in more than three million U.S. residents and remains a risk that can be managed only by adhering to strict infection control practices and avoiding blood exposure. CONCLUSIONS The risks of viral infection in the operating room remain the same as a decade ago even though attention to this issue has waned. The avoidance of blood exposure to prevent transmission of both known and unknown blood-borne pathogens continues to be a goal for all surgeons.

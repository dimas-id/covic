On the cell sur “face”, sialoglycoconjugates act as receptionists that have an important role in the first step of various cellular processes that bridge communication between the cell and its environment. Loss of Sia production can cause the developmental of defects and lethality in most animals; hence, animal cells are less prone to evolution of resistance to interactions by rapidly evolved Sia-binding viruses. Obligative intracellular viruses mostly have rapid evolution that allows escape from host immunity, leading to an epidemic variant, and that allows emergence of a novel strain, occasionally leading to pandemics that cause health-social-economic problems. Recently, much attention has been given to the mutual recognition systems via sialosugar chains between viruses and their host cells and there has been rapid growth of the research field “sialoglycovirology.” In this chapter, the structural diversity of sialoglycoconjugates is overviewed, and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses that bind to Sia are reviewed. Also, interactions of viral lectins-host Sia receptors, which determine viral transmission, host range, and pathogenesis, are presented. The future direction of new therapeutic routes targeting viral lectins, development of easy-to-use detection methods for diagnosis and monitoring changes in virus binding specificity, and challenges in the development of suitable viruses to use in virus-based therapies for genetic disorders and cancer are discussed.

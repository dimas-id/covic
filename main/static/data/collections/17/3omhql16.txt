Brazil has become the epicenter for COVID-19 cases worldwide, after the United States, with more than 500 000 cases and almost 30 000 deaths as of June 1, 2020.[1] This pandemic has resulted in the need to modify all hospitals to be adapted for receiving patients with severe cases of COVID-19. In many institutions, postgraduate residents have experienced an interruption of their ordinary activities. Brazil is a vast country, with many structural inequalities and a postgraduate medical residency program sponsored within the public health system.

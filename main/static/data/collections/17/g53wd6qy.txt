Systemic vasculitides represent uncommon conditions characterized by the inflammation of blood vessels that can lead to different complex disorders limited to one organ or potentially involving multiple organs and systems. Systemic vasculitides are classified according to the diameter of the vessel that they mainly affect (small, medium, large, or variable). The pathogenetic mechanisms of systemic vasculitides are still partly unknown, as well as their genetic basis. For most of the primary systemic vasculitides, a single gold standard test is not available, and diagnosis is often made after having ruled out other mimicking conditions. Current research has focused on new management protocol and therapeutic strategies aimed at improving long-term patient outcomes and avoiding progression to multiorgan failure with irreversible damage. In this narrative review, authors describe different forms of systemic vasculitides through a review of the literature, with the aim of highlighting the current knowledge and recent findings on etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy.

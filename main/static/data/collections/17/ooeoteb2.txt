Increasing international trade in poultry meat presents an opportunity for the global dissemination of poultry disease. However, it would be very unfortunate if expanding world trade resulted in animal diseases being used as unjustified non-tariff trade barriers. For those avian diseases currently listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health, the current evidence suggests that only highly pathogenic avian influenza, Newcastle disease, and (for chicken meat) infectious bursal disease should be considered likely to be spread though trade in this commodity.

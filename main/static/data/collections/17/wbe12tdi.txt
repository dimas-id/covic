INTRODUCTION In 2008, we initiated the first Guyanese comprehensive kidney replacement program, comprising hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), vascular access procedures, and living-donor kidney transplantation. The government of Guyana, US-based philanthropists, US-based physicians, and Guyanese caregivers teamed up to form a public-private partnership. This pilot program was free of cost to the patients. METHODS From July 2010 to the time of writing, we placed 17 patients with end-stage kidney disease on PD, which was used as a bridge to living-donor kidney transplantation. During the same period, we placed 12 primary arteriovenous fistulae. RESULTS The 17 patients who received a PD catheter had a mean age of 43.6 years and a mean follow-up of 5.3 months. In that group, 2 deaths occurred (from multi-organ failure) within 2 weeks of catheter placement, and 2 patients were switched to HD because of inadequate clearance. Technical issues were noted in 2 patients, and 3 patients developed peritonitis (treated with intravenous antibiotics). An exit-site abscess in 1 patient was drained under local anesthesia. The peritonitis rate was 0.36 episodes per patient-year. Of the 17 patients who received PD, 4 underwent living-donor kidney transplantation. CONCLUSIONS In Guyana, PD is a safe and cost-effective option; it may be equally suitable for similar developing countries. In Guyana, PD was used as a bridge to living-donor kidney transplantation. We have been able to sustain this program since 2008 by making incremental gains and nurturing the ongoing public-private partnership.

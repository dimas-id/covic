The River Coquet is a clean, fast flowing, moderately calcareous river. It is young to mature in development and supports a typical torrential fauna. Marked trends in successional replacement along the river course are confined to the scarce species of Ephemeroptera and the absence of longitudinal zonation in the distribution of some common species is related to the topographical characteristics of the system. A distinct successional trend by one species is attributed to its intolerance to the lower temperatures at high altitudes. Major discontinuities in distribution are found between the Ephemeroptera of the main river and certain tributaries. The paucity of certain otherwise abundant species in one region is related to silt deposition resulting from sand and gravel excavation.

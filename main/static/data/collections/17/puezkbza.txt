Most pediatric neck masses encountered in primary care are benign, reactive lymph nodes that originate from common pediatric viral processes. In a pediatric otolaryngology practice, more unusual pathologies are encountered, such as embryologic anomalies, vascular lesions, or neoplasms. Lesions that are larger or that have concerning features will ultimately need imaging and excisional biopsy for histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis. A sound clinician understanding of anatomic neck spaces and common etiologies of pediatric neck masses can greatly reduce nonessential testing, cost, delay in treatment, and parental angst.

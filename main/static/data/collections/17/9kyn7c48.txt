Although vaginal reconstructions with intestinal segments require particularly complex surgical procedures, this technique has become popular with respect to fairly good functional and esthetic outcomes. This study describes cases of vaginal reconstruction performed using a modified rectosigmoid colon held in an ischemic state in order to reduce secretion and denervated in order to prevent defecation problems. Vaginal reconstructions with rectosigmoid colon were performed on 43 patients. In this retrospective study, 34 patients had Müllerian agenesis, while nine had undergone male to female sex reassignment surgery in which adequate vaginal depth had not been achieved. A rectosigmoid colon with its vascular pedicle was used and left in an ischemic state. All nerve structures within the pedicle were excised intraoperatively. Follow-up period was between 12 and 60 months. Partial necrosis occurred in one patient which was reconstructed with local flap. Hematoma developed beneath the skin incision in two cases, but resolved with conservative treatment. A good esthetic outcome was achieved in all cases. Sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) in 15 patients. Fourteen out of 15 patients scored above 26.5 on this scale and were determined as having no sexual dysfunction (FSFI score ≥26.5). In conclusion, vaginal reconstruction with denervated rectosigmoid held in an ischemic state appears to be a reasonable option among several available reconstruction techniques.

The interactions between humans and their environment, comprising living and non-living entities, can be studied via Social Network Analysis (SNA). Node classification, as well as community detection tasks, are still open research problems in SNA. Hence, SNA has become an interesting and appealing domain in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Immanent facts about social network structures can be effectively harnessed for training AI models in a bid to solve node classification and community detection problems in SNA. Hence, crucial aspects such as the individual attributes of spatial social actors, and the underlying patterns of relationship binding these social actors must be taken into consideration in the course of analyzing the social network. These factors determine the nature and dynamics of a given social network. In this paper, we have proposed a unique framework, Representation Learning via Knowledge-Graph Embeddings and ConvNet (RLVECN), for studying and extracting meaningful facts from social network structures to aid in node classification as well as community detection tasks. Our proposition utilizes an edge sampling approach for exploiting features of the social graph, via learning the context of each actor with respect to neighboring actors/nodes, with the goal of generating vector-space embedding per actor. Successively, these relatively low-dimensional vector embeddings are fed as input features to a downstream classifier for classification tasks about the social graph/network. Herein RLVECN has been trained, tested, and evaluated on real-world social networks.

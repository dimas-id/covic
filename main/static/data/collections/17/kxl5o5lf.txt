During the latest years, a number of studies have confirmed the benefits of perioperative haemodynamic optimisation on surgical mortality and postoperative complication rate. This process requires the use of advanced haemodynamic monitoring with the purpose of guiding therapies to reach predefined goals. This review aim to present recent evidence on perioperative goal directed therapy (GDT), with an emphasis in some aspects that may merit further investigation. In order to maximise the benefits on outcomes, GDT must be implemented as early as possible; intravascular volume optimisation should be in accordance with the response of the preload-reserve, goals should be individualised and adequacy of the intervention must be also assessed; non-invasive or minimally invasive monitoring should be used and, finally, side effects of every therapy should be taken into account in order to avoid undesired complications. New drugs and technologies, particularly those exploring the venous side of the circulation, may improve in the future the effectiveness and facilitate the implementation of this group of therapeutic interventions.

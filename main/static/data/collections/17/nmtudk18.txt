The phenomenon of suicide is a much studied but still little-known issue. In this particular period of health emergency, quarantine and mandatory restrictions could play a role in the genesis of fatal events or suicide attempts not only in people at risk. However, this issue has not yet been adequately addressed in the literature. The influence of the global pandemic could change the way suicide cases are analyzed; in the future, it is necessary to reconsider and analyze the various risk groups by population but above all to evaluate new methods of intervention for avoiding the increase in fatal events related to the current emergency whose duration is still unknown.

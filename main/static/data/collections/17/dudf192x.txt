Summary According to previous reports, diabetes seems to be associated with serious clinical events due to COVID-19. But is diabetes per se a risk factor of being infected by the virus? We discuss these points. Data about the antidiabetic drugs are scarce. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) is found as both a cell surface protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and as a soluble molecule found in serum/plasma, fluids. DPP-4 is involved in infection of cells by some viruses. We relate data about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in diabetic patients. We conclude relating French and international recommendations in people with diabetes.

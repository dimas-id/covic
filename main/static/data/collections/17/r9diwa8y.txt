Summary: Interactive examination of RNA multiple alignments for covariant mutations is a useful step in non-coding RNA sequence analysis. We present three parallel implementations of an RNA visualization metaphor: Colorstock, a command-line script using ANSI terminal color; SScolor, a Perl script that generates static HTML pages; and Ratón, an AJAX web application generating dynamic HTML. Each tool can be used to color RNA alignments by secondary structure and to visually highlight compensatory mutations in stems. Availability: All source code is freely available under the GPL. The source code can be downloaded and a prototype of Ratón can be accessed at http://biowiki.org/RnaAlignmentViewers Contact: ihh@berkeley.edu

Previous reports of COVID-19 among US children have been based on health jurisdiction reporting. We performed SARS-CoV-2 testing on children enrolled in active, prospective, multi-center surveillance during January-March, 2020. Among 3187 children, only 4 (0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were identified March 20-31 despite evidence of rising community circulation.

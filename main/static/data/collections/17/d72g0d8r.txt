With technological advancement and increasing skill in minimal access surgery, laparoscopic myomectomy is increasingly performed for the management of symptomatic fibroids in appropriately selected women. We present a series of 125 consecutive laparoscopic myomectomies to assess whether the number, size and location of fibroids affect the length of hospital stay. Total of 462 myomas were removed from 125 patients. The mean size of fibroids removed was 7.6 cm and the mean number of fibroids was 3.69. None of our patients had major intraoperative complication involving bladder or bowel. Our laparotomy conversion rate was 1.6% (2 out of 125). There was no significant difference based on size, number or weight of fibroids removed in relation to the day of discharge in our series. We conclude that the size and number of fibroids removed do not affect the day of discharge.

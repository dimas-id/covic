The study of epidemic spreading in complex networks is currently a hot topic and a large body of results have been achieved. In this paper, we briefly review our contributions to this field, which includes the underlying mechanism of rumor propagation, the epidemic spreading in community networks, the influence of varying topology, and the influence of mobility of agents. Also, some future directions are pointed out.

The corona pandemic has caused a serious emergency also in the Federal Republic of Germany; shortages of medical capacities and failure of critical infrastructures may occur resulting in a pandemic catastrophe. German laws prescribe various mechanisms for disaster preparedness and disaster response. Nevertheless, both authorities and physicians will have to make difficult ethical and legal decisions. In the event of lack of resources (e. g. vaccines or ventilation capacity), conflict-laden selection decisions must be made. The regulations on pandemic preparedness need to be reviewed: preparing for the response to pandemics must be a clear and legally binding task and responsibility of all state and private agents involved. Here, among other things, planning, training, exercises and stockpiling are crucial elements of being prepared to deal with a pandemic.

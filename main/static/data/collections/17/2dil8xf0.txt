Abstract Wheeze in preschool children (5 years of age and younger) is common. The majority of severe episodes are triggered by viral colds. Unlike atopic asthma in adults and young people, the underlying pathology of this condition is poorly understood, and the label of “preschool wheeze” should therefore not be regarded as a diagnosis but a description of symptoms. It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children. Some trials suggest that preemptive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroids. Since wheeze is intermittent for the majority of children, preemptive therapy is a logical approach. However, more studies are needed to confirm whether preemptive inhaled corticosteroids are as, or more, effective than regular preventer therapy.

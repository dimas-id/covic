ABSTRACT Emerging studies on radiological findings in COVID-19 patients report a high incidence of bilateral lung involvement, with GGOs imaging being the most common pattern on CT. Cystic lesions, such as pneumatoceles, are rare, although they may occur in 10% of cases. Cyst formation may be explained by a focal pulmonary trauma due to mechanical ventilation and/or infection-related damage to the alveolar walls leading to pneumatoceles. The superinfection of pneumatoceles is a potential life-threating condition for which no standardized therapeutic algorithm has been accepted. We report a case of a COVID-19 patient successfully treated by lung resections for infected pneumatoceles.

As a community member of the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project Advisory Board, I wish to acknowledge the group for its work, but to make clear there is much more to be done. While the state’s data show more parity across departments, we know that unconscious bias and racism still exists. I wish to advocate for the committee’s work to focus on answering three new questions. 1. How does the community feel about its relationship with the police? 2. How do those who are stopped by the police feel about their experience? 3. To what extent do the police understand the principles of unconscious bias, racism, and trauma-informed policing? How effectively do they use that knowledge to help work with communities in policing?

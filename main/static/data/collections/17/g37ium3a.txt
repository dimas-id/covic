Assays to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can display a high proportion of false-positive results if the frequency of the disease in the general population is low. Testing is not suitable for proving or ruling out an acute infection. Judging an individual patient, a positive antibody titer does not necessarily mean that this person is immune. Currently ELISA assays are not appropriate for individual screening purposes but possibly can complement diagnostic procedures. They are suitable for population-based screening in the context of studies.

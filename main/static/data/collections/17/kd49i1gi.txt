Poliovirus interactions with host cells were investigated by studying the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes at the 3' end of poliovirus negative-strand RNA which are presumed to be involved in viral RNA synthesis. It was previously shown that two host cell proteins with molecular masses of 36 and 38 kDa bind to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA at approximately 3 to 4 h after infection. We tested the hypothesis that preexisting cellular proteins are modified during the course of infection and are subsequently recruited to play a role in viral replication. It was demonstrated that the 38-kDa protein, either directly or indirectly, is the product of processing by poliovirus 3CD/3C proteinase. Only the modified 38-kDa protein, not its precursor protein, has a high affinity for binding to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA. This modification depends on proteolytically active proteinase, and a direct correlation between the levels of 3CD proteinase and the 38-kDa protein was demonstrated in infected tissue culture cells. The nucleotide (nt) 5-10 region (positive-strand numbers) of poliovirus negative-strand RNA is important for binding of the 38-kDa protein. Deletion of the nt 5-10 region in full-length, positive-strand RNA renders the RNA noninfectious in transfection experiments. These results suggest that poliovirus 3CD/3C proteinase processes a cellular protein which then plays an essential role during the viral life cycle.

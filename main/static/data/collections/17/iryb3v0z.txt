BACKGROUND: Patients with influenza complicated with pneumonia are at high risk of rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prone positioning with longer duration and lung-protective strategies might reduce the mortality level in ARDS. The aim of this study is to investigate the survival predictors of prone positioning in patients with ARDS caused by influenza pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted by eight tertiary referral centers in Taiwan. From January 1 to March 31 in 2016, all of the patients in intensive care units with virology-proven influenza pneumonia were collected, while all of those patients with ARDS and receiving prone positioning were enrolled. Demographic data, laboratory examinations, management records, ventilator settings and clinical outcomes were collected for analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 336 patients with severe influenza pneumonia were screened and 263 patients met the diagnosis of ARDS. Totally, 65 patients receiving prone positioning were included for analysis. The 60-day survivors had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, pneumonia severity index (PSI), creatinine level and lower rate of receiving renal replacement therapy than non-survivors (22.4 ± 8.5 vs. 29.2 ± 7.4, p = 0.003; 106.6 ± 40.9 vs. 135.3 ± 48.6, p = 0.019; 1.2 ± 0.9 mg/dL vs. 3.1 ± 3.6 mg/dL, p = 0.040; and 4% vs. 42%, p < 0.005). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified PSI (hazard ratio 1.020, 95% confidence interval 1.009–1.032; p < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (hazard ratio 6.248, 95% confidence interval 2.245–17.389; p < 0.001), and increase in dynamic driving pressure (hazard ratio 1.372, 95% confidence interval 1.095–1.718; p = 0.006) which were independent predictors associated with 60-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, in evaluating the effect of prone positioning in patients with influenza pneumonia-related ARDS, pneumonia severity index, renal replacement therapy and increase in dynamic driving pressure were associated with 60-day mortality in patients with influenza pneumonia-related ARDS receiving prone positioning.

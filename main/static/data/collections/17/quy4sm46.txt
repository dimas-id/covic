Publisher Summary This chapter illustrates the recommendations and guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) concerning water, sanitation, and health. The recommendations and guidelines are evaluated in the light of disease caused by human pathogenic viruses. The guidelines outline a preventive management framework for safe drinking water. The framework includes health-based targets to assist national authorities who are normally responsible to set the targets for the protection of public health from risks by exposure to drinking water. Assessing the adequacy of systems, defining and monitoring control measures, and establishing management plans are the three components of the so-called water safety plans. Achievement of health-based targets may be verified by independent surveillance to assess the safety of the drinking water through additional verification or audit-based approaches. This framework for safe drinking water can be adapted according to environmental, social, economic, and cultural circumstances of drinking water provision on the national, regional, and local level. The chapter concludes that viruses could be considered as biocolloids with specific properties such as size, shape, structure, charge, composition, and genome. These viral characteristics determine their behavior in the environment, resistance to natural inactivation and treatment, and disinfection processes. For each (re-)emerging virus these properties may be known or could be assessed predicting the effectiveness of possible intervention measures for prevention of waterborne disease.

BACKGROUND Introduction of the full-thickness resection device (FTRD) has allowed endoscopic resection of difficult lesions such as those with deep wall origin/infiltration or those located in difficult anatomic locations. The aim of this study is to assess the outcomes of the FTRD among its early users in the USA. METHODS Patients who underwent endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) for lower gastrointestinal tract lesions using the FTRD at 26 US tertiary care centers between 10/2017 and 12/2018 were included. Primary outcome was R0 resection rate. Secondary outcomes included rate of technical success (en bloc resection), achievement of histologic full-thickness resection (FTR), and adverse events (AE). RESULTS A total of 95 patients (mean age 65.5 ± 12.6 year, 38.9% F) were included. The most common indication, for use of FTRD, was resection of difficult adenomas (non-lifting, recurrent, residual, or involving appendiceal orifice/diverticular opening) (66.3%), followed by adenocarcinomas (22.1%), and subepithelial tumors (SET) (11.6%). Lesions were located in the proximal colon (61.1%), distal colon (18.9%), or rectum (20%). Mean lesion diameter was 15.5 ± 6.4 mm and 61.1% had a prior resection attempt. The mean total procedure time was 59.7 ± 31.8 min. R0 resection was achieved in 82.7% while technical success was achieved in 84.2%. Histologically FTR was demonstrated in 88.1% of patients. There were five clinical AE (5.3%) with 2 (2.1%) requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS Results from this first US multicenter study suggest that EFTR with the FTRD is a technically feasible, safe, and effective technique for resecting difficult colonic lesions.

SARS‐CoV‐2 has infected over 170,000 people worldwide and was associated with substantial mortality. Previous studies have reported that the SARS‐CoV‐2 could be detected in sputum, faeces, urine and other specimens from COVID‐19 patients. In the case report, the novel coronavirus was found in the bile specimen from a patient with severe COVID‐19 by real‐time fluorescent RT‐PCR. In addition, much higher viral load in the bile juice than in the sputum indicated that a false positive error in the specimen was hardly possible. As far as we know, it is the first report about SARS‐CoV‐2 in the bile juice. We would love to share the information to other researchers. The report may have a significant impact on the clinical management and public health decision making. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

A major infectious disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019-nCoV)has emerged in Wuhan, China. Current clinical studies have shown that diabetes is commonly complicated with this disorder. Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for severe infection, and also an independent risk factor for the progression of mild infection to severe infection. This may be related to the immune deficiency of diabetics. Besides, virus may cause direct damage to the islets and induce acute stress hyperglycemia. Special attention should be payed to diabetics with 2019-nCoV infection. Systemic steroid hormones should be used with particular caution in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, especially those with diabetes.

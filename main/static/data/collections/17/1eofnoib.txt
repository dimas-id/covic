BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Efficient and timely recanalization is an important goal in acute stroke endovascular therapy. Several studies demonstrated improved recanalization and clinical outcomes with the stent retriever devices compared with the Merci device. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of the balloon guide catheter (BGC) and recanalization success in a substudy of the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry. METHODS The investigator-initiated NASA registry recruited 24 clinical sites within North America to submit demographic, clinical, site-adjudicated angiographic, and clinical outcome data on consecutive patients treated with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device. BGC use was at the discretion of the treating physicians. RESULTS There were 354 patients included in the NASA registry. BGC data were reported in 338 of 354 patients in this subanalysis, of which 149 (44%) had placement of a BGC. Mean age was 67.3±15.2 years, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18. Patients with BGC had more hypertension (82.4% versus 72.5%; P=0.05), atrial fibrillation (50.3% versus 32.8%; P=0.001), and were more commonly administered tissue plasminogen activator (51.6% versus 38.8%; P=0.02) compared with patients without BGC. Time from symptom onset to groin puncture and number of passes were similar between the 2 groups. Procedure time was shorter in patients with BGC (120±28.5 versus 161±35.6 minutes; P=0.02), and less adjunctive therapy was used in patients with BGC (20% versus 28.6%; P=0.05). Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 reperfusion scores were higher in patients with BGC (53.7% versus 32.5%; P<0.001). Distal emboli and emboli in new territory were similar between the 2 groups. Discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (mean, 12±14.5 versus 17.5±16; P=0.002) and good clinical outcome at 3 months were superior in patients with BGC compared with patients without (51.6% versus 35.8%; P=0.02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of BGC was an independent predictor of good clinical outcome (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.9). CONCLUSIONS Use of a BGC with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device resulted in superior revascularization results, faster procedure times, decreased need for adjunctive therapy, and improved clinical outcome.

Rapid and low-cost diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to identify the infected subjects, particularly the asymptomatic cases, primarily to arrest the spread of the disease through local transmission. Antibody-based chromatographic serological tests, as an alternative to RT-PCR, offer only limited help due to high false positives. We propose to exploit our field-deployable/portable plasmonic fiber-optic absorbance biosensor (P-FAB) platform for one-step, wash-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles directly in saliva sample with minimal sample pre-processing.

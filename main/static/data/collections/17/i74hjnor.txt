In this paper we introduce a fusion framework for image tampering localization, that moves towards overcoming the limitation of available tools by allowing a synergistic analysis and multiperspective refinement of the final forensic report. The framework is designed to combine multiple state-of-the-art techniques by exploiting their complementarities so as to produce a single refined tampering localization output map. Extensive evaluation experiments of state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets have resulted in a modular framework design where candidate methods go through a multi-criterion selection process to become part of the framework. Currently, this includes a set of five passive tampering localization methods for splicing localization on JPEG images. Our experimental findings on two different benchmark datasets showcase that the fused output achieves high performance and advanced interpretability by managing to leverage the correctly localized outputs of individual methods, and even detecting cases that were missed by all individual methods.

Patients on anticoagulant treatment are constantly increasing, with an estimated prevalence in Italy of 2% of the total population. The recent spreadout of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a re-organization of Anticoagulation Clinics to prevent person-to-person viral diffusion and continue to offer the highest possible quality of assistance to patients. In this paper, based on the Italian Federation of Anticoagulation Clinics statements, we offer some advice aimed at improving patient care during COVID-19 pandemic, with particular regard to the lockdown and reopening periods. We give practical guidance regarding the following points: (1) re-thinking the AC organization, (2) managing patients on anticoagulants when they become infected by the virus, (3) managing anticoagulation surveillance in non-infected patients during the lockdown period, and (4) organizing the activities during the reopening phases.

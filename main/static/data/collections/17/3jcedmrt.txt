Reports from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China identified older age as a predictor of severity and mortality [1] A retrospective analysis of individual case data from China and elsewhere showed a very strong age gradient in the infection fatality ratio (IFR) and case fatality ratio (CFR) [2] In France, as at 15 March 2020, people older than 75 years accounted for 20% of the confirmed cases but 79% of the deaths [3] Cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the comorbidities most frequently associated with COVID-19, and many patients died of their original comorbidities [4,5] All these comorbidities are highly common among dependent elderly people housed in institutions Using simple calculation, we present here the impact of several worst-case scenarios in French institutions Potential number of deathsGo to section We studied different scenarios to simulate the potential death toll of an outbreak of COVID-19 in the French institutions in the absence of mitigation measures We extracted the age structure of residents from 40 “Habitat et Humanisme” institutions for dependent elderly people In France, at the end of 2017, 766,400 people above 60 years of age were housed in retirement homes for dependent elderly people, in long-term care facilities or received home-based care [6] While the calculation of IFR is based on the proportion of all infected cases, i e a precise estimation of the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, we restricted our analysis to CFR The CFR, estimated from China and elsewhere, for 60–69 year-olds, 70–79 year-olds and those 80 years and older were, respectively, 3 6%, 8 0% and 14 8% [2] We applied the hypothesis that 30–50% of the institutions were infected, a final attack rate (AR) of 30–50% among the residents and applying age-specific fatality ratios, with their confidence intervals (CI), from [2] By the time the epidemic is over, the resulting death toll in these institutions could be equal to the yearly national death toll caused by seasonal influenza in those older than above 65 years (9,025 deaths on average between 2000 and 2009) or it could largely exceed that figure, depending on the final AR and the proportion of infected institutions (Table) [7] Among this frail population, part of this excess in mortality may be due to the acceleration of underlying unavoidable process and another part directly attributable to the infection

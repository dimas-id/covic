African horse sickness (AHS) is a devastating disease caused by African horse sickness virus (AHSV) and transmitted by arthropods between its equine hosts. AHSV is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, where polyvalent live attenuated vaccine is in use even though it is associated with safety risks. This review article summarizes and compares new strategies to generate safe and effective AHSV vaccines based on protein, virus like particles, viral vectors and reverse genetics technology. Manipulating the AHSV genome to generate synthetic viruses by means of reverse genetic systems has led to the generation of potential safe vaccine candidates that are under investigation.

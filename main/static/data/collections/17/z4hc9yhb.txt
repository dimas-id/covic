Abstract The inhibition of viral targets might provide new therapies for coronavirus disease abbreviated as COVID-19. The rational drug design identified as much of the recent discoveries of potent drugs molecule against any targets. This results in an improvement in bindings for better potency and selectivity. The drugs containing ethanolamine/propylamine fragments along with heterocycles have shown potential antiviral results. Similarly, there is the possibility of controlling the COVID-19 infection by nucleotide analogues. Here we also highlight drugs ACEIs/ARBs inhibitory discussing both their advantages and disadvantages. The class of compounds/antibodies inhibiting interleukin-6 works in antirheumatoid drugs are found useful in alleviating overactive inflammatory responses in the lungs of the patient. These inclusion based approaches counter some of the side-effects associated with the heterocycles and also potentiate the efficacy of the molecules. In this review article, design strategies for some of the drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2 are represented. The review also focuses on the listing of drugs that are currently testing under clinical trials for the COVID-19 virus with their mechanism of action. This conversation undertakes the opportunity to do a bit for the newer researchers working in this arena.

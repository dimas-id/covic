The new 2-aminomethylphenol, JPC-3210, has potent in vitro antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum lines, low cytotoxicity, and high in vivo efficacy against murine malaria. Here we report on the pharmacokinetics of JPC-3210 in mice and monkeys and the results of in vitro screening assays, including the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes. In mice, JPC-3210 was rapidly absorbed and had an extensive tissue distribution, with a brain tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of about 5.4. JPC-3210 had a lengthy plasma elimination half-life of about 4.5 days in mice and 11.8 days in monkeys. JPC-3210 exhibited linear single-oral-dose pharmacokinetics across the dose range of 5 to 40 mg/kg of body weight with high oral bioavailability (âˆ¼86%) in mice. Systemic blood exposure of JPC-3210 was 16.6% higher in P. berghei-infected mice than in healthy mice. In vitro studies with mice and human hepatocytes revealed little metabolism and the high metabolic stability of JPC-3210. The abundance of human metabolites from oxidation and glucuronidation was 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively. CYP450 studies in human liver microsomes showed JPC-3210 to be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 isozymes, suggesting the possibility of a metabolic drug-drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by these isozymes. In vitro studies showed that JPC-3210 is highly protein bound to human plasma (97%). These desirable pharmacological findings of a lengthy blood elimination half-life, high oral bioavailability, and low metabolism as well as high in vivo potency have led the Medicines for Malaria Venture to select JPC-3210 (MMV892646) for further advanced preclinical development.

The diverse forms and functions of cellular organelles are, presumably, a consequence of their particular molecular compositions. The generation and maintenance of this diversity is achieved by the targeting of newly synthesized proteins to specific locations and their subsequent retention there. Sequences that retain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been identified at the C-termini of resident ER proteins, where they are readily accessible to potential receptors. By contrast, recent results have demonstrated that retention of proteins in the Golgi complex involves sequences located within transmembrane domains. This suggests the novel possibility that the membrane composition of the Golgi complex plays a role in retention of resident Golgi proteins.

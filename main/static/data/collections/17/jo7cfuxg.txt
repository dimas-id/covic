The availability of intensive care beds during the Covid-19 epidemic is crucial to guarantee the best possible treatment to severely affected patients. In this work we show a simple strategy for short-term prediction of Covid-19 ICU beds, that has proved very effective during the Italian outbreak in February to May 2020. Our approach is based on an optimal ensemble of two simple methods: a generalized linear mixed regression model which pools information over different areas, and an area-specific non-stationary integer autoregressive methodology. Optimal weights are estimated using a leave-last-out rationale. The approach has been set up and validated during the epidemic in Italy. A report of its performance for predicting ICU occupancy at Regional level is included.

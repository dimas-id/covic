Two new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayes (ELISA) for the diagnosis ofBabesia bovis in cattle are described. The ELISA using a native antigen is more sensitive and less laborious than the assays described previously, because it does not require adsorption of sera with bovine erythrocytes. The second ELISA, using a recombinantB. bovis antigen expressed inEscherichia coli, was both sensitive and specific. It is suitable to replace the native antigen, thus avoiding large batch-to-batch variations in antigen preparations and the need to sacrifice experimental cattle.

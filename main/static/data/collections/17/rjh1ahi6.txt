Heart arrhythmia is a severe heart problem. Automated heartbeat classification provides a cost-effective screening for heart arrhythmia and allows at-risk patients to receive timely treatments, which is a highly demanded but challenging task. Recent works have brought visible improvements to this area, but to identify the problematic supraventricular ectopic (S-type) heartbeats is still a bottleneck in most existing studies. This paper presents a two-step DNN-based framework to identify arrhythmia-related heartbeats. In the first step, a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) is proposed to classify all heartbeat classes, except for the normal and S-type heartbeats. In the second stage, a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM) is specially designed to distinguish S-type heartbeats from the normal ones. By processing heart rhythms in central-towards directions, CLSM learns and abstracts hidden temporal information between a heartbeat and its neighbors to reveal the deep differences between the two heartbeat types. As an improvement, we also propose a rule-based data augmentation method to solve the training data imbalance problem. The proposed framework is evaluated over three real-world ECG databases. The results show that our method outperforms the baselines in most evaluation metrics.

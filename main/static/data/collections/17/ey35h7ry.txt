The cytokine growth factor, G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), is commonly used in oncologic practice and is generally believed to be a safe agent to administer. We describe here a case of pulmonary toxicity associated with the concurrent administration of G-CSF and doxorubicin. We contend that G-CSF contributed to the life-threatening lung injury in our patient, and discuss additional reports in the literature of pulmonary toxicity associated with the use of this agent.

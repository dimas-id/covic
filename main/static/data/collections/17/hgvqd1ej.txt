Pathogenesis describes the spread of a virus in the organism and the mutual relationship between the pathogen and its host during infection. These processes can be analysed in several ways by using different histological, virological and immunological methods. Viral infections can be with or without symptoms (also called apparent or inapparent infection courses). In both cases, the host organism responds with immunological defence responses, which usually lead to overcoming the primary disease symptoms and to the elimination of the virus. The immune response may also contribute in the context of immunopathogenesis to specific disease symptoms and either temporary or permanent damage to the host.

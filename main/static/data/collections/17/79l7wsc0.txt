The North American Species Survival Plan (SSP) for the Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus has developed a cooperative and comprehensive research plan for the long‐term management of the species. Networking with zoos, field biologists and scientists, the SSP has managed the captive population from a situation that was clearly not self‐sustaining into a well‐defined, growing population. This paper describes the development of the SSP and its long‐range goals.

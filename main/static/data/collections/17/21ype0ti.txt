Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and other tick-borne illnesses, a burden predominantly in the summer season, produce symptoms ranging from fever to paralysis. Although often benign, sequela can range from chronic arthritis to neurologic or cardiac illness. Especially in the areas of the North America where tick-borne illnesses are more prevalent, tick-borne illnesses require vigilance on the providerâ€™s part to inquire about recent outdoor activity. Prevention is paramount including the use of protective clothing and tick repellent.

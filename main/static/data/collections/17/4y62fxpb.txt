Segmental colectomy is an ideal procedure for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Transanal endoscopic approaches have enabled rectosigmoid colectomy through a viscerotomy that is resected with the specimen. To extend NOTES segmental colectomy to the entire colon and beyond, a rectal viscerotomy will have to be safely and effectively closed at the end of the procedure. A new technique for rectal viscerotomy closure using a circular EEA hemorrhoid and prolapse stapler with DST series technology (Covidien) is described.

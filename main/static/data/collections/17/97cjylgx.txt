Abstract There exists experimental evidence that necrotoxigenic Escherichia coli (NTEC) strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 1 cause intestinal and extra-intestinal disease in piglets. On the other hand, no experimental model has been developed with NTEC strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 2. In all, 14 colostrum-restricted calves were orally challenged with two strains isolated from the faeces of a diarrheic calf (B20a) or from the heart blood of a septicaemic calf (1404). All calves had diarrhoea which lasted until euthanasia in eight of them. In those calves, diarrhoea was correlated with the faecal excretion of the challenge strains. At necropsy, vascular congestion of the intestinal mucosa, hypertrophy of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and some congestion of the lungs were observed. Bacteriology confirmed the colonisation of the intestine by the challenge strains which were also recovered from the heart blood, the lungs and/or the liver. Histological sections confirmed enterocolitis, lymphadenitis and limited bronchopneumonia. In the intestinal tissue sections, bacteria testing positive in an in situ DNA hybridisation assay with a CNF2 probe were observed. Those results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal anti-O78 and a monoclonal anti-F17b antisera. Three of the five control calves receiving either saline or a CNFâˆ’, F17a strain (25KH09) had no clinical signs or lesions. The other two presented a profuse liquid diarrhoea but those calves were positive for the presence of K99+ E. coli. In this model, both NTEC2 strains were thus, able to colonise the intestine, to cause long-lasting diarrhoea and to invade the blood stream with localisation in various internal organs in colostrum-restricted conventional newborn calves.

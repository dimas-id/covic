Oncocardiology is an emerging field in cardiovascular healthcare. Besides establishing surveillance and follow-up strategies for cancer patients, it will be essential to set up specialized oncocardiology services. However, there is a lack of clinical studies to give evidence-based recommendations regarding cardiological diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cancer patients. An oncocardiology service is a patient-centered structure that aims to integrate research and interdisciplinary patient care to bridge this gap. We discuss the current challenges in developing an oncocardiology service and review the literature on this topic. We further provide an overview of the essential diagnostic tools and upcoming ethical issues to be considered in the management of oncology patients.

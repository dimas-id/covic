Although the most common use of DNA microarrays is gene expression profiling, microarrays are also used for many other applications, including genotyping, resequencing, SNP analysis, and DNA methylation assays. Here we describe genotyping arrays for Influenza A subtype identification and for upper respiratory pathogen diagnostics using standard hybridization techniques and we also describe resequencing, SNP, and methylation assays using an enzyme-based strategy [25, 26].

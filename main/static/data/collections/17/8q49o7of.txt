BACKGROUND The concept of a minimally invasive live donor nephrectomy developed over 20 years ago. Surgeons gained expertise with the laparoscopic technique and utilized multiple variations that are now utilized in transplant centers throughout the world. Recent modifications include laparoendoscopic single-site and robotic approaches that have been adopted by an additional smaller set of programs. PURPOSE Review was performed of the following eight different surgical approaches to a "minimally invasive" live donor nephrectomy: laparoscopic (LDN), hand-assisted laparoscopic (HALDN), retroperitoneoscopic (RLDN), hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic (HARS), single-port laparoscopic (LESS), robotic-assisted laparoscopic (RALDN), mini open, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic (NOTES). The techniques are described and summaries of available outcomes and complications are presented. CONCLUSIONS Traditional surgical techniques of open donor nephrectomy have transitioned to minimally invasive techniques. With adoption of these techniques as the preferred approach, several variations have and continue to evolve. The current minimally invasive donor nephrectomy techniques share low complication rates and excellent outcomes.

Here we report an investigation to adapt existing non-invasive ventilators (NIV) capable of delivering CPAP for use with oxygen to deliver enriched ventilation of 40%+ FiO2. Our intention is to maximise use of existing resources available to HCPs, as NIV and sleep apnoea (CPAP) machines are widely available, to deliver therapeutic benefit and potentially avoid the need for positive pressure ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

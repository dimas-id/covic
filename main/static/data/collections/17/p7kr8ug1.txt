PURPOSE To evaluate the safety and diagnostic ability of percutaneous needle biopsy performed immediately after lung radiofrequency ablation (RFA). MATERIALS AND METHODS From May 2013 to April 2014, percutaneous needle biopsy was performed immediately after RFA for 3 patients (2 men and 1 woman, aged 57-76 years) who had lung tumors measuring 1.3-2.6 cm in diameter. All patients had prior history of malignancy, and all tumors were radiologically diagnosed as malignant. Obtained specimens were pathologically classified using standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS We completed three planned sessions of RFA followed by percutaneous needle biopsy, all of which obtained tumor tissue that could be pathologically diagnosed. Two tumors were metastatic from renal clear cell carcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma, respectively; one tumor was primary lung adenocarcinoma. There was no death or major complication related to the procedures. Although pneumothorax occurred in two patients, these resolved without the need for aspiration or chest tube placement. Tumor seeding was not observed, but 21 months after the procedure, one case developed local tumor progression that was treated by additional RFA. CONCLUSION Pathologic diagnosis was possible by needle biopsy immediately after RFA for lung tumors. This technique may reduce the risks and efforts of performing biopsy and RFA on separate occasions.

An ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia was caused by a novel coronavirus in China in 2019. By March 19, over 200 thousand confirmed cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and over 9000 deaths have been reported throughout the world. For this infectious disease, nucleic acid detection is still the gold standard for pathogenic detection. However, nucleic acid detection takes a long time and has relatively high "false negative"; therefore, we need urgently a convenient and accurate detection method to make up for this deficiency. In this article, we will show such technical characteristics of lgM/lgG serum antibody detection, compared with nucleic acid detection.

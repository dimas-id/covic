In a successful example of lead optimization by computer modeling prediction, computational technology was used to optimize a lead inhibitor (TL‐3) of the SARS‐CoV 3CL protease. A novel C (2)‐symmetric diol (1) was then designed and synthesized, and displayed higher affinity than the original lead compound by one order of magnitude in its inhibition constant (0.6→0.073 μm). We believe that this approach has provided a platform for further lead optimization.[Image: see text]

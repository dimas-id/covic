Abstract Phytotherapy, or herbalism, is defined as the usage of plants or herbs as medication to treat or prevent diseases in human and animals. The usage is gaining more attention among medical practitioners as well as large-scale livestock producers. A number of reports have shown the positive effects of herbal extracts as an antiviral agent used in animal feed or as a prophylaxis and remedy. Besides being a cheaper and safer alternative, the use of herbs may reduce the incidence of drug resistance and may modulate the immune system in preventing viral-related diseases. In this chapter, the antiviral effects of several herbs and their extracts against viruses in terms of the mechanism of action in targeting viral replication steps, the effects in the host and the application in animals will be discussed. The information given may aid in improving the health and increase the production of animals.

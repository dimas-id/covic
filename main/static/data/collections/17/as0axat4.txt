OBJECTIVE We describe our experience of single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy (SILS) for an unruptured aneurysm of the splenic artery. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION A 73-year-old woman was diagnosed as having a splenic aneurysm which grew from 14 to 22 mm in diameter within 2 years. Due to a contrast agent allergy, transcatheter arterial embolization could not be performed; therefore, SILS was performed with a 4-cm Z-shaped incision. The operative time and intraoperative blood loss were 132 min and 27 mL, respectively. The patient was discharged 4 days after surgery. CONCLUSION In selected cases, SILS is a suitable and safe procedure for an unruptured aneurysm of the splenic artery.

ABSTRACT Background Anosmia/hyposmia is a relatively rare sensory disorder that could indicate an underlying more serious cause. In the context of the current COVID 19 pandemic, this could be one of the red flags for the dental practitioner in terms of screening potential COVID 19 patients. Methods The authors searched electronic databases with regards to anosmia/hyposmia and their relation to local and systemic causes. Results The authors found articles relating to the physiology and significance of normal olfaction, etiology, and pathophysiology of olfaction and disorders of the same. Also, we found the most recent literature of anosmia/hyposmia linked to early symptoms of this pandemic. Conclusions Anosmia/hyposmia is most likely indicative of a local or systemic pathology affecting the olfactory system. Recent evidence suggests the importance of this as related to the new global pandemic of COVID 19. Practical Implications The dental professional must be cognizant of the fact that anosmia/hyposmia could indicate a more serious underlying local or systemic issue. In the coming months of the new reality of COVID 19, dental practitioners have an additional role of potential early screening of these infections.

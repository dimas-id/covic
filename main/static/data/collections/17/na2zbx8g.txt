Abstract Background and Aims In view of restrictions on mobility of patients because of COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face consultations are difficult. We sought to study the feasibility of telemedicine in this scenario. Methods PubMed database and Google Scholar were searched using the key terms ‘telemedicine’, ‘diabetes’, ‘COVID-19’up to 31ST March 2020. In addition, existing guidelines including those by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India were accessed. Results We discuss evidence and general guidelines regarding role of telemedicine in patients with diabetes along with its utility and limitations. Conclusions Telemedicine is a useful tool for managing patients of diabetes during this lockdown period. However, there is limited data and further research is required.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is considered to be an emerging viral outbreak due to its link to diseases like microcephaly, Guillain-Barre Syndrome in human. In this paper, we identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using RNA-seq data. In this study, we adopted the RNA-seq analysis pipeline to quantify RNA-seq data into read counts. Our analysis uncovers the significant DEGs which may be involved in the altered biological process somehow. Here, we report the list of significant DEGs, out of which three genes are found to be highly differentially expressed. In addition, our analysis also predicts other moderate DEGs, low DEGs whose differential expression was induced due to ZIKV infections.

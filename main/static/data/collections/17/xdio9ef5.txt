This study presents numerical simulations of UVC light propagation through seven different filtered face respirators (FFR) to determine their suitability for UV germicidal inactivation (UVGI). UV propagation was modelled using the FullMonte program for two external light illuminations. The optical properties of the dominant three layers were determined using the inverse adding doubling method. The resulting fluence rate volume histograms and the lowest fluence rate recorded in the modelled volume, sometimes in the nW cm-2, provide feedback on a respirator's suitability for UVGI and the required exposure time for a given light source. While UVGI can present an economical approach to extend an FFR's useable lifetime, it requires careful optimization of the illumination setup and selection of appropriate respirators.

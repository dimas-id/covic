Abstract The aetiology of asthma associated with viral infection is complex. The dynamics that contribute to disease pathogenesis are multifactorial and involve overlapping molecular and cellular mechanisms, particularly the immune response to respiratory virus infection or allergen sensitization. This review summarizes the evidence associated with factors that may contribute to the development or exacerbation of asthma including age, host factors, genetic polymorphisms, altered immune responses, and aspects of viral antigen expression. This review also provides an important perspective of key events linked to the development of asthmatic disease and related pulmonary inflammation from human and animal studies, and discusses their relationship as targets for disease intervention strategies.

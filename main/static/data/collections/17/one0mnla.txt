We apply the cavity master equation (CME) approach to epidemics models. We explore mostly the susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model, which can be readily treated with the CME as a two-state. We show that this approach is more accurate than individual based and pair based mean field methods, and a previously published dynamic message passing scheme. We explore average case predictions and extend the cavity master equation to SIR and SIRS models.

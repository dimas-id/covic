The SARS‐Cov‐2 (COVID‐19) pandemic has already claimed over 200,000 lives. Quite early on in this pandemic, it was recognised that the virus triggers the immune system leading to a cytokine storm in some severely ill patients [1]. This hyper‐responsiveness has been suggested to be the predominant aetiology for clinical deterioration and mortality in patients with this infection [2]. More recently, there have been several reports of increased thrombotic events in these patients [3‐6]. From a laboratory perspective, this hypercoagulability is reflected in the marked elevation of the fibrinolytic marker, D‐dimer, in almost all hospitalised COVID‐19 patients [7]. We must, therefore, ask ourselves what is the link between the extremes of the immune system, presenting as cytokine storm, and the extremes of coagulation, presenting as arterial and venous thromboembolism?

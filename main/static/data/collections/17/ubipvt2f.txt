Given the high prevalence of preexisting cardiovascular diseases and the increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the identification of optimal antithrombotic approaches in terms of risk/benefit ratio and outcome improvement appears crucial in this setting. In the present position paper we collected current evidence from the literature to provide practical recommendations on the management of antithrombotic therapies (antiplatelet and anticoagulant) in various clinical contexts prevalent during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: in-home management of oral anticoagulant therapy; interactions between drugs used in the SARS-CoV-2 infection and antithrombotic agents; in-hospital management of antithrombotic therapies; diagnosis, risk stratification and treatment of in-hospital thrombotic complications.

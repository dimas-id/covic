A molecular docking study was performed on several structurally diverse A(2A) AR antagonists, including xanthines, and non-xanthine type antagonists to investigate their binding modes with A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR), one of the four subtypes of AR, which is currently of great interest as a target for therapeutic intervention, in particular for Parkinson’s disease. The high-affinity binding site was found to be a hydrophobic pocket with the involvement of hydrogen bonding interactions as well as π–π stacking interactions with the ligands. The detailed binding modes for both xanthine and non-xanthine type A(2A) antagonists were compared and the essential features were extracted and converted to database searchable queries for virtual screening study of novel A(2A) AR antagonists. Findings from this study are helpful for elucidating the binding pattern of A(2A) AR antagonists and for the design of novel active ligands.

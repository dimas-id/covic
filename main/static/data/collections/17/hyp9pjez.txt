Publisher Summary This chapter describes the normal biochemical processes of intestinal secretion, digestion, and absorption. The digestive system is composed of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or the alimentary canal, salivary glands, the liver, and the exocrine pancreas. The principal functions of the gastrointestinal tract are to digest and absorb ingested nutrients, and to excrete waste products of digestion. Most nutrients are ingested in a form that is either too complex for absorption or insoluble, and therefore, indigestible or incapable of being digested. Within the GI tract, much of these substances are solubilized and further degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size, and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. This chapter explains in detail the mechanisms of salivary secretions, compositions of saliva, and the functions of saliva. The chapter also elaborates properties of bile as well as the synthesis of bile acids. The chapter explores the pathogenesis of the important gastrointestinal diseases of domestic animals, and the biochemical basis for their diagnosis and treatment. The chapter concludes with a discussion on disturbances of gastrointestinal function such as vomition, acute diarrheas, malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, and ulcerative colitis.

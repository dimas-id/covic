Introduction. Emergency liver resection during active bleeding in a patient who takes anticoagulant therapy is a complicated and high-risk surgery. Aim. We described a technique that is combination of staplers, total hepatic vascular occlusion, and hemostatic agent (TachoSil) application for safe and quick hepatectomy. Patient and Method. A 72-year-old woman who uses warfarin regularly due to valvuloplasty admitted emergency unit with abdominal pain and shock. At admission, her hemoglobin, hematocrit, and INR values were 5.2 g/dL, 14.9%, and 6.7, respectively. Radiologic evaluation revealed abdominal free fluid and a liver lesion on segments V, VI, and VII. Emergency laparotomy was required. There was an active bleeding from a liver hematoma that could not be controlled by packing, and an urgent hepatic resection was required. Under total hepatic vascular occlusion, segments V, VI, and VII were resected with endoscopic nonvascular staplers. Cut surface of the liver was coagulated with bipolar cautery and covered with a hemostatic material. Results. Hepatectomy took six minutes, and the duration of surgery was 80 minutes. There was no complication and no transfusion required after surgery, and the patient was discharged on 8th day, uneventfully. Conclusion. Emergency hepatectomy with staplers, under vascular control with hemostatic agents, provided a rapid and safe surgery.

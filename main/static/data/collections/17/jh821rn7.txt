When the AIDS warriors in China’s academies and health institutions started experimenting with responses to the epidemic, their efforts were largely funded with foreign money. UN agencies; the international development wing of the governments of Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and other nations; multilateral organisations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and private charities such as the Ford Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – all of these provided support for HIV prevention and/or treatment activities in China. The Chinese government’s contribution to the response rose dramatically following the “tipping point” described in Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-3746-7_4. But even then, most of the original funding for provision of treatment to people in areas with epidemics driven by plasma sales was provided by the Global Fund.

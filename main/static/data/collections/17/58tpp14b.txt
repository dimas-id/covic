Background The use of sealing devices has been established in thyroid surgeries. Recently, LigaSure Small Jaw (LS), a new device that utilizes bipolar energy, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in different head and neck procedures. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficiency and safety of LS use in thyroid surgery compared to Harmonic Focus Scalpel (HS), a well-established device. Methods A prospective study was conducted to compare the efficacy of LS versus the HS. We evaluated 301 patients who underwent surgery at a North American academic institution. Patients were allocated into two groups according to LS or HS use. All patients underwent vocal cord assessment using direct laryngoscopy preoperatively and postoperatively. Analyses were performed to examine the difference in perioperative outcomes resulting from the utilization of either device. Results No difference was seen in operative time between both groups (124.20 ± 68.44 minutes in HS vs 125.20 ± 72.13 minutes in LS, P = .99). Overall complications were similar between both groups (22.86% in HS vs 13.84% in LS, P = .05). However, LS use was also associated with a lower incidence of postoperative transient hypocalcemia as compared to the HS (P = .025). No significant difference was found between both groups regarding the incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (P = .52). Conclusion The use of the LS is safe, feasible, and is associated with comparable outcomes to HS. Both intraoperative and postoperative variables were similar between both devices. Future larger studies are warranted to further investigate the effect on postoperative transient hypocalcemia.

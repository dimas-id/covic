Abstract Search of cost-effective strategies that can enhance the accumulation of phytochemicals of pharmaceutical interest in plant in vitro cultures is an essential task. For the first time, Isatis tinctoria L. hairy root cultures were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet-A, ultraviolet-B, and ultraviolet-C) in an attempt to promote the production of pharmacologically active flavonoids. Results showed that the maximum flavonoid accumulation (7259.12 ± 198.19 μg/g DW) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures treated by 108 kJ/m2 dose of UV-B radiation increased 16.51-fold as compared with that in control (439.68 ± 8.27 μg/g DW). Additionally, antioxidant activity enhancement and cell wall reinforcement were found in the treated I. tinctoria hairy root cultures, indicating the positive-feedback responses to oxidative stress mediated by ultraviolet-B radiation. Moreover, the expression of chalcone synthase gene was tremendously up-regulated (up to 405.84-fold) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures following ultraviolet-B radiation, which suggested chalcone synthase gene might play a crucial role in flavonoid augmentation. Overall, the present work provides a feasible approach for the enhanced production of biologically active flavonoids in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures via the simple supplementation of ultraviolet-B radiation, which is useful for the biotechnological production of these high-added value compounds to fulfil the ever-increasing demand in pharmaceutical fields.

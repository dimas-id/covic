The authors presented state-of-the-art insight into hemostatic disorders in patients with COVID-19 and clinical recommendations on prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The article discussed in detail a new hypothesis proposed by Chinese physicians about a new component in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, namely, about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the hemoglobin beta-chain and the formation of a complex with porphyrin, which results in displacement of the iron ion. Thus, hemoglobin loses the capability for transporting oxygen, which aggravates hypoxia and worsens the prognosis. The article stated rules of hemotransfusion safety in the conditions of COVID-19 pandemic.

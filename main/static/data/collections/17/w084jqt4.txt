Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is one of the causes of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries, and is often triggered by physical events (e.g. acute respiratory failure), or emotional events (e.g. loss of a family member, cardiac stress induced by an acute illness). SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia currently represents a worldwide health problem; the correlations between cardiovascular disease, myocardial injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear, but initial data show that myocardial damage represents a negative prognostic factor. Myocardial injury during SARS-CoV-2, as defined by a pathological rise in circulating troponin levels, is not an uncommon complication in hospitalized patients, and is significantly more frequent in intensive care unit patients and among those who died. In this setting, myocardial injury is mainly secondary to type 2 myocardial infarction (mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand during respiratory failure); other causes include myocarditis, coronary thrombosis, sepsis or septic shock. At present, only few cases of TTS have been described during SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the case of a patient hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 with subsequent onset of TTS triggered by both physical and emotional events.

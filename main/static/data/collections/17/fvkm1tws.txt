RNA viruses use several initiation strategies to ensure that their RNAs are synthesized in appropriate amounts, have correct termini, and can be translated efficiently. Many viruses with genomes of single-stranded positive-, negative-, and double-stranded RNA initiate RNA synthesis by a de novo (primer-independent) mechanism. This review summarizes biochemical features and variations of de novo initiation in viral RNA replication.

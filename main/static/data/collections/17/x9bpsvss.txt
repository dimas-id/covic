BACKGROUND Flow diversion with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) is a widely accepted treatment modality for aneurysm occlusion. Previous reports have shown no recanalization of aneurysms on long-term follow-up once total occlusion has been achieved. CASE DESCRIPTION We report on a 63-year-old male who had a large internal carotid artery cavernous segment aneurysm. Treatment with PED resulted in complete occlusion of the aneurysm. However, follow-up angiography at four years revealed recurrence of the aneurysm due to disconnection of the two PEDs placed in telescoping fashion. CONCLUSION Herein, we present the clinico-radiological features and discuss the possible mechanisms resulting in the recanalization of aneurysms treated with flow diversion.

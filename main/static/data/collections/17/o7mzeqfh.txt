BACKGROUND Intravenous lidocaine is increasingly used in surgical patients. As it has neuromuscular blocking effects, we tested the impact of an intravenous lidocaine infusion on the time course of a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. METHODS Fifty-two adults undergoing surgery were randomly allocated to intravenous lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/h or physiological saline (control) throughout surgery. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled propofol infusion and sufentanil. After loss of consciousness, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given. Neuromuscular transmission was measured using train-of-four (TOF)-watch SX (Organon, Swords Co., Dublin, Ireland) acceleromyography. RESULTS Onset time (to 95% depression of first twitch) was on average 113.9 s (standard deviation 35.3) with lidocaine and 119.5 s (44.9) with saline (P = 0.618). Total recovery time (TOF ratio 0.9) was on average 58.1 min (15.1) with lidocaine and 54.3 min (16.9) with saline (P = 0.394). Clinical duration (until first twitch has recovered to 25%) was on average 33.3 min (7.2) with lidocaine and 30.6 min (8.1) with saline (P = 0.21). Recovery index (time between 25% and 75% recovery of the first twitch) was on average 11.5 min (5.0) with lidocaine and 10.6 min (4.1) with saline (P = 0.458). Recovery time (between 25% recovery of the first twitch and TOF ratio 0.9) was on average 24.8 min (9.3) with lidocaine and 23.2 min (9.2) with saline (P = 0.541). CONCLUSION A continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine has no impact on the time course of the neuromuscular blockade induced by a standard intubation dose of rocuronium.

[Image: see text] Lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) with acute rejection (AR) and chronic rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [BOS]) induce circulating exosomes known to contain donor human leukocyte antigens and lung-associated self-antigens. Here, we sought to identify proteomic signatures in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) that differentiate LTxRs in 4 groups: stable, AR, BOS, or respiratory viral infection (RVI). EVs were isolated from plasma from patients in each group via ultracentrifugation. EV protein cargoes were prepared for shotgun proteomics using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 2 unique proteins for AR, 4 for RVI, 24 for BOS, and 8 for stable LTxRs. Differential analysis of AR, BOS, RVI, and stable proteins identified significantly deregulated proteins (p < 0.05, log(2)(fold change) > ±1) in each condition (31, 2, and 2, respectively). EVs from LTxRs with AR contained proteins involved in immunoglobulin, complement regulation, coagulation, and innate and adaptive immune response pathways. EVs from LTxRs with BOS revealed enriched immunoglobulin receptors and a carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain. EVs from LTxRs with RVI had an enriched macrophage-stimulating factor. We found unique signatures in LTxRs with AR, BOS, and RVI, highlighting complex immune mechanisms underlying lung allograft rejection. Proteomic signatures in LTxRs’ circulating EVs provided insights into immunological mechanisms of graft rejection and RVI.

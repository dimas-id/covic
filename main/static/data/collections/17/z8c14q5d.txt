A novel Coronavirus strain, named “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2” (SARS‐CoV‐2) was recently identified as the etiological agent of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Interestingly, a consistent number of COVID‐19‐associated skin manifestations seem to share a certain degree of vascular damage as common pathogenetic mechanism(1). Vascular injury may be due to the direct damage of endothelial cells by the virus or may represents an epiphenomenon of a dysregulated host inflammatory responses triggered by the infection(2). Here, we describe an unprecedented case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis presenting with a hemorrhagic bullous eruption in a patient affected by COVID‐19.

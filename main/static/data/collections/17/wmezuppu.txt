OBJECTIVE To evaluate an alternative catheter labelling approach for 3-way catheters based on the drainage channel and irrigation channel cross-sectional area (CSA), which impacts catheter flow rate characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three-way 22Fr catheters from Bard (Bard Limited), Rusch Simplastic (Teleflex Medical), Dover (COVIDIEN), and Rusch Golden were included in the study. Irrigation channel, drainage channel, and overall CSAs were digitally measured with an image-processing program. Irrigation channel and drainage channel flow rates were measured and correlated with their corresponding catheter CSA values. RESULTS Catheter CSA and French value did not predict flow-rate characteristics, but irrigation channel CSA and drainage channel CSA were predictive. The 22Fr Rusch Simplastic catheter had the largest irrigation channel CSA (2.87 mm(2)) and drainage channel CSA (12.6 mm(2)), and had the greatest irrigation (5.27 ± 0.02 ml/s) and drainage flow rates (14.42 ± 0.22 ml/s). Twenty-two French gauge Rusch Golden catheters had the smallest irrigation channel CSA (1.34 mm(2)) and drainage channel CSA (7.82 mm(2)) and the lowest irrigation (1.83 ± 0.03 ml/s) and drainage flow rates (1.83 ± 0.03 ml/s). CONCLUSION An alternative catheter labelling system to include overall CSA, irrigation channel CSA, and drainage channel CSA values would provide more accurate and transparent data relevant to anticipated drainage and irrigation flow rates. The proposed labelling method will assist urologists in selecting 3-way catheters for bladder irrigation.

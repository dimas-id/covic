Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSV‐A), RSV‐B, and human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV‐1, HPIV‐2, and HPIV‐3) are common respiratory paramyxoviruses. Here, we developed a two‐tube triplex one‐step real‐time reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (real‐time RT‐PCR) and evaluated its performance using clinical samples. The data showed that this novel assay was 100% consistent with the monoplex real‐time RT‐PCR assay (in‐house), which was superior to the commercial routine multiplex‐ligation‐NAT‐based assay. Meanwhile, the clinical nasopharyngeal swabs of 471 patients with the acute febrile respiratory syndrome (AFRS) were analyzed using the established method. The results showed that 52 (11.7%) cases were positive for paramyxovirus. Among them, HPIVs and RSV‐A had the highest detection rate. The age and seasonal distribution of human paramyxovirus infection were analyzed. In conclusion, we developed a novel multiplex real‐time RT‐PCR assay for the rapid detection of six common human paramyxoviruses, which were dominant in patients with AFRS in Qinghai.

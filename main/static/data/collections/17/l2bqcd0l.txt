The Covid-19 epidemic is having a strong impact on the population with pre-existing chronic diseases. The collision between the Covid-19 pandemic and the current diabesity epidemic has highlighted that obese and diabetic patients have a worse prognosis due to the impairment of the immune response to infections and due to the mechanical limits that make the management of the hospitalized patients with severe obesity more difficult. The limitations imposed on accessibility to non-urgent care during the lockdown of "phase 1" of this pandemic have created the need to revolutionize clinical practice to meet the health demands of chronic and high-risk diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The use of technology and risk stratification to establish the priority of access to the treatments that we have been forced to undertake will be useful tools for a new phase of a more efficient and successful treatment of diabesity.

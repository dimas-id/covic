The established findings of lower representation of minority population in clinical trials are skewed by the national representation of the US population by race where they account only for 30%, making it difficult to compare the participation rate by race. We report the direct age-adjusted demographic and socioeconomic disparities in clinical trial participation among cancer survivors using the most recent national survey data. In 2018, 7.1% of cancer survivors reported participating in the clinical trial as a part of their cancer treatment. The participation rate was significantly higher among younger adults (age 18â€“24, 19.1%), male (8.5%), black (19.8%), and Hispanic (14.4%) cancer survivors, while rate was lower among female (4.2%), and white (5.4%). By marital status, 8.5% of unmarried and 3.5% of married cancer survivors reported clinical trial participation. These results help explain the demographic disparities in cancer survivors and drawing attention to targeted education and awareness intervention for ideal cancer care.

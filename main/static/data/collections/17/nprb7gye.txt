BACKGROUND The multimodality approach has significantly improved outcomes for hepatic malignancies. Microwave ablation is often used in isolation or succession, and seldom in combination with resection. Potential benefits and pitfalls from combined resection and ablation therapy in patients with complex and extensive bilobar hepatic disease have not been well defined. METHODS A review of the University of Louisville prospective Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary Patients database was performed with multi-focal bilobar disease that underwent microwave ablation with resection or microwave only included. RESULTS One hundred and eight were treated with microwave only (MWA, n = 108) or combined resection and ablation (CRA, n = 84) and were compared with similar disease-burden patients undergoing resection only (n = 84). The groups were comparable except that the MWA group was older (p = .02) and with higher co-morbidities (diabetes, hepatitis). The resection group had larger tumours (4 vs. 3.2 and 3 cm) but the CRA group had more numerous lesions (4 vs. 3 and 2, p = .002). Short-term outcomes including morbidity (47.6% vs. 43%, p = .0715) were similar between the CRA and resection only groups. Longer operative time (164 vs. 126 min, p = .003) and need for blood transfusion (p = .001) were independent predictors of complications. Survival analyses for colorectal metastasis patients (n = 158) demonstrated better overall survival (OS) (43.9 vs. 37.6 and 30.5 months, p = .035), disease-free survival (DFS) (38 vs. 26.6 and 16.9 months, p = .028) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (55.4 vs. 17 and 22.9 months, p < .001) with resection only. CONCLUSION The use of microwave ablation in addition to surgical resection did not significantly increase the morbidities or short-term outcomes. In combination with systemic and other local forms of therapy, combined resection and ablation is a safe and effective procedure.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes significant loss to the swine industry. The emergence of novel PEDV strains in recent years has decreased the effectiveness of PEDV vaccines. We have developed a live recombinant vaccine, a swinepox virus vector that expresses a truncated S protein (rSPV-St) from a recent PEDV strain, SQ2014, and evaluated its immunogenicity and effectiveness in a swine model. Vaccination of swine with rSPV-St elicited a robust antibody response specific for the homologous PEDV SQ2014. Serum IgA titers in rSPV-St-vaccinated animals were significantly higher than in those immunized with inactivated vaccines. The effectiveness of antibodies induced by the rSPV-St vaccine in protection against PEDV was tested in a passive-transfer model in which piglets were challenged with the homologous virus SQ2014 and the heterologous strain CV777. When challenged with the homologous virus, sera from rSPV-St vaccination provided complete protection. However, sera from rSPV-St vaccination did not provide any protection against the heterologous virus challenge. Amino acid sequence differences in the S proteins of the two viruses were identified within neutralizing epitopes, which might have contributed to the divergent clinical results. Our data suggest that rSPV-St is potentially an effective vaccine against infection with emerging PEDV strains.

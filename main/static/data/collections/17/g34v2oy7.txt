PURPOSE OF REVIEW The main purpose of this review is to summarize the current research (2006-2007) concerning the development of novel anticoronaviral strategies and compounds. RECENT FINDINGS Recent research led to the identification of several novel agents inhibiting coronaviral replication. The most promising compounds include carbohydrate-binding agents, neutralizing antibodies and drugs targeting a coronaviral envelope protein. SUMMARY Although initial outbreaks of coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) were controlled by public health measures, the development of vaccines and antiviral agents for SARS-CoV is essential for improving control and treatment of future outbreaks. Four years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, several compounds with an anticoronaviral activity have been identified.

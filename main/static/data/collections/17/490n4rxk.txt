Abstract The sequences of the peplomeric S1 protein of four serologically distinct strains of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, have been determined. The S1 protein is thought to contain the serotype-specific neutralization epitopes and to be the main target of antigenic variation. An alignment with sequences of three strains published previously showed that from the 545 amino acid residues only 243 have been conserved. Clustering of substitutions suggests that most serotype determinants are located within the first 300 amino acid residues of S1. A phylogenetic tree of the S1 sequences showed very variable rates of divergence. Differences in topology with a tree based on RNAse-T1 fingerprint data indicate that some of the IBV strains have arisen by genetic recombination.

BACKGROUND: There are no reports of proteomic analyses of inflamed islets in type 1 diabetes. PROCEDURES: Proteins expressed in the islets of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) with extensive insulitis were identified by laser-capture microdissection mass spectrometry using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues. RESULTS: Thirty-eight proteins were identified solely in FT1DM islets, most of which have not been previously linked to type 1 diabetes. Five protein-protein interacting clusters were identified, and the cellular localization of selected proteins was validated immunohistochemically. Migratory activity-related proteins, including plastin-2 (LCP1), moesin (MSN), lamin-B1 (LMNB1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1) and others, were identified in CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages infiltrated to inflamed FT1DM islets. Proteins involved in successive signaling in innate/adaptive immunity were identified, including SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1), proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1), HLA class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA-C), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1). Angiogenic (thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP)) and anti-angiogenic (tryptophan-tRNA ligase (WARS)) factors were identified in migrating CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages. Proteins related to virus replication and cell proliferation, including probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 5 (DDX5) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH1), were identified. The anti-apoptotic protein T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5), the anti-oxidative enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PDG), and the anti-viral and anti-apoptotic proteins serpin B6 (SERPINB6) and heat shock 70 kDa protein1-like (HSPA1L), were identified in FT1DM-affected islet cells. CONCLUSION: The identified FT1DM-characterizing proteins include those involved in aggressive beta cell destruction through massive immune cell migration and proteins involved in angiogenesis and islet vasculature bleeding, cell repair, and anti-inflammatory processes. Several target proteins for future type 1 diabetes interventions were identified.

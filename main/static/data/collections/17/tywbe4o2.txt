A new coronavirus (Sars‐CoV‐2) was detected in China at the end of 2019 and has since caused a worldwide pandemic. This virus is responsible for an acute respiratory syndrome (COVID‐19), distinguished by a potentially lethal interstitial bilateral pneumonia. Because Sars‐CoV‐2 is highly infective through airborne contamination, the high infection risk in the dental environment is a serious problem for both professional practitioners and patients. This literature overview provides a description of the clinical aspects of COVID‐19 and its transmission, while supplying valuable information regarding protection and prevention measures.

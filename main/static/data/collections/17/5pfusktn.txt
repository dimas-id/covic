Background & Aims The coronavirus disease 2019 (COIVD-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized as a pandemic, which causes a serious public health challenge in the world. A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide, especially in China. In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown. Approach & Results In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7, 2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2/15) compared to 2.8% (3/108) for the patients without HBV infection. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause liver function damage in COVID-19 cases and the patients with HBV infection are likely to have more severe disease outcome.

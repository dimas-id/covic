There is currently no established injury criterion for the spine in compression with lateral load components despite this load combination commonly contributing to spinal injuries in rollover vehicle crashes, falls and sports. This study aimed to determine an injury criterion and accompanying tolerance values for cervical spine segments in axial compression applied with varying coronal plane eccentricity. Thirty-three human cadaveric functional spinal units were subjected to axial compression at three magnitudes of lateral eccentricity of the applied force. Injury was identified by high-speed video and graded by spine surgeons. Linear regression was used to define neck injury tolerance values based on a criterion incorporating coronal plane loads accounting for specimen sex, age, size and bone density. Larger coronal plane eccentricity at injury was associated with smaller resultant coronal plane force. The level of coronal plane eccentricity at failure appears to distinguish between the types of injuries sustained, with hard tissue structure injuries more common at low levels of eccentricity and soft tissue structure injuries more common at high levels of eccentricity. There was no relationship between axial force and lateral bending moment at injury which has been previously proposed as an injury criterion. These results provide the foundation for designing and evaluating strategies and devices for preventing severe spinal injuries.

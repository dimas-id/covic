BACKGROUND Several studies have shown that laparoscopic hernia repair for large paraesophageal hiatal hernia is associated with a high recurrence rate. Therefore, some authors recommend the use of prosthetic meshes. Considering the dynamic area between the esophagus and the diaphragmatic crura with its constant motion, it is astonishing that only a minor number of surgeons describe mesh-associated complications. METHODS Between January 2000 and August 2008, 26 patients of the Centre Hospitalier Emile Mayrisch (CHEM, Luxembourg) underwent laparoscopic repair for large paraesophageal hiatal hernia (median age, 70 (range, 39-90) years). In nine patients, prosthetic mesh reinforcement was performed (7 composite/2 mono-phase mesh). Crural repair without tension was performed only with sutures. There were no conversions. Follow-up assessment was prospective with the GIQL (Gastro-Intestinal Quality of Life) Index. RESULTS Responses to the GIQLI questionnaires were obtained from 20 patients (6 died of unrelated causes). Nineteen patients were satisfied with their symptom control 1 year after the operation (GIQLI 127). Sixteen patients had radiological follow-up (median, 24 months). Three patients treated without mesh (3/10) showed a radiological recurrence. All of them (3/10) had symptoms. None of the controlled patients with mesh (0/6) showed a recurrence. One patient developed a severe aortal bleeding 1, 2, and 3 weeks after the laparoscopic mono-phase mesh repair. During conventional operation, the bleeding stopped. Three years later, the follow-up showed a satisfied patient (GIQLI 127). CONCLUSIONS In view of the described complication, there is still considerable controversy regarding the routine use of mesh. To increase safety, a composite mesh should be preferred.

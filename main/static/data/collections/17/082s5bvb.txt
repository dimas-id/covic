BACKGROUND It is reported that several systemic immunoinflammatory measures, including systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin ratio (CAR), are associated with survival in patients with various types of cancer. OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to clear which systemic immunoinflammatory measures had the greatest prognostic values. In addition, we examined which component had the greatest prognostic power in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS Preoperative systemic immunoinflammatory measures were evaluated in 143 patients undergoing esophageal resection for esophageal cancer from 2009 to 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance of these markers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and the area under the ROC curves (AUROCs) were compared to verify the accuracy of each measure in predicting overall survival (OS). RESULTS In univariate analysis, preoperative SII, NLR, and CAR were the predictors of OS in patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer (p < 0.05, respectively), whereas in multivariate analysis, CAR and pathological tumor depth were the significant predictors of OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.994, p = 0.03 vs. HR 1.967, p = 0.02, respectively). According to AUROC, the CRP (0.66) and albumin levels (0.66) were more important systemic immunoinflammatory measures than neutrophil (0.58), lymphocyte (0.63), and platelet (0.56) levels. CONCLUSION Among systemic immunoinflammatory measures, CAR was the most significant predictor of OS in patients with esophageal cancer. CRP and albumin levels were more important components of systemic immunoinflammatory measures.

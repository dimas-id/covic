This paper discusses an open-source solution for smart-parking in highly urbanized areas. We have conducted interviews with domain experts, defined user stories and proposed a system architecture with a case study. Our solution allows integration of independent owners of parking space into one unified system, that facilitates parking in a smart city. The adoption of such a system raises trust issues among the stakeholders involved in the management of the parking. In order to tackle such issues, we propose a smart contract-based solution encapsulating sensitive information, agreements and processes into transparent and distributed smart contracts .

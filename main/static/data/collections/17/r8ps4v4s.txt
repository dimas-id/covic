Dynamic forces are very important boundary conditions in practical engineering applications, such as structural strength analysis, health monitoring and fault diagnosis, and vibration isolation. Moreover, there are many applications in which we have found it very difficult to directly obtain the expected dynamic load which acts on a structure. Some traditional indirect inverse analysis techniques are developed for load identification by measured responses. These inverse problems about load identification mentioned above are complex and inherently ill-posed, while regularization methods can deal with this kind of problem. However, most of regularization methods are only limited to solve the pure mathematical numerical examples without application to practical engineering problems, and they should be improved to exclude jamming of noises in engineering. In order to solve these problems, a new regularization method is presented in this article to investigate the minimum of this minimization problem, and applied to reconstructing multi-source dynamic loads on the frame structure of hydrogenerator by its steady-state responses. Numerical simulations of the inverse analysis show that the proposed method is more effective and accurate than the famous Tikhonov regularization method. The proposed regularization method in this article is powerful in solving the dyanmic load identification problems.

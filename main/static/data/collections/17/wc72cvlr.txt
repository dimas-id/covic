Abstract The presentation offers a UK veterinary practitioners viewpoint on issues of DOI and booster vaccination with reference to both dog and cat vaccines. The current use of vaccines and issues surrounding their use are discussed, including motivations for and against vaccinating in a climate of reduced fear of disease, and increased suspicion of vaccines. Attitudes to extended DOI and routine booster vaccinations are explored, and specific disease and prevention issues concerning leptospirosis in particular are presented. The strategy and tactics of implementation of extended DOI vaccines at general practice level are discussed based on the author's own experiences, and thoughts offered on how vaccine manufacturers might support the process at local and national levels, as well as communicating a positive message for continued routine vaccination of dogs and cats, and the advantages that extended DOI offers.

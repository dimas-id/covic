BACKGROUND The important point in safely performing laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) is to control bleeding. The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the bleeding reduction effect by occlusion of the hepatic artery in LH; and (ii) to evaluate the risk of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) gas embolism (GE) in the case of high pneumoperitoneum (PP). METHODS Nine piglets underwent laparoscopic left medial lobe and left lateral lobe resection, receiving either occlusion of the hepatic artery (hepatic artery clamping group: HACG, n = 9) or no occlusion (hepatic artery declamping group: HADCG, n = 9) using a PP of 15 mmHg. In addition, we observed changes in hemodynamics induced by PP. The state of GE was observed using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during LH (n = 8). GE was graded as grade 0 (none), grade 1 (minor), and grade 2 (major). RESULTS The HACG had significantly less bleeding compared to the HADCG (P < 0.01). During LH, four animals showed grade 1 (37.5%) and one animal showed grade 2 (12.5%) GE at 15 mmHg. At 20 mmHg, all animals showed grade 2 (100%) GE. CONCLUSION The occlusion of the hepatic artery in LH reduces blood loss. The control of bleeding from the hepatic vein is feasible with a high PP, but there is a possibility of GE.

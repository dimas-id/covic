BACKGROUND The increased frequency of laparoscopic hepatic resection as a principal or adjunct component of patient care has driven the need for and development of efficient and safe hepatic parenchymal transection technologies. At present, various devices are available for pre-coagulation transection (PCT) of hepatic parenchyma with the intent of minimizing procedure-associated postoperative haemorrhage and bile leak. This report presents the evaluation of a novel bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy device for PCT used for laparoscopic hepatic resection. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatic resection using the Enseal device (SurgRx Inc.) were identified from the prospectively maintained hepatobiliary database. Information on patient demographics, procedures and postoperative complications was collected and analysed; complications were grouped into early (at <30 days) and late (at > or = 30 days) events. RESULTS A total of 18 patients, of whom 13 had malignant tumours (12 colorectal metastases and one hepatocellular carcinoma) and five had benign tumours (two hepatic adenomas and three haemangiomas) underwent 18 hepatic procedures, including two formal hemi-hepatectomies, four left lateral sections, three posterior sections and nine atypical non-anatomic resections. Estimated blood loss did not differ from institutional historical control data; no postoperative haemorrhage, bile leaks or hepatic abscess or necrosis were identified (n = 18). CONCLUSIONS This initial experience using the laparoscopic bipolar RF device demonstrates an acceptable safety profile in terms of the outcomes analysed.

Abstract β-Defensins are cationic peptides which form part of the innate immune response of the respiratory epithelium. Due to their antimicrobial properties and immunostimulatory activity, β-defensins are potential tools for the treatment and prevention of respiratory disease. In dogs, infectious respiratory disease is a common problem, particularly in housed animals. This study aimed to assess the presence of four β-defensins in the canine respiratory tract and to use quantitative real-time PCR to determine mRNA levels following microbial challenge. Three β-defensins, CBD1, CBD103 and CBD108, were detected in respiratory cells. All three defensins were also readily expressed in skin samples, while their expression in lymphoid tissues and the kidney was low and inconsistent. Treatment of primary tracheal epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or infection with canine respiratory coronavirus led to decreased expression of CBD103 and CBD108, while cells infected with canine parainfluenza virus had lower levels of CBD1 and CBD108. Furthermore CBD103 was demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity against the respiratory pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica.

BACKGROUND: Earlier attempts to deliver effective lung doses of surfactant by aerosolization were unsuccessful, mostly because of technical shortcomings. We aimed at quantifying the lung deposition of poractant alfa with a new supraglottic delivery system for surfactant atomization in an experimental neonatal model. METHODS: The method involved six sedated 1-day-old piglets lying in the lateral decubitus, spontaneously breathing on nasal-mask continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). A pharyngeal cannula housing a multi-channel air-blasting atomization catheter was placed through the mouth with its tip above the glottis entrance. In all, 200 mg kg(−1) of a (99m)Tc-surfactant mixture was atomized through the catheter synchronously with inspiration. Six intubated control piglets received an equal amount of intratracheally instilled (99m)Tc-surfactant mixture. The percentage of the (99m)Tc-surfactant mixture deposited in the lungs was estimated by scintigraphy. RESULTS: Median (range) deposition in the lungs was 40% (24–68%) after atomization and 87% (55–95%) after instillation (p < 0.001). Overall, almost 80% of the deposited surfactant was in the dependent lung. Effective atomization time (atomizer on) was 28 (17–52) min, yielding an output rate of 0.1–0.2 mL min(−1). CONCLUSIONS: Without endotracheal intubation, in spontaneously breathing newborn piglets, this new supraglottic atomizer delivery system attained a median lung deposition of 40% of the nominal dose of surfactant.

In March 2020, Polish universities had to suspend all on‐site activities due to the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. As a result, we were faced with the problem of how to convert a simulation‐based course in geriatrics into distance‐learning. The main focus of the original course (30 academic hours) is to expose fourth‐year medical students, working in teams of three, to eight simulated cases including acute dyspnea (pneumonia), behavior change (somatic delirium), and cardio‐pulmonary deterioration.

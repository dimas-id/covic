Abstract As coronavirus pandemic continue to spread over the world, we have to be aware of potential complications on hospitalized patients. We report a case of a 79-year-old woman with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by combined arterial and venous thrombosis of upper mesenteric vessels. As unenhanced chest-CT scan plays a key-role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic we should pay attention to indirect signs of thrombosis.

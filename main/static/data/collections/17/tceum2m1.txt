Sensitive and quantitative analysis of proteins and other biochemical species are central to disease diagnosis, drug screening and proteomic studies. Research advances exploiting SiNWs configured as FETs for biomolecule analysis have emerged as one of the most promising and powerful platforms for label-free, real-time, and sensitive electrical detection of proteins as well as many other biological species. In this chapter, we first briefly introduce the fundamental principle for semiconductor NW-FET sensors. Representative examples of semiconductor NW sensors are then summarized for sensitive chemical and biomolecule detection, including proteins, nucleic acids, viruses and small molecules. In addition, this chapter discusses several electrical and surface functionalization methods for enhancing the sensitivity of semiconductor NW sensors.

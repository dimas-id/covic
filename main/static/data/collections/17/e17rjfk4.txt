Abstract Nanohybrid membranes based on the Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) H5PV2Mo10O40 and a poly(vinyl alcohol)/polyethyleneimine (PVA/PEI) blend were prepared as a chemical and biological protective material. The objective of the study was to develop and evaluate permeable membranes (PVA/PEI) impregnated with reactive nanoparticulates (POM) that can protect against simulants of chemical and biological warfare agents. The physical properties of the PVA/PEI–POM hybrids were examined using SEM, TEM, TGA, and UV–Vis spectroscopy, the results of which indicated that the POM was incorporated in the PVA/PEI matrix after impregnation. The redox properties against 2-chloroethyl-ethyl sulfide (CEES) were investigated based on significant color changes and UV absorption in the POM upon reduction by CEES. The antibacterial effects of the PVA/PEI–POM hybrids were assessed by the zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and plate-counting methods. The results of this study showed that PVA/PEI–POM hybrids that act against simulants of chemical and biological weapons while retaining their ability to transmit moisture vapor could be obtained.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes a non‐contagious, arthropod‐transmitted disease in wild and domestic ruminants, such as sheep. In this study, we used iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC‐MS/MS for quantitative identification of differentially expressed proteins in BTV‐infected sheep testicular (ST) cells. Relative quantitative data were obtained for 4455 proteins in BTV‐ and mock‐infected ST cells, among which 101 and 479 proteins were differentially expressed at 24 and 48 h post‐infection, respectively, indicating further proteomic changes during the later stages of infection. Ten corresponding genes of differentially expressed proteins were validated via real‐time RT‐PCR. Expression levels of three representative proteins, eIF4a1, STAT1 and HSP27, were further confirmed via western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that the differentially expressed proteins are primarily involved in biological processes related to innate immune response, signal transduction, nucleocytoplasmic transport, transcription and apoptosis. Several upregulated proteins were associated with the RIG‐I‐like receptor signaling pathway and endocytosis. To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate proteome‐wide dysregulation in BTV‐infected cells with the aid of quantitative proteomics. Our collective results not only enhance understanding of the host response to BTV infection but also highlight multiple potential targets for the development of antiviral agents.

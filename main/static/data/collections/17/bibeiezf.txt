This paper presents a more detailed concept of Human-Robot Interaction systems architecture. One of the main differences between the proposed architecture and other ones is the methodology of information acquisition regarding the robot’s interlocutor. In order to obtain as much information as possible before the actual interaction took place, a custom Internet-of-Things-based sensor subsystems connected to Smart Infrastructure was designed and implemented, in order to support the interlocutor identification and acquisition of initial interaction parameters. The Artificial Intelligence interaction framework of the developed robotic system (including humanoid Pepper with its sensors and actuators, additional local, remote and cloud computing services) is being extended with the use of custom external subsystems for additional knowledge acquisition: device-based human identification, visual identification and audio-based interlocutor localization subsystems. These subsystems were deeply introduced and evaluated in this paper, presenting the benefits of integrating them into the robotic interaction system. In this paper a more detailed analysis of one of the external subsystems—Bluetooth Human Identification Smart Subsystem—was also included. The idea, use case, and a prototype, integration of elements of Smart Infrastructure systems and the prototype implementation were performed in a small front office of the Weegree company as a decent test-bed application area.

This study aimed to evaluate the behavioral aspects and beliefs of the population of Ceará in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was conducted on sociodemographic aspects and opinions related to the pandemic. Absolute and relative frequencies were calculated, the association between variables was performed with Chi-square, and the level of significance was 5%. The final sample had 2,259 participants, and an association was observed between females and perceiving themselves with a high risk of infection (p = 0.044) and males with non-performance of voluntary quarantine (p < 0.001). People aged 80 years and over were partially quarantined due to the flow of people at home (p < 0.001). Participants with elementary school education had a lower risk of infection than participants with a higher level of education (p < 0.001). This group includes people who did voluntary quarantine the least (p < 0.001). Participants living in the inland region of the state had less direct contact with someone tested positive for the Coronavirus (p = 0.031) and are less reclusive (p < 0.001). We can conclude that the approach to the COVID-19 pandemic varies by social aspects, such as gender, age, education, and place of residence, as well as the belief system of the population of the State of Ceará.

Abstract The development of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens at an alarming rate has created a great health concern worldwide. Nanotechnology today provides hope as an alternative to antibiotics, in the field of antimicrobial therapy. The diverse structures and small size make the nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unique and remarkable properties, drastically different from its bulk counterparts. Various microorganisms such as actinomycetes, algae, yeast, fungi, and bacteria synthesize inorganic nanoparticles enzymatically, either extracellularly or intracellularly. Various metallic NPs, for example, magnesium, titanium, copper, silver, and gold, are well reported for their antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. The antimicrobial properties of these NPs may be attributed to its ability to disorganize membrane structure, form pores in the bacterial cell wall, inhibit or disruption biofilm, etc. Most metal oxide nanoparticles like ZnO-NPs, exhibit bactericidal properties by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, other NPs like MgO-NPs are effective due to their peculiar physical structure. Nanoparticles can also be fabricated with various bioactive entities. Due to their small and controllable size, functionalized nanoparticles can deliver drugs precisely and safely to the target sites. Thus, microbial mediated production of nanoparticles is gaining substantial interest as a potential solution to the growing need for the development of eco-friendly ways to fight microbial resistance and control diseases.

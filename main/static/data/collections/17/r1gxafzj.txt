Medicine and public health have traditionally separated the prevention and treatment of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged this paradigm, particularly in the setting of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Overall, individuals with underlying CVD who acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience up to a ten-fold higher case-fatality rate compared to the general population. While the impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular health continues to evolve, few have defined this association from a frontline, public health perspective of populations disproportionately affected by CVD and COVID-19. Louisiana is ranked within the bottom five states for cardiovascular health, and is home to several parishes that have experienced among the highest COVID-19 case-fatality rates nationally. Here, we review CVD prevention and implications of COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana, a city holding a sobering yet, resilient history with previous public health disasters. In particular, we discuss potential pandemic-driven changes in access to healthcare, preventive pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which may adversely affect CVD prevention and management, while amplifying racial disparities. Through this process, we highlight proposed recommendations for how CVD prevention efforts can be improved in midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.

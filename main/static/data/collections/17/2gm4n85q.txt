Objectives: To describe and evaluate epidemiological investigation. Results: and containment measures implemented in Busan, where 108 cases were confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between February 21 and March 24, 2020. Methods: Any individual who tested positive for COVID-19 was classified as a confirmed case. Measures were taken to identify the source of infection and trace and quarantine contacts. Serial intervals were estimated and the effective reproduction number (R_t) was computed. Results: Of the total 18,303 COVID-19 tests performed between January 16 and March 24 in Busan, 108 yielded positive. Results: (positive test rate: 0.6%). All confirmed cases were placed in isolation at hospitals. Of the 108 confirmed cases, 59 (54.6%) were female. The most common age group was 20-29 years with 37 cases (34.3%). Regarding symptoms at the time of diagnosis, cough (n=38, 35.2%) and fever (n=34, 31.5%) were most common; 12 cases (11.1%) were asymptomatic. The source of infection was identified in 99 cases (91.7%). A total of 3,223 contacts were identified and quarantined. Household contacts accounted for 196, and the household secondary attack rate (SAR) was 8.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-12.9%). The mean serial interval was estimated to be 5.54 days (95% CI 4.08-7.01 days). After February 26, R_t remained below 1 in Busan. Conclusion: : The early containment strategy implemented in Busan shows that control is possible if outbreaks are of limited scope. In preparation for future outbreaks, public health and healthcare systems should be re-examined and put in a ready state.

OBJECTIVE To find the most suitable RT-PCR detection method for SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) detection in both human and animals, and to study the source of SARS virus by investigating the condition of virus carried by wild, domestic animals and animals sold in market. METHODS 350 throat washes of confirmed, suspected and observed SARS cases were tested by TaqMan and molecular beacon fluorescence RT-PCR methods. 386 animals with 442 nasal-throat swabs, fecal swabs of animals and cell cultured were detected by TaqMan method and conventional RT-PCR method. RESULTS 10 positive were detected from 41 SARS clinical confirmed cases (24.39%). The results of TaqMan and molecular beacon are basically coincident with the coincident rate of 88.89%. 18 cell cultures with CPE were detected and find 16 positive, among which, 14 were civet cats (87.5%). The detecting results of animal samples from Dongmen Market (Shenzhen) and other markets and farms in peripheral areas show that: the total positive rate of 4 kinds of wild animal (civet cat, raccoon dog, hog-badge and Chinese ferret-badge) is 39.02% , which has an significant difference (P < 0.01) compared with the positive rate of other animals as 0. The positive rate of PCR for nasal and fecal swabs from 109 major wild animals is 44.04%, but the positive rate of 145 wild live-animals is 0. CONCLUSION TaqMan and molecular beacon PCR methods both can be used in SARS detection.The results could support the hypothesis that animals (especially civet cat) could carry SARS virus.

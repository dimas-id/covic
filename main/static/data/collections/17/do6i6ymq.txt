Abstract Pneumonia remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases in the world. The important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases especially in the elderly population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganisms. Because elderly individuals present with comorbidities, particular attention should be paid for multidrug-resistant pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most frequently encountered pathogen. Enteric gram-negative rods, as well as anaerobes, should be considered in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Interventions for modifiable risk factors will reduce the risk of this infection. The adequacy of the initial antimicrobial therapy and determination of patientsâ€™ follow-up place is a key factor for prognosis. Also, vaccination is one of the most important preventive measures. In this section it was focused on several aspects, including the atypical presentation of pneumonia in the elderly, the methods to evaluate the severity of illness, the appropriate take care place and the management with prevention strategies.

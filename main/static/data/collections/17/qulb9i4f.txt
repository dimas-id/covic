The investigation deals with in vitro clonal propagation of L. aestivum L. (summer snowflake), a threatened Amaryllidaceae plant species in Bulgaria used in the pharmaceutical industry as raw material for production of galanthamine-based medicines. Plants of known origin and with different alkaloid profile were taken from the living collection of the Institute of Botany, Sofia. Bulbs were used to initiate in vitro cultures and 24 clones were multiplied. The influence of the clone origin on the propagation coefficient, shoot and bulblet morphology, alkaloid profile and content of galanthamine, lycorine, and four related alkaloids was evaluated. Clones kept stable alkaloid profiles and for most of them, high regeneration rates were noted. Galanthamine content of some clones was commensurable with that of Bulgarian populations of L. aestivum of commercial importance. Five clones: four galanthamine-type and one lycorine-type were selected as promising for further investigation.

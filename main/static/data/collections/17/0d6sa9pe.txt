Abstract A relationship between the infecting dose and the risk of disease severity has not been demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report three clusters of individuals that were exposed to diverse inoculi in Madrid and overall developed divrgent clinical forms of COVID-19. Our data support that a greater SARS-CoV-2 inoculi at the time of exposure might determine a higher risk of severe COVID-19.

Summary Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of Antiwei, a traditional Chinese prescription, in the treatment of influenza. Methods In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 480 adults aged 18 to 65 years within 36 h of onset of influenza-like symptoms. There were 225 patients with confirmed influenza. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 6 g of Antiwei (n = 360) or placebo (n = 120) twice daily for three days. All patients recorded their temperature and symptoms on diary cards during treatment. Analyses were performed in both the influenza-like population and the influenza-confirmed population. Results Antiwei increased patientsâ€™ recovery by 17% (P < 0.001), and reduced the severity of illness measured by the median symptom score by 50% (P < 0.001) in both the influenza-like and the influenza-confirmed populations, compared to placebo. The influenza-confirmed patients reported reductions in the severity of fever (P = 0.002), cough (P = 0.023) and expectoration (P = 0.004) after one-day of treatment with Antiwei, compared to placebo. The adverse event profiles were similar for Antiwei and placebo. Conclusion Antiwei was effective and well tolerated in treatment of natural influenza infection in adults. Antiwei represents a clinically valuable intervention in the management of influenza.

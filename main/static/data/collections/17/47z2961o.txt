In this chapter, “On Sci-Fi’s Good China, Bad China,” examines China Mountain Zhang (1992) and On Such a Full Sea (2014). In both works, the universal duality of “good cop, bad cop,” utopia and dystopia, sinophilia and sinophobia, is attributed to the rise of China as the world power and the scourge of the world. In Maureen F. McHugh’s and Chang-rae Lee’s sci-fi novels, they trade the police badge of justice and violence for the Chinese face—a countenance of beauty and bastardy, awesome “China Mountain” that somehow infects with the suggestive C-illness in Lee.

A 31-year-old man developed diarrhea, fatigue, and intermittent fever for 2 weeks. The past few days he had experienced increasing dyspnea and dry cough. Ambulatory reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Because of elevated D-dimer (1.5 mg/L), a lung scintigraphy (V/Q scan) was performed as SPECT/CT. Ventilation SPECT showed reduced ventilation with central nuclide deposition, whereas perfusion SPECT was inconspicuous, excluding pulmonary embolism. However, the low-dose CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities as previously described in COVID-19. This case highlights the procedure and findings of V/Q scanning (without embolism) in COVID-19.

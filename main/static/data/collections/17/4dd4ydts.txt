This editorial considers studies which establish our current understanding of SARSCoV-2 and the indicated direction for treatment of COVID-19 patients and future research. Recent modelling studies point to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on hemoglobin as a key element in understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. This would suggest that the focus of treatment of COVID-19 would need to shift towards maintaining the oxygen carrying capacity of blood; potentially with blood transfusions and super-oxygenation, perhaps including hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Further, early prevention of thromboembolism, and suppression of the immune response due to hemoglobin damage, may help contain the clinical course.

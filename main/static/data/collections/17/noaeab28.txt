Circoviruses are small circular DNA viruses causing severe pig and poultry disease, recently identified in various bat species worldwide. We report the detection and full-genome molecular characterization of a novel bat-associated Circovirus identified in faecal samples of Miniopterus schreibersii bats (Schreiberâ€™s bent-winged bats) from Sardinia, Italy. Full-genomic sequencing revealed a new putative member of Circoviridae family, with a genome size of 2063 nt. Sequencing allowed the characterization of the two major ORFs, inversely arranged, encoding replicase and capsid proteins, as well as the finding of a polythymidine tract within the genome, and highlighted phylogenetic relationships of the novel virus. This is the first report of circovirus in European bats. Giving the high level of genetic diversity of bat circoviruses, it is paramount to further investigate the relationships between these viruses and bats.

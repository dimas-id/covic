Summary The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health crisis. Significant delays in the rapid development and distribution of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection have prevented adequate public health management of the disease, impacting the timely mapping of viral spread and the conservation of personal protective equipment. Furthermore, vulnerable populations such as those served by Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net hospital in New England, represent a high-risk group across multiple dimensions, including a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions and substance use disorders, lower health maintenance, unstable housing, and a propensity for rapid community spread, highlighting the urgent need for expedient and reliable in-house testing. Here, we report the implementation of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RT-PCR assay with rapid turnaround time enabling more informed decisions with personal and public health ramifications. This work provides a blueprint for academic centers and community hospitals lacking capital-intensive automated laboratory machinery to implement in-house testing.

SARS-CoV-2 causes substantial morbidity and mortality in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, particularly in retirement homes, where transmission from asymptomatic staff and visitors may introduce the infection. Here we present a cheap and fast approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 in single or pooled gargle lavages ('mouthwashes'). With this approach, we test all staff at a nursing home daily over a period of three weeks in order to reduce the risk that the infection penetrates the facility. This or similar approaches could be implemented to protect hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions in this and future viral epidemics.

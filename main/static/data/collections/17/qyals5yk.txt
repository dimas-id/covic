Since the outbreaks of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis occurring in maternity hospitals of Paris and suburbs in 1979-1980, it has been possible to examine by light and electron microscopy gut specimens from ten newborns with this illness. Coronavirus-like particles, enclosed in intracytoplasmic vesicles of damaged epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa, were observed in the small intestine, appendix, and colon. The ultrastructural study, supported by bacteriologic findings, suggests the role of coronavirus-like particles in the appearance of the lesions. Secondary proliferation of mainly anaerobic bacteria, probably responsible for pneumatosis, may aggravate the disease.

To suppress the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei province, a medical rescue team consisting of 860 members was sent to E'zhou, one of the hard-hit cities in east Hubei. A total of 414 of the team members, whose core members were from Guizhou Medical University and its Affiliated Hospital, took over the full operation of Leishan hospital of E'zhou, a makeshift hospital built for treating COVID-19 patients. Under the instructions by the E'zhou Medical Team Front Command, the staff made quick responses to the surging number of patients with COVID-19 and rapidly formulated treatment plans based on the local conditions. The medical team efficiently carried out the operations and successfully completed the rescue mission. Herein the authors, as members of Guizhou Medical Team supporting COVID-19 containment in E'zhou, analyze and summarize the experiences of Guizhou Medical Team with the organization, implementation and logistic support of medical rescue operations, which may provide reference for future rescue missions in a similar scenario.

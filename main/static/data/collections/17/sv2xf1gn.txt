Background: Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) has become the gold standard treatment for organ-confined prostate cancer. However, no proper surgical approach or appropriate postsurgical management of RALP has been established for a patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Here, we present a case of a peritoneal dialysis patient who underwent RALP and reinstated peritoneal dialysis with no trouble associated with peritoneal dialysis. Case Presentation: The patient was a 61-year-old man with organ-confined prostate cancer. He had been on peritoneal dialysis for 2 years. The peritoneal dialysis catheter was routed subcutaneously from the left lateral region into the abdominal cavity at the paramedian region. RALP was performed by the transperitoneal anterior approach. The surgical maneuver was not influenced by the peritoneal dialysis catheter at all. At the end of surgery, the incised peritoneum was sutured and closed tightly. After surgery, peritoneal dialysis was temporarily interrupted for 2 weeks. Then it was safely reinitiated with no complications. Conclusion: Transperitoneal RALP with complete peritoneal repair can be a standard treatment option for a prostate cancer patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

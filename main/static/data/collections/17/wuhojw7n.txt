Efficient delivery of functional nucleic acids into specific cells or tissues is still a challenge for gene therapy and largely depends on targeted delivery strategies. The folate receptor (FR) is known to be overexpressed extracellularly on a variety of human cancers and is therefore an outstanding gate for tumor-targeted Trojan horse-like delivery of therapeutics. In this study, an amphiphilic and biodegradable ternary copolymer conjugated with folate as ligand, polyethylenimine-graft-polycaprolactone-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol) was synthesized and evaluated for targeted siRNA delivery via folate-FR recognition. The amphiphilic character of similar polymers was shown previously to support endosomal release of endocytosed nanocarriers and to promote formation of long circulating micelles. The obtained PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol exhibited less cytotoxicity in comparison with the corresponding ternary copolymer without folate (PEI-PCL-PEG) and with unmodified PEI25kDa. Stable micelle-like polyplexes with hydrodynamic diameters about 100 nm were found to have a zeta potential of +8.6 mV, which was lower than that of micelleplexes without folate-conjugation (+13-16 mV). Nonetheless, increased cellular uptake and in vitro gene knockdown of PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol/siRNA micelleplexes were observed in SKOV-3 cells, an FR overexpressing cell line, in comparison with the nonfolate-conjugated ones. Moreover, PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol/siRNA micelleplexes exhibited excellent stability in vivo during the analysis of 120 min and a longer circulation half life than hyPEI25kDa/siRNA polyplexes. Most interestingly, the targeted delivery system yielded 17% deposition of the i.v. injected siRNA per gram in the tumor after 24 h due to the effective folate targeting and the prolonged circulation.

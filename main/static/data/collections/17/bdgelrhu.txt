New collaboratory opportunities in ultrastructural research and diagnostics are now available on the Internet through the combination of digital image acquisition, remote operation of modern digitally controlled and automated electron microscopes, and the development of software specifically tailored for collaboratory needs. Remote experts can examine samples directly, and unique instruments can be utilized from anywhere. In the case of diagnostic dilemmas, the second-opinion expert is no longer constrained by problems inherent in the interpretation of preselected images. The remote examiner can independently choose the area of interest on the sample as well as select the appropriate magnification for an accurate diagnosis. With these capabilities and together with teleconferencing tools and securely accessible databases on-line, telepathology can provide increased effectiveness and support for diagnostics, research, and teaching in many areas. The authors report their experience with remote electron microscope diagnoses of pathological samples using two different dynamic imaging systems and discuss the main technical issues encountered. It appears that only minor technical issues need to be resolved before ultrastructural telepathology can be promoted for routine use in areas with high-speed Internet access.

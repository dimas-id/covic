BACKGROUND Single-port surgery was developed by the evolution of the laparoscopy. The advantage of this new method is mainly cosmetic, but the risk of the hernia-owing to the larger port-increased. CASE REPORT A 71-year-old man was admitted with a left lateral inguinal hernia and gallbladder stones. After preparation of the sac of the hernia, a single-port was inserted into the lateral ring and a cholecystectomy was performed. The operation was completed by the reconstruction of the abdominal wall using a polypropylene mesh. The total operating time was 85 minutes. CONCLUSION In the case of the combined operation, the defect of the abdominal wall could be used as a location of the single port, and the trauma of the abdominal wall could be avoided. This is the first publication about single-port cholecystectomy where the ring of the inguinal hernia was used as a placement site of the single port.

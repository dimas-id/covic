PURPOSE Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard surgical treatment for rectal cancer. The roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy have become more defined, accompanied by improvements in preoperative staging and histopathological assessment. We analyse our ongoing results in the light of changing patterns of treatment over consecutive time periods. METHODS In total, 151 consecutive patients underwent potentially curative rectal excision for cancer in a single institution. Management and outcomes were compared between 1993-1999 and 2000-2007 which corresponded with the restructuring of the regional oncological services. RESULTS We found an increase in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy after 1999 (20/89 vs 1/62, p < 0.001). There was an increase in the mean number of lymph nodes examined (11.9 vs 9.4, p = 0.037). The locoregional recurrence rate was 5.3%. The rates were not significantly different between the two study periods [4/89 (4.5%) 1999-2007 vs 4/62 (6.5%) 1993-1999, p = 0.597]. There was no statistical difference in overall or disease-free survival in the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS Increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy and concomitant improvement in lymph node assessment did not translate into a concurrent reduction in the local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival rates. Our results demonstrate the enduring benefit of specialist training in TME in the outcome of rectal cancer surgery. This observational study suggests that low local recurrence rates are surrogate markers for improved overall and disease-free survival. Multidisciplinary team practice should be examined and made cost effective according to the individual unit's local recurrence rate in the light of this and other reports.

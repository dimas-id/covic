Osteoarthritis (OA) is a global disease that, despite extensive research, has limited treatment options. Pet dogs share both an environment and lifestyle attributes with their owners, and a growing awareness is developing in the public and among researchers that One Medicine, the mutual co-study of animals and humans, could be beneficial for both humans and dogs. To that end, this Review highlights research opportunities afforded by studying dogs with spontaneous OA, with a view to sharing this active area of veterinary research with new audiences. Similarities and differences between dog and human OA are examined, and the proposition is made that suitably aligned studies of spontaneous OA in dogs and humans, in particular hip and knee OA, could highlight new avenues of discovery. Developing cross-species collaborations will provide a wealth of research material and knowledge that is relevant to human OA and that cannot currently be obtained from rodent models or experimentally induced dog models of OA. Ultimately, this Review aims to raise awareness of spontaneous dog OA and to stimulate discussion regarding its exploration under the One Medicine initiative to improve the health and well-being of both species.

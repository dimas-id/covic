Instruments designed to measure the performance of public health systems at state and local levels were supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and implemented in 2002. This article describes the process and outcomes of a system and tool designed to measure performance of State Public Health Laboratory Systems, accomplished by the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) in partnership with CDC. We describe the process used to develop the instrument and its subsequent pilot testing and field testing in 11 states. Throughout the field testing and early implementation phases, both CDC and APHL recognized that the core rationale for measuring system performance would be to provide the basis for subsequent system improvement. APHL implemented the Laboratory System Improvement Program (L-SIP) in 2007 and conducted an evaluation of the field testing of the instrument and related materials that same year. We conclude with a summary of future implications for L-SIP, the program's recognition as an international standard for laboratory systems, and the critical importance of its continuation.

RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease and became a global issue. Treatment of COVID-19 especially in solid organ transplant recipients is empirical and controversial, especially the adjustment of the immunosuppressants. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 29-year-old kidney transplant recipient with the symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. DIAGNOSES: COVID-19 pneumonia after kidney transplantation. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with modified immunosuppressants (unchanged dose of tacrolimus and oral corticosteroids while discontinuing mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)), antibiotics, interferon &#945;-2b inhalation and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: He recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia after 29 days of hospitalization. And the renal function (measured as blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urine protein) returned to normal. LESSONS: In certain group of COVID-19 (e.g., mild to moderate cases, young patients without comorbidities), a reduction instead of an overall withdrawal of immunosuppressant in kidney transplant recipients is feasible.

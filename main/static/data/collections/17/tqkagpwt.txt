Abstract Objective To investigate the association between the cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14)-159C/T (rs2569190) gene polymorphism and susceptibility to acute brucellosis in an Iranian population. Methods The study included 153 Iranian patients with active brucellosis and 128 healthy individuals as the control group. Genotyping of the CD14 variant was performed using an amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method. Results The prevalence of CD14-159 TT and CT genotypes were associated with increased risk of brucellosis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.993, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.07–3.71, P = 0.03 for CT; OR = 3.869, 95% CI = 1.91–7.84, P = 0.01 for TT genotype. Additionally, the minor allele (T) was significantly more frequently present in brucellosis patients than in controls (61% vs. 45%, respectively), and was a risk factor for brucellosis (OR = 3.058, 95% CI = 1.507–6.315, P = 0.01). Conclusions The findings provided suggestive evidence of association of the CD14-159C/T gene polymorphism with susceptibility to acute brucellosis in the Iranian population.

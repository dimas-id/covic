Publisher Summary The threat posed by terrorism remains many years ahead. Bioterrorism remains a real threat, but because actual incidents remain at a low level, complacency is a constant enemy; hence the continuing background of false alarms may indeed be beneficial, encouraging responding agencies to keep practiced and alert. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) model of an integrated intelligence and forensic approach is a useful model for other nations of similar size or maturity to consider as a measured contribution to a whole of government approach to threats posed by bioterrorism. The Australian microbial forensic capability is reliant on the combined and coordinated efforts of numerous government facilities, departments, and agencies within law enforcement and public health at the state, territory, and commonwealth levels, as well as the private sector. It is a shining example of how a coordinated effort can provide a comprehensive capability that does well to protect the Australian community. The AFP and Australian Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Data Center also work closely with international law enforcement partners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The contribution of these and other international partners can be understated in the ongoing united effort to protect the citizens and assets of Australia and other countries against bioterrorism.

Ocular complications in critical care patients are common. There has been a surge in intensive care admissions following the COVID-19 outbreak. The management of COVID-19 exposes patients to a number of specific risk factors for developing ocular complications, which include non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Consequently, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of ocular complications secondary to the management of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit setting, and these complications could lead to permanent visual loss and blindness. Increased awareness of eye care in the intensive care unit setting is therefore vital to help prevent visual loss and maintain quality of life for patients recovering from COVID-19.

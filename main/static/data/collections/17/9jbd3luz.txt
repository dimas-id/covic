This chapter reviews the position of the government officials in Taiwan as well as that of foreign governments on the political status of the Republic of China (ROC), or more specifically whether the ROC has become a State, after its move to Taiwan. The chapter begins by detailing the constitution of the ROC and then briefly describes the exile of the ROC government to Taiwan after losing the control of mainland China to the Communists in a civil war. The rule of the ROC in Taiwan is outlined as is the position of the United States and the United Nations towards the international status of the ROC and People’s Republic of China (PRC) in representing the State of China. The chapter then discusses the reforms of the ROC under the Presidency of Lee Teng-hui and the “special state-to-state relationship,” followed by the position of the next President Chen Shui-bian regarding the international status of the ROC. Finally, the chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the positions of Presidents Ma Ying-jeou and Tsai Ing-wen on the political status of the ROC.

Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy is currently the standard for treatment of small renal mass. Recently, robot-assisted single site surgery has been introduced. However, there have been few reports of retroperitoneal approaches. Herein, we report initial case series of retroperitoneal single-site robot-assisted partial nephrectomy using the da Vinci Xi surgical system using the Lapsingle Vision advanced access platform. Three patients have undergone retroperitoneal single-site robot-assisted partial nephrectomy due to incidental finding of renal mass. Operation duration, estimated blood loss, warm ischemia time, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change, and complication were evaluated. Renal cell carcinoma of the two clear cell type and one chromophobe was diagnosed based on the pathological examination. Initial two cases were successfully completed with minimal bleeding and warm ischemic time within 25 minutes. The last 3rd case has been converted to multiport operation due to limited retroperitoneal space and difficulty in managing upper pole renal mass. Retroperitoneal single-site robot-assisted partial nephrectomy is a feasible treatment modality for treatment of posterior or lateral renal masses. Additional cases are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this technique.

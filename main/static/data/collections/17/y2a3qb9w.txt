BACKGROUND It has been evident for a while that the result after resection for colon cancer may not have been optimal. Several years ago, this was showed by some leading surgeons in the USA but a concept of improving results was not consistently pursued. Later, surgeons in Europe and Japan have increasingly adopted the more radical principle of complete mesocolic excision (CME) as the optimal approach for colon cancer. The concept of CME is a similar philosophy to that of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer and precise terminology and optimal surgery are key factors. METHOD There are three essential components to CME. The main component involves a dissection between the mesenteric plane and the parietal fascia and removal of the mesentery within a complete envelope of mesenteric fascia and visceral peritoneum that contains all lymph nodes draining the tumour area (Hohenberger et al., Colorectal Disease 11:354-365, 2009; West et al., J Clin Oncol 28:272-278, 2009). The second component is a central vascular tie to completely remove all lymph nodes in the central (vertical) direction. The third component is resection of an adequate length of bowel to remove involved pericolic lymph nodes in the longitudinal direction. RESULT The oncological rationale for CME and various technical aspects of the surgical management will be explored. CONCLUSION The consensus conference agreed that there are sound oncological hypotheses for a more radical approach than has been common up to now. However, this may not necessarily apply in early stages of the tumour stage. Laparoscopic resection appears to be equally well suited for resection as open surgery.

Two camps continue to evolve in the field of structural biologyâ€”a 'systems-oriented' camp, which studies proteins or complexes carefully one system at a time, and a 'discovery-oriented' one, which studies proteins of entire families, pathways or genomes. The end goals of both camps are the same: to decipher the atomic-resolution structures and mechanisms of biological macromolecules and understand them in the context of the living cell.

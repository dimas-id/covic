Spigelian hernias are a rare abdominal wall hernia. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and outcomes of patients who underwent a laparoscopic spigelian hernia repair. A retrospective study was performed reviewing all patients who had a laparoscopic spigelian hernia repair. We assessed the success of the procedure including conversion rates, postoperative morbidities, and recurrence rates. Forty patents had a laparoscopic repair. Two thirds (n=25) had an intraperitoneal repair. There was no conversion to open repair. Four patients had postoperative morbidities. At 6-month follow-up all patients were pain free, with 1 recurrence. There is considerable evidence supporting the opinion that laparoscopic repair offers excellent outcomes. This report is the largest series to date, and we advocate that this approach should become the standard of care.

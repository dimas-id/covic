Optimal treatment of acute bronchiolitis is currently unclear. In a double-blind study, we found no significant differences between inhaled epinephrine and nasal decongestant in hospitalized infants with acute bronchiolitis regarding length of hospitalization, need for oxygen supplementation, or intravenous fluids and clinical score. Nasal decongestant is as effective as inhaled epinephrine in acute bronchiolitis.

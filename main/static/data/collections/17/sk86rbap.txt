Dear Future AWWA Members, I'm writing to you on the 139th birthday of the American Water Works Association, and what a strange time it is We are in the midst of a global pandemic A disease called COVID‐19 is spreading so quickly that we are running short on hospital beds and people are hoarding toilet paper At this moment, the United States has more confirmed cases than any other country and Canada is ranked 15th But I am not writing to tell you about the tragedy of COVID‐19;I imagine the history books will capture that This is a letter about how today's water professionals are rising to the challenge through their selfless and often uncelebrated acts of courage They are building on the legacy of water professionals throughout AWWA's history, and I wish you were here to witness it As you—the future AWWA—look back on spring 2020, you will clearly see how access to safe, reliable water was critical in halting the spread of COVID‐19 The simplest example I can provide is handwashing The practice of handwashing for at least 20 seconds, with plenty of soap, has never seemed so important Now, we are a society uniformly obsessed with washing our hands Because tap water is critical to personal hygiene and protecting the public's health, the US Environmental Protection Agency this week sent a letter to all governors, reminding them that water utility workers and water sector businesses that support water utilities should be considered “essential” as communities impose orders to keep people at home And in another sign of the essential nature of water service in a public health crisis, utilities are suspending water shutoffs and, in many cases, restoring service to customers who had previously been shut off But it isn't these policy decisions I hope you'll remember It's the exemplary—and yes, courageous—commitment of your predecessors in the water profession Each day, water professionals are delivering safe water to their communities and then cleaning the wastewater before returning it to the environment Never has this daily routine seemed more extraordinary These days, we are all being asked to participate in “social distancing,” a term that most had never heard of before COVID‐19 As schools and restaurants close and citizens are ordered to stay at home, your predecessors in the water profession continue to do what it takes to keep the water flowing, whether that is repairing mains, unclogging sewer lines (you can't imagine what some people do in the absence of toilet paper!), or ensuring treatment equipment is functioning properly Many water professionals are stationed 24/7 at treatment plants They are living apart from their own families so they can protect all of our families The ongoing pandemic has given our society new appreciation for the work of health professionals, police, and other first responders I would say that water professionals are not only first responders, but “everyday” responders They are the super‐heroes we don't need to summon because they are already on the scene I am certain that in time we will be able to return to a more normal state, where a handshake is a handshake and not an elbow bump And when we do, I hope that we—and the people who live in the communities we serve—remember that water is critical to everything we care about and that it played a crucial role in eliminating COVID‐19 It is not an overstatement to say that others’ lives were in the hands of water professionals during the pandemic Poet and philosopher George Santayana is known for saying, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it ” In this case, however, it would be wise to remember and repeat selfless acts like those of water professionals facing COVID‐19 in the spring of 2020 In closing, Happy Birthday, AWWA, and my thanks to all who are members today and in the future Your commitment to the legacy of safe and reliable water service is, quite literally, life‐saving Sincerely, David B LaFrance Chief Executive Officer, American Water orks Association

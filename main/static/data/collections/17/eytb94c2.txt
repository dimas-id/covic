Neonatal sepsis remains a significant global problem with little progress made despite major efforts. At present, there is a lack of an accepted international consensus on the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal sepsis; the unclear understanding of the pathogenesis of neonatal sepsis leads to blindness in treatment, which will result in an unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome. In addition, some serious diseases caused by noninfectious factors, such as trauma, stress, asphyxia, and so on, have very similar pathophysiological results with neonatal sepsis. In this review we synthesize the recent advances in definition, incidence, causative agents, risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis. Of course, there are still many challenges to neonatal sepsis in many ways.

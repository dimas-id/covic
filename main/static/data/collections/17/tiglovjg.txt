BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Transfascial sutures (TFS) are a standard component of laparoscopic ventral herniorrhaphy (LVHR) that contribute to the durability of repair, but also pain and, resultantly, hospital stay. We sought to examine LVHR without TFS in obese patients with small abdominal wall hernias. METHODS Between September 2002 and December 2007, 174 patients underwent LVHR at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Patients with BMI >30kg/m(2) and small primary abdominal wall hernias were eligible for repair without TFS. Correlation between BMI, defect surface area, operative time, and postoperative stay was assessed. RESULTS Fourteen patients underwent LVHR with no TFS, 2 with normal BMI and recurrent hernia after open repair and 12 with BMI >30 kg/m(2) and primary small hernia. Mean age was 38.8 years. The average defect size was 5.3cm(2); mean operative time (OT) was 42 minutes. Eleven patients (92%) were discharged home the day of surgery. No infectious or bleeding complications occurred. One patient required chronic pain management, and 8 patients (67%) developed seromas that resorbed spontaneously. There was no hernia recurrence at 7-month follow-up. CONCLUSION LVHR is feasible without TFS provided the hernia defect is small. Surgery can be performed on an outpatient basis in obese individuals with minimal postoperative morbidity.

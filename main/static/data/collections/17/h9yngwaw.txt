Corona virus disease 2019 is a global pandemic, which affects around 2million individuals with a high death rate that exceeds 90,000 death cases across the globe. The Saudi Heart Association and the national cardiopulmonary resuscitation committee developed a taskforce to discuss the magnitude of clinical situation and CPR management on COVID-19 patients in a prehospital and in-hospital settings. Meanwhile, the taskforce aims to develop a nation-wide clinical guidance to be used by health care workers and untrained laypersons to resuscitate COVID-19 suspected and diagnosed patients.

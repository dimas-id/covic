Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSC) retaining proliferation and multi-differentiation potential may support the central nervous system (CNS) regeneration. Multipotency of MSC may result in both desirable and undesirable cells, post-transplantation. A better strategy to attain desired cells may be in vitro commitment of hADMSCs to uni-/bi- potent neural progenitor cells (NPCs), prior to transplantation. Derivation of stable NPCs may require a suitable niche eliciting proliferation and differentiation signals. The present study designed a biomimetic niche comprising insoluble fibrin supported adhesion matrix and exogenously added growth factors (GFs) for deriving different neural cells and established the role of Notch and Wnt signals for proliferation and differentiation of hADMSCs, respectively. The stable transformation of hADMSCs into neurospheres (NS) comprising Nestin+ve NPCs was achieved consistently. Slight modifications of niche enable differentiation of NS to NPCs; NPCs to neurons; NPCs to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs); and OPCs to oligodendrocytes (OLG). Fibrin plays a crucial role in the conversion of hADMSC to NS and NPCs to OPCs; but, not essential for OPC to OLG maturation. Co-survival and cell-cell interaction of NPC derived neurons and OPCs promoting OLG maturation is illustrated. The designed biomimetic niche shows the potential for directing autologous ADMSCs to neural cells for applications in regenerative medicine.

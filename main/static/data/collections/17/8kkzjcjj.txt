COVID-19 is a treacherous disease, in which infected patients who appear to fare well can deteriorate rapidly, mostly due to respiratory failure. For general practitioners (and other first-line responders), a clinical evaluation at any given time merely provides a snapshot of the patient's condition. Therefore, frequent monitoring is warranted in at-risk patients. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach for monitoring, treatment and referral decisions. This is particularly the case in patients with advanced age. In this article, through the use of case examples, we aim to provide guidance when facing difficult management decisions in patients with (suspected) COVID-19.

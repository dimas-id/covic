The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The difficulty to control the viral spread due to the absence of vaccines and prophylactics measures has raised concerns about prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it becomes more and more crucial the reduction of environmental risk factors through viral inactivation of aerosols and fomites. Photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms by light energy emitted in the visible spectrum region (VIS), not harmful for mammalian cells and safe for humans, has recently been described. A LED-device emitting a special combination of frequencies in the visible light spectrum was tested on SARS-CoV-2 infected cell surnatant dilutions in order to evaluate the antiviral efficacy. This preliminary in vitro study showed for the first time the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 through LED irradiation of visible spectrum wavelengths. If further and more extensive studies will confirm these data, the usage of this LED could potentially have a big impact on the sanitization of virtually all human environments.

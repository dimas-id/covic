Using a method for pathogen screening in DNA synthesis orders, we have identified a number of amino acid sequences that distinguish 2019-nCoV (Wuhan Coronavirus) from all other known viruses in Coronaviridae. We find three main regions of unique sequence: two in the 1ab polyprotein QHO60603.1, one in surface glycoprotein QHO60594.1.

OBJECTIVE Management of cornual gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) has never been reported. Here, we describe the first case of cornual GTN. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old woman was diagnosed with left cornual GTN after evacuation of a complete mole. Laparoscopic cornuostomy was performed with intramural vasopression injection and barbed sutures. Histopathology revealed hydropic chorionic villi. Complete hydatidiform mole was diagnosed, and treated with adjuvant methotrexate, to address the poor decline of β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels during follow-up. The β- human chorionic gonadotropin levels declined to < 1 mIU/mL 9 months after cornuostomy. She successfully conceived 16 months after cornuostomy, and underwent cesarean section at 37 gestational weeks due to concomitant severe preeclampsia. CONCLUSION Cornual GTN can be successfully managed with laparoscopic cornuostomy and adjuvant methotrexate.

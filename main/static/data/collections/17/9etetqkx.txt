The most common phacomatoses in children that need surgical attention are neurofibromatosis 1 and 2, tuberous sclerosis complex, Sturge-Weber disease, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, and neurocutaneous melanocytosis. All are rare and, as genetically determined disorders, all complex multisystem diseases with multiple manifestations outside the CNS. Diagnostics, management recommendations, and surgical care are age-specific and require individualization. The lifelong multidimensional disease burden demands a multidisciplinary and well-coordinated management approach. The consequence of these boundary conditions is that management of children with a phacomatosis is everything else but simple, straight forward, and intuitive. This Special Annual Issue is designed to serve as an up-to-date encyclopedic reference for all aspects of management of phacomatoses in the pediatric age group.

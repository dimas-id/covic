For more than 20 years, sepsis has been defined as symptoms associated with the response to microorganism infection, which was more specifically called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). With the evidence of organ failure, it was called severe sepsis, and this could lead to hypotension (septic shock). However, with the deep understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, sepsis has been known as both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Additionally, the classic use of SIRS could lead to overestimation of sepsis. For example, usual common cold could be identified as sepsis in classic definition. With this background, new sepsis definition, Sepsis 3, was introduced and sepsis was defined as a “life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.” The management of sepsis has been changed dramatically, with the development of Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which substantially increased the survival of sepsis. However, this is not with the help of a new drug, but the implementation of a treatment system. Unfortunately, no specific drug for sepsis has survived in clinical use even though many candidate drugs have been successfully investigated in preclinical setting, and this leads to the new approach to the sepsis.

We report a review of all the experimental and clinical studies performed in the last 60 years on the antiviral activity of inactivated Corynebacterium Parvum (Cutibacterium acnes). This bacterium has been originally investigated and used for its oncolytic properties linked to immunomodulating activity, but the interest to successfully prevent and treat bacterial, fungal and viral infections and lethality, uprising the innate immunity barriers produced many experimental models and very few clinical studies. The dramatic defenceless situation due to impending CoViD‚Äê19 pandemic claims to exhume and highlight this aspecific strategy in preventive and therapeutic settings; as a matter of fact no new or mutated virus can potentially escape to this strong innate immune surveillance strengthened by adequate C.parvum protocols.

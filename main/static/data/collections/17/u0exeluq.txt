Although murine coronaviruses naturally infect only mice, several virus variants derived from persistently infected murine cell cultures have an extended host range. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) variant MHV/BHK can infect hamster, rat, cat, dog, monkey, and human cell lines but not the swine testis (ST) porcine cell line (J. H. Schickli, B. D. Zelus, D. E. Wentworth, S. G. Sawicki, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 71:9499-9507, 1997). The spike (S) gene of MHV/BHK had 63 point mutations and a 21-bp insert that encoded 56 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert compared to the parental MHV strain A59. Recombinant viruses between MHV-A59 and MHV/BHK were selected in hamster cells. All of the recombinants retained 21 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert found in the N-terminal region of S of MHV/BHK, suggesting that these residues were responsible for the extended host range of MHV/BHK. Flow cytometry showed that MHV-A59 bound only to cells that expressed the murine glycoprotein receptor CEACAM1a. In contrast, MHV/BHK and a recombinant virus, k6c, with the 21 amino acid substitutions and 7-amino-acid insert in S bound to hamster (BHK) and ST cells as well as murine cells. Thus, 21 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert in the N-terminal region of the S glycoprotein of MHV/BHK confer the ability to bind and in some cases infect cells of nonmurine species.

Morgagni hernia is a rare type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia found in the anterior aspect of the diaphragm. It typically presents in the pediatric population and rarely is diagnosed in adults. Only 3% of diaphragmatic hernias are the Morgagni type, and only 4% of these are found to present bilaterally. Surgical repair of Morgagni hernia has been performed through various approaches including open, laparoscopic, thoracotomy, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), all with and without mesh. The optimal method of surgical repair is not known due to the rarity of this condition and the limitations of setting up a prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the different methods. Laparoscopic repair with mesh has been described with good short-term results. Few case reports exist in the world literature describing laparoscopic repair of a bilateral Morgagni hernia with mesh. At the University of Washington, the authors present a video showing their technique for laparoscopic repair of a congenital, bilateral Morgagni type hernia with mesh.

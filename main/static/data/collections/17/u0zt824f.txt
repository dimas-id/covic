The addition of the word “catastrophic” to the term antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was proposed 20 years ago by Ronald Asherson when he published an editorial in The Journal of Rheumatology describing a group of patients who develop multiple thrombosis in a short period of time and with a much worse prognosis than that attributed to patients with classic APS [1]. Since then, many cases have been published reporting patients with this devastating variant of the APS.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Determining reference values for hematological and biochemical parameters of Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) is important for wildlife research to protect human health in surrounding communities. This study aimed to establish the reference values for selected hematology and serum clinical chemistry analyses that may contribute to research on shrew in future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples (n=51) were collected from shrews between July and December 2015, Bangladesh, to estimate the levels of hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total leukocyte count (TLC), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, calcium, phosphorus (P), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), urea, glucose, total protein (TP), creatinine, and alanine transaminase (ALT). RESULTS: Although the values did not differ significantly among sexes, age was found to be a significant factor. Hb, PCV, TEC, glucose, and P were higher in males; eosinophil, Na, Cl, TP, and ALT were higher among females. Adults had significantly greater urea and glucose (p<0.05) while juveniles had insignificantly higher values for TLC, PCV, neutrophil, P, and TP. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first reference values for this species in Bangladesh and can be used to guide wildlife research studies.

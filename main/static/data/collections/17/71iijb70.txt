Abstract Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus cause acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, especially in children and the elderly. Early treatment for these infections is thought to be important, so simple and sensitive detection methods are needed for use at clinical sites. Therefore, in this study, real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays with quenching primer for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were developed. Evaluation of a total of 113 clinical specimens compared to real-time RT-PCR assays showed that the novel assays could distinguish between the types and subtypes of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus and had 100% diagnostic specificity. The diagnostic sensitivity of each assay exceeded 85.0% and the assays showed sufficient clinical accuracy. Furthermore, positive results could be obtained in around 15 min using the novel assays in cases with high concentrations of virus. The developed assays should be useful for identifying influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus cases not only in experimental laboratories but also in hospital and quarantine laboratories.

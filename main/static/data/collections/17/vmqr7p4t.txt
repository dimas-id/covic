SARS‐CoV‐2 is spreading worldwide, and is a pandemic virus that has infected almost 5 million individuals and causing 300.000 deaths, as of mid‐May 2020. Because SARS‐CoV‐2 is a new virus in humans there are currently no vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or even effective drugs available. Human convalescent plasma transfusion is an option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of COVID‐19 patients, but its administration to patients who are affected by severe pulmonary disease is associated with increased risk of transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI).

INTRODUCTION Golimumab (GLM) is a subcutaneously administered human anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent that has been approved by the regulatory authorities for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) in 2013. Areas covered: Maintained clinical remission rates up to 50% have been shown in UC patients receiving GLM, and higher GLM serum concentrations have been associated with improved clinical outcomes. Approximately 50% of UC patients do not respond to induction therapy with GLM, and up to 40% of GLM responders will lose response over time. In most patients, loss of response is associated with low serum GLM concentrations, which suggests insufficient exposure to GLM. Low GLM serum concentrations may be avoided by therapeutic drug monitoring. Expert commentary: So far, the therapeutic window for GLM has not yet been defined, but options to dose increase GLM based on therapeutic drug monitoring might result in improved clinical outcome and higher success rates.

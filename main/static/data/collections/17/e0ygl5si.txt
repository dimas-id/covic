In this paper, we provide a general framework for understanding the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) from a biopsychosocial perspective. More specifically, we provide an overview of the recent research on how the complex interactions of environmental, psychological, and biological factors contribute to the development and maintenance of the FGID. We emphasize that considering and addressing all these factors is a conditio sine qua non for appropriate treatment of these conditions. First, we provide an overview of what is currently known about how each of these factors - the environment, including the influence of those in an individual's family, the individual's own psychological states and traits, and the individual's (neuro)physiological make-up - interact to ultimately result in the generation of FGID symptoms. Second, we provide an overview of commonly used assessment tools which can assist clinicians in obtaining a more comprehensive assessment of these factors in their patients. Finally, the broader perspective outlined earlier is applied to provide an overview of centrally acting treatment strategies, both psychological and pharmacological, which have been shown to be efficacious to treat FGID.

Objective: To conduct an early estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number (BRN) induced by government interference, and to project resulting day to day number of in-patients, ICU-patients and cumulative number of deaths in a Danish setting. Method: We used the Kermack and McKendrick model with varying basic reproduction number to estimate number infected and age stratified percentages to estimate number of in-patients, ICU-patients and cumulative number of deaths. Changes in basic reproduction number was estimated based on current in-patient numbers. Results: The basic reproductive number in the time period of February 27th to March 18th was found to be 2.65, however, this number was reduced to 1.99 after March 18th.

The Maastrichtian carbonates of the Tarbur Formation from the Zagros zone (SW Iran) are very rich in larger Foraminifera. Additionally, smaller benthic Foraminifera occur as well, one of them presented here as Covidaria pinnata n. gen., n. sp. It occurs abundantly at the Mandegan section within two levels corresponding to the lower photic zone. Based on the existence of a central pile along with an umbilical plate, and the lacks of true interiomarginal apertures, likely represented by a perforate surface, the suprageneric placing of Covidaria n. gen. remains controversial. The ultimate aperture is represented by a central elongate double-bifid slot that arguably lies on a finely perforated and heavy feathered apertural face. Based on the reduced dimensions and lack of dimorphism the new taxon could be considered an epifaunal or shallow-infaunal r-strategist.

Trocar site hernia arising from 8 mm robotic port is very rare despite the increasing prevalence of robot-assisted surgeries. To date, there had been only a single case reported in the literature. We report a case of small bowel obstruction secondary to an interparietal trocar site incisional hernia after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Meticulous closure of 8 mm robotic trocar sites associated with large peritoneal defect at the end of surgery should be performed.

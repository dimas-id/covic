Aneurysms within the internal acoustic canal are rare. We report the case of a 71-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from a ruptured distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery which was not detected on initial radiological examination. A second rupture was detected by contrast-enhanced computed tomography and successfully treated by endovascular coil embolization. The patient recovered without neurological deficits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an intrameatal aneurysm treated by endovascular coil embolization. We suggest endovascular coil embolization as an alternative to open surgery, even in cases of deep intrameatal aneurysm.

Exogenous pulmonary surfactant, widely used in neonatal care, is one of the best-studied treatments in neonatology, and its introduction in the 1990s led to a significant improvement in neonatal outcomes in preterm infants, including a decrease in mortality. This chapter provides an overview of surfactant composition and function in health and disease and summarizes the evidence for its clinical use.

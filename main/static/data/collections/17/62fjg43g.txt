During branched endovascular aneurysm repair, cannulation of the visceral target vessels through antegrade branches and insertion of bridging stents are frequently done from an upper extremity access. A retrograde femoral approach is a challenging alternative when an antegrade approach is not preferred. Herein, we describe a technique to increase stability of a steerable sheath, using a single suture, for bridging antegrade-facing branches from a retrograde access. This technique secures the sheath's deflected tip and provides more pushability to the steerable sheath.

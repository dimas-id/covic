OBJECTIVE Acute occlusions of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and a major intracranial artery respond poorly to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and present an endovascular challenge. The aim of our study was to retrospectively delineate the feasibility of the combined use of emergent carotid stenting and intra-arterial (IA) Abciximab with intracranial revascularization in the setting of acute ischemic stroke and carotid occlusions at our institution. METHODS Eleven patients with complete cervical carotid occlusion with or without concomitant intracranial ICA and/or MCA occlusion were identified from a single center, retrospective review of patients admitted to the Stroke unit. We evaluated all cases for complications of emergent cervical ICA recanalization employing carotid stenting and IA Abciximab. RESULTS All patients had complete cervical carotid occlusion with (n = 8) or without (n = 3) concomitant intracranial ICA and/or MCA occlusion. Successful emergent cervical ICA recanalization was achieved in all cases. All patients were administered IA Abciximab (dose range 6-17 mg, average 11.4 mg) immediately following the cervical carotid stenting. There was complete recanalization in all patients with no procedural morbidity or mortality. A single case (1/11, 9%) developed asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Upon discharge, 9 patients (9/11, 82%) had a mRS of 0-2 and 2 patients (2/11, 18%) had a mRS of 3. CONCLUSIONS In acute ICA-MCA/distal ICA occlusions, extracranial stenting followed by intracranial IA Abciximab and thrombectomy appears feasible, effective, and safe. Further evaluation of this treatment strategy is warranted.

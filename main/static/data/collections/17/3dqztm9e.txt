Traditionally the focus for control of food-borne disease has been bacteria. During the last decade viruses have emerged as important sources of food borne human disease. Since the traditional bacteriological indicators, are not reliable for viral contamination, new methods are needed. PCR has enhanced the detection of virus in food. A challenge for developing detection reliable methods for viruses in food is that food matrices vary in composition, high sequence variability and inhibitors may be present. Therefore it is necessary to develop assays that have high diagnostic sensitivity, are broad and robust, and combine sample concentration and removal of inhibitors.

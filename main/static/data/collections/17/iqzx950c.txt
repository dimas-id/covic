In response to the researchers need in the bio-medical domain, we opted for automating the bibliographic research stage. In this context, several classification models of supervised machine learning are used. Namely the SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, and Gradient Boosting. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study between experimental results of full article classification and abstract classification approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate our results by using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. We observe that the abstract approach outperforms the full article approach in terms of learning time and efficiency.

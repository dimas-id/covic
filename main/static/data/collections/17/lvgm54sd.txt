Avian reovirus (ARV) is an important agent of several diseases causing considerable losses in poultry farming. An outer capsid protein (σC) of ARV, is known as a virus-cell attachment protein essential for virus infectivity. In this study, the σC gene of ARV was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed recombinant protein was used as immunogen for raising a specific IgY antibody in laying hens. At 14 weeks post immunization, the antibody titers in serum and egg yolk reached 302,000 and 355,000, respectively. The IgY antibody was capable to neutralize ARV in BHK-21 cells and it strongly reacted in ELISA with ARV but not with heterologous viruses. The IgY antibody detected ARV in field samples of infected animal tissues in dot blot assay. These results suggest that an efficient, economic and rapid diagnostics of ARV can be performed routinely using the IgY antibody against a recombinant ARV σC protein.

We analyzed COVID-19 data through April 16, 2020 using a partially observed Markov process. Our method uses a hybrid deterministic and stochastic formalism that allows for time variable transmission rates and detection probabilities. The model was fit using iterated particle filtering to case count and death count time series from 51 countries. We found evidence for a declining transmission rate in 42 of the 51 examined countries. Of those 42 countries 34 have significant evidence for subcritical transmission rates, although the decline in new cases are relatively slow compared to the initial growth rates. This suggests that global scale social distancing efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are effective although they need to be strengthened in many regions and maintained in others to avoid further resurgence of COVID-19. The slow decline also suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed before social distancing efforts are partially relaxed.

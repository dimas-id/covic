BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Acute tonsillitis is one of the most common reasons for application to otorhinolaryngology clinics. In the treatment of acute tonsillitis, supportive therapies are mostly used. As antibiotic therapy, penicillin or erythromycin can be used. The aim of this study is to decrease the clinical recovery time of acute tonsillitis by providing parenteral treatment and daily cleaning of tonsillar lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with an age range of 15-60 years were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group used an i.v. combination of ampicillin + sulbactam and the tonsillar membranes of patients were cleaned daily. The second group used only the i.v. combination of ampicillin + sulbactam. RESULTS Patients who received antibiotherapy and debridement had a clinical improvement of 90% on the 2nd treatment day and 95% on the 5th treatment day. The patients receiving only antibiotics had a clinical improvement of 65% on the 5th treatment day and 75% on the 7th treatment day. The recovery time of both groups was significantly different (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The solution and technique used in this clinical study showed that patients with acute tonsillitis could recover in a very short time without any complications.

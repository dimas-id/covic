In order to accurately admit children with COVID-19 to an isolation ward, our study retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of children in isolation wards during the COVID-19 epidemic. It was found that 55 cases (83.3%) had fever and 48 cases (72.7%) coughed in the isolated area, 31 cases (47%) had a history of exposure, 26 cases (39.4%) had a decrease in lymphocytes (LYM), more than half had an increase in lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase isoenzyme, 14 cases (21.2%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, 58 cases (87.9%) had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT), and 11 cases (16.7%) had sinus arrhythmia. Therefore, for some suspected children with COVID-19, we can make a comprehensive judgment through clinical symptoms, epidemiological history, LYM number, myocardial enzyme spectrum, chest CT, and electrocardiogram; put these children in an isolation ward for treatment; and then transfer them to a general ward for treatment after excluding COVID-19.

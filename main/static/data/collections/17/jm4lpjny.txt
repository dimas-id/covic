OBJECTIVE Outcome prediction in comatose patients with acute brain injury remains challenging. Regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) derived from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a surrogate for cerebral blood flow and can be used to calculate cerebral autoregulation (CA) continuously at the bedside from the derived cerebral oximetry index (COx). We hypothesized that COx derived thresholds for CA are associated with outcomes in patients with acute coma from neurological injury. METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted in 88 acutely comatose adults with heterogenous brain injury diagnoses who were continuously monitored with COx for up to 3 consecutive days. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate association between averaged COx and short (in-hospital and 3 mo) and long-term (6 mo) outcomes. RESULTS Six month mortality rate was 62%. Median COx in nonsurvivors at hospital discharge was 0.082 [interquartile range, IQR: 0.045 to 0.160] compared with 0.042 [IQR: -0.005 to 0.110] in survivors (P=0.012). At 6 months, median COx was 0.075 [IQR: 0.27 to 0.158] in nonsurvivors compared with 0.029 [IQR: -0.015 to 0.077] in survivors (P=0.02). In the multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for confounders, average COx ≥0.05 was associated with both in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-7.33, P=0.02), mortality at 6 months (adjusted OR=4.4, 95% CI=1.41-13.7, P=0.01), and severe disability (modified Rankin Score ≥4) at 6 months (adjusted OR=4.4, 95% CI=1.07-17.8, P=0.04). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting mortality and severe disability at 6 months were 0.783 and 0.825, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Averaged COx ≥0.05 is independently associated with short and long-term mortality and long-term severe disability in acutely comatose adults with neurological injury. We propose that COx ≥0.05 represents an accurate threshold to predict long-term functional outcome in acutely comatose adults.

The authors report that TEM with a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port can be facilitated by the use of a colonoscope instead of a conventional laparoscopic camera. The colonoscope can be inserted through one of the SILS channels and has the added benefit of flexibility, insufflation, irrigation, suction, and an operative port.

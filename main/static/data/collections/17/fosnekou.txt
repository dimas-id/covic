Abstract Patients infected with the new SARS-CoV-2 appear to be associated with higher risk of thromboembolic disease, especially stroke and pulmonary embolism. We report a case of a 79-year-old woman that presented with stroke and was found to have COVID-19 pneumonia and concomitant large burden pulmonary arterial clot. Early imaging of suspected thromboembolic disease may lead to improved patient morbidity and mortality.

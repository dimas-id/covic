The endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke has become a standard procedure. The combination of multiple neuroendovascular devices provides more possibilities for the improvement of the thrombectomy technique. We describe a modified retrieval technique using a distal intracranial catheter (DIC) for the semi-retrieval of stentriever during the thrombectomy procedure. The retrograde semi-retrieval technique involves completely unfolding the stent retriever by pulling a Navien catheter and the partial re-sheath of a retrievable stent forming a tapered configuration by pushing the Navien catheter, which results in the thrombi being embedded into the strut, securing the clot within the stent and there being a shorter distance for the clot to travel. This technique may lessen the occurrence of thrombus fragmentation and injury to the vessel wall. The retrograde semi-retrieval technique is an optional thrombectomy technique that may improve the efficiency of this procedure in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

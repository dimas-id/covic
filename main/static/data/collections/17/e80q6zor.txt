BACKGROUND DeBakey type I aortic dissection is a catastrophic event that presents a formidable challenge to cardiovascular surgeon. Here, we evaluate a new combined surgical and endovascular technique for acute condition. METHODS Between December 2011 and December 2015, 12 patients with type I aortic dissection concomitant involving supra-aortic vessels underwent ascending aortic replacement and simultaneous stent grafts inserted into the descending aorta, left subclavian, and left carotid arteries, and into the innominate artery when possible, without arch replacement. The stent grafts, Gore TAG thoracic endoprosthesis and Viabahn, were deployed under visual guidance through opened aortic arch into the true lumen, with the techniques of circulatory arrest, moderate hypothermia, and bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion. RESULTS Operation was performed smoothly in all patients. There was one death, and the other 11 recovered without any neurological deficits. Follow-up computed tomography scans showed that the true lumen expanded and false lumen regressed in both arch and descending aortic segments in 1 year. The diameter did not increase in either arch or descending aortic segments. CONCLUSION Ascending aortic replacement and stent graft for supra-aortic arteries and the descending aorta without arch replacement are feasible options for type I aortic dissection with satisfactory short-term aortic remodeling.

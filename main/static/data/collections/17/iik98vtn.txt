Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a class I treatment for cardiovascular disease, however, underutilization of these services remains. Home-based CR (HBCR) models have been implemented as a potential solution to addressing access barriers to CR services. Home-based models have been shown to be effective, however, there continues to be large variation of protocols and minimal evidence of effectiveness in higher risk populations. In addition, lack of reimbursement models has discouraged the widespread adoption of HBCR. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an even greater gap in CR care has been present due to decreased availability of on-site services. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a time to highlight the value and experiences of home-based models as clinicians search for ways to continue to provide care. Continued review and standardization of HBCR models are essential to provide care for a wider range of patients and circumstances.

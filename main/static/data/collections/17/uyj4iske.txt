The world currently faces a pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2. Relevant information has emerged regarding the higher risk of poor outcomes in lung cancer patients. As such, lung cancer patients must be prioritized in terms of prevention, detection and treatment. On May 7th, 45 experts in thoracic cancers from 11 different countries were invited to participate. A core panel of experts regarding thoracic oncology care amidst the pandemic gathered virtually, and a total of 60 initial recommendations were drafted based on available evidence. By May 16th, 44 experts had agreed to participate, and voted on each recommendation using a Delphi panel on a live voting event. Consensus was reached regarding the recommendations (>66% strongly agree/agree) for 57 questions. Strong consensus (>80% strongly agree/agree) was reached for 45 questions. Patients with lung cancer represent a particularly vulnerable population during this time. Special care must be taken to maintain treatment while avoiding exposure.

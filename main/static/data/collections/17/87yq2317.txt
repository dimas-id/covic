A surveillance program for influenza A viruses (H5N1) was conducted in live bird and food markets in central Thailand during July 2006–August 2007. Twelve subtype H5N1 viruses were isolated. The subtype H5N1 viruses circulating in the markets were genetically related to those that circulated in Thailand during 2004–2005.

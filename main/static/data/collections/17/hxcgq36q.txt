A 64-year-old woman who underwent surgery for ovarian cancer, but were unable to be resected and were directly infiltrated at the terminal ileum, and the ileostomy in the oral side of the terminal ileum was performed as a palliative operation. Prolapse of the ileostomy appeared approximately 17 months after the operation, and after 19 months, the blood circulation disorder of the intestinal tract and the reduction of prolapse became difficult. Since the patient's systemic condition was poor, anesthesia was not enforced, and an ileostomy reconstruction was performed using a stapling device while performing mild sedation. During the operation, the patient was unconscious, and the operation time was 29 minutes, and the general condition was not abnormal. In this paper, we report noninvasive local correction of loop ileostomy prolapse using a stapling device for a patient in the terminal phase of malignancy.

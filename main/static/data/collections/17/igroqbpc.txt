BACKGROUND Several sites have been used for ovarian cortex transplantation (OCT) in humans. The present study was designed to evaluate different intra-abdominal transplantation sites in the baboon to gain further knowledge about alternative transplantation sites in a human setting. METHODS Autologous fresh OCTs were performed in 12 baboons (Papio anubis). Four different sites were tested: the free portion of the omentum (OMF), the portion of the omentum adjacent to the spleen (OMS), the pouch of Douglas (D) and the pelvic wall on the psoas muscle (PW). Cortex survival, follicle density, cyclicity and hormonal levels were compared between the different sites, 3 and 6 months after transplantation. RESULTS Macroscopically, antral follicles were only found in the OMS and OMF locations, which also showed a higher proportion of follicle-containing cortex at light microscopy (OMF 71.4%, OMS 83.3% versus PW 58.8% and D 40%, P< 0.05). Higher densities of primordial [OMF: 3.54 (0-13.18) follicles/grid, OMS: 3.85 (0-8.53), PW: 0 (0-13.25), D 0 (0-1.33), P< 0.05] and primary follicles [OMF: 3.54 (0-18.52), OMS: 3.85 (0-1), PW: 0 (0-4.58), D 0 (0-0.25), P< 0.05] was also found in the omental locations. CONCLUSIONS Omental locations provide a better site, in terms of follicle survival, for intra-abdominal OCT in the baboon compared with the pelvic wall and the D.

Nanotechnologies are considered to be of growing importance to the vaccine field. Through decoration of immunogens on multivalent nanoparticles, designed nanovaccines can elicit improved humoral immunity. However, significant practical and monetary challenges in large‐scale production of nanovaccines have impeded their widespread clinical translation. Here, an alternative approach is illustrated integrating computational protein modeling and adaptive electroporation‐mediated synthetic DNA delivery, thus enabling direct in vivo production of nanovaccines. DNA‐launched nanoparticles are demonstrated displaying an HIV immunogen spontaneously self‐assembled in vivo. DNA‐launched nanovaccines induce stronger humoral responses than their monomeric counterparts in both mice and guinea pigs, and uniquely elicit CD8+ effector T‐cell immunity as compared to recombinant protein nanovaccines. Improvements in vaccine responses recapitulate when DNA‐launched nanovaccines with alternative scaffolds and decorated antigen are designed and evaluated. Finally, evaluation of functional immune responses induced by DLnanovaccines demonstrates that, in comparison to control mice or mice immunized with DNA‐encoded hemagglutinin monomer, mice immunized with a DNA‐launched hemagglutinin nanoparticle vaccine fully survive a lethal influenza challenge, and have substantially lower viral load, weight loss, and influenza‐induced lung pathology. Additional study of these next‐generation in vivo‐produced nanovaccines may offer advantages for immunization against multiple disease targets.

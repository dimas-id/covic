BACKGROUND Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) is the most effective bariatric surgical procedure, but major concerns exist about the nutritional consequences. OBJECTIVES The study reported weight loss and nutritional outcomes of 80 patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years. SETTING The follow-up was conducted at a university hospital as well as in a private practice institution in France. METHODS Eighty patients operated on between February 2002 and May 2006 were reviewed. Weight outcomes were analyzed as well as complete biological status. Revisions were reported as well as the number of patients taking vitamin supplementation. RESULTS A follow-up of 141 ± 16 months was available for 87.7% of the patients at least 10 years from surgery. Preoperative BMI decreased from 48.9 ± 7.3 to 31.2 ± 6.2 kg/m2 with an EWL of 73.4 ± 26.7% and a TWL of 35.9% ± 17.7%. Despite weight regain ≥10% of the weight loss in 61% of the cases, 78% of the patients maintained a BMI <35. Fourteen percent of the patients had a revision. Normal vitamin D levels were found in 35.4%. The overall PTH level was 91.9 ± 79.5 ng/mL, and 62% of the patients had hyperparathyroidism. Other deficiencies were less frequent but fat-soluble deficiencies as well as a PTH >100 ng/mL were significantly associated with the absence of vitamin supplementation. CONCLUSION BPD/DS maintains a significant weight loss, but remains associated with side effects leading to revision and multiple vitamin deficiencies. The most severe deficiencies are related to the lack of supplementation compliance.

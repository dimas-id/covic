BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with conventional laparoscopic TEP repair for the treatment of inguinal hernias. To date, no other studies have compared the LESS and conventional laparoscopic TEP approaches for the treatment of inguinal hernia in a prospective randomized study setting. METHODS For this study, 100 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair were prospectively randomized into either the LESS TEP group or the conventional laparoscopic TEP group. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were recorded. The primary end point was postoperative pain. The patients were interviewed at outpatient clinics at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS The demographic data were comparable between the two groups. The median operative time was longer in the LESS TEP group (63.5 min) than in the conventional TEP group (50.5 min) (p = 0.001). No conversion was performed in either group. The mean pain score 2 h postoperatively during rest was significantly higher in the conventional TEP group than in the LESS TEP group (3.9 vs. 2.6; p = 0.02). The postoperative results were comparable between the groups in terms of analgesic requirements, systemic stress responses, complications, and postoperative convalescence. CONCLUSIONS The LESS TEP technique is associated with a longer operative time but offers the minor benefit of a reduction in immediate postoperative pain.

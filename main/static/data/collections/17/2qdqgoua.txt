OBJECTIVE To investigate the pulmonary function in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients during the convalescent period. METHODS Followup 89 outpatients of SARS. The follow-up study included interview, physical examination, and pulmonary function test. RESULTS The interval between hospital discharge and functional assessment was 1.75 +/- 0.53 months (0.5-3.4 months). Mild to moderate abnormalities in pulmonary function were found in 48 patients (53.9%). Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) was impaired in 38 patients (42.7%); in 7 patients (7.9%), lung function was restrictive defect combined DLco impairment; Other patterns of impairment were revealed in 3 patient. Dyspnea during acute phase and CT during the convalescent period were found to have significant influences on DLco and total lung capacity (TLC). CONCLUSIONS Diffusing capacity impairment as well as restrictive defect persist in convalescence SARS.

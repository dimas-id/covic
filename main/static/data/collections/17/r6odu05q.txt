We examined some epidemiological features of the viruses associated with gastrointestinal illness, using national data reported by electron microscopists in the United Kingdom. During the 3 years analyzed (1985â€“1987), a total of 1,993 positive detections of astroviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, and small round structured viruses (SRSVs) were reported. In 1 year of this period, 8,210 rotaviruses were reported. More than 90% of the astroviruses and caliciviruses were detected in children under 5 years of age, while coronaviruses and SRSVs were detected in adults as well as children. Detections of astroviruses increased in the winter and were infrequent during the summer, a seasonal pattern similar to that observed for rotaviruses. There was some variability between reporting regions in rates of detection of fecal viruses. We have attempted to identify the reasons for this. We make suggestions for improving the detection of human fecal viruses, and we recognize the need for continued surveillance of these agents.

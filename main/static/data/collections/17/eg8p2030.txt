Community quarantine has been resorted to by various governments to address the current COVID-19 pandemic; however, this is not the only non-therapeutic method of effectively controlling the spread of the infection. We study an SEIR model with nonlinear incidence rates, and introduce two parameters, and {varepsilon}, which mimics the effect of quarantine (Q). We compare this with the Q-SEIR model, recently developed, and demonstrate the control of COVID-19 without the stringent conditions of community quarantine. We analyzed the sensitivity and elasticity indices of the parameters with respect to the reproduction number. Results suggest that a control strategy that involves maximizing and {varepsilon} is likely to be successful, although quarantine is still more effective in limiting the spread of the virus. Release from quarantine depends on continuance and strict adherence to recommended social and health-promoting behaviors. Furthermore, maximizing and {varepsilon} is equivalent to a 50% successful quarantine in disease-free equilibrium (DFE). This model reduced the infectious in Quezon City by 3.45% and Iloilo Province by 3.88%; however, earlier peaking by nine and 17 days, respectively, when compared with the results of Q-SEIR.

Abstract Common marmosets are susceptible to a number of bacterial infections, which may be enzootic, causing sporadic but occasionally severe disease, or which may result in epizootics associated with more severe colony morbidity and mortality. The spectrum of these diseases often differs from those observed in macaque species, and veterinarians caring for common marmosets need to be aware of these unique susceptibilities. In formulating differential diagnoses for sick or diseased animals, it should be recognized that diseases once common in imported animals in the 1960s and 1970s are now rare. It is also important to recognize that housing and sanitation conditions can influence exposure to potentially pathogenic bacteria. In a zoological setting where mixed- or free-ranging exhibits are utilized, animals may be exposed to many more potential pathogens than would be the case in animals raised in a barrier facility.

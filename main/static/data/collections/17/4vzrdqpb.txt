The mannose binding proteins on the surface of the dendritic cells are responsible for capture of pathogens in the early stages of immune response. Conjugation to mannose dendrimers is a rarely explored but potentially powerful strategy for enhancing immunogenicity of synthetic peptides relying on direct delivery to dendritic cells. We describe a general protocol for preparation of pure, monodisperse third-generation mannosylated poly-L-lysine dendrimer-peptide conjugates using direct, machine-assisted Fmoc/t-Bu solid phase peptide synthesis. The glycodendrons were elaborated onto the N- or C-terminus of sequences derived from HIV-1 gp41, SARS-CoV S2 protein, and Influenza Hemagglutinin (consisting of 15-44 residues). The products were obtained in a homogeneous state after cleavage from the resin, deprotection, and a single purification on semipreparative RP-HPLC.

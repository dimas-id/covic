The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bovine torovirus (BoTV) in bovine fecal samples and to determine whether a relationship exists between BoTV and diarrhea in Japan. Ninety-nine diarrheic and 114 normal fecal samples from calves in Hokkaido Prefecture and 38 diarrheic fecal samples from calves in 10 other prefectures were examined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with primers designed in the spike (S) gene for the presence of BoTV. The specimens were also examined for the presence of other enteric pathogens, bovine rotavirus, coronavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. BoTV RNA was detected in 15 (15.2%) of the 99 diarrheic samples from Hokkaido and in 9 (23.7%) of the 38 diarrheic samples from the other prefectures. The incidence of BoTV in control specimens was 7.0%. In 11 of the 15 BoTV-positive specimens from Hokkaido, BoTV was the only pathogen detected among those examined, and 11 BoTV-positive specimens were obtained from calves less than 2 weeks of age. Rotavirus was confirmed to be associated with calf diarrhea, but coronavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. were not. Nucleotide sequences of 17 different BoTV RT-PCR products were determined. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences revealed that Japanese BoTVs could be classified into at least two groups. This study showed that BoTV is a common virus in fecal specimens of calves with diarrhea in Japan and may be an important pathogen of cattle, principally in young calves less than 2 weeks of age.

Abstract A novel two-step real-time RT-PCR assay using SYBR® Green I was developed for the detection of acute Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDV) infection in whole blood from cattle. During infection animals experience a characteristic transient leucopenia and the number of cells per volume of blood changes over time; so quantitation of viral load by reference to a cellular housekeeping gene is not ideal as this may hide significant animal to animal variation. Therefore, to facilitate comparison of different samples, an external RNA reference was used for normalisation whereby each sample was spiked with the RNA virus, Canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov), prior to RNA extraction, for comparative purposes. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out with two primer sets designed to amplify either a 156bp region of the BVDV 5′-UTR or a 280bp region of the CECov nucleocapsid protein gene. Linearity and efficiency of the assay was established and the method assessed using samples from BVDV-challenged calves. Viral RNA was quantified on days 6 and 14 post-challenge by real-time RT-PCR. Infectious virus isolation by traditional cell culture was negative after day 7. This study demonstrates encouraging results for rapid, sensitive and reliable detection of acute BVDV infection and provides an alternative real-time RT-PCR method for use on whole blood samples or samples where suitable housekeeping genes are not available.

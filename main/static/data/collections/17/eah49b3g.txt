It is estimated that viruses play a role in 30% to 80% of asthma exacerbations. Thus, virus vaccination in patients with asthma could play an important role in preventing asthma exacerbations and other complications. Influenza is the only agent for which a routine vaccine is currently available. This article discusses whether influenza vaccination in patients with asthma, based on the available evidence, is justified. Cost-effectiveness of (influenza) vaccination for patients with asthma is questionable. For the other major viruses involved, the present state of affairs is described. Although progress is being made, a vaccine may be available in the near future only for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Meanwhile, clinicians and patients should aim for an optimal treatment with the currently available asthma medication.

BACKGROUND The Global Mood Scale (GMS; [Denollet, J., 1993a. Emotional distress and fatigue in coronary heart disease: the Global Mood Scale (GMS). Psychol Med 23, 111-121., Denollet, J., 1993b. The sensitivity of outcome assessment in cardiac rehabilitation. J Consult Clin Psychol 61, 686-695.]) was originally developed as a measure of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) in cardiac patients. The purpose of this study was to examine its two-factor affect model in the realm of stress, depression, and fatigue in working adults. METHODS Affect, stress, depression, and fatigue were assessed with validated questionnaires in a sample of 228 adults (49.6% male; mean = 41.4 +/- 9 years) from the working population. RESULTS The GMS PA and NA scales were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = .94 and alpha = .93, respectively), and correlated in the expected direction with their corresponding mood scales from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Factor analyses of the 40 mood terms comprising the GMS and PANAS yielded one common PA-dimension, but two NA-dimensions reflecting emotional exhaustion (GMS) and anxious apprehension (PANAS) as different components of the stress process. A relatively high mean NA score of the GMS suggested that these working adults perceived terms that refer to malaise/deactivation as being relevant to describe their negative affective status. The GSM-NA scale was related to stress, depression and fatigue while the GMS-PA scale was positively associated with quality of life. LIMITATIONS This study is based on a cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS The association between the PA (negative correlation) and NA (positive correlation) scales of the GMS and perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and fatigue supports the validity of its two-factor model. Assessment of both PA and NA may benefit a better understanding of emotional distress in adults from the working population.

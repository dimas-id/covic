OBJECTIVE: To determine whether topical applications of thiosulfinate-enriched Allium sativum extract (TASE) can accelerate acute cutaneous wound healing (WH) in a murine model. METHODS: Keratinocyte viability and in vitro wound closure were assessed in keratinocyte cultures. Effects of topical TASE (0.5 µg/mL of allicin in 97% ethanol) on acute cutaneous WH were determined in a murine model of acute cutaneous wound. Twelve mice were alternately assigned to the vehicle- and TASE-treated groups (n=6 per group). Expression levels of mRNA for keratinocyte differentiation marker-related proteins (filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin) and lipid synthetic enzymes (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4), fatty acid synthase (FA2H), 3-hydroxy- 3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA), and serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)) were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on day 3 and 8 after wounding, while transepidermal water loss (TEWL) rates were measured in wounded areas. RESULTS: TASE accelerated WH both in vivo (40% vs. 22% reduction in wound area, P<0.01) and in vitro (90% vs. 65% reduction in wound area, P<0.01). Moreover, topical applications of TASE upregulated the expression levels of epidermal mRNA for ELOVL4, HMGCoA, SPT, filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin (P<0.05 vs. vehicle-treated controls) on day 3 after wounding. Likewise, TASE significantly lowered TEWL rates in comparison with vehicle alone on day 8 (33.06±2.09 g/(m2·h) vs. 24.60±2.04 g/(m2·h), P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Topical applications of TASE stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and formation of epidermal permeability barrier function, leading to acceleration of acute cutaneous WH. Topical products containing TASE could be used to manage acute cutaneous WH.

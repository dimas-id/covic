An evaluation of the Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel was performed on 404 clinical respiratory specimens. Clinical sensitivities and specificities of the assay compared to those of the reference methods were 80.0% to 100.0% and 98.9% to 100.0%, respectively. Correct genotyping information was provided for 95.5% of influenza virus A specimens. The closed-tube format of the assay simplified the workflow and minimized carryover contamination.

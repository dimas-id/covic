BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is increasing worldwide; however, long-term follow-up results included insufficient weight loss and weight regain. This study aims at assessing the outcomes of converting LSG to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic re-sleeve gastrectomy (LRSG). METHODS A total of 1300 patients underwent LSG from 2009 to 2012, of which 12 patients underwent LRYGB and 24 patients underwent LRSG in Al-Amiri Hospital alone. Data included length of stay, percentage excessive weight loss (EWL%), and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS Twenty-four patients underwent conversion from LSG to LRSG, and 12 patients underwent conversion from LSG to LRYGB due to insufficient weight loss and weight regain. Eighty-five percent were females. The mean weight and BMI prior to LSG for the LRYGB and LRSG patients were 136.5 kg and 52, and 134 kg and 50, respectively. The EWL% after the initial LSG was 37.9 and 43 %, for LRYGB and LRSG, respectively. There were no complications recorded. Results of conversion of LSG to LRYGB involved a mean EWL% 61.3 % after 1 year (p value 0.009). Results of LRSG involved a mean EWL% of 57 % over interval of 1 year (p value 0.05). Comparison of the EWL% of LRYGB and LRSG for failed primary LSG was not significant (p value 0.097). CONCLUSION Following our algorithm, revising an LSG with an LRSG or LRYGB for poor weight loss is feasible with good outcomes. Larger and longer follow-up studies are needed to verify our results.

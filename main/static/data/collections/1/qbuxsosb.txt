As the spread of COVID-19 worldwide progresses, it is important not only to protect human lives, but also to minimize social losses due to economic paralysis by detecting signs of spread at an early stage and predicting future trends accurately. This report introduces a new indicator (K) of the magnitude of the spread of COVID-19 based on daily number of infected people from publicly available data. Transitions of the K can predict effects of measures such as the blockage of cities and social distancing, signs of new spread, and possible regional dependence in the formation of population immunity.

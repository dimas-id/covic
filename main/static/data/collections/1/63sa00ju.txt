Diseases that are predominantly peribronchovascular in distribution on computed tomography by definition involve the bronchi, adjacent vasculature, and associated lymphatics involving the central or axial lung interstitium.

This review will cover clinical and imaging features that may assist in differentiating amongst the various causes of primarily peribronchovascular disease.

A temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus was inoculated intranasally into infant Sprague Dawley rats aged 9 to 17 days. Rats receiving the virus at 9 days of age had an extensive spread of infection throughout the brain and the animals died after a few days. Rats inoculated at day 11 postnatally survived and the infection was limited to the olfactory pathways, hypothalamus, diagonal bands and the anterior raphe nuclei. Stereological measurements showed that the volume of infected neurons constituted 67 Â± 10% of the total neuronal volume in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Double-labelling experiments revealed that both 5-hydroxytryptamine- and substance P-immunoreactive neurons contained the virus antigen. The motor stimulant effect of amphetamine was studied at 3 months post infection. The increase in amphetamine-induced frequency and duration of rearing was significantly attenuated in infected rats and the amphetamine-induced locomotion was slightly reduced.

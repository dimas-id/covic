The new coronavirus disease outbreak in 2019 (COVID-19) represents a dramatic challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. As to viral tropism, lungs are not the only COVID-19 target but also the heart may be involved in a not negligible percentage of the infected patients. Myocarditis-related cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias are the main aftermaths. A few studies showed that myocardial injury in adult patients is often linked with a fatal outcome. Conversely, scientific evidence in children is sparse, although several reports were published with the description of a cardiac involvement in COVID-19 paediatric patients. In these young subjects, a background of surgically treated congenital heart disease seems to be a predisposing factor.Conclusion: This systematic review is aimed at summarizing all COVID-19 cases with a cardiac involvement published in paediatric age and trying to explain the underlying mechanisms responsible for COVID-19-related myocardial damage.What is Known:â¢ Coronaviruses proved to be able to jump from animals to humans.â¢ The outbreak of COVID-19 started from China (Dec 2019) and became pandemic.What is New:â¢ Even in childhood, COVID-19 is not without the risk of cardiac involvement.â¢ Myocarditis, heart failure, and arrhythmias are among the possible manifestations.

In December 2019, a novel outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan city, China. Initially, the zoonitic infection spread from human to human, causing a pandemic. This viral disease (COVID-19) can appear in a variety of forms, from asymptomatic through the spectrum of mild symptoms to severe respiratory failure, requiring intensive care. Caring for this latter group of patients puts a significant burden on health care. The purpose of this summary is to present the practical aspects of intensive care for patients requiring respiratory support and mechanical ventilation. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(17): 678Â­684.

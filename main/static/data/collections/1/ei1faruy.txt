In this research, high voltage static electricity and ultraviolet technologies were integrated to an air purifying device which can be used to trap and kill airborne bacteria and viruses in central air-conditioning systems. An experimental platform was built to mimic the central air system, in which the efficacy of the newly built device was examined. In addition to the standard physical and chemical tests, bacteriophages were used to simulate airborne viruses in the experimental system. The bacteriophage suspension was aerosolized into the air with ultrasonic wave atomization. The result showed that more than 86% removal efficiency of micro-particles (<10 micron in diameter) were removed after the device was in operation in a building and more than 95% of bacteriophages in the experimental system. It is concluded that the integrated air purifier is suitable for controlling air quality and preventing virus transmission through the central air system.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has been thrust to the forefront of health care. Despite its inherent limitations, telemedicine offers many advantages to both patient and physician as an alternative to in-person evaluation of select patients. In the near term, telemedicine allows nonpandemic care to proceed while observing appropriate public health concerns to minimize the spread of pandemic pathogens. Thus, it behooves practitioners to use telemedicine consultations for common otolaryngology complaints. Assessment of the dizzy patient is well-suited to an algorithmic approach that can be adapted to a telemedicine setting. As best practices for telemedicine have yet to be defined, we present herein a practical approach to the history and limited physical examination of the dizzy patient in the telemedicine setting for the general otolaryngologist. Indeed, once the acute crisis has abated, we suspect that this approach will continue to be an effective way to manage dizzy patients.

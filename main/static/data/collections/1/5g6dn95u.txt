Laboratory diagnosis of bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus no longer poses a problem. Clinical diagnosis, based on signs of pulmonary emphysema manifest in autumn, should be confirmed by laboratory techniques. Direct isolation of the BRS virus from field samples in cell cultures is often unsuccessful, whereas detection of the viral antigens by staining ultra-thin tissue sections with fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody conjugates is highly effective. Complement fixation and especially indirect immunofluorescence tests are still very useful for the detection of BRS specific antibodies in serum and nasal mucus.

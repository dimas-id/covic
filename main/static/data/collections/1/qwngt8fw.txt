Susceptible BALB/c mice, after experimental infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3), revealed virus titres in the liver that increased gradually to a peak of 8 Ã— 10(5) PFU/g of tissue after 3 days' infection, when the mice died of acute hepatitis. BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3, subsequently labelled in vivo with (35)S-methionine, and then the liver preparations from both infected and non-infected animals were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparisons of the patterns by computer image analysis revealed 17 gene products which increased, and 8 gene products which decreased, upon virus infection in their two-dimensional gel spot intensity. We conclude that during MHV3 infection of a susceptible strain of mice, a major modification in protein synthesis occurs. The pattern alterations were not related to the virus gene products but were mostly endogenous mouse proteins. Whether these proteins are a result of a defence attempt by the animal, or are dictated by the virus in order to prevent a protective response from happening, remains to be shown.

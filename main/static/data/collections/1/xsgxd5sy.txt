Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen which mainly spreads by droplets. Most published studies focused on adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data concerning pediatric patients is limited. This study aimed to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome and follow-up results. Results: From January 20th to February 27th of 2020, a total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 cases whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65/68, 95.59%) cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. Forty (59.46%) of the infected children were male, and the median age and body weight are 6 (0.10-15.08) years and 24 (4.20-87.00) kg, respectively. Except for one critically ill case, 20 (27.03%) patients did not show any symptoms of infection, 24 (32.43%) patients had acute upper respiratory tract infection and 29 (39.19%) patients were diagnosed with mild pneumonia. Cough (24/74, 32.43%) and fever (20, 27.03%) were the predominant symptoms of 44 (59.46%) symptomatic patients at onset of the illness. Abnormalities in leukocyte count were found in 23 (31.08%) children and 10 (13.51%) children presented with abnormal lymphocyte count. Of the 34 (45.95%) patients who had nucleic acid testing results for common respiratory pathogens, 19 (19 / 34, 51.35%) showed co-infection with other pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2.Ten (13.51%) children had RT-PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 for fecal specimens and 8 of them showed prolonged existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA 11 (5-23) days after nasopharynx swabs turning negative. Abnormalities in chest imaging were observed in 37 (50.00%) patients and 28 (37.84%) of them only presented with nontypical changes.All children had good prognosis with a median hospitalization duration of 11 days and follow-up period of 16.5 days. During the follow-up period, all the patients remained in quarantine at designated site and home for two 14-day obervation periods and showed no clinical manifestation,but 3 of the 8 cases with prolonged fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 still showed positive result of feces test.

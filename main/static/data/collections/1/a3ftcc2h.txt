The tuning fork tests have been under attack since their first use in clinical examination. However, the tuning fork is small and fits into every white coat, and tuning fork tests for hearing are easy, accurate and inexpensive.

After more than 100 years, the tuning fork is not obsolete; tuning fork tests are a very useful if used correctly and for the appropriate indication.

Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgeries performed each year and can be indicated for many gynecologic conditions. The development of minimally invasive surgery has transformed this procedure, resulting in improved outcomes, superior cosmesis, and quicker return to normal function. Vaginal cuff closure is a critical component of hysterectomy, with many variations in surgical technique and materials. This review provides an overview of intracorporeal suturing and knot-tying techniques at the level of a junior resident in obstetrics and gynecology and describes several validated models that have been developed to test resident skill level in vaginal cuff closure. We also provide a review of the literature regarding vaginal cuff closure techniques and suture materials, including knotless barbed sutures. Finally, a brief discussion of single-site surgery, the latest development in minimally invasive hysterectomy, will be provided. We hope to provide a better understanding of vaginal cuff closure for residents in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.

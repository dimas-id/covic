The current period of transition due to COVID-19 emergency may negatively affect the psychological functioning of children and require resources aimed at supporting post-transition adaptation. Few contributions exist which specifically focus on what to do in such circumstances in order to assist the mental health of both children and parents. It seems therefore critical to provide strategies, which support the adjustment of children during the pre-existing and post-transition periods. Furthermore, screening projects are required in order to identify those children with increased levels of emotional and behavioural issues, beyond the COVID-19 transition, in order to plan specific interventions.

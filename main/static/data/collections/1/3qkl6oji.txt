OBJECTIVE Lymphocytic esophagitis (LyE) is a novel, yet poorly described, clinicopathologic entity. The aim of this systematic review was to characterize the demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of LyE in observational studies of adult and pediatric patients. DESIGN We searched the Embase, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases for relevant studies in 2018. Two authors reviewed and extracted data from studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS We identified 20 studies for analysis of demographic, clinical, and endoscopic features of LyE. The mean age ranged from 9 to 67 years. When pooled, there were 231 (52.7%) patients with LyE that were female. The most common presenting symptom was dysphagia reported in 191 (48.8%) patients. On endoscopy, most patients with LyE tended to have abnormal findings (69.0%), which included erosive esophagitis, multiple esophageal rings, linear furrows, and narrow-caliber esophagus. In the 31 studies used to assess the histologic definition, the cut-off number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) was reported in 16 (51.6%) studies, peripapillary IEL specification in 18 (58.1%) studies, and presence of spongiosis in 6 (19.4%) studies. CONCLUSION We identified a spectrum of demographic, clinical, and endoscopic findings characteristic of patients with LyE. A consensus on the diagnostic criteria of LyE is required.

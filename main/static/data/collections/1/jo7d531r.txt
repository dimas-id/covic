PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to review and synthesize the existing evidence and recommendations regarding to the therapeutic and surgical indications as well as monitoring of patients with Penile Cancer in COVID-19 era and to propose an action protocol to facilitate decision-making. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature regarding the management of penile cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed until April 30, 2020. We propose our recommendations based on this evidence. RESULTS: Penile cancer is an uncommon but aggressive disease. Prognosis is determined by several characteristics, being the most important the presence of lymph nodes, in which case, treatment should not be delayed. For these reasons, an initial evaluation is mandatory. Priority classifications, based on the oncological outcomes when treatment is delayed, have been made in order to separate deferrable disease from the one that needs high priority treatment. In penile cancer with low risk of progression, surgical treatment can be delayed, but other options must be considered, like topical treatment or laser therapy. In cases with intermediate risk of progression, surgical treatment may be delayed up to three months, but we must consider radiation therapy and brachytherapy as effective options. When feasible, follow-up should by telemonitoring. CONCLUSIONS: In the COVID-19 era, initial evaluation of the patient is mandatory. Histological diagnosis with local staging is necessary before offering any therapeutic option. In case of superficial non-invasive disease, topical treatment is effective in absence of lymph node involvement. In selected patients, radiotherapy is an organ-preserving approach with good results. Non-deferrable surgical treatment must be performed by an experienced surgeon and as an outpatient procedure when possible. When indicated, iLND should not be delayed since it is decisive for patient survival. Follow-up should be by telemonitoring.

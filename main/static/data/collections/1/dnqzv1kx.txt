PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been demonstrated to be a feasible alternative to multiport laparoscopy, but concerns over port-site incisional hernias have not been well addressed. A retrospective study was performed to determine the rate of port-site hernias as well as influencing risk factors for developing this complication. METHODS A review of all consecutive patients who underwent SILS over 4 years was conducted using electronic medical records in a multi-specialty integrated healthcare system. Statistical evaluation included descriptive analysis of demographics in addition to bivariate and multivariate analyses of potential risk factors, which were age, gender, BMI, procedure, existing insertion-site hernia, wound infection, tobacco use, steroid use, and diabetes. RESULTS 787 patients who underwent SILS without conversion to open were reviewed. There were 454 cholecystectomies, 189 appendectomies, 72 colectomies, 21 fundoplications, 15 transabdominal inguinal herniorrhaphies, and 36 other surgeries. Cases included 532 (67.6 %) women, and among all patients mean age was 44.65 (±19.05) years and mean BMI of 28.04 (±6). Of these, 50 (6.35 %) patients were documented as developing port-site incisional hernias by a health care provider or by incidental imaging. Of the risk factors analyzed, insertion-site hernia, age, and BMI were significant. Multivariate analysis indicated that both preexisting hernia and BMI were significant risk factors (p value = 0.00212; p value = 0.0307). Morbidly obese patients had the highest incidence of incisional hernias at 18.18 % (p value = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS When selecting patients for SILS, surgeons should consider the presence of an umbilical hernia, increased age and obesity as risk factors for developing a port-site hernia.

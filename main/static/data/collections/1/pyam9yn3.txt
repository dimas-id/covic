Recent advances in DNA and protein microarray methodology and the emerging technology of cell-based sensors have massively increased the speed and sensitivity with which we can detect viral infections. The advantages of the multi-parameter microarray technologies could be combined with the speed and sensitivity of cell-based systems to give 'cell-omic' sensors.

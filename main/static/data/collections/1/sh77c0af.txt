Background: Testing is one of the commendable preventive measures against coronavirus disease (COVID_19), and needs to be done using both most appropriate specimen and an accurate diagnostic test like real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT_PCR). However, the detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS_CoV_2) RNA from different clinical specimens after onset of symptoms is not yet well established. For guiding the selection of specimens for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, a systematic review aiming at profiling the positive detection rate from different clinical specimens using PCR was conducted. Methods: The systematic search was done using PubMed/MEDLINE, Science direct, Google Scholar, among others. The search included studies on laboratory diagnosis of SARS_CoV_2 from different clinical specimens using PCR. Data extraction was done using Microsoft Excel spread sheet 2010 and reported according to PRISMA_P guidelines. Using Open Meta Analyst software, DerSimonian_Laird random effects analysis was performed to determine a summary estimate (positive rate [PR]/proportions) and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results: A total of 8136 different clinical specimens were analyzed to detect SARS_CoV_2, with majority being nasopharyngeal swabs (69.6%). Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had a PR of 71.3% (95%CI:60.3%-82.3%) while no virus was detected from the urinogenital specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) specimen had the PR of 91.8% (95%CI:79.9-103.7%), followed by rectal swabs, 87.8 % (95%CI:78.6%-96.9%) then sputum, 68.1% (95%CI:56.9%-79.4%). Low PR was observed in oropharyngeal swabs, 7.6% (95%CI:5.7%-9.6%) and blood samples, 1.0% (95%CI: -0.1%-2.1%), whilst no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine samples. Nasopharyngeal swab, a widely used specimen had a PR of 45.5% (95%CI:31.2%-59.7%). Conclusion: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was highly detected in lower respiratory tract specimens while there was no detected virus in urinogenital specimens. Regarding the type of clinical specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate followed by rectal swab then sputum. Nasopharyngeal swab which is widely used had a moderate detection rate. Low positive rate was recorded in oropharyngeal swab and blood sample while no virus was found in urine samples. More importantly, the virus was detected in feces, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transmission by the fecal route.

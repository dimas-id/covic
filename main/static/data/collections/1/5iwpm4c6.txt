The seroprevalence of human herpesviruses is high and reactivations occur frequently. A microarray was designed and tested for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies for Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) and IgG antibodies against four herpesviruses. Initially, a microarray platform was set up using an unrelated in-house antigen, PUUV recombinant nucleocapsid protein, to optimize the protocol for the detection of antibodies. Detection of the four herpesviruses was set up in a microarray using the recombinant proteins of herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein G1 and G2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein E, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp150 phosphoprotein. The results of the PUUV panel were in good agreement with the PUUV IgG immunofluorescent assay and IgM enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Seropositive and negative clinical reference panels were tested for herpesviruses by the serological microarray, and the results were compared to those of individual EIAs used for standard diagnostic purposes. The serologic microarray for HSV, VZV and CMV antibody detection gave good specificities for IgG. However, sensitivities of the assay varied depending on the herpesvirus detected. The serological microarray showed potential for screening purposes. The microarray based analyses were easy to perform, and HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and CMV antibodies could be detected on the same microarray.

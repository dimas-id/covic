Combined anterior cranial base resection is the mainstay of therapy for skull base malignancies. Improvements in surgical techniques and reconstruction have led to a reduction in morbidity and overall better survival rates. Meticulous attention to dural and skull base reconstruction is essential for reducing the major complications, including cerebrospinal fluid leak and pneumocephalus. Complications can be devastating, but timely effective management can limit the severity.

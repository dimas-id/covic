OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to compare complication rates between peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and peripherally inserted non-central catheters (PINCCs) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). STUDY DESIGN A retrospective, observational study was conducted. The PICCs were catheters whose tip terminated in the vena cavae, and PINCCs were defined as those whose tip fell short of this location. Complication rates were assessed using generalized estimating equations modeling. RESULT A total of 91 PINCCs and 889 PICCs were placed in 750 neonates. In all, 44.0% of PINCCs had a major complication compared with 25.2% of PICCs (P=0.0001). The unadjusted (unadj.) complication rate among PINCCs was 51.7 per 1000 line days and 15.9 for PICCs (unadj. rate ratio: 3.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.32, 4.55). After adjusting for multiple confounders, the risk remained significantly higher for PINCCs (adjusted odds ratio: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.37). CONCLUSION The rate of associated complications with the use of PINCCs in the NICU population is more than twice that of the PICCs.

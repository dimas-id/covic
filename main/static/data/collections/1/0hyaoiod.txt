Health crises shock the population and overwhelm the health services. This article analyzes 30 years of health crises in Spain from a multifaceted perspective: population, patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, politicians, the media and other groups involved. The interaction among all stakeholders shapes the response and management of any health crisis. Heterogeneity of management and of health effectsâ€“contributing to inequalities in health-is common. The participation and coordination of the health services is crucial in detection of the crisis and in modulating the population reactions. Public health services characterized by their low public profile could gain public influence by their role in coordinating politicians and the media when solving important health problems. Analyzing the mistakes and successes in previous crises together with risk and vulnerability assessments, research and drills are essential to give a quick and adequate response to future crises.

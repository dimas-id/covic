The development of a safe and efficient multivalent vaccine has great prospects for application. Both rabies virus (RABV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) are highly infectious antigens, causing lethal diseases in domestic dogs and other carnivores worldwide. In this study, a replication-deficient human adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine, rAd5-G-H, expressing RABV glycoprotein (G) and CDV hemagglutinin (H) protein was constructed. The RABV G and CDV H protein of rAd5-G-H were expressed and confirmed in infected HEK-293 cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The rAd5-G-H retained a homogeneous icosahedral morphology similar to rAd5-GFP under an electron microscope. A single dose of 10(8) GFU of rAd5-G-H administered to mice by intramuscular injection elicited rapid and robust neutralizing antibodies against RABV and CDV. Flow cytometry assays indicated that the dendritic cells and B cells in inguinal lymph nodes were significantly recruited in rAd5-G-H-immunized mice in comparison with the mock and rAd5-GFP groups. rAd5-G-H also activated the Th1- and Th2-mediated cell immune responses against RABV and CDV in mice, which contributed to 100% survival of a lethal-dose RABV challenge without any clinical signs. In foxes, a single dose of 10(9) GFU of rAd5-G-H could elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies against both RABV and CDV in comparison with the mock and rAd5-GFP groups. All foxes in the rAd5-GFP and mock groups died, while the foxes inoculated with rAd5-G-H all survived and showed no clinical signs of disease after being challenged with a lethal wild-type CDV strain. These results suggested that rAd5-G-H has great potential as a bivalent vaccine against rabies and canine distemper in highly susceptible dogs and wildlife animals.

INTRODUCTION Penile prosthetic devices are highly satisfactory in the management of erectile dysfunction but carry a number of risks including the potential for erosion. In some cases, impending extrusion can be identified and managed before frank erosion occurs. AIMS To report our results using a transglanular approach for management of impending distal erosion of penile prosthetic devices. METHODS Patients who presented with impending erosion of penile prosthetics were identified by retrospective chart review. Patients who were managed with a transglanular surgical approach constitute the study group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical data were culled from the charts. Identified patients were contacted and were asked a battery of questions regarding their subjective assessment of the treatment's efficacy. RESULTS Six men were identified. Mean age at time of surgery was 56 years. Four men had had implants placed within the past 2 years and two had implants that had been in place for greater than 12 years. Mean operative time was 25 minutes. Four patients were successfully managed with a single repair procedure. Two men required repeat revision surgery. Of men that were available for additional postoperative contact, three of four reported satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS The transglanular approach for repair of impending distal erosion of penile prosthetics is a quick and minimally morbid procedure that produces satisfactory results in the majority of patients. Further refinements of technique will likely lead to greater overall improvement in outcomes.

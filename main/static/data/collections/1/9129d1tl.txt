Severe tissue trauma is frequently associated with hemorrhagic shock and subsequent pronounced coagulopathy [1]. Uncontrolled bleeding is the second most common cause of death, and hemorrhage is directly responsible for 40 % of all trauma-related deaths [2]. Coagulopathy can be detected with standard coagulation tests immediately after arrival in the emergency room (ER) in approximately 25â€“35 % of all trauma patients [1], [2]. Moreover, early trauma-induced coagulopathy is associated with a 4-fold increase in mortality [1]. Blood coagulation monitoring is essential in order to assess the underlying coagulation disorder and to tailor hemostatic treatment. Thromboelastometry (TEM) and thrombelastography (TEG) are promising point-of-care technologies providing rapid information on the initiation process of clot formation, clot quality, and stability of the clot [3].

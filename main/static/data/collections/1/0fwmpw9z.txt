Introduction: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play key roles in many biological functions and are linked to many diseases across all therapeutic areas. As such, GPCRs represent a significant opportunity for antibody-based therapeutics.Areas covered: The structure of the major GPCR families is summarized in the context of choice of antigen source employed in the drug discovery process and receptor biology considerations which may impact on targeting strategies. An overview of the therapeutic GPCR-antibody target landscape and the diversity of current therapeutic programs is provided along with summary case studies for marketed antibody drugs or those in advanced clinical studies. Antibodies in early clinical studies and the emergence of next-generation modalities are also highlighted.Expert opinion: The GPCR-antibody pipeline has progressed significantly with a number of technical developments enabling the successful resolution of some of the challenges previously encountered and this has contributed to the growing interest in antibody-based therapeutics addressing this target class.

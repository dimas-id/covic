The control of livestock and poultry pests presents unique challenges. The hosts are warmblooded vertebrate animals, capable of a wide range of behaviors and movement. Range cattle and sheep in arid environments, for example, may occupy sparse grassland regions of thousands of hectares and move freely over many kilometers in search of forage. In these situations, pest management strategies must be effective and sustainable with minimal human input or supervision.

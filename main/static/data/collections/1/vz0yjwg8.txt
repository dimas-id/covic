The protection of healthcare workers from the risk of nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a paramount concern. SARS-CoV-2 is likely to remain endemic and measures to protect healthcare workers against nosocomial infection will need to be maintained. This review aims to inform the assessment and management of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare workers involved in elective peri-operative care. In the absence of data specifically related to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the peri-operative setting, we explore the evidence-base that exists regarding modes of viral transmission, historical evidence for the risk associated with aerosol-generating procedures and contemporaneous data from the COVID-19 pandemic. We identify a significant lack of data regarding the risk of transmission in the management of elective surgical patients, highlighting the urgent need for further research.

This current study aimed at detecting the potential protective role of Nano-fenugreek seed on acute lung injury induced by instillation gastric acid in male Swiss albino mice using histological, and histocemical studies. Forty animals grouped as follows: control group, HCl-treated group; low Nano-fenugreek + HCl treated group and high Nano-fenugreek + HCl treated group. Pretreatment with Nano-fenugreek in animal model of acute lung injury resulted in marked ameliorations of the lung histological lesions and injury induced by HCL instillation in a dose dependent manner. It also caused inhibition in the increase of the DNA content and prevented proliferation of goblet cells induced by HCl instillation alone. Pretreatment with Nano-fenugreek prior induction acute lung injury could suppress the aggregations of inflammatory cells, accumulation DNA content, and proliferation of goblet cells in a dose dependent manner. We suggest that Nano-fenugreek may be useful in combating lung injury induced.

Common emergency conditions seen in the ferret include insulinoma, cardiomyopathy, and urethral obstruction. When developing a diagnostic and therapeutic plan, the ferret veterinarian must seek a balance between species-specific information and information extrapolated from cat and dog medicine. The therapeutic plan must always include close and careful monitoring. Significant changes in the status of these small patients can occur extremely quickly in the course of providing basic supportive care, such as intravenous fluids or supplemental heat.

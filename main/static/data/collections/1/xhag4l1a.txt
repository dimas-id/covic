PURPOSE: We evaluated whether longer term hemodialysis (HD) is associated with a higher incidence of vasoplegic syndrome (VS) after cardiac surgery. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center cohort study included 562 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a tertiary hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. We assessed VS occurrence and its relationship with HD duration and other risk factors. To assess the effect of the HD duration on VS occurrence, we constructed ordinal variables: HD = 0 (non-HD), 0 < HD ≤ 5 (HD ≤ 5 years), 5 < HD ≤ 10, and 10 < HD. RESULTS: The overall mean (± standard deviation) age of patients was (73 ± 11) years, and there were 60.9% men. Forty-one patients (7.3%) were HD dependent. Cardiac surgeries included all coronary artery bypass graft procedures, all valvular procedures, and aortic surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Sixty-six patients (10%) developed VS. Most preoperative patient characteristics were comparable between the VS and no-VS groups; a chronic HD status and a total CPB time of > 180 min were significantly more common in the VS group (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Longer term HD significantly correlated with VS incidence (P < 0.0001). Ordinal variables for the HD duration and age and known risk factors for VS (preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, low left-ventricular ejection fraction, and CPB time > 180 min) were subjected to multivariate regression analysis. Long-term HD was identified as an independent predictor of VS (odds ratio, 2.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.66–3.18). CONCLUSIONS: Longer term HD may be associated with a higher VS incidence after cardiac surgery. VS should be given attention after cardiac surgery in chronic HD-dependent patients.

BACKGROUND: Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of all procedures concerning prevention of and protection from MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to improve the knowledge of the dental students and evaluate their awareness about MERS-CoV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was made according to MOH information and 200 dental students (Al-Farabi Colleges, Jeddah) were interviewed to evaluate their knowledge about MERS-CoV. RESULTS: More than half of the dental students (54%) interviewed had good knowledge about the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of MERS-CoV. Measurements for infection control and protection were also known (79%). The sources of information for the students were: college (27%), MOH (25%), media (24%), and social community (23%), while 17% of the students interviewed had no idea about it. CONCLUSION: Dental students had good knowledge about MERS-CoV. However, more information still must be provided by MOH and college for the medical staff.

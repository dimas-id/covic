We describe our experience with three pregnant women with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who required mechanical ventilation. Recent data suggest a mortality of 88% in nonpregnant patients with COVID-19 who require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The three women we report were intubated and mechanically ventilated during pregnancy due to respiratory failure and pneumonia resulting from COVID-19. After several days of ventilation, all three were successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation and extubated, and are continuing their pregnancies with no demonstrable adverse effects. Our experience suggests that the mortality in pregnant women with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation is not necessarily as high as in nonpregnant patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: 路 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic.. 路 COVID-19 may cause pneumonia or respiratory failure in pregnant women.. 路 Approximately 5% of women with COVID-19 will develop severe or critical disease.. 路 Mechanical ventilation in pregnant women may not necessarily result in high mortality rates..

Pathological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury and chronic pain are characterized by activation of astrocytes and microglia in spinal cord and have been modeled in rodents. In vivo imaging at cellular level in these animal models is limited due to the spinal cord's highly myelinated funiculi. The preparation of acute slices may offer an alternative and valuable strategy to collect structural and functional information in vitro from dorsal, lateral and ventral regions of spinal cord. Here, we describe a procedure for preparing acute slices from mouse spinal cord (Garr√© et al., 2016). This preparation should allow further understanding of how glial cells in spinal cord respond acutely to various inflammatory challenges.

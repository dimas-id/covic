Asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major issue in healthcare settings, and management in perinatal wards requires particular caution. Located in central Tokyo as a tertiary center, Keio University Hospital implemented universal PCR testing on patients before admission starting April 6 2020, in response to a nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19. The present study reports a retrospective review of 52 obstetric patients universally tested for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to this hospital between April 6 and April 27, 2020.

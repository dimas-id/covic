Viral gastroenteritis is among the most common illnesses affecting humans and has greatest impact at the extremes of age. The spectrum of disease can range from asymptomatic infections to severe disease with dehydration. Intensive investigation of enteric infections in the past three decades has made it increasingly clear that viruses cause a significant proportion of enteric illnesses worldwide. In contrast to bacterial pathogens, enteric viruses cannot multiply outside their host; hence, the original inoculum into the common source determines infectivity. Prevention of contamination of food and water will help control primary cases, whereas careful nursing and handwashing prevent secondary cases.

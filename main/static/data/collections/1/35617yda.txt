PURPOSE OF REVIEW Obesity is a global epidemic and bariatric surgery remains an underperformed modality for its treatment. Even though the dangers of obesity are well understood, surgical intervention is underestimated. The purpose of this review is to discuss emerging trends in bariatric surgery. RECENT FINDINGS Studies suggest that different operations have different effects on both obesity and its comorbidities. Combining the concepts of malabsorption and restriction, we are looking toward more advanced and efficient treatment options. Less-invasive techniques such as endoscopic devices are under investigation and their results remain to be determined. SUMMARY A paradigm shift is occurring and both obesity and diabetes will be increasingly treated with surgical and endoscopic procedures. Bariatric care is a growing field for surgeons and therapeutic endoscopists with many future opportunities for improvement.

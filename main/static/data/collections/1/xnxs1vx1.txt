Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of the ileal mucosae from 12 calves infected with Cryptosporidium sp. showed cryptosporidia free in the lumen and attached to epithelium. The attached parasites were interpreted to be extracellular and adherent to the microvillous border of epithelial cells. Stages of the organism included crescentic-free merozoites, trophozoites, schizonts, gametes and oocysts. Attached parasites were detected chiefly at villous tips and all stages were present on a single villus. Attachment sites were characterized by absence or disintegration of microvilli, disorganization of the terminal web and development of a specialized attachment zone. There were increased numbers of lysosomes and irregularities in the nuclear membrane of parasitized epithelial cells. It was concluded that cryptosporidia exist in bovine intestine as extracellular parasites and cause epithelial changes that in turn probably cause or contribute to diarrheal disease.

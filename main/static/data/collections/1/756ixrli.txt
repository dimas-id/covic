OBJECTIVE We describe an alternate technique for establishing antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) during hypothermic circulatory arrest via direct, central cannulation of the innominate artery. METHODS From 2009 to 2015, 100 elective hemiarch reconstructions for proximal aortic aneurysms were performed under moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA). Cerebral perfusion was instituted with ACP via direct cannulation of the innominate artery. RESULTS Mean patient age was 63 ± 13 years (72 men; 72%). Mean MHCA temperature was 27.3°C ± 1.0°C (median, 28°C). Mean ACP time was 17 ± 4 minutes and mean crossclamp time was 134 ± 42 minutes. Proximal reconstruction included root replacement with composite valved graft (n = 47), valve sparing root reimplantation (n = 16), and aortic valve replacement (n = 19). In-hospital 30-day mortality (n = 1; 1%), stroke (1; 1%), reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (n = 1; 1%), coma (n = 0), and renal failure (n = 1; 1%) rates were low. There was no incidence of injury or dissection of the innominate artery. CONCLUSIONS Direct, central innominate artery cannulation for ACP yields excellent outcomes. This technique is safe, provides excellent cerebral protection during circulatory arrest and simplifies the circulatory management strategy for elective ascending aortic and hemiarch reconstruction.

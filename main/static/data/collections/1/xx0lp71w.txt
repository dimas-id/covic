The CODIV-19 outbreak in early 2020 generated a tremendous effort of epidemiologists and researchers to fit the experimental data with the solutions of the SIR model equations or with more sophisticated models. In this paper we show that under same hypotheses, a closed form solution exists that reasonably fits the experimental data for Italy, and the results can be extended to any other area.

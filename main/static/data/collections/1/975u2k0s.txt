There is a shortage of pediatric donor hearts for waitlisted children, and yet nearly 50% of organs offered are not transplanted. Donor quality is often cited as a reason for declining organs offered from donors infected with influenza, presumably due to concern about disease transmission at transplant leading to severe disease. We previously described an excellent outcome after heart transplant from a donor infected with influenza B that had been treated with a complete course of oseltamivir. In this report, we describe a similar outcome after transplantation of an organ from an influenza A‚Äêpositive donor with symptomatic disease incompletely treated with oseltamivir. Due to the availability of effective antiviral treatment, we suggest that influenza A is also a manageable donor infection that need not preclude heart placement.

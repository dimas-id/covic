BACKGROUND The Derivo Embolization Device (DED) is a novel flow diverter stent that provides increased x-ray visibility, an improved delivery system, and potentially reduced thrombogenicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the early safety and efficacy of the second-generation DED. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) treated with the DED between November 2015 and December 2017 in three German tertiary care centers. Procedural details, complications, and morbidity within 30 days after treatment, as well as the aneurysm occlusion rates after 6 months (O'Kelly-Marotta scale, OKM), were evaluated. RESULTS Implantation of the DED was attempted in 42 patients with 42 aneurysms. All procedures were technically successful. Multiple DEDs were used in three aneurysms (7.2%) and adjunctive coiling in 11 (26.2%). Procedure-related complications occurred in four cases (9.5%) including three thromboembolic events and one aneurysm perforation. The morbidity rate was 2.4% and there was no mortality. One patient suffered an ischemic stroke with persistent aphasia at 30-day follow-up due to a thromboembolic infarct (modified Rankin Scale score 1). Among 33 patients (78.6%) available for angiographic follow-up, complete (OKM D) and favorable (OKM C+D) aneurysm occlusion was obtained in 72.7% (24/33) and 87.9% (29/33), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of UIAs with the DED is associated with high procedural safety and adequate occlusion rates. Examinations at 1- and 2-year follow-up will provide data on the long-term safety and angiographic outcomes of this device.

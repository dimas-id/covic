AIMS In acute ischaemic stroke, endovascular therapy with the Solitaire FR stent retriever has been shown to double recanalisation rates and the numbers of patients who recover to be functionally independent, when compared to standard therapy. We present the Auckland City Hospital experience of clot retrieval. METHODS Previously independent ischaemic stroke patients with contraindications to, or no response following, i.v. alteplase, were treated with clot retrieval. All patients had proximal large artery occlusions on CT angiography and many also had CT perfusion scans showing salvageable ischaemic tissue. RESULTS Clot retrieval was performed in 33 patients (10 women, mean (SD) age of 54 (17) years) since 2011. Twenty-two (67%) patients were first treated with alteplase. Patients fell into three groups: 17 (52%) had anterior circulation occlusion, similar to those in recent clot retrieval studies; 10 (30%) had posterior circulation occlusion; and six (18%) had 'Rescue' clot retrieval, usually with stroke that followed a procedure. Patients with anterior circulation occlusion had a median time from symptom onset to groin puncture of 225 (range 95-450) minutes, full recanalisation occurred in 76%, and by day 90, all 17 were alive and living at home, with 63% functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2). At day 90, eight of 10 posterior circulation occlusion group patients were alive and living at home, four with a mRS of 0-2. In contrast, four of six 'Rescue' patients had died, and another was functionally dependent with a mRS of 4. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular clot retrieval can be safely and effectively performed in a New Zealand setting with similar results to recent trials in anterior circulation occlusion patients. We suggest that District Health Boards develop clot retrieval services as part of regional hyperacute stroke treatment pathways.

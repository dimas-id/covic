Mechanical force is a determinant of Notch signalling but the mechanism of force detection and its coupling to Notch are unclear. We propose a role for Piezo1 channels, which are mechanically-activated non-selective cation channels. In cultured microvascular endothelial cells, Piezo1 channel activation by either shear stress or a chemical agonist Yoda1 activated a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), a Ca(2+)-regulated transmembrane sheddase that mediates S2 Notch1 cleavage. Consistent with this observation, we found Piezo1-dependent increase in the abundance of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) that depended on ADAM10 and the downstream S3 cleavage enzyme, Î³-secretase. Conditional endothelial-specific disruption of Piezo1 in adult mice suppressed the expression of multiple Notch1 target genes in hepatic vasculature, suggesting constitutive functional importance in vivo. The data suggest that Piezo1 is a mechanism conferring force sensitivity on ADAM10 and Notch1 with downstream consequences for sustained activation of Notch1 target genes and potentially other processes.

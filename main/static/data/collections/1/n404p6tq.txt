Abstract Since the latest coronavirus outbreak, the number of infected individuals and COVID-19 cases have been increasing exponentially worldwide. Of interest is the evidence that orchitis can develop due coronavirus infection. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to believe that the latest coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, could be transmitted by semen. Consequently, it is paramount that individuals who could potentially be infected take all possible care to mitigate the likely risk of infection through sexual intercourse.

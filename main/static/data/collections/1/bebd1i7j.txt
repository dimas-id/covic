Following intranasal administration, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replicated to high titers in the respiratory tracts of BALB/c mice. Peak replication was seen in the absence of disease on day 1 or 2, depending on the dose administered, and the virus was cleared within a week. Viral antigen and nucleic acid were detected in bronchiolar epithelial cells during peak viral replication. Mice developed a neutralizing antibody response and were protected from reinfection 28 days following primary infection. Passive transfer of immune serum to na√Øve mice prevented virus replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge. Thus, antibodies, acting alone, can prevent replication of the SARS coronavirus in the lung, a promising observation for the development of vaccines, immunotherapy, and immunoprophylaxis regimens.

The combination of a fluorine atom and a diazine ring, which both possess unique structural and chemical features, can generate new relevant building blocks for the discovery of efficient fluorinated biologically active agents. Herein we give a comprehensive review on the biological activity and synthesis of fluorine containing, pyrimidine, pyrazine and pyridazine derivatives with relevance to medicinal and agrochemistry.

Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory illness caused by a novel human beta-coronavirus. Based on the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome found in China, a clinical research in combination with radiological findings was studied. Fever was the main clinical manifestation of this patient, and the primary imaging findings were basically the same as viral pneumonia. Differential imaging diagnosis on the basis of epidemiological and experimental pathogen detection is helpful for clinical diagnosis of MERS, even in distinguishing from SARS and pneumonia caused by H7N9 avian influenza.

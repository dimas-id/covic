This study examined the effects of organic enrichment on water column, sediments and macrofauna caused by a fish farm in the Mediterranean Sea. Samples were collected on four sampling campaigns over a one‐year cycle. Significant differences were found in the water column in dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate and total phosphorus concentrations between the fish farm and the control. The increase in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate concentrations at the fish farm modified the stoichiometric ratios between nutrients, with silicate acting as limiting nutrient at the fish farm 11% more than at the control. Nevertheless, chlorophyll a concentration in the water column was higher at the control station, probably due to the fouling of the underwater fish farm structures. Significant differences were found in sediment concentrations of organic matter, total phosphorus and redox potential between the fish farm and the control. The Canonical Correlation Analysis indicated that organic matter, total phosphorus, redox potential and% of gravels accounted for 68.9% of the total variance in the species data. Changes were observed in macrofauna, with a decrease in number of species and up to a nine‐fold increase in abundance with respect to the control.

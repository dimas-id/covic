The in vivo effect of 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) on transcript levels of the gonadotropin receptors (fshr and lhr) and sex differentiation-related genes (dmrt1 and foxl2) was examined in ovaries of immature female beluga. For this purpose, six fish were treated with implants containing 2.5 mg 11KT and a placebo group of six females of the same age and gametogenic stage were given a blank implant. The implants were intraperitoneally inserted into 4-year-old females at the previtellogenic stage (mean body weight 5580 Â± 165 g) and maintained under culture conditions for 8 weeks. Ovary samples for gene expression analysis of lhr, fshr, dmrt1 and foxl2 were collected by biopsy at 3 and 8 weeks post-implantation. Diameters of oocytes increased in response to 11KT treatment, both at 3 and at 8 weeks post-implantation, but no obvious changes were evident in cytology. Three weeks of 11KT treatment did not affect target gene expression, but a tendency for a time-dependent decrease of lhr and dmrt1 mRNA levels was observed in both treatment and placebo groups. By 8 weeks of treatment, however, 11KT implants provoked the upregulation of fshr and foxl2 transcript levels. Furthermore, lhr and dmrt1 transcript abundances recovered by 8 weeks of exposure in both blank- and 11KT-implanted beluga. These results suggest that 11KT, either directly or indirectly, may affect gametogenesis and regulate some key components of the reproductive axis in female beluga.

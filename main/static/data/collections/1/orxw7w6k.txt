This article challenges our collective focus on individual leaders such as Donald Trump especially during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It argues that such attention distracts us from larger systemic dynamics which are contributing to the severity of the pandemic in the US as well as obfuscating the influence of unelected parties whose interests are served by Trump’s actions. In light of these observations, rather than continuing to feed our romance with leaders, leadership scholars are encouraged to (1) expand their inquiries to interrogate the structural and societal forces which contribute to a situation’s outcomes and keep individuals in place as leaders and (2) pay greater attention to the irrational, primal dimensions at play in the relationship between leaders and those they lead.

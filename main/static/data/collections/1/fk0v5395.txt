The diverse roles of deubiquitinating enzymes, or DUBs, in determining the fate of specific proteins continue to unfold. Concurrent with the revelation of DUBs as potential therapeutic targets are publications of small molecule inhibitors of these enzymes. In this review, we summarize these molecules and their associated data and suggest additional experiments to further validate and characterize these compounds. We believe the field of drug discovery against DUBs is still in its infancy, but advances in assay development, biophysical techniques, and screening libraries hold promise for identifying suitable agents that could advance into the clinic.

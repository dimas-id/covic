In this article we will review the imaging features of COVID-19 across multiple modalities, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and ultrasonography (US). Given that COVID-19 primarily affects the lung parenchyma by causing pneumonia, our directive is to focus on thoracic findings associated with COVID-19. We aim to enhance radiologistsâ€™ understanding of this disease in order to help guide diagnosis and management.

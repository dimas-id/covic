During a period from 1973 to 1978, 392 and 225 lots including 12,232 mouse and 8,044 rat individual sera, respectively, were examined for antibodies to murine hepatitis virus, Sendai virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Tyzzer agents, Salmonella typhimurium and Corynebacterium kutscheri. Of mouse lots 94.5% and 39.3% from breeder and user colonies, respectively, were negative for all antibodies examined as well as 31.6% and 17.2% of rat breeder and user colonies, respectively. Among positive lots from mouse users, high positivity rates were seen with Senai virus (47.6%), M. pulmonis (19.0%), and murine hepatitis virus (JHM : 18.2%, MHV : 31.0%), while the rates were high in rat user lots with Sendai virus (24.4%), B. bronchiseptica (39.3%) M. pulmonis (12.5%), murine coronaviruses (JHM : 19.0%, MHV-2 : 28.0%) and tyzzer agents (MSK : 19.6%, RT : 17.9%). These pathogenes with high positivities should be monitored indispensably as a quality control of laboratory mice and rats.

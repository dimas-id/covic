BACKGROUND Despite most bariatric procedures are actually performed by laparoscopic approach, management of postoperative pain remains a major challenge. The aim of this study was to analyze the analgesic effect of intraperitoneal ropivacaine infusion in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS A prospective randomized clinical trial of all the patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) between January and November 2015 was performed. Patients were randomized to experimental (EG: those patients undergoing intraperitoneal ropivacain irrigation) and control groups (CG: those undergoing intraperitoneal irrigation with normal saline). RESULTS One hundred ten patients were included, 83 LRYGB (75.5 %) and 27 LSG (24.5 %). Mean pain, as measured by VAS score, was 21.7 ± 14.5 mm in CG and 13.3 ± 10.9 mm in EG (p = 0.002). Morphine needs during the first 24 h postoperatively were 21.8 % in CG and 3.6 % in EG (p = 0.01). Early taking of fluids by mouth was possible 6 h after surgery in 76.4 % in EG vs 34.5 % in CG (p = 0.001). Early mobilization ability (6 h after surgery) was feasible in 72.7 % in EG and 32.7 % in CG (p = 0.001). Median hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-10 days) in CG and 2 days (2-7 days) in EG (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS The intraoperative peritoneal infusion with ropivacaine in patients undergoing bariatric surgery is associated with a reduction in postoperative pain, lower morphine needs, earlier mobilization and earlier oral intake of fluids after surgery, and a shorter hospital stay.

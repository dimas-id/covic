The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has dramatically affected the entire world. Because of significant disparity levels in Latin American countries with deficient health care access and significant poverty, their population may end up among the most severely impacted. Patients with chronic conditions such as rheumatic diseases are quite vulnerable because of their high flaring risks and subsequent poor outcomes. Additionally, an overuse of antimalarials for the treatment of COVID-19 could lead to shortages in our region. Telemedicine, personal protective equipment use by patients and providers, web conferences, and comprehensive care are tools that will contribute to reduce the risk of infections and other complications in rheumatic disease patients, as well as to improve the knowledge and experience of rheumatologists at a global level.

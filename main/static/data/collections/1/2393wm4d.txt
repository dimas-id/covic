PURPOSE: Acute traumatic coagulopathy can result in uncontrolled haemorrhage responsible for the majority of early deaths after adult trauma. Data on the frequency, transfusion practice and outcome of severe trauma haemorrhage in paediatric patients are inconsistent. METHODS: Datasets from paediatric trauma patients were retrieved from the registry of the German trauma society (TR-DGU(®)) between 2009 and 2016. Coagulopathy was defined by a Quick’s value < 70% (INR (international normalized ratio) > 1.4) and/or thrombocytes ≤ 100 k upon emergency room admission. Children were grouped according to age in 4 different groups (A: 1–5, B: 6–10, C: 11–15 and D: 16–17 years). Prevalence of coagulopathy was assessed. Demographics, injury severity, haemostatic management including transfusions and mortality were described. RESULTS: 5351 primary admitted children ≤ 17 years with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) ≥ 3 and complete datasets were included. The prevalence of coagulopathy was 13.7% (733/5351). The majority of the children sustained blunt trauma (more than 90% independent of age group) and a combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and any other trauma in more than 60% (A, C, D) and in 53.8% in group B. Coagulopathy occurred the most among the youngest (A: 18.2%), followed by all other age groups with approximately 13%. Overall mortality was the highest in the youngest (A: 40.9%) and among the youngest patients with traumatic brain injury (A: 71.4% and B: 47.1%). Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFPs) occurred almost in a 2:1 ratio (or less) across all age subgroups. CONCLUSION: Traumatic haemorrhage in association with coagulopathy and severe shock is a major challenge in paediatric trauma across all age groups.

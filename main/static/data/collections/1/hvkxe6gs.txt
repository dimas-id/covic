Escherichia coli producing the adhesive antigen FY(Att25) were isolated from 46 of 1341 (3.4 per cent) E coli isolated from calves on 20 of 164 (12.1 per cent) farms in Scotland and England. Twenty of the 46 calves had diarrhoea and in nine of these animals there were mixed infections with rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidium and Salmonella typhimurium. The F41 fimbrial adhesin was found on one of the FY(Att25)+ E coli. This strain also produced heat stable enterotoxin. The remaining FY(Att25)+ isolates did not produce other adhesins, enterotoxins or verotoxins. The FY(Att25) antigen was not detected on 109 pathogenic E coli isolated from calves, chickens, lambs, pigs or man.

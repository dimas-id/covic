Abstract A comparison of the sequence of the dengue-2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain (16681-PDK53) derived from it identified 53 of the 10,723 nucleotides which differed between the strains. Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2 91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1 75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1 114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3 495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% ( 6 398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% ( 3 900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.

Abstract Computer-assisted technologies of the genomic structure, biological function, and evolution of viruses remain a largely neglected area of research. The attention of bioinformaticians to this challenging field is currently unsatisfying in respect to its medical and biological importance. The power of new genome sequencing technologies, associated with new tools to handle “big data”, provides unprecedented opportunities to address fundamental questions in virology. Here, we present an overview of the current technologies, challenges, and advantages of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) in relation to the field of virology. We present how viral sequences can be detected de novo out of current short-read NGS data. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and applications of viral quasispecies and how secondary structures, commonly shaped by RNA viruses, can be computationally predicted. The phylogenetic analysis of viruses, as another ubiquitous field in virology, forms an essential element of describing viral epidemics and challenges current algorithms. Recently, the first specialized virus-bioinformatic organizations have been established. We need to bring together virologists and bioinformaticians and provide a platform for the implementation of interdisciplinary collaborative projects at local and international scales. Above all, there is an urgent need for dedicated software tools to tackle various challenges in virology.

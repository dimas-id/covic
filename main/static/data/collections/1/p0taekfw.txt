When extreme events occur some research becomes a clear priority, but what becomes of all other research? Does it stop indefinitely, or can it be paused with plans to resume, persist with modifications, or pivot to address new priorities? Facing this dilemma and witnessing it among their fellow health professions education researchers, the authors recognized a need for guidance. This commentary presents a framework, organized as key questions related to the research stage and process, to assist health professions education researchers in making decisions about how to proceed with research that was planned or in progress when an extreme event occurred. Although at the time of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic was the extreme event at hand, the authors intentionally created questions and discussed considerations that can be helpful for thinking through decisions in a variety of disruptions in health professions education research-many of which require similar difficult decisions and creative solutions to carry important research forward and maintain high quality.

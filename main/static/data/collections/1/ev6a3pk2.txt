An 80-year-old female underwent EVAR 4 years ago. She presented type II endoleak with sac expansion from 68 to 80 mm during 3-year follow-up after EVAR. Although she underwent translumbar percutaneous sac embolization, the AAA sac continued to enlarge, suggesting mixed-type endoleak including type I, II, and III. Transgraft direct sac angiography revealed endoleak cavity without demonstrable feeding vessel. Transgraft sac embolization using n-butyl cyanoacrylate and graft reinforcement was performed concurrently, without complications. The graft reinforcement consisted of graft extension for eliminating occult type I endoleak, and relining for eliminating occult type III endoleak. Six months after the procedure, CT showed no signs of sac expansion. Transgraft sac embolization combined with graft reinforcement is one of the available options for persistent and refractory mixed-type endoleak.

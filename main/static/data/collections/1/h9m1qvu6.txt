A method was worked out for the extraction of a cell monolayer from test tubes with the use of 10 per cent acetone solution of celloidin. This made it possible to carry out parallel cytologic and immunofluorescent studies of cultures infected with various viruses. In contrast to the alcohol-ether celloidin used in histology the use of the acetone solution of celloidin, suggested by us, preserved to a larger extent the viruses of different structure and composition, and, therefore, was shown to be more suitable in immunofluorescent investigations. The method was employed for the cytologic and the immunofluorescent identification of newly isolated virus agents. It was also used in the controlled replication of noncytopathogenic and slightly cytopathogenic strains of bovine rotaviruses, corona viruses, respiratory-syncytial virus, pestivirus, and others that required roller cultivation. The celloidin method makes it possible to obtain from one to four preparations with material of the cell monolayer of each test tube, and renders it unnecessary to maintain permanently cultures on glass lamellas.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illnesses are a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality in children. Coinfection with multiple respiratory viruses is common. Although the effects of each virus have been studied individually, the effects of coinfection on disease severity or healthcare seeking are less well-understood. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a maternal influenza vaccine trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in rural southern Nepal. Prospective weekly active household-based surveillance of infants was conducted from birth to 180 days of age. Mid-nasal swabs were collected and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, parainfluenza (HPIV), and bocavirus by RTâ€“PCR. Coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more respiratory viruses simultaneously detected as part of the same illness episode. Maternal vaccination status, infant age, prematurity, and number of children under 5 in the household were adjusted for with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1,730 infants with a respiratory illness, 327 (19%) had at least two respiratory viruses detected on their primary illness episode. Coinfection status did not differ by maternal vaccination status, infant age, premature birth, and number of children under 5 in the household. Of 113 infants with influenza, 23 (20%) had coinfection. Of 214 infants with RSV, 87 (41%) had coinfection. Overall, infants with coinfection had increased occurrence of fever lasting 4 or more days overall (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), and in the subset of infants with influenza (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.7). Coinfection was not associated with seeking further care (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.5) or pneumonia (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of infants experiencing their first respiratory illness had multiple viruses detected. Coinfection with influenza was associated with longer duration of fever compared with children with influenza alone, but was not associated with increased illness severity by other measures.

Abstract An S L 1 L 2 I 1 I 2 A 1 A 2 R epidemic model is formulated that describes the spread of an epidemic in a population. The model incorporates an Erlang distribution of times of sojourn in incubating, symptomatically and asymptomatically infectious compartments. Basic properties of the model are explored, with focus on properties important in the context of current COVID-19 pandemic.

Sacrococcygeal teratoma is a relatively rare congenital retroperitoneal tumor in adults. The standard treatment is a complete tumor resection. This report describes the successful laparoscopic resection of a sacrococcygeal teratoma. The patient was a 27-year-old woman with a well-demarcated cystic mass, 6 cm in diameter, in the retroperitoneum overlying the anterior surface of the sacrum. The mass was resected laparoscopically. A histopathological examination showed a mature teratoma. The magnifying function of the laparoscope allowed an en bloc resection in the narrow pelvic cavity, without damaging the tumor. The aesthetic outcome was excellent. The patient remains relapse-free at 1 year 6 months after surgery.

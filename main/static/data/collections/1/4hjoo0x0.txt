OBJECTIVE The PARC-AALA (Paroi art√©rielle et Risque Cardiovasculaire in Asia Africa/ Middle East and Latin America) study was designed to evaluate the correlation between intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CCAIMT), carotid plaque and absolute cardiovascular risk in a multi-ethnic population. METHODS An international, cross-sectional, study including 79 centres from 21 countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-eight subjects, meeting all inclusion criteria, were stratified by risk factors groups (no modifiable factor or at least both uncontrolled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia). CCAIMT, presence of plaque and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed for each individual. RESULTS Some intergeographical characteristics in demographics, and risk factors were found accompanying early atherosclerosis marker differences. In Asia where the subjects were at lower risk, the mean CCAIMT was 4% lower than in Africa/Middle East and Latin America. On multiple linear regression analysis CCAIMT and carotid plaque were independently associated with increased Framingham cardiovascular score (FCS) without heterogeneity across geographic regions. CCAIMT and carotid plaque explained roughly 20% of the FCS in both genders. CONCLUSION The PARC-AALA study confirms the correlation between CCAIMT and FCS in three different populations. Intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque evaluation may represent a complementary predictive tool for detection of cardiovascular disease in individuals.

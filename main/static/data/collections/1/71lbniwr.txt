BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EVMT) shows significant promise in improving acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with proximal artery occlusion, but outcomes have been variable. We explored the patients treated by thrombectomy to investigate the association between a favorable clinical outcome of EVMT in intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion (iICAO) and a set of predictors. METHODS A total of 38 iICAO patients treated by EVMTs were analyzed. Primary collateral grades (PCG) at baseline based on the integrity of Willis' circle were categorized into three degrees. The favorable outcomes, measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS), were defined as ≤2 at 90 days. The reperfusion was one of the most important confounders, defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) ≥ 2b. The other risk factors included demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, procedural EVMT, and PCG at baseline was adjusted to reveal the association with favorable outcomes. RESULTS Of 38 iICAO patients, 65.8% (25 in 38) achieved reperfusion. However, only 31.6% (12/38) achieved favorable outcomes at 90 days. With a PCG3, 61.5% of them achieved favorable outcomes, while only 37.5% of those with PCG2 and PCG1 achieved favorable outcomes (p = .003). In multivariable logistic regression, PCG was revealed as a predictor for favorable outcomes (OR 5.278, p = .019) after adjusting the reperfusion and other factors. CONCLUSIONS The PCG based on the integrity of Willis' circle might be an underlying predictor of the prognosis of AIS in patients with iICAO after EVMT. The function of intact anterior communicating artery (AcoA) and ipsilateral posterior communicating artery (PcoA) in favoring prognosis of the iICAO patients might need to be validation in future study.

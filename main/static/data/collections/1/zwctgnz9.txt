The clinical presentations of tuberculous pleurisy are usually nonspecific and have an insidious course, thus resulting in diagnostic challenges. Pseudomonas oryzihabitans is a nonfermenting, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, Gram-negative bacillus that has rarely been encountered as a human pathogen. We present the case of a 30-year-old male patient who exhibited intermittent fever despite antibiotic treatment for Pseudomonas oryzihabitans bacteremia for 6 days. Tuberculous pleurisy was finally diagnosed by histopathologic and microbiologic studies. He recovered after a 2-week antibiotic course and 6-month antituberculosis treatment.

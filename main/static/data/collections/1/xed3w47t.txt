Predicting susceptibility of various species to a virus assists assessment of risk of interspecies transmission. Evaluation of receptor functionality may be useful in screening for susceptibility. In this study, docking simulation was conducted for measles virus hemagglutinin (MV‐H) and immunoglobulin‐like variable domain of signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM‐V). It was observed that the docking scores for MV‐H and SLAM‐V correlated with the activity of SLAM as an MV receptor. These results suggest that the receptor functionality may be predicted from the docking scores of virion surface proteins and cellular receptor molecules.

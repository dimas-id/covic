BACKGROUND AND AIM The efficacy of using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) prior to gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to reduce gastric bleeding remains controversial. This study aimed to systematically review the literature to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative PPI use to reduce post-ESD bleeding. METHODS PubMed, the Cochrane library, and the Igaku-Chuo-Zasshi database were searched to identify randomized trials eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Data from four studies (406 patients) were combined to calculate a pooled risk difference (RD) for developing post-ESD bleeding. RESULTS Compared with patients who received no premedication, the pooled RD for post-ESD bleeding in patients who received preoperavive PPI was -0.027 (95% confidence interval: -0.070-0.017, p = 0.228), without significant heterogeneity. Preoperavive PPI use significantly increased gastric pH (weighted mean difference: 1.289, 95% CI: 0.227-2.352, p = 0.0174). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that premedication with PPI had no advantage for the prevention of post-ESD bleeding, despite increasing gastric pH.

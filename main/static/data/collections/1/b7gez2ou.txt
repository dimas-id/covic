Various meshes are being used widely in clinical practice for pelvic reconstructive surgery despite the lack of evidence of their long-term safety and efficacy. Management of complications such as mesh erosion and dyspareunia can be challenging. Most mesh-related complications can probably be managed successfully via the transvaginal route; however, this may be impossible if surgical access is poor. This case report demonstrates the successful laparoscopic removal of mesh after several failed attempts via the vaginal route.

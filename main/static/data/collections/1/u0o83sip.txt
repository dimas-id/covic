Abstract To visually and rapidly detect a novel goose astrovirus (N-GoAstV) causing fatal gout in goslings, an isothermal detection method based on one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-step RT-LAMP) was established. The one-step RT-LAMP assay for N-GoAstV detection, using Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase with strong reverse transcription activity and primer sets targeting the opening reading frame 1b (ORF1b) of N-GoAstV, could be completed in 30 min using a water bath at 61°C; the detection results could be visually observed by adding a pH-sensitive dye containing phenol red and cresol red. The detection limit of the one-step RT-LAMP assay was 57.8 copies/μL, which was similar to that of reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The assay specifically detected N-GoAstV without any cross-reaction with other reference viruses, and this was further confirmed using enzyme digestion. These results indicated that the newly established RT-LAMP assay could accomplish reverse transcription, amplification, and visual result determination in one step, and the results obtained via this rapid and cost-effective method could be used to support disease control on farms in terms of N-GoAstV infection.

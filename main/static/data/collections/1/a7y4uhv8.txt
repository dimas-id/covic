Abstract Feline Î± 1-acid glycoprotein (fAGP) increases during feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). We have recently identified a 29 kDa protein that we named feline AGP-related protein (fAGPrP) due to its cross-reactivity with an anti-human AGP monoclonal antibody. In this work we describe the tissue distribution of fAGPrP during FIP, and its relationship with feline coronavirus (FCoV) and myeloid cells. Tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with FIP were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human AGP, FCoV and myeloid antigens. Diffuse fAGPrP positivity within the lesions, likely due to vascular plasma leakage, endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable. Compared to controls, fAGPrP-expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes, as usually occurs for IgM-producing plasma cells during early immune responses. These findings did not depend on the presence of FCoVs or of myeloid cells, suggesting that fAGPrP is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.

Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a potential target of therapy in COVID-19 during the severe respiratory-inflammatory phase ("cytokine release syndrome"), when pulmonary macrophages are hyperactivated, releasing IL-1 and other cytokines. Preliminary evidence indicates that anakinra and canakinumab, drugs that block the action of IL-1 and have a good safety profile, improve the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 cytokine release syndrome. Results from large, randomized clinical trials are pending.

The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system is a powerful method to identify and analyze binary protein interactions. In the field of virology, the Y2H system has significantly increased our knowledge of structure and function of viral proteins by systematically assessing intraviral protein interactions. Several comprehensive approaches to determine virus-host interactions have provided insight into viral strategies to manipulate the host for efficient replication and to escape host-derived countermeasures. To expand our knowledge of intraviral and virus-host protein interactions, we here present a Y2H protocol that is well suited for high-throughput screening. Yeast mating followed by liquid handling in a 96-well format as well as fluorescent readout of the reporter system provides a highly standardized and fully automated screening situation. The protocol can either be applied to screen complex host cDNA libraries or protein pairs arrayed for cross-testing. The ease of use, the cost-effectiveness as well as the robotic handling allows for extensive and multiple rounds of screening providing high coverage of protein-protein interactions. Thus, this protocol represents an improved “deep” screening method for high-throughput Y2H assays.

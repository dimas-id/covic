OBJECTIVE: Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) increases hospital stay, resource utilization, morbidity, and mortality. However, there is paucity of data about its effect in Indian patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: Seven hundred forty-eight patients underwent off-pump CABG from January 2015 to December 2016 (24 months). One hundred twenty-seven patients (16.7%) developed POAF. In an effort to mitigate the effects of wider risk factors on perioperative outcomes, a separate sub-analysis of patients based on risks quantified by EuroSCORE II (<> 3) was also performed. RESULTS: Age > 60 years and development of sepsis were the independent predictors for the development of POAF. Thirty-day/mortality rate was higher in the POAF group (7.1% vs. 1.4%; p value < 0.001). POAF was associated with increased ICU and hospital stay and increased incidence of stroke and renal dysfunction. The survival was significantly lower in the POAF group compared with the normal sinus rhythm (NSR) (3-year survival in POAF was 81.3% vs. 94.4% in the NSR group; Hazard ratio (HR) 3.867 (1.989–7.516)). Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) usage, age ≥ 60 years and sepsis were independent predictors for the development of POAF in low-risk patients. For the NSR group, 1-year survival was 98% and 3-year survival was 95.7%. For the POAF group, 1-year survival was 94.4% and 3-year survival was 84.0% (HR. 3.794 (1.897–7.591)). CONCLUSION: The incidence of POAF was lower than reported in the wider global literature. Increasing age and development of post-operative sepsis were strong independent predictors of POAF. POAF increases the morbidity; length of hospital stay and these patients show decreased survival after off-pump CABG.

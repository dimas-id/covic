The 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of coronaviruses contain the signals necessary for negative strand RNA synthesis and may also harbor elements essential for positive strand replication and subgenomic RNA transcription. The 3' UTRs of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) are more than 30% divergent. In an effort to learn what parts of these regions might be functionally interchangeable, we attempted to replace the 3' UTR of MHV with its BCV counterpart by targeted RNA recombination. Initially, we tried to substitute the 3' 267 nucleotides (nt) of the 301 nt MHV 3' UTR with the corresponding region of the BCV 3' UTR. This exchange did not yield viable recombinant viruses, and the donor DI RNA was shown to be unable to replicate with MHV as a helper virus. Subsequent analysis revealed that the entire BCV 3' UTR could be inserted into the MHV genome in place of the entire MHV 3' UTR. It resulted that the failure of the initial attempted substitution was due to the inadvertent disruption of an essential conserved bulged stem-loop secondary structure in the MHV and BCV 3' URTs immediately downstream of the N gene stop codon.

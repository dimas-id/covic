Single-incision laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease is not widespread because of its technical difficulty. On the other hand, patients with gastroesophageal reflux frequently also have mental retardation and eating disorders. We have been performing single-incision laparoscopic fundoplication via a gastrostomy site incision since October 2009 for these patients. The treated patients were 4 males and 1 female. A small skin incision was made on the gastrostomy site and a SILS port was placed. Under pneumoperitoneum, a single-incision laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and gastrostomy were performed with a flexible scope, conventional instruments, and high-dexterity instruments. The pneumoperitoneal time was 115-180 min and blood loss was 1-15 ml. There were no intra- or postoperative complications. The hospital stay was under 8 days for all patients. Using this procedure, the incidence of postoperative intestinal obstruction was very low. The results indicate this procedure can be used as a standard operation for these patients in the future.

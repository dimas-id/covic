Two porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains, named DH1/2016 and DH2/2016, were isolated from feces of piglets which had severe watery diarrhea symptoms. A comparison of the complete genome sequences suggested that the DH1/2016 and DH2/2016 strains are highly homologous to each other and to PDCoVs isolated in early 2014 from the United States.

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which broke out in Wuhan, HuBei in December, 2019, spread around the country in a short term. Some infected patients suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome. It has become a major public health event of international concern. COVID-19 patients are the main source of transmission and most people get infection easily, so the current main prevention method is interrupting the pathway of transmission. The dental treatments are very special because these operations produce substantial aerosols and lead a high risk of cross-infection, which brings challenge for epidemic prevention and control. In this paper, the characteristics of aerosols and prevention methods of aerosol transmission in dental clinics are mainly discussed.

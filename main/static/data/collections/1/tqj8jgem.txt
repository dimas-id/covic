Anti-tracking network plays an important role in protection of network usersâ€™ identities and communication privacy. Confronted with the frequent network attacks or infiltration to anti-tracking network, a robust and destroy-resistant network topology is an important prerequisite to maintain the stability and security of anti-tracking network. From the aspects of network stability, network resilience and destroy-resistance, we propose the convex-polytope topology (CPT) applied in the anti-tracking network. CPT has three main advantages: (1) CPT can easily avoid the threat of key nodes and cut vertices to network structure; (2) Even the nodes could randomly join in or quit the network, CPT can easily keep the network topology in stable structure without the global view of network; (3) CPT can easily achieve the self-optimization of network topology. Anti-tracking network based on CPT can achieve the self-maintenance and self-optimization of its network topology. We compare CPT with other methods of topology optimization. From the experimental results, CPT has better robustness, resilience and destroy-resistance confronted with dynamically changed topology, and performs better in the efficiency of network self-optimization.

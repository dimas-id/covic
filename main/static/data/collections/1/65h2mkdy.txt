Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing public-health pandemic worldwide. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been known to spread primarily through respiratory droplets, recent evidence also supports fecal/oral as an additional route of transmission, raising concerns over gastrointestinal (GI) transmission of the infection. Herein, we, as the front-line Chinese GI surgeons, would like to share our experience and lessons in the combat against COVID-19. It is essential to create science-based, rational, and practical strategies during the outbreak of COVID-19. Here, we provide multi-institutional consensus on minimizing disease transmission while continuing to provide care from all aspects for patients in GI surgery, including outpatient clinics, inpatient units, gastrointestinal endoscopy centers, and adjustments in perioperative care. Our experiences and recommendations are worth sharing and may help to establish specific infection-control and outcome measures.

BACKGROUND Treatment of patients with ileocaecal Crohn's disease who have not responded to conventional therapy is commonly scaled up to biological agents, but surgery can also offer excellent short-term and long-term results. We compared laparoscopic ileocaecal resection with infliximab to assess how they affect health-related quality of life. METHODS In this randomised controlled, open-label trial, in 29 teaching hospitals and tertiary care centres in the Netherlands and the UK, adults with non-stricturing, ileocaecal Crohn's disease, in whom conventional therapy has failed were randomly allocated (1:1) by an internet randomisation module with biased-coin minimisation for participating centres and perianal fistula to receive laparoscopic ileocaecal resection or infliximab. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years, had active Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum, and had not responded to at least 3 months of conventional therapy with glucocorticosteroids, thiopurines, or methotrexate. Patients with diseased terminal ileum longer than 40 cm or abdominal abscesses were excluded. The primary outcome was quality of life on the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were general quality of life, measured by the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey and its physical and mental component subscales, days unable to participate in social life, days on sick leave, morbidity (additional procedures and hospital admissions), and body image and cosmesis. Analyses of the primary outcome were done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analyses were done in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered at the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR1150). FINDINGS Between May 2, 2008, and October 14, 2015, 73 patients were allocated to have resection and 70 to receive infliximab. Corrected for baseline differences, the mean IBDQ score at 12 months was 178·1 (95% CI 171·1-185·0) in the resection group versus 172·0 (164·3-179·6) in the infliximab group (mean difference 6·1 points, 95% CI -4·2 to 16·4; p=0·25). At 12 months, the mean SF-36 total score was 112·1 (95% CI 108·0-116·2) in the resection group versus 106·5 (102·1-110·9) in the infliximab group (mean difference 5·6, 95% CI -0·4 to 11·6), the mean physical component score was 47·7 (45·7-49·7) versus 44·6 (42·5-46·8; mean difference 3·1, 4·2 to 6·0), and the mean mental component score was 49·5 (47·0-52·1) versus 46·1 (43·3-48·9; mean difference 3·5, -0·3 to 7·3). Mean numbers of days of sick leave were 3·4 days (SD 7·1) in the resection group versus 1·4 days (4·7) in the infliximab group (p<0·0001), days not able to take part in social life were 1·8 days (6·3) versus 1·1 days (4·5; p=0·20), days of scheduled hospital admission were 6·5 days (3·8) versus 6·8 days (3·2; p=0·84), and the number of patients who had unscheduled hospital admissions were 13 (18%) of 73 versus 15 (21%) of 70 (p=0·68). Body-image scale mean scores in the patients who had resection were 16·0 (95% CI 15·2-16·8) at baseline versus 17·8 (17·1-18·4) at 12 months, and cosmetic scale mean scores were 17·6 (16·6-18·6) versus 18·6 (17·6-19·6). Surgical intervention-related complications classified as IIIa or worse on the Clavien-Dindo scale occurred in four patients in the resection group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in two patients in the infliximab group. During a median follow-up of 4 years (IQR 2-6), 26 (37%) of 70 patients in the infliximab group had resection, and 19 (26%) of 73 patients in the resection group received anti-TNF. INTERPRETATION Laparoscopic resection in patients with limited (diseased terminal ileum <40 cm), non-stricturing, ileocaecal Crohn's disease in whom conventional therapy has failed could be considered a reasonable alternative to infliximab therapy.

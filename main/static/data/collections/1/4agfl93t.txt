INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can severely influence sexual function. Robot-assisted surgery is increasingly used to treat POP, but studies describing its effect on sexual function are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate sexual function after robot-assisted POP surgery. METHODS This prospective cohort study included all patients who underwent a robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) or supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicopexy (RSHS). Exclusion criteria were unknown preoperative sexual activity status or concomitant surgery. In sexually active women, sexual function was measured with the translated validated version of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). Changes in sexual activity were scored. Prolapse stages were described using the simplified Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (S-POP) system. RESULTS A total of 107 women were included (median follow-up 15.3 months). No difference was found in the total number of sexually active women before and after surgery [63 (58.9%) vs. 61 (63.5%), p = 0.999]. Significantly fewer women avoided sexual intercourse postoperatively compared with preoperatively. Preoperatively, sexual intercourse was avoided due to vaginal bulging (2% vs. 24%, respectively, p = 0.021). Total mean PISQ-12 scores improved significantly 1 year after prolapse correction (33.5 vs. 37.1; p = 0.004), mainly due to improved scores on the physical and behavioral-emotive domain. No significant difference in pre- and postoperative complains of dyspareunia was found. CONCLUSION Robot-assisted middle-compartment surgery improved sexual function 1 year after surgery according to enhanced physical and emotional scores. The total number of sexually active women and complains of dyspareunia before and after surgery did not differ.

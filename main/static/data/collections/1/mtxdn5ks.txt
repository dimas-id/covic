Medical geographers study the geographic distribution of health and health-related phenomena such as diseases, and health care facilities. Seeking to understand who is getting what diseases or health services where and why, they examine spatial disparities in access to health care services, and the geographic distribution of health risks. Medical geographers apply tools of geographic enquiry such as disease mapping and geographical correlation studies to health-related issues (Elliot et al., 2000; Pickle, 2002). Some have called this research endeavor spatial epidemiology (Cromley, 2003; Rushton, 2003a).

The data characterizing spontaneous infections of Old World monkeys: measles, poliomyelitis, hepatitis A (HPA), encephalomyocarditis, coronavirus infection, simian hemorrhagic fever (SHF), are presented. The experimental infections were reproduced with the isolated pathogens. On these models, pathogenesis and epidemiology of these diseases were studied. The efficiency of poliomyelitis, measles and HPA vaccines is shown. The priority of data on the discovery of earlier unknown disease—SHF and “Sukhumi” virus—are emphasized. Several important pathogenic mechanisms common for various hemorrhagic fevers were studied on experimental SHF of macaques. This model is uniquely safe and adequate for the assessment of therapy of hemorrhagic fevers dangerous for humans.

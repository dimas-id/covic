BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is an epidemic disease throughout the world. The management of vascular access during the epidemic is currently unknown. METHODS: In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we collected vascular access data from hemodialysis patients treated at 44 hospitals in Hubei from 22 January to 10 March 2020. We estimated the management of vascular access during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. RESULTS: Of the 9231 hemodialysis patients included, 5387 patients (58.4%) were men and 2959 patients (32.1%) were older than 65 years. Arteriovenous fistula was the predominant type of vascular access, accounting for 76.5%; 496 patients (5.4%) developed vascular access complications; catheter flow reduction was the most common vascular access complication, and stenosis was the predominant complication among those with arteriovenous access. Overall, 280 vascular access sites were placed in patients newly diagnosed with uremia, of whom 260 (92.8%) underwent catheter insertion; 149 rescue procedures were carried out to treat the vascular access complications, which consisted of 132 catheters, 7 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties, 6 arteriovenous fistula repairs, and 4 arteriovenous fistulas. Occlusion of the arteriovenous access had the highest rescue rate (92.7%), while many other vascular access complications remained untreated; 69 and 142 patients were diagnosed with confirmed and suspected coronavirus disease 2019, respectively. A total of 146 patients died, of whom 29 patients (19.9%) died due to vascular access complications. CONCLUSION: Catheter flow reduction and stenosis of arteriovenous access were the major vascular access complications. Most of the vascular access sites established were catheters, and many of the vascular access complications remained untreated.

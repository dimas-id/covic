OBJECTIVES: To describe neurological manifestations in children with Influenza A (H1N1). METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and Pediatric Neurology unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India involving children with PCR confirmed Influenza A (H1N1) with neurological manifestations during 2019 outbreak. RESULTS: Six children (5 females, 1 male) were enrolled. All presented with neurological symptoms (seizures and altered sensorium) accompanied with fever and respiratory symptoms with duration of illness of 2–7 d. The admission Glasgow Coma Scale ranged from 4 to 12. Only 2 cases showed cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Neuroimaging was suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema, acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. All were treated with Oseltamivir. Four cases had clinical features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and were managed in PICU, 3 of them needed mechanical ventilation, 3 needed vasoactive drugs, 3 received 3% saline infusion, 1 underwent invasive ICP monitoring, and 3 (cases 4, 5 and 6) received intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) for 5 d. Total duration of hospital stay was 10–30 d. Case 2 expired due to refractory raised ICP. Among survivors, 3 children had residual neurological deficits and the remaining 2 had achieved premorbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A (H1N1) can present with isolated or predominant neurological manifestations which can contribute to poor outcome. The authors suggest to rule out H1N1 in any child who presents with unexplained neurological manifestations during seasonal outbreaks of H1N1.

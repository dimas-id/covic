This case series examines the spectrum of imaging findings on chest radiographs, US, CT, and MRI images in 35 children admitted to a tertiary pediatric hospital in April-May 2020 with a post COVID-19 inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The constellation of findings includes airway inflammation and rapid development of pulmonary edema on thoracic imaging, coronary artery aneurysms, and extensive right iliac fossa inflammatory changes on abdominal imaging. Awareness of this emerging condition and the expected multi-organ imaging findings will aid radiologists in the assessment of these complex cases.

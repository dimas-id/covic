During April-May 2020, the presence of respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in pets living with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) owners was analyzed. From 23 pets, a cat without clinical symptoms showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in oropharyngeal swab using three RT-qPCR assays (negative rectal swab). SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the remaining pets. Our finding suggests that cats may act as asymptomatic dispersers of SARS-CoV-2, although viral transmission from animals to humans seems unlikely.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the E2 glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been classified according to their ability to bind to either of the two purified 90,000-molecular-weight subunits (90K subunits) of the 180K peplomeric glycoprotein E2. Correlation with previously reported information about these MAbs suggest that both of the subunits of E2 are important for viral infectivity and cell fusion. Incubation of trypsin-treated virions at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C released only the E2N subunit from virions. The pattern of MAb reactions suggested that a conformational change occurred in the E2N subunit in association with its release from virions under mildly alkaline conditions at 37 degrees C, the same conditions which are optimal for coronavirus-induced cell fusion.

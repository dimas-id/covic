Secondary reading frames, ‘hidden’ under other reading frames, are used for coordinated expression of proteins in several eukaryotic viruses. In some genes, ribosomal frameshifting and initiation or reinitiation of protein synthesis on internal AUG codons are translational mechanisms allowing access to such ‘hidden’ reading frames. In others, secondary reading frames are translated from alternatively spliced or edited mRNAs.

A review and synthesis of recently published literature regarding lower respiratory infections in athletes was conducted. Diagnosis and treatment of common etiologies, specifically acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and influenza, are examined and discussed. In addition, potential complications, including spontaneous pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, hemoptysis, and acute respiratory failure that may result from inadequate diagnosis and treatment, are addressed. Criteria for allowing athletes to return to play were reviewed and current accepted guidelines for return to activity are discussed.

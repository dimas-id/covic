Recent reports have showed that a proportion of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented elevated leukocyte count. Clinical data about these patients is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the clinical findings of patients with COVID-19 who have increased leukocyte at admission. We retrospectively collected the clinical data on the 52 patients who have increased leukocyte count at admission from the 619 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had pneumonia with abnormal features on chest CT scan in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from February 3 to March 3, 2020. The mean age of the 52 patients with increased leukocyte count was 64.7 (SD 11.4) years, 32 (61.5%) were men and 47 (90.4%) had fever. Compared with the patients with non-increased leukocyte count, the patients with increased leukocyte count were significantly older (P < 0.01), were more likely to have underlying chronic diseases (P < 0.01), more likely to develop critically illness (P < 0.01), more likely to admit to an ICU (P < 0.01), more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (P < 0.01), had higher rate of death (P < 0.01) and the blood levels of neutrophil count and the serum concentrations of CRP and IL-6 were significantly increased, (P < 0.01). The older patients with COVID-19 who had underlying chronic disorders are more likely to develop leukocytosis. These patients are more likely to develop critical illness, with a high admission to an ICU and a high mortality rate.

Abstract A small group of 1.2-kb RNAs present on polyribosoes from clover yellow mosaic virus (CYMV)-infected tissue contains sequences from the genomic RNA (gRNA) of CYMV and is encapsidated by CYMV coat protein. Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5′ and 415 nucleotides of the 3′ terminal of CYMV's gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant. This coding strategy represents a novel property of plant virus defective RNAs.

Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in long-term care facilities revealed significantly higher prevalence of infection in facilities that screened in response to a known infection compared to those that screened as a prevention measure. “Response” facilities had a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 28.9% while “preventive” facilities’ prevalence was 1.6% (p <0.001).

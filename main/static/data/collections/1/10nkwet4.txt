We present a case of tandem stenosis of the great vessels (cervical internal carotid artery [ICA] and brachiocephalic trunk ostium [BTO]) treated with stenting and balloon angioplasty of both lesions under flow arrest. A 70-yr-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and previous strokes presented with recurrent transient ischemic attacks of the left upper and lower extremities over the last 6 mo. She underwent right cervical endarterectomy (CEA) 16 yr prior. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Carotid Doppler ultrasonography revealed severely increased velocities of the right ICA. Cervical magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated 80% right ICA stenosis and 50% BTO stenosis. Digital subtraction cerebral angiography showed 80% right ICA stenosis and 70% BTO stenosis. The patient was not a candidate for standard carotid artery stenting because the BTO precluded endovascular access or for CEA because of the previous CEA; therefore, direct carotid access and flow reversal was an alternative. Under general anesthesia and systemic heparinization, the patient underwent right carotid artery surgical exposure. Under flow reversal using the Enroute System (Silk Road Medical, Sunnyvale, California), anterograde right ICA stenting angioplasty and retrograde BTO stenting and angioplasty were performed. Successful revascularization of the right ICA and BTO was obtained. No procedure-related complications occurred. The patient was discharged home 2 d postprocedure, neurologically intact. Direct carotid access with flow reversal is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for patients with ICA (or common carotid artery) stenosis who cannot undergo CEA or when endovascular access from the aortic arch is not possible. Patient consent was obtained prior to performing the procedure. Institutional board approval is not required for the report of a single case.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can identify discrete cortical representation of lower-limb muscles in healthy individuals. Data were obtained from 16 young healthy adults (12 women, four men; mean [SD] age 23.0 [2.6] years). Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the resting vastus medialis, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medial and lateral hamstring, and medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles on the right side of the body using bipolar surface electrodes. TMS was delivered through a 110-mm double-cone coil at 63 sites over the left hemisphere. Location and size of the cortical representation and the number of discrete peaks were quantified for each muscle. Within the quadriceps muscle group there was a main effect of muscle on anterior-posterior centre of gravity (p = 0.010), but the magnitude of the difference was very small. Within the quadriceps there was a main effect of muscle on medial-lateral hotspot (p = 0.027) and map volume (p = 0.047), but no post-hoc tests were significant. The topography of each lower-limb muscle was complex, displaying multiple peaks that were present across the stimulation grid, and variable across individuals. The results of this study indicate that TMS delivered with a 110-mm double-cone coil could not reliably identify discrete cortical representations of resting lower-limb muscles when responses were measured using bipolar surface electromyography. The characteristics of the cortical representation of lower-limb muscles reported here provide a basis against which to evaluate cortical reorganisation in clinical populations.

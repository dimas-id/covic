Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune‐mediated demyelinating disorder of unknown etiology. Both genetic‐susceptibility and environment exposures, including vitamin D deficiency, Epstein‐Barr viral and Herpesvirus (HHV‐6) infections are strongly implicated in the activation of T cells and MS‐pathogenesis. Despite precise knowledge of how these factors could be operating alone or in combination to facilitate and aggravate the disease progression, it is clear that prolonged induction of inflammatory molecules and recruitment of other immune cells by the activated T cells results in demyelination and axonal damage. It is imperative to understand the risk factors associated with MS progression and how these factors contribute to disease pathology. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms of what factors triggers activation of T cells to attack myelin antigen are important to strategize therapeutics and therapies against MS. Current review provides a detailed literature to understand the role of both pathogenic and non‐pathogenic factors on the impact of MS.

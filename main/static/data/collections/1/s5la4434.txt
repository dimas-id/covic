Abstract Research has revealed that nurses and nursing students with disabilities experience discrimination. There are relatively few nurses with obvious physical disabilities working in clinical settings. Misconceptions abound regarding what a nurse with a disability can do. The focus tends to be on disability rather than ability. Similarly, prospective nursing students with disabilities are viewed with apprehension and caution. The overriding concern regarding nurses and nursing students with disabilities is that they will jeopardize patient safety. Nurse educators worry that students will not be able to complete the required skills and often confuse essential functions of nursing work with the academic standards required to graduate successfully. This article proposes that based on the research, we are not truly inclusive of nurses or nursing students with disabilities.

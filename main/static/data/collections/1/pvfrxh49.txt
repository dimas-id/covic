Aberrant blood cell counts, most prominently lymphopenia, have been identified as markers of the degree of severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Terpos et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2020; Wan et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020; Zhao et al, 2020). However, most of these studies lack comparison to a COVID-19 negative, contemporary control group. Additionally, the longitudinal composition and dynamics of lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients are insufficiently characterized.

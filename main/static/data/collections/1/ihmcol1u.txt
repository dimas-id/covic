Proof obligations of the B method and of Event B use predicates in the Constraints, Sets, Properties and Invariant clauses as hypotheses in proof obligations. A contradiction in these predicates results in trivially valid proof obligations and essentially voids the development. A textbook on the B method [3] presents three “existence proof obligations” to show the satisfiability of the Constraints, Properties and Invariant clauses as soon as they are stated in a component. Together with new existence proof obligations for refinement, this prevents the introduction of such contradictions in the refinement chain. This paper presents a detailed formalization of these existence proof obligations, specifying their implementation in Atelier B.

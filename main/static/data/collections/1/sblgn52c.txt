Much less is known about the etiology of influenza‐like illness in China. A continuous surveillance of 16 respiratory viruses was conducted from November 2010 to October 2011 of outpatients with influenza‐like illness in Nanjing, China. The two largest general hospitals and a provincial virus laboratory in Nanjing participated in this study. Throat swabs were collected from outpatients during medical visits for influenza‐like illness and were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using PCR. Three hundred seventeen viruses were detected in samples from 246 (50.6%) patients with influenza‐like illness. The viruses found mostly commonly were influenza, rhinovirus, hCoV HKU1, and adenovirus. The identification rates of respiratory viruses differed significantly among different sampling seasons (P = 0.0002). The rates of influenza A and hCoV HKU1 were much higher during the influenza‐like illness winter peak than during the influenza‐like illness summer peak and other months. Co‐infections were detected in 57 (11.7%) patients and were found most commonly in adults older than 60 years. RSV was detected in 5.9% and 2.6% of patients who were 0–5 and 6–15 years old, respectively, but was not detected in other age groups. This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently in the population and account for a large proportion of influenza‐like illness. In addition to influenza virus, hCoV HKU1 may be associated with the influenza‐like illness winter peak in Nanjing, China. J. Med. Virol. 84:1980–1984, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

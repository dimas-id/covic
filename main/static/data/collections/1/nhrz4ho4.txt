PURPOSE Few studies of robotic gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) resection have been conducted. This study was aimed to evaluate the robotic gastrotomy with intracorporeal suture for patients with GISTs located at cardia and subcardiac region. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2014 to August 2016, 11 patients with GISTs located at cardia and subcardiac region underwent robotic gastrotomy with intracorporeal suture. Data of these patients were collected. RESULTS The mean operative time was 82.7 minutes and the mean blood loss was 30.0 mL. No complication was reported. The postoperative length of stay was 3.3 days. On postoperative day 14, inflammation recovered to preoperative level. On postoperative month 6, the nutritional status was similar to that before the surgery. After 25.5 months follow-up, all patients survived with no recurrence or metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Robotic gastrotomy with intracorporeal suture for patients with GISTs located at cardia and subcardiac region is safe and feasible.

INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening medical condition. It is characterized by serious lung inflammation or injury. Characterizing novel miRNAs implicated in ARDS pathogenesis may provide new therapeutic strategy for managing ARDS. METHODS: We employed LPS-induced lung injury model to profile miRNAs associated with ARDS. We isolated one miRNA candidate and characterized its role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in lung macrophages. We further evaluated its functional role in ARDS model by assessing histological change, neutrophil activation, tissue permeability and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) production. We also characterized its downstream target using luciferase assay, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell inflammation assay. RESULTS: Microarray profiling revealed miR-802 was significantly downregulated in ARDS mouse model. LPS-induced miR-802 downregulation was confirmed in lung macrophages. Overexpression of miR-802 significantly suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury in vivo. Peli2 was identified as a downstream target of miR-802 and found upregulated in ARDS model. Overexpressing Peli2 abolished the antagonizing effect of miR-802 on LPS-mediated inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: MiR-802 carried a protective role against LPS-induced acute lung injury by downregulating Peli2. MiR-802/Peli2 axis may act as intervening targets to manage ARDS.

The year 2020 started with a report about a cluster of pneumonia cases from Wuhan, China, that were later identified to be caused by the novel coronavirus. By March 11, this outbreak was designated as a pandemic by World Health Organization. So far, it has affected 213 countries and territories around the world. It is an infectious disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread. In the present paper, we discuss the various non-pharmacological approaches that have to be adopted at the personal or community level and by the healthcare providers to win against this virus.

Pregnant patients can suffer from the same respiratory diseases as the general population in addition to unique syndromes of pregnancy (such as pre-eclampsia and tocolytic induced pulmonary edema, and pregnancy induced cardiomyopathy). Pregnancy by itself may add certain challenges such as difficult intubation. The critically ill pregnant patient requires a multidisciplinary approach and early inclusion of obstetrical expertise is paramount in managing these patients especially in the third trimester.

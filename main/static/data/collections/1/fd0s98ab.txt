A minimally invasive technique of chest drain insertion using the Mini Step bladeless trocar is described. Thirty-one chest drain insertions were performed with this technique between January 2007 and December 2009. It is a safe, efficient, fast, and easily acquired means of chest drain insertion in children, which has a high success rate and minimal morbidity. Overwhelmingly positive responses were obtained from doctors of all levels who used this technique, which is highly recommended for chest drain insertion in conscious children.

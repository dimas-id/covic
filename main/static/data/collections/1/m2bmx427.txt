Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases caused by pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), West Nile virus (WNV) or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) pose considerable threats to public health worldwide. Research on the mechanism of cross-species infection and transmission for animal-origin emerging and re-emerging zoonosis (2016YFD0500300) has won support by the National Key Research and Development Program of China. Professor Wenjie Tan (National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) was the primary principal investigator of this research group. Focusing on the mechanism of transmission and infection for emerging and re-emerging zoonosis, this research will provide an important. foundation for the prevention and control of zoonosis.

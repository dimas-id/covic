Abstract Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is considered an occupational disease in health care workers (HCW) and its transmission in health care facilities is an important concern. Some hospital departments are at higher risk of infection. Objective: To describe TB cases detected after TB screening in HCW from a hospital department (Ear, Nose and Throat – ENT) who had had contact with active TB cases. Material and methods: All HCW (73) from Hospital São João’s ENT Unit who had been in contact with two in-patients with active TB underwent TB screening. Those who had symptoms underwent chest X-ray and mycobacteriological sputum exam. Results: Of 73 HCW who underwent TB screening, TB diagnosis was established in 9 (8 female; median age: 30 years; 1 doctor, 6 nurses, 2 nursing auxiliaries). Pulmonary TB was found in 8 and extra-pulmonary TB in 1. Microbiology diagnosis was obtained in 7 cases by sputum smear, n=2; culture exam in bronchial lavage, n=4 and histological exam of pleural tissue, n=1. In 4 cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA was extracted from cultures and molecular typing was done. All cases had identical MIRU types, which allowed identification of the epidemiological link. Conclusion: Nosocomial TB is prominent and efforts should be made to implement successful infection control measures in health care facilities and an effective TB screening program in HCW. Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis facilitates cluster identification. Rev Port Pneumol 2007; XIII (6): 789-799

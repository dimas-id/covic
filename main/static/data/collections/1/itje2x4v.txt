OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Observed complications during rigid bronchoscopy, including hypercarbia and hypoxemia, prompted us to assess how well rigid bronchoscopes serve as an airway device. We performed computer-aided design flow analysis of pediatric rigid bronchoscopes to gain insight into flow dynamics. STUDY DESIGN We made accurate three-dimensional computer models of pediatric rigid bronchoscopes and endotracheal tubes. SOLIDWORKS (Dassault Systemes, VÃ©lizy-Villacoublay, France) flow analysis software was used to analyze fluid dynamics during pressure-controlled and volume-controlled ventilation. METHODS Flow analysis was performed on rigid bronchoscopes and similar outer diameter endotracheal tubes comparing resistance, flow, and turbulence during two ventilation modalities and in common surgical scenarios. RESULTS Increased turbulent flow was observed in bronchoscopes compared to more laminar flow in endotracheal tubes of similar outer diameter. Flow analysis displayed higher resistances in all pediatric bronchoscope sizes except one (3.0 bronchoscope) compared to similar-sized endotracheal tubes. Loss of adequate ventilation was observed if the bronchoscope was not assembled correctly or if increased peak inspiratory pressures were needed. Anesthesia flow to the patient was reduced by 63% during telescope insertion. CONCLUSIONS Flow analysis illustrates increased turbulent flow and increased airflow resistance in all but one size of pediatric bronchoscopes compared to endotracheal tubes. This increased turbulence and resistance, along with the unanticipated gas distal exit pattern, may contribute to the documented hypercarbia and hypoxemia during procedures. These findings may explain why hypoxemia and hypercarbia are commonly observed during rigid bronchoscopy, especially when positive pressure ventilation is needed.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders. Angiotensin II (Ang-II), the final product of this pathway, is known for its vasoconstrictive and proliferative effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a newly discovered homolog of ACE, plays a key role as the central negative regulator of the RAS. It diverts the generation of vasoactive Ang-II into the vasodilatory and growth inhibiting peptide angiotensin(1–7) [Ang(1–7)], thereby providing counter-regulatory responses to neurohormonal activation. There is substantial experimental evidence evaluating the role of ACE2/Ang(1–7) in hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis. In this review, we aim to focus on the conceptual facts of the ACE2-Ang(1–7) axis with regards to clinical implications and therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disorders, with emphasis on the potential therapeutic role in cardiovascular diseases.

AIM This paper aimed to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in Calu-3 cells infected by influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H5N1. METHODS We downloaded proteome data (BTO: 0000762) from the Proteomics Identifications database and identified the DEPs in the IAV-infected Calu-3 cells. Then we constructed a protein-protein interaction network and a transcriptional regulatory network of the proteins. Finally, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to study the IAV infection at a functional level. RESULTS A total of 4 protein groups between the normal cells and the Calu-3 cells infected by IAV, severe acute respiratory syndrome or swine influenza were identified. In the networks, we found 5 significant proteins including FAN, CPSF2, AGO1, AGO2 and PAX5. In addition, we demonstrated those proteins were associated with GO terms such as phosphate metabolic process, calcium ion transport, cell division and regulation of cell motion. STAT1, NS2, CD5, NCKX6 and PDGFB were significant DEPs in these GO terms. CONCLUSIONS By referring to the previous studies, we suggest that proteins including FAN, CPSF2, AGO1, AGO2, PAX5, STAT1 and PDGFB can be used as therapeutic targets of IAV infection.

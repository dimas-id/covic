The UK Government recognised the importance of vaccines in the control of new emerging disease threats and in 2015 established the UK Vaccine Network to focus on specific areas of need. One of these was the understanding of what is involved in the development of a new vaccine and what are the potential bottlenecks to a rapid response in the face of an epidemic such as Ebola, MERS and more recently COVID-19. A Working Group was established to initially produce a Vaccine Development Process Map for a Human Vaccine. However, in view of the importance of animal wellbeing and the significant impact of diseases with Zoonotic potential, a similar Map has been created outlining the Veterinary Vaccine Development Process. This paper describes the production of that Map and covers the process from the generation of a Target Product Profile (TPP) through Discovery and Feasibility, and on to Product Development and Registration.

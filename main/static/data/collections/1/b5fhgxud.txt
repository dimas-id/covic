The nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain IS-1494 like (variant-2; GI-23) was first isolated in the Middle East (1998). Despite intensive vaccinations, IS-1494 like IBVs are still circulating in Iran (the dominant genotype) and spread to other countries. Here, the full-length genome of this Iranian IS-1494 like IBV was (Mahed) determined to understand its evolutionary relationships. The genome consists of 27,652 nucleotides, with mutations in most of the structural genes. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the Mahed isolate (5′ UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3′ UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c, and 6b, which has rarely been reported, were present in the Mahed genome. According to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, 1a, S2, M, E, N protein, Mahed isolate clustered with the QX type strain. Based on the partial 1b, S1, Mahed clustered with the Q1 strain. The full-length genome of Mahed isolate shared the highest sequence homology with Gray and JMK (90.06–90.07%) and was least related to the Vic-s (86.21%). These data show that evolutionary variation because of recombination in IBV plays a major role in the adaptation and origin of IBV leading to new genetic and types of the virus strain.

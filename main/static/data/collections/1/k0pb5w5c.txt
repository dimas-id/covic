The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing. However, these tests might not be available in an emergency setting.

In this review, we present the typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia and discuss the main differential diagnosis.

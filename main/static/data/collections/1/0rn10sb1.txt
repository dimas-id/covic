In the last decade, many energy devices have entered day-to-day practice in thoracic surgery. Some have proven and recognized applications, whereas others still require further trials. Nevertheless, currently used devices continue to be improved on and new applications for current devices will be evaluated. Ultimately, novel applications of energy in thoracic surgery and refinement in technology will hopefully allow for safer and less invasive techniques for patients requiring thoracic surgical procedures. In this article, we review the present and future applications of energy devices in thoracic surgery.

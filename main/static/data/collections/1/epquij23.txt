AIMS To assess the use of potassium bromide (KBr) as a therapeutic intervention for perennial ryegrass toxicosis (PRGT) in lambs fed ryegrass seed containing lolitrem B. METHODS Male lambs aged 10-12 months (n = 43) were assigned to received ryegrass seed containing lolitrem B, at a dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (Groups 2, 3 and 4), or lucerne chaff and molasses (Groups 1 and 5). Lambs in Groups 2 and 3 were observed for clinical signs and gait changes until defined signs of PGRT were observed, when they were transferred, with lambs in Group 1, to the Testing phase of the trial. Lambs in Group 3 were then treated with a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg bromide. Lambs in Groups 4 and 5 received KBr daily from the start of the trial (540 mg/kg bromide over 3 days then 20 mg/kg daily) and were transferred to the Testing phase after 18 days. Clinical examination and gait assessment, and surface electromyography of the triceps muscle, measuring root-mean-square (RMS) voltages, were carried out on Days 0, 1 and 2 of the Testing phase followed by necropsy, histopathology, measurement of concentrations of bromide in serum and CSF and faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM). RESULTS In Group 3 lambs, mean composite gait scores decreased between Testing phase Day 0 and Days 1 and 2 (p < 0.001), but increased in lambs in Group 2 between Day 0 and Day 2 (p = 0.015). Scores for lambs in Group 3 on Day 2 were lower than for lambs in Group 2 (p < 0.001). Mean RMS voltages on Day 2 were higher in lambs in Group 2 than Group 3 (p = 0.045). Mean concentrations of bromide in serum were >800 Âµg/mL in lambs in Groups 3 and 4 on Day 2. Concentrations of FCM were higher in lambs from Group 2 than in Groups 1 or 5, but were similar in Groups 2, 3 and 4. Histopathological findings in the cerebellum of lambs from Groups 2, 3 and 4 were similar, showing pyknosis of neurons within the granular layer of the cerebellum and Purkinje neuron proximal axonal spheroid formation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A single oral dose of 300 mg/kg bromide in lambs with neurological signs of PRGT resulted in reduced composite gait scores and reduced RMS voltages, indicating a significant improvement in clinical signs of ataxia, movement disorder and muscle tremor associated with the neurotoxic effects of lolitrem B.

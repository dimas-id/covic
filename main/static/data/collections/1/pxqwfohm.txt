Recurrence of positive SARS CoV‐2 PCR has been described in patients discharged from hospital after 2 consecutive negative PCR. We discuss possible explanations including false negative, reactivation and re‐infection and propose different strategy to solve this issue. Prolonged SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA shedding and recurrence of viral RNA shedding in asymptomatic patients remain unknown. Transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 by asymptomatic carriers had been documented. Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, it is necessary to carry out large studies to better understand the issue of potential SARS‐CoV‐2 recurrence in COVID‐19 patients.

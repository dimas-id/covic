We determined the untranslated 5′-leader sequence for three different isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV): pathogenic European- and American-types, as well as an American-type vaccine strain. 5′-leader from European- and American-type PRRSV differed in length (220 and 190 nt, respectively), and exhibited only approximately 50% nucleotide homology. Nevertheless, highly conserved areas were identified in the leader of all 3 PRRSV isolates, which constitute candidate motifs for binding of protein(s) involved in viral replication. These comparative data provide a priori knowledge for mutational identification of virulence determinants in the 5′ nontranslated part of the PRRSV genome.

Cough is an indispensable defensive reflex. Although generally beneficial, it is also a common symptom of diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, upper respiratory tract infections, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer. Cough remains a major unmet medical need and although the centrally acting opioids have remained the antitussive of choice for decades, they have many unwanted side effects. However, new research into the behaviour of airway sensory nerves has provided greater insight into the mechanisms of cough and new avenues for the discovery of novel non-opioid antitussive drugs. In this review, the pathophysiological mechanisms of cough and the development of novel antitussive drugs are reviewed.

Rough set theory has many interesting applications in circumstances characterized by vagueness. In this paper, the applications of rough set theory in community detection analysis are discussed based on the Rough Net definition. We will focus the application of Rough Net on community detection validity in both monoplex and multiplex networks. Also, the topological evolution estimation between adjacent layers in dynamic networks is discussed and a new community interaction visualization approach combining both complex network representation and Rough Net definition is adopted to interpret the community structure. We provide some examples that illustrate how the Rough Net definition can be used to analyze the properties of the community structure in real-world networks, including dynamic networks.

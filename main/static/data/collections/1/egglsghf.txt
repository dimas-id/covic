BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in December 2019, Wuhan, China. We aimed to figure out the time-point and duration of using antiviral drugs for receiving the maximal effects in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled 129 confirmed COVID-19 mild to moderate patients who had been treated with antiviral drugs during their hospitalization in Wuhan Union Hospital China. The patients were divided into early antiviral treatment group and late antiviral treatment group. The demographic data, laboratory tests, the virus clearance time, chest computed tomography (CT) scans, etc. were extracted, calculated and compared between two groups. RESULTS: Our data showed that the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 6 days in all patients. The group with early antiviral treatment demonstrated 7 days shorter in the virus clearance time when compared to the group with late antiviral treatment. After virus clearance, the group with early antiviral treatment showed milder illness than the group with late antiviral treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Early antiviral treatment could effectively shorten the virus clearance time, and prevent the rapid progression of COVID-19. Therefore, the COVID-19 patients should receive combined therapies with antiviral treatment at early stage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

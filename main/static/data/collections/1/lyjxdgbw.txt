Coastal zones are characterized by the interactions between continents and oceans and, therefore, between fresh and salt surface and groundwater. The wetlands of coastal zones represent transitional ecosystems that are affected by these conditions, although little is known about the hydrogeochemistry of wetlands, especially coastal wetlands. In the present study, the hydrogeochemical characterization of coastal freshwater herbaceous wetlands in the Ciénaga del Fuerte Protected Natural Area in Veracruz, Mexico, in the American tropics was carried out per plant community. Four herbaceous wetlands (alligator flag, saw grass, cattail, and floodplain pasture) were monitored to understand the origin of the water feeding these ecosystems, the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater, and the relationship between the groundwater and ecology of these ecosystems during dry and rainy seasons. The results indicate that Ciénaga del Fuerte is located in a regional discharge area and receives local recharge, so it is fed by both regional and local flows. The chemical composition varied temporally and spatially, creating unique conditions that determined the habitat occupied by the hydrophytic vegetation. The spatiotemporal behaviour of groundwater is one factor that, along with the hydroperiod, determines wetland dynamics and affects wetland biota (ecohydrogeochemistry). Generalist plant communities established in zones of local recharge, whereas other more specialized and/or plastic communities inhabited zones receiving regional flows with greater ion concentrations. This information forms the basis for establishing an appropriate scale (municipal, state, or larger regions) for the sustainable management of goods and services provided by the wetlands.

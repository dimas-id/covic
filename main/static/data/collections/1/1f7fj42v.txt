In this perspective we offer views on how microbial activities may change in response to the impact of human activities and an increasing human population. New knowledge is forthcoming in microbiology and immunology on the biology of emerging pathogens. With the exposure of human populations to changing environments, through climate change and human encroachment into previously unpopulated areas, there is likely to be increased incidences of diseases caused by existing, emerging and previously unrecognised pathogens.

Science today studies phenomena lasting less than 10(−21) s and phenomena which occurred more than 13 billion years ago; science also studies phenomena occurring over distances greater than 10(28) cm and shorter than 10(−13) cm; that is, science studies phenomena occurring over times and distances varying by a factor of about 10(40) (Fig. 3.1). In those incomprehensible ranges of time and space, the description of the physical world presented by science is most impressive. Based on what we know today everything in this enormous cosmos everywhere is made up of the same microscopic particles, the atoms and their constituents; their behavior is governed by the same physical laws everywhere.

BACKGROUND Rives-Stoppa repair is widely accepted technique in large midline IH, and appears to be advantageous compared to other surgical techniques concerning complications and recurrence rates. The aim of this case series study was to analyze 1-year outcomes in patients with IH treated with Progrip self-gripping mesh compared to polypropylene (PPL) mesh fixed with sutures during the Rives-Stoppa technique. METHODS Between June 2014 and June 2015, we performed a prospective comparative non-randomized (case series) analysis between 25 patients with IH using retromuscular Progrip self-gripping mesh and 25 patients with retromuscular PPL mesh fixed with sutures, under Rives-Stoppa repair. All intraoperative and perioperative morbidities were reported with particular attention to wound infection, seroma or hematoma formation, duration of hospital stay, presence of abdominal wall pain (VAS) and recurrence during long-term follow-up. RESULTS Mean operative time in Progrip group was shorter than Non-Progrip group (101±29.5 versus 121±39.8min). In Progrip group, the only postoperative complication was seroma in two patients; however, in Non-Progrip group, we reported seroma in three patients, and hematoma in 4 patients (p=0.03). The median hospital stay was shorter in Progrip group (5.8±2.2days versus 6.6±2.9days). Mean VAS score in the first 48h was higher in Non-Progrip group than Progrip group (4.9±2.1 versus 8.1±2)(p=0.01). The median follow-up was 13 months (range 12-20 months) and none of the 50 patients had a hernia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS In Rives-Stoppa repair, retromuscular Progrip mesh causes less postoperative pain in the first 48h and lower rate of hematoma than PPL mesh fixed with sutures in the short term follow-up.

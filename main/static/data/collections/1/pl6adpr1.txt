BACKGROUND Parathyroid gland mediastinal ectopia is an unusual but challenging condition in surgical management of hyperparathyroidism. Posterior mediastinum parathyroid ectopia is rare, and glands need to be removed either with a broad open cervical or thoracic approach. In recent years, several minimally invasive approaches to mediastinal parathyroid glands have been described, but for posterior mediastinum adenomas, proposed techniques are transthoracic. METHODS The aim of this paper is to describe, to our best knowledge for the first time, a standardized pure endoscopic cervical technique to approach posterior mediastinal parathyroid adenomas which we have used in three patients. RESULTS The technique was applied in three patients which excellent surgical, postoperative, and cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic prevertebral approach is a feasible, sure and inexpensive standardized pure endoscopic cervical approach to posterior mediastinal parathyroid adenomas, which may result in a less aggressive surgical option when compared with thoracic approaches.

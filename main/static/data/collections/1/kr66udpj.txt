Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct. It is usually asymptomatic but may present with bleeding, infections, and intestinal obstruction. It also may be a content of a hernia sac, a so-called Littre hernia. Herein, we will present the case of a 75-year-old female, who suffered from a painful swelling of the right inguinal region. Ultrasound imaging detected an inguinal hernia with incarcerated blind ending small bowel. Immediately, a laparoscopy was conducted. We diagnosed a right femoral hernia with an incarcerated MD. A TAPP (transabdominal preperitoneal) procedure was performed and the MD tangential stapled. Due to an uneventful postoperative course, the patient left the hospital after two days. An incarceration of a MD in a femoral hernia is rare. Tangential resection of the MD with simultaneous hernia repair in a TAPP technique seems to be a sufficient approach, when it is conducted by an experienced surgeon.

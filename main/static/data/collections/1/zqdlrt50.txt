1. We have generated monoclonal antibodies against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) X1/3a protein (3a), which are suitable for western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. 2. We have established and characterised an in-vivo 3a transgenic Drosophila model, and demonstrated its usefulness in studying SARS-CoV 3a gene function. 3. We validated our in-vivo findings on 3a gene function in mammalian Vero E6 cells. 4. Our findings raise the possibility of using ion channel blockers as a novel approach to suppress SARS-CoV-induced cell death.

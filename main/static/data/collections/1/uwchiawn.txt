In 72 faecal extracts examined from babies and infants with an acute gastroenteritis, virus particles were found in 29 cases. These particles could be classified as reovirus-like in 16 cases, coronaviruses in 11 cases and adenoviruses in 2 cases. The electron microscopic investigation of 11 faecal extracts from healthy babies did not show any of these particles. Comparative studies on the concentration methods were performed.

To circumvent the limited availability of RNA extraction reagents, we developed a protocol for direct RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. Incubation of specimens at 65oC for 10 minutes along with the use of TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix provides higher analytical sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than many other commercial and laboratory-developed methods. In 132 specimens submitted for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our optimized approach were 95%, 99% and 98.5%, respectively, with reference to results obtained by a standard approach involving RNA extraction. Also, the RT-qPCR CT values obtained by the two methods were highly correlated.

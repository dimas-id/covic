The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has required a complete change in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who need to undergo endoscopic procedures. Several preventive measures must be taken to avoid the spread of infection among health-care professionals and patients with IBD, including the use of personal protective equipment, greater attention to endoscopic room hygiene and rescheduling of non-urgent procedures. This Perspective aims to provide a guide based on the Italian and French experience to better face the difficulties encountered by endoscopists during this global health emergency. In particular, recommendations regarding the use of personal protective equipment to prevent COVID-19 transmission, both for patients and health-care professionals, are proposed and different scenarios in endoscopic IBD management are evaluated to suggest when endoscopy could be rescheduled and replaced by alternative biomarkers.

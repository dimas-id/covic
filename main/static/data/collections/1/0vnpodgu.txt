Increasing number of deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic has raised serious global concerns. Higher testing capacity and ample intensive care availability could explain lower mortality in some countries compared to others. Nevertheless, it is also plausible that the SARS-CoV-2 mutations giving rise to different phylogenetic clades are responsible for the obvious death disparities around the world. Current research literature linking the genetic make-up of SARS-CoV-2 with fatality is lacking. Here, we suggest that this disparity in fatality rates may be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 evolving mutations and urge the international community to begin addressing the phylogenetic clade classification of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to clinical outcomes.

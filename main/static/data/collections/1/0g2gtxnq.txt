Abstract Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has been shown lately to be a host restriction factor that encodes an enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidized form of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). A series of studies have shown that 25HC activity in hosts plays a vital role in inhibiting viral infection. In this study, we explored the antiviral effect of CH25H and 25HC on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes high mortality rates in newborn piglets with severe diarrhea, and considerable financial loss in the swine industry worldwide. Our results showed that PEDV infection downregulated the expression of CH25H in Vero cells. An overexpression and knockdown assay indicated that CH25H has significant antiviral action against PEDV, and a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) that lacks hydroxylase activity also retains antiviral activity to a lesser extent. Furthermore, 25HC had a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against different PEDV strains by blocking viral entry. In addition, CH25H and 25HC inhibited the replication of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Taken together, CH25H as a natural host restriction factor could inhibit PEDV and TGEV infection.

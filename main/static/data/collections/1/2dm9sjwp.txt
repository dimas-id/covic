Ultrasonography (US) is one of the most common diagnostic imaging tests in children. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is important to operate with a plan designed to protect health care workers, to prevent transmission of infection from child and parents to another child or an accompanying person in the US suite, and to save valuable protective material and resources. Measures during routine US in children can be challenging both in general hospitals with paediatric units and in dedicated paediatric hospitals. Special considerations include: a) cancellation or rescheduling of unnecessary imaging tests, b) a relevant questionnaire on the request form informing about patient and accompanying personâ€™s symptoms and likely exposure in addition to general triage, c) appropriate patient and parent protective measures, d) recruitment and selection of US machines in different protected areas depending on the possibility or certainty for the infection, e) regular personnel protective measures and personal hand hygiene, f) routine disinfection of probes and adjacent surfaces and g) machine/room deep disinfection, if required. Our purpose is to present the modified US services in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in two hospitals based on the instructions of the national organization of public health in Greece and what is known about the mode of transmission of the virus.

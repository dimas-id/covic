OBJECTIVE To review the initial results and surgical outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. DESIGN Prospective case series. SETTING A university teaching hospital and a regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS All patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy from August 2009 to March 2011. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the study period. The indications for surgery included symptomatic gallstones (n=43) and gallbladder polyps (n=7). The mean operating time was 78 (standard deviation, 24) minutes. Forty-five of the patients successfully underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, giving a success rate of 90%. In the remaining five patients, additional working ports were constructed to obtain better exposure and dissection around Calot's triangle. On comparing the results of the initial 25 cases to the subsequent 25 cases, in the latter group the operating time was significantly shorter (86 vs 71 minutes; P=0.02), and the success rate was higher (80% vs 100%; P=0.05). During the median follow-up period of 6.8 months, four patients had complications, which included: postoperative urinary retention (n=2), one each with a haematoma and an incisional hernia. No patient endured bile duct injury, postoperative bile leakage, or haemorrhage in our series. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is feasible and safe for treatment of uncomplicated gallbladder diseases. There was a reduction in the operating time and increase in success rate with accumulation of experience. Nevertheless, surgeons should be cautious about the potential risks of this new technique.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in China, has spread rapidly to affect the entire world in a matter of months. Main manifestations of the disease include a febrile syndrome accompanied by respiratory symptoms; however, cases of systemic involvement are increasingly being reported, including cardiac and central nervous system compromise. In the series by Ling M. et al., 214 patients with COVID-19 were studied; 78 (36.4 %) had neurologic manifestations, which were classified into four main groups: acute cerebrovascular disease, impaired consciousness, peripheral nervous system involvement and muscular manifestations. Another report published by Li et al. describes that, out of 221 patients with COVID-19, 13 developed acute cerebrovascular disease with cerebral infarction, venous thrombosis and intracerebral hemorrhage.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a pressing public health emergency garnering rapid response from scientists across the globe. Host cell invasion is initiated through direct binding of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disrupting the spike-ACE2 interaction is a potential therapeutic target for treating COVID-19. We have developed a proximity-based AlphaLISA assay to measure binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to ACE2. Utilizing this assay platform, a drug-repurposing screen against 3,384 small molecule drugs and pre-clinical compounds was performed, yielding 25 high-quality, small-molecule hits that can be evaluated in cell-based models. This established AlphaLISA RBD-ACE2 platform can facilitate evaluation of biologics or small molecules that can perturb this essential viral-host interaction to further the development of interventions to address the global health pandemic.

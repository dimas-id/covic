Iatrogenic HIV infection refers here to cases of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) caused by private and public administration of blood products [1]. Following the discovery of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981, numerous warnings were issued by specialists regarding the use of blood products. In spite of this, no effective measures such as a switch to cryoprecipitate were taken, and the authorization of safe heated products was also delayed, as a result of which 40 % of Japanese hemophiliacs, or some 2000 people, fell victim as a result of ‘human error’ [2]. Additionally, since insufficient risk data was provided, the infection spread to partners, families, and other associates of hemophiliacs through secondary and tertiary infection. In connection, questions were asked as to the degree of responsibility of those institutions involved in the outbreak and spread of the infection.

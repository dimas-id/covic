Contaminated poultry meat is a major source of human foodborne illnesses. Many interventions have been developed to reduce and/or eliminate human foodborne pathogens in poultry products; however, treatments with cold plasma or carnosine or a combination of both interventions have not been extensively investigated. In this communication, the bacterial microflora of poultry meat samples after treatments with cold plasma and carnosine were characterized with EcoPlates &#8482; in the OmniLog ® system. The plates were incubated at 25 o C for seven days in the OmniLog ® chamber, and bacterial growth was monitored by recording formazan production every 30 minutes at OD 590 nm . The kinetics of lag, log and stationary phases of the bacterial growth patterns followed the Gompertz sigmoidal model, but with different inflection times and asymptotes at the log phase and the stationary phase, respectively. Results indicated that treating poultry meat samples with cold plasma technology and carnosine could inhibit growth of the bacteria in the treated meat samples. Of 31 chemicals tested, phenylethylamine, &#945;- D -lactose, D,L -&#945;-glycerol phosphate, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, Î³-hydroxybutyric acid, &#945;-ketobutyric acid or D -malic acid could not be metabolized by bacteria in the meat samples. Future research is required to determine whether these seven chemicals that inhibit growth of bacteria from the meat samples can be used as food preservatives for extending shelf-life of these products. Whether the bacterial flora be as an indicator of effectiveness for meat samples treated with cold plasma, carnosine or both needs further study.

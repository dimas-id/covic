The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of starch granules enriched with carvacrol and mixed with straw pellets (as poultry litter) on the mortality of larvae and adults of the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus Panzer, a cosmopolitan pest inhabiting chicken houses in vast numbers worldwide. Additionally, the effect of starch granules on the growth parameters and survival of broiler chickens exposed to treated litter was examined. In this study, granules containing 3, 5, and 10% carvacrol was used. In a simulated chicken house bioassay, this material was mixed with pellets in three different proportions: 30/70%, 40/60%, and 50/50% (granules/pellets, respectively). On this medium, young larvae (approximately 10 days old), older larvae (last stage before pupa), and unsexed 7–10 days old adults of the lesser mealworm, with access to food, were colonized. Experiments were performed at 29°C in the dark. The study shows that poultry litter with the addition of starch granules enriched with 10% of carvacrol in the proportion of 40:60% (granules:pellets) appears to be the optimal medium applicable to broiler houses for A. diaperinus control. In this environment, all larvae and adults died within 3–4 days and the overall development of the experimental chickens was similar to that of the control. However, the feed conversion rate was slightly higher in the treated group (1.72) than in the control group (1.56). The average final body weight in the treated group was 100 g lower than that in the control group (the differences were not statistically significant).

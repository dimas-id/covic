BACKGROUND Coronary lipid core plaque may be associated with the incidence of subsequent cardiovascular events. METHODS We analyzed outcomes of 239 patients who underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coronary imaging between 2009-2011. Multivariable Cox regression was used to identify variables independently associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiac mortality, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), stroke, and unplanned revascularization) during follow-up. RESULTS Mean patient age was 64±9years, 99% were men, and 50% were diabetic, presenting with stable coronary artery disease (61%) or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS, 39%). Target vessel pre-stenting median lipid core burden index (LCBI) was 88 [interquartile range, IQR 50-130]. Median LCBI in non-target vessels was 57 [IQR 26-94]. Median follow-up was 5.3years. The 5-year MACE rate was 37.5% (cardiac mortality was 15.0%). On multivariable analysis the following variables were associated with MACE: diabetes mellitus, prior percutaneous coronary intervention performed at index angiography, and non-target vessel LCBI. Non-target vessel LCBI of 77 was determined using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis to be a threshold for prediction of MACE in our cohort. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for non-target vessel LCBI ≥77 was 14.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.47-133.51, p=0.002). The 5-year cumulative incidence of events in the above-threshold group was 58.0% vs. 13.1% in the below-threshold group. CONCLUSION During long-term follow-up of patients who underwent NIRS imaging, high LCBI in a non-PCI target vessel was associated with increased incidence of MACE.

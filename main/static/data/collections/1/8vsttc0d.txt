A patient presented 2 weeks after distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with increased bloody output from his surgical drain. Catheter angiography found an enlarging splenic artery stump pseudoaneurysm. During the procedure, there was concern that nontarget embolization may occur, given the short splenic artery remnant. Pseudoaneurysm thrombosis was subsequently achieved using a variation of stent-supported coil embolization. At 3-month follow-up, the patient had no recurrent bleeding from the surgical site. Although this technique has been described in the treatment of neurovascular and renal artery aneurysms, it is applicable to, and readily adapted for, use in visceral arterial procedures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc and created challenges in various subspecialty training programs, including hematology/oncology fellowship programs. The challenge of social distancing, providing care for those infected by COVID-19, continuing appropriate treatment of time-sensitive diseases, and the looming threat of health care worker infections required swift planning and restructuring of training programs. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education provided leeway to tackle the challenges faced by institutions and training programs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there is no established guideline specific to hematology and oncology fellowship programs. While understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all, shared experiences can assist training programs to incorporate best practices and customize their programs to provide an active educational environment that balances patient care needs, didactics, scholarly activities, and wellbeing during the process of rapid changes and adaptation. We share our hematology/oncology fellowship program's restructuring approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

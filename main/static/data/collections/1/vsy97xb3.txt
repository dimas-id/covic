Of paired serum samples of 196 cattle with respiratory disease from 37 herds which were tested for hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies against coronavirus (BCV) 185 of the first specimens and 190 of the second ones gave positive results. This difference was due to five animals of five different farms showing seroconversions between the time of the blood collections. A significant rise in antibody titer (no less than 4-fold) was evident in 28 cattle from 3 of the above mentioned and 12 other farms. Altogether serological indication of acute coronavirus infections were gained in 33 (16.8%) of animals with respiratory diseases which derived from 17 of 37 herds. Most of these infections (about 35%) occurred in animals older than 6 months while calves up to 3 or 6 months were only affected in a ratio of ca. 10%, respectively.

Since China participated in the Human Genome Project in the 1990s, implications of the debate surrounding the Homo erectus Peking Manâ€™s ancestorship for nationalism wrapped in scientific jargon have been well comprehended by various segments of the society with ultranationalists and a liberal public opinion as the two extremes contesting each other. This divergence also cuts through the Chinese party-state. The discourse on a pure ancestry, an ancestral home, a natural bond between this ancestor and the environment, and most of all, a narrative that attributes remarkable lineal continuity to physical, mental, intellectual and even moral traits unique to this ancestor and its posterity, support fanatical racial nationalisms.

INTRODUCTION Intracranial infectious aneurysm (IIA) accounts for less than 5% of all intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of endovascular treatment for IIA. METHODS During a 14-year period, 15 patients (age range, 2-68 years; mean, 42.8 years) with 17 aneurysms were diagnosed with IIA and treated via an endovascular route at our institution. The IIA diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory findings of infection, echocardiography results, and digital subtraction angiography that were collected retrospectively. All patients were clinically and radiologically followed. The modified Rankin scale was used to evaluate clinical outcome. RESULTS Among 15 patients, 12 presented with ruptured aneurysms (7 intraparenchymal hematoma, 4 subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 subdural hematoma), 2 with cerebral infarcts, and 1 with pansinusitis and epidural abscess. All but one aneurysm were distally located in intracranial circulation, 14 were in anterior, and the remaining 3 were in posterior circulation. The final diagnosis was based on aneurysm morphology, location, and clinical laboratory findings. Endovascular treatment was scheduled initially for all IIAs; 13 of 17 IIAs underwent endovascular parent vessel occlusion, 3 underwent spontaneous parent vessel occlusion while waiting for intervention, and the remaining patient was treated by intrasaccular coil occlusion. There were no instances of perioperative neurological complications. Late clinical and radiological outcomes included absence of endovascular treatment related to mortality and aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment may be performed safely at the time of diagnosis for at least symptomatic IIAs under the protective effect of antibiotic treatment.

Heparin is one of the oldest drugs still in widespread clinical use. Its discovery in 1916 predates the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration. Since 1935, over 15,000 research papers have been published on the effects of heparin. Because the exact chemical formula of heparin is unknown, synthetic manufacturing has proven difficult. In 2008, a worldwide recall of heparin occurred. Scientists determined that a contaminant known as oversulfated chondroitin sulfate was responsible for the numerous deaths and adverse events. This contaminant was first traced to a chemical plant in Changzou, China. This article will review the discovery of heparin and the adulteration process that jeopardized the world's heparin supply.

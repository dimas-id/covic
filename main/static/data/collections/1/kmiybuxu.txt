Abstract Autophagy, an evolutional conserved lysosomal degradation process, has been implicated to play an important role in cellular defense against a variety of microbial infection. Interestingly, numerous studies found that some pathogens, especially positive-single-strand RNA viruses, actually hijacked autophagy machinery to promote virus infection within host cells, facilitating different stages of viral life cycle, from replication, assembly to egress. Enterovirus, a genus of positive-strand RNA virus, can cause various human diseases and is one of main public health threat globally, yet no effective clinical intervention is available for enterovirus infection. Here we summarized recent literature on how enteroviruses regulate and utilize autophagy process to facilitate their propagation in the host cells. The studies on the interplay between enterovirus and autophagy not only shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying how enterovirus hijacks cellular components and pathway for its own benefits, but also provide therapeutic option against enterovirus infection.

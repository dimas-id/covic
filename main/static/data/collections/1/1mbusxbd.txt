In selected patients, transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects with the AMPLATZER Septal Occluder has yielded excellent results. However, there is a slight risk of device embolization after deployment. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman in whom an embolized AMPLATZER device was retrieved percutaneously from the right pulmonary artery. We also discuss important technical principles for managing this uncommon but potentially severe complication.

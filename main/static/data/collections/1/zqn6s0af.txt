In the current spread of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), antiviral drug discovery is of great importance. AutoDock Vina was used to screen potential drugs by molecular docking with the structural protein and non-structural protein sites of new coronavirus. Ribavirin, a common antiviral drug, remdesivir, chloroquine and luteolin were studied. Honeysuckle is generally believed to have antiviral effects in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, luteolin (the main flavonoid in honeysuckle) was found to bind with a high affinity to the same sites of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 as the control molecule. Chloroquine has been proved clinically effective and can bind to the main protease; this may be the antiviral mechanism of this drug. The study was restricted to molecular docking without validation by molecular dynamics simulations. Interactions with the main protease may play a key role in fighting against viruses. Luteolin is a potential antiviral molecule worthy of attention.

The psychotherapeutic management of a suicidal crisis makes it possible to think of the health crisis linked to COVID-19 from a particular angle. In this article, we show the parallels but also the differences between these two types of crises. The sequential course of the crisis, the viral agent which acts as a triggering factor and the host of reactions which follow can thus evoke a suicidal crisis during which a subject often perceives an external event as a precipitating factor. However, unlike confinement in the case of the virus, it is the relationship, in particular the therapeutic relationship, which makes it possible to get through the crisis. This relationship should allow us to get to know our specific vulnerabilities, those on which the triggering factor has specifically acted.

COVID-19, an acute respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread throughout the world. China has achieved initial success in containing this highly infectious disease with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Current findings have shown that the Chinese protocol can reduce the incidence of severe or critical events, improve clinical recovery and help alleviate symptoms such as cough or fever. The inclusion of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in this protocol is based on its successful experience in fighting against pestilence. To date there are 133 ongoing registered clinical studies on TCM/integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Although there are no high-quality clinical evidences, pharmacological studies have suggested that Chinese medicine is effective for COVID-19 probably through its host-directed regulation and certain antiviral effects.

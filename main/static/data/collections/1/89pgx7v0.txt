Taking the context of simulating a retail environment using agent based modelling, a theoretical model is presented that describes the probability distribution of customer"collisions"using a novel space transformation to the Torus $Tor^2$. A method for generating the distribution of customer paths based on historical basket data is developed. Finally a calculation of the number of simulations required for statistical significance is developed. An implementation of this modelling approach to run simulations on multiple store geometries at industrial scale is being developed with current progress detailed in the technical appendix.

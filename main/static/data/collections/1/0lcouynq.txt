The immunoregulatory actions of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) of relevance immunosuppression were investigated. To test the hypothesis that CLA ameliorate immunosuppression, we developed the immunosuppressive model of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in broiler chickens induced by cyclosporin A. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes of broiler chickens were cultured with media containing various concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 200 Î¼mol/L) of c9, t11-CLA and t10, c12-CLA to investigate the effects of CLA isomers on peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-2, the activity of phospholipase C, and protein kinase C production. Results suggested that CLA alleviated the immunosuppression of T lymphocytes in broiler chickens exposed to cyclosporin A through increasing of peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2. The 2 CLA isomers enhanced T lymphocyte proliferation at low concentration and inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation at high concentration. In addition, the effect of c9, t11-CLA was better than that of t10, c12-CLA. At the cellular level, the effects of CLA on the alleviation of immunosuppression in T lymphocytes are mainly attributable to increasing the signaling molecules, such as phospholipase C and protein kinase C.

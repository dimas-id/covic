OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in the normal canine liver. STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. ANIMALS Adult Beagle dogs (n = 5). METHODS Gelatin sponge particles (GSPs) were injected through a microcatheter for selective embolization of the left hepatic artery in normal dogs. Computed tomography (CT) and histology were performed during an 8-week observation period; biochemical analysis data were obtained during a 12-week observation period after TAE. RESULTS Embolization was successful in all dogs and did not induce any change in the clinical appearance of dogs. Postoperative CT was consistent with recanalization of the artery within 2 weeks of embolization in all dogs. Hepatic enzyme levels increased temporarily after embolization but gradually returned to normal ranges. Histological examinations did not differ between treated and untreated liver tissues. CONCLUSION TAE appears safe in normal dogs observed for 12 weeks. Arterial recanalization seems to occur within 2 weeks after injection of GSPs in the left hepatic artery. IMPACT/CLINICAL RELEVANCE Selective TAE of the hepatic artery was well tolerated in normal dogs. Selective TAE may be applicable to canine hepatocellular carcinoma.

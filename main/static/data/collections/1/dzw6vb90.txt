The objective of this review is to summarize the collective knowledge regarding the risks and complications in vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation (VCA), focusing on upper extremity and facial transplantation. The field of VCA has entered its second decade with an increasing experience in both the impressive good outcomes, as well as defining challenges, risks, and experienced poor results. The limited and selective publishing of negative outcomes in this relatively new field makes it difficult to conclusively evaluate outcomes of graft and patient survival and morbidities. Therefore, published data, conference proceedings, and communications were summarized in an attempt to provide a current outline of complications. These data on the medical complications of VCA should allow for precautions to avoid poor outcomes, data to better provide informed consent to potential recipients, and result in improvements in graft and patient outcomes as VCA finds a place as a therapeutic option for selected patients.

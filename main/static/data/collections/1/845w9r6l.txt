Although hematological abnormalities have been described among patients with influenza virus infection, little is known about their impact on the outcome of the patients. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and clinical impact of severe hematological abnormalities in patients with confirmed influenza virus infection. This was an observational retrospective study including all adult patients with diagnosis of influenza virus infection hospitalized from January to May 2016 in our institution. Influenza virus infection was diagnosed by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on respiratory samples. Poor outcome was defined as a composite endpoint in which at least one of the following criteria had to be fulfilled: (a) respiratory failure, (b) SOFA ≥2, or (c) death. Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Applying the HLH-04 criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome, cytopenias (hemoglobin ≤9 g/dl, platelets <100,000/μl or neutrophils <1,000/μl) were present in 51 patients (21%). Patients with hematological abnormalities showed higher SOFA scores, respiratory failure, septic shock and in-hospital mortality than the remaining patients. The composite endpoint was present in 33.3% in the cytopenias group vs. 13.3% in the group without cytopenias (p=0.001). In a multivariate analysis, variables associated with the composite endpoint were: use of steroids prior to present admission (OR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.015–0.96, p=0.046), presence of any hematological abnormality (OR: 3.54; 95% CI:1.66–7.51, p= 0.001), and LDH>225 U/l (OR:4.45; CI:1–19.71, p=0.049). Hematological abnormalities are not uncommon among hospitalized patients with influenza virus infection, and they are associated with a poorer outcome.

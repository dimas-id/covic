INTRODUCTION Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) account for less than 3% of all gastrointestinal tract tumours and 5.7% of all sarcomas, and the majority of these tumours are gastric in origin. Patients commonly present with gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal pain with 10-30% of patients presenting with symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction. PRESENTATION OF A CASE We present a case of a 65-year-old gentleman who presented with symptomatic iron deficiency anaemia. Gastroscopy revealed a large submucosal lesion originating from the gastric fundus, consistent with a GIST. The patient developed acute epigastric pain, vomiting with raised inflammatory markers. A CT of the abdomen revealed the GIST to be causing gastric outlet obstruction as result of a prolapse of the tumour through the pylorus into the duodenum. This also resulted in compression of the distal common bile duct and was associated with the radiological appearance of acute pancreatitis. This responded to conservative management. The GIST was resected subsequently using a laparoscopic technique. DISCUSSION Only one similar case has previously been reported in the literature. Several surgical approached have been described in the management of gastric GISTs including open, laparoscopic, hand assisted, ultrasound assisted and a combined endoscopic and laparoscopic approach. A laparosopic 'eversion' techinque was preferred in our case due to the close proximity of the tumour to the gastro-oesophageal junction. CONCLUSION Pancreatitis secondary to a prolapsed gastric GIST is a rare entity. Laparoscopic wedge resection of these tumours can be safely performed with a satisfactory oncological outcome.

The concept of clinical biocontainment, otherwise known as high-level containment care (HLCC), had its birth among a confluence of near-simultaneous events in 1969. The U.S. Army’s Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) began construction of the first modern biocontainment unit that year, and opened the two-bed facility, often referred to as “the Slammer” in 1971. Over its 41-year existence, 21 persons exposed to highly hazardous infectious diseases were admitted to the Slammer, but none ever contracted the disease to which they had been exposed. Owing, in part, to this underutilization, some questioned the utility of HLCC units. This concern notwithstanding, Emory University and the University of Nebraska opened HLCC units in civilian academic medical centers in 2004 and 2005, respectively. These units, distinct from conventional infectious disease isolation wards found in most major medical centers, proved their worth during the West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014–2015. It is our opinion that such units, as well as the parallel high-level containment transport systems necessary to move patients to them, will continue to play an important role in the global response to emerging and highly hazardous contagious pathogens. Moreover, we feel that the lessons derived from their successful operation will lead to improvements in infection control procedures and practices throughout the healthcare system.

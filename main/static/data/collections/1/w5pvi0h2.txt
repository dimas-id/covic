The dietary intake of flavonoids seems to be inversely related to cardiovascular mortality. The consumption of isoflavonoids is increasing in the general population, especially due to the use of food supplements and a variety of isoflavonoid-rich foods. However, detailed studies on the vascular influence of individual pure isoflavonoids are mostly missing. For this study, 16 isoflavonoids were initially screened for their vasorelaxant properties on rat aortas. The 2 most potent of them, biochanin A and glycitein, were further tested for the mechanism of action on porcine coronary arteries. They both induced an endothelium independent vascular relaxation, with EC50 below 6 and 17 µM, respectively. Biochanin A, but not glycitein, was able to block the vasoconstriction caused by KCl, CaCl2, serotonin, and U46619 in a dose-dependent manner. Another series of experiments suggested that the major mechanism of action of biochanin A was the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, biochanin A in relatively small concentrations (2 - 4 µM) interfered with the cGMP, but not cAMP, pathway in isolated coronary arteries. These results indicate that some isoflavonoids, in particular biochanin A, are able to have vasodilatory effects in micromolar concentrations, which is of potential clinical interest for the management of cardiovascular pathologies.

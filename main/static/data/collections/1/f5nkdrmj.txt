SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019. Since then, it has spread to several countries, becoming classified as a pandemic. So far, there is no definitive treatment or vaccine, so the best solution is to prevent transmission between individuals through social distancing. However, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these distancing measures. Therefore, this study uses data from Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports to try to understand the mobility patterns of the Portuguese population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the Rt value was modeled for Portugal. Also, the changepoint was calculated for the population mobility patterns. Thus, the change in the mobility pattern was used to understand the impact of social distancing measures on the dissemination of COVID-19. As a result, it can be stated that the initial Rt value in Portugal was very close to 3, falling to values close to 1 after 25 days. Social isolation measures were adopted quickly. Furthermore, it was observed that public transport was avoided during the pandemic. Finally, until the emergence of a vaccine or an effective treatment, this will be the new normal and it must be understood that new patterns of mobility, social interaction, and hygiene must be adapted to this new reality.

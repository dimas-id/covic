BACKGROUND: There is a concern that civilian gunshot injuries in Europe are increasing but there is a lack of contemporary studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the current epidemiology and outcome of firearm injuries. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all patients (n = 235) treated for firearm injuries admitted to a Scandinavian trauma center between 2005 and 2016. Local and national trauma registries were used for data collection. RESULTS: Mean age was 31.3 years (SD ± 12.9; range 16–88 years); 93.6% males; mean ISS was 14.3 (SD ± 15.9); 31.9% (75/235) had ISS > 15. There was a significant increase in penetrating trauma (P < 0.001) and firearm injuries (P < 0.001) over the years. The most common anatomical location of firearm injury was the lower extremity, (n = 138/235; 38%), followed by the abdomen (n = 69;19%), upper extremity (n = 53;15%), chest (n = 50; 14%), and head and neck (n = 50; 14%). Ninety patients (38.3%) had more than one anatomic injury location. There were in total 360 firearm injuries and 168 major surgical procedures were performed. 53% (n = 125) of patients underwent at least one surgical procedure. The most common procedures were fracture surgery 42% (n = 70/168), followed by laparotomy 30%% (n = 51), chest tube 17% (n = 29), and thoracotomy 11% (n = 18). Forty-one patients (17%) had at least one major vascular injury (n = 54). The most common vascular injury was lower extremity vessel injuries, 26/54 (48%), followed by vessels in chest and abdomen. There was a significant increase in vascular injuries during the study period (P < 0.006). The 30-day mortality was 12.8% (n = 30); 24 patients died within 24 h mainly due to injuries to the chest and the head and neck region. CONCLUSIONS: Firearm injuries cause significant morbidity and mortality and are an important medical and public health problem. In a Scandinavian trauma center there has been an increase of firearm injuries in recent years. The lower extremities followed by the abdomen are the dominating injured regions and there has been an increase in associated vascular injuries.

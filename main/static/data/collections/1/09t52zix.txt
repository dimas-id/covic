Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) generally includes preparative or conditioning regimes containing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in high doses. These regimens, as well as other treatments before and after HSCT such as immunosuppressive drugs to prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD) (see Chap. 11), may affect the patient’s organs and tissues and may cause both acute and long-term complications. In the evolving field of stem cell therapies, some complications that traditionally have been regarded as early complications are now, due to changes in preparative regimens and choice of stem cell source, sometimes seen later in the post-transplant out-patient setting. The complications covered in this chapter generally occur within 100 days post HSCT and are thus classified as early complications. Two of the most common early complications are oral complications/mucositis and sepsis. Some other relatively rare complications are also covered here: haemorrhagic cystitis (HC), endothelial damage (ED) syndromes including engraftment syndrome (ES), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH), transplant-associated microangiopathy (TAM) and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD). For all complications, recommendations for prevention and principles for nursing care are presented since careful nursing monitoring, prompt intervention and care may have an influence on patients’ morbidity and mortality.

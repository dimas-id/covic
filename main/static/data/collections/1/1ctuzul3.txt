Vertebral canal haematoma following epidural anaesthesia is a rare but potentially devastating occurence, which can lead to permanent neurological damage. Early clinical identification and diagnosis using MRI imaging with surgical decompression of the haematoma can lead to full recovery (Kebaish 2004). However surgical patients often have metal clips or staples, which are left inside the body, some of which are not MRI compatible. Currently there is no process to document which surgical clips have been used and their MRI compatibility in an accessible format. This can lead to a delay in performing MRI imaging. We propose a clinical pathway to expedite diagnosis of vertebral canal haematoma to incorporate a system to allow rapid identification of MRI compatibility of surgical clips used during surgery.

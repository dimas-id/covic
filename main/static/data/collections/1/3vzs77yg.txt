Editor's Note: For those whose response to COVID-19 includes exploring beyond vaccines, conventional pharmaceuticals, and the watchful or healthy waiting until such tools might arrive, interest in cannabinoids has been high - and controversial. It has already stimulated one journal, the Liebert Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research, to issue a call for papers on COVID-19. The unique place of cannabis in the culture seems to always mark the herb with an exponential asterisk whenever basketed with the other natural health strategies that are both widely used, and as broadly derided. In this invited commentary, JACM Editorial Board member Michelle Sexton, ND starts by describing the multiple immune modulating effects associated with the herb. The University of California San Diego Assistant Adjunct Professor in Anesthesiology then asks: "Given these effects, can phytocannabinoids be either helpful, or harmful for immune competency, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic?" A skilled edge-walker, Sexton lets the research fall where it may in wending a path through this evidentiary maze. -John Weeks, Editor-in-Chief, JACM.

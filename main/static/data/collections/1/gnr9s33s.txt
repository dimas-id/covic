Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a rare hereditary multisystemic disease. Multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts, and skeletal abnormalities are the main clinical manifestations of the syndrome, but several organs can be involved. Moreover, this condition is associated with the development of various benign and malignant tumors, even in the genital tract. This report describes a rare association between Gorlin-Goltz syndrome and the sclerosing stromal tumor of the ovary. Because the ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging patterns of this tumor can be similar to those of a malignant neoplasm, prompt surgical intervention and histological confirmation of diagnosis is mandatory; however, this is a benign lesion and thus can be approached with a laparoscopic fertility-sparing surgery. Gynecologists should be aware of this possible association to provide appropriate counseling for these women, and to take a fertility-sparing laparoscopic approach whenever possible.

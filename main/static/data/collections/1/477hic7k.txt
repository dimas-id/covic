BACKGROUND The purpose of this study is to evaluate symptom relief, patient satisfaction, and safety of permanent mesh following Nissen fundoplication and hiatal hernia repair. METHODS Patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication and hiatal hernia repair with permanent mesh (Crurasoft; Davol, Inc, Bard, Warwick, RI) between 2005 and 2011 were identified. A retrospective chart review was conducted. Long-term follow-up data were obtained via telephone interviews using a modified 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS Forty-one patients were identified. Twenty-six patients (63%) had complete follow-up data. Mean follow-up period was 65 months (14 to 96 months). Symptomatic improvement occurred in 23 patients (88%). Twenty-three patients (88%) reported overall satisfaction with the procedure as either excellent or good, and 23 of 26 patients (89%) would undergo surgery again. Three patients (12%) reported hernia recurrence. There were no mesh erosions. CONCLUSION The use of permanent (Crurasoft; Davol, Inc) mesh resulted in symptom improvement as well as patient satisfaction, and no mesh erosions were seen.

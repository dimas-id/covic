BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased burden on healthcare systems with subsequent reductions in non-emergent hospitalizations and procedures. While there are widespread reports of intentional reductions in elective hospitalizations, trends in urgent or emergent hospitalizations including heart failure (HF) hospitalizations have not been adequately characterized. METHODS: We evaluated trends of HF hospitalizations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Mississippi Medical Center using electronic health records and discharge database. We also compared HF hospitalization trends during the same time frame in 2019 to account for seasonal variation in HF presentations. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our medical center, a mean of 30 patients per week were admitted with a principal diagnosis of HF. After the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Mississippi, there was a sharp 50% decline in the number of HF hospitalizations that declined even further after a “state of emergency” was declared in Mississippi. CONCLUSIONS: Based on observations from a large academic medical center, there has been a significant reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for HF during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further investigation of these trends is warranted to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term HF outcomes.

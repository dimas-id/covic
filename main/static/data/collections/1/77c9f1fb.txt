Understanding mechanisms of the novel SARS-CoV2 infection and progression, can provide potential novel targets for prevention and/or treatment. This could be achieved via the inhibition of viral entry and/or replication, or by suppression the immunologic response that is provoked by the infection (known as the cytokine storm). Probiotics are defined as "live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host". There is scarcity of evidence about the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota. So, whether or not these supplements can prevent or ameliorate COVID-19 associated symptoms is not fully understood. The aim of this paper is to provide an indirect evidence about the utility of probiotics in combating COVID-19 or its associated symptoms, through the review of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro, animal models, and human trials.

The management of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic inflammatory skin disease, deserves special consideration in the context of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. A new Global Hidradenitis Suppurativa COVID‐19 Registry has been developed to capture data on risks, clinical course, and outcomes of COVID‐19 in HS patients. Caused by the virus SARS‐CoV‐2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2), COVID‐19 is an easily transmissible disease which, in its most severe form, is characterized by respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction triggered by a cytokine storm response that predominates in older adults and those with significant comorbidities.

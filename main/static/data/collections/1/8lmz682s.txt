The COVID-19 pandemic has made it imperative to rapidly implement changes to typical medical practice in order to minimise spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many of these changes are non-intuitive or differ significantly from normal practice. For this reason, we read with great appreciation the timely article by Fregene et al. [1], which describes translational simulation leading to increased preparedness at their institution. With the recognition that aerosol generating procedures are of particular importance to practice due to their high risk of virus transmission, we offer an additional tool for COVID-19 airway simulation training that helped consolidate learning and motivate change to practice in hospitals across Vancouver.

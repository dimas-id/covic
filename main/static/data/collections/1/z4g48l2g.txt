Common respiratory viruses are now recognised as true opportunistic respiratory pathogens in patients with haematological malignancies. The epidemiology of these viruses has not been extensively studied in immunocompromised hosts, but is probably closely related to viral activity in immunocompetent hosts, who constitute the virus reservoir for immunocompromised patients. In these patients, common respiratory viruses may cause severe infections with higher rates of progression to pneumonia and mortality compared to immunocompetent individuals. Prolonged high-titre viral shedding is common in patients with haematological malignancies and may enhance not only viral transmission, but also the selection of resistant strains. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have been particularly well studied. They are associated with pneumonia rates of about one-third for influenza and 30â€“40% for RSV. Both viruses are responsible for mortality rates ranging from 15% to 30%. The exact mechanisms of pneumonia related to these viruses remains unknown, but bacterial and fungal co-infections are frequent and must be carefully investigated. Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and RSV have also been linked to late airflow obstruction in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Neuraminidase inhibitor therapy has been suggested for influenza, ribavirin for RSV, and cidofovir for adenovirus infections. However, there is no evidence supporting the use of these drugs, and randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to better define the optimal management of common viral pneumonia in patients with haematological malignancies. The absence of proven effective treatments highlights the critical importance of prevention. Viral transmission may be interrupted by contact isolation with droplet precautions for infected patients and by having patients and health care workers with suspected infection, and their relatives, refrain from visits and work. Immunisation remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention and is recommended for patients with haematological malignancies, their relatives, and health care workers.

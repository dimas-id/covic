BACKGROUND The safety of therapeutic hypothermia combined with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has been challenged after reports of high risk of stent thrombosis. METHODS We searched the Western Denmark Heart Registry to identify patients with an acute coronary angiography due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest performed at our institution between September 2010 and September 2013. We identified 68 unconscious patients, who were resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and underwent acute PCI with stent implantation and immediate therapeutic hypothermia, and followed these for 30 days. Target temperature of 32-34Â°C was achieved by either an invasive or a non-invasive cooling system. RESULTS All patients had elevated myocardial biomarkers and 37 patients had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Bare metal stents were implanted in 14 and drug-eluting stents in 54 patients. All patients received antithrombotic treatment with a standard loading dose of 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 10,000 units heparin intravenously prior PCI. Clopidogrel or ticagrelor was administered orally through a gastric tube immediately after PCI. During the procedure abciximab or bivalirudin was administered in 44 patients. Electrocardiographic and clinical signs of stent thrombosis were found in one patient. CONCLUSIONS We observed one stent thrombosis in this cohort of 68 consecutive patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were treated with PCI and therapeutic hypothermia. This suggests that PCI with stent implantation can be performed with acceptable safety in these patients.

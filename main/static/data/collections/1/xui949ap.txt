By April 2020, COVID-19 lockdowns had restricted the movements of over half the world's population. As health authorities advise people living with chronic conditions to self-isolate because they are at particular risk of serious complications and death, the epidemiological split between communicable and noncommunicable disease is tenuous. We argue that much more is at stake for people living with (multiple) medical conditions than being "at risk" of infection of coronavirus. We emphasize the need to attend to the long-term effects of COVID-19, but also the importance of the continued care of people living with other lifelong medical conditions.

Abstract Unlike porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that infects only pigs, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has the capacity to infect different animal species. In vivo gnotobiotic calves were previously confirmed to be susceptible to infection with PDCoV, but not with PEDV. We next investigated in vitro whether primary bovine cells are susceptible to PDCoV or PEDV infection. We conducted quantification of viral RNA in cell culture supernatants and immunofluorescent staining for the detection of PDCoV or PEDV antigen in two primary bovine cell types inoculated with the PDCoV strain OH-FD22 or PEDV strain PC22-P40 grown in LLC-PK or Vero cells, respectively, and supplemented with 1.25∼5 μg/mL of trypsin in the cell culture medium. The primary cells were isolated from the kidney or heart of a gnotobiotic calf, and both cell types were vimentin-positive, but E-Cadherin-negative, resembling mesenchymal cells. Similar to the previous in vivo observation, cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged and rounded cells, followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, were identified in the two primary cell types inoculated with PDCoV. Unexpectedly, similar CPE was also identified in the two cell types inoculated with PEDV. High PDCoV or PEDV RNA titers and PDCoV or PEDV antigens were detected in the cell culture supernatants and CPE-positive cells, respectively. Our study revealed that primary bovine mesenchymal cells are susceptible to infection with PDCoV and PEDV. The in vitro observation partially coincided with the corresponding in vivo data from gnotobiotic calves.

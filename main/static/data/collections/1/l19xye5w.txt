I used to begin my microbiology lecture series with a slogan “microbes rule the world”. And I continued by reminding the students that microbes, in fact, have been on earth billions of years before man and that they most probably stay here after mankind has been extinguished. The current SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic makes this statement actual but also a bit creepy.

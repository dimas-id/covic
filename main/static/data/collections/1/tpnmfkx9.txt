BACKGROUND Laparoscopic hepatectomy has gained popularity in the management of malignant liver lesions in the past decade. Its safety and feasibility, with faster recovery and comparable long-term outcomes, have been widely published. Nonetheless, laparoscopic isolated caudate lobectomy is still rare and technically demanding. We herein present a video on laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy for caudate cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS The patient is a 61-year-old man who presented with epigastric distending discomfort. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a 4.6 Ã— 3.9 cm tumor in the caudate lobe adjacent to the inferior vena cava, middle hepatic vein, right hepatic vein, as well as the bifurcation of the main trunk of the portal pedicle. The carbohydrate antigen was elevated to 54.58 U/ml (normal < 37 U/ml), and his liver function was normal. With the preoperative diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, laparoscopic caudate lobectomy was contemplated. RESULTS The operative time was 300 min. The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 180 ml. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day without any complications. Histopathological examination showed a 4.2 cm cholangiocarcinoma (T2N0M0) with a negative margin. He received a course of adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrence was noted upon follow-up at 6 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection for caudate lobe is a feasible and safe procedure. An experienced hepatobiliary surgeon could perform the procedure in selected cases, even with hepatic vein invasion.

INTRODUCTION The objective of this study is to assess the usefulness of an evaluation system of surgical skills based on motion analysis of laparoscopic instruments. METHOD This system consists of a physical laparoscopic simulator and a tracking and assessment system of technical skills in laparoscopy. Six surgeons with intermediate experience (between 1 and 50 laparoscopic surgeries) and 5 experienced surgeons (more than 50 laparoscopic surgeries) took part in this study. All participants were right-handed. The subjects performed 3 repetitions of a cutting task on synthetic tissue with the right hand, dissection of a gastric serous layer, and a suturing task in the dissection previously done. Objective metrics such as time, path length, speed of movements, acceleration and motion smoothness were analyzed for the instruments of each hand. RESULTS In the cutting task, experienced surgeons show less acceleration (P=.014) and a smoother motion (P=.023) using the scissors. Regarding the dissection activity, experienced surgeons need less time (P=.006) and less length with both instruments (P=.006 for dissector and P=.01 for scissors). In the suturing task, experienced surgeons require less time (P=.037) and distance travelled (P=.041) by the dissector. CONCLUSIONS This study shows the usefulness of the evaluation system for the cutting, dissecting, and suturing tasks. It represents a significant step in the development of advanced systems for training and assessment of surgical skills in laparoscopic surgery.

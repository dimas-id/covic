Abstract Background and objective: In the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand of masks has been increased by health professionals and the general population. In this context, it is necessary to summarize the features and indications of the different types of masks. Patients or Materials and methods: To consult and to compile the different recommendations disseminated by prestigious institutions such as the World Health Organization, the European Center for Disease Prevention, the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, or the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain has been reviewed. Results: The institutions consulted recommend reserving FFP respirators for healthcare workers, especially when carrying out aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) (minimum FFP2 protection) and consider some reutilization systems during times of scarcity. The use of surgical masks is recommended to professionals who do not perform AGPs and to the symptomatic population but exist variations in its indications intended for the general healthy population. Conclusions: In the context of shortage of personal protective equipment due to the COVID -19 pandemic, a prioritization and rationalization of the use of each type of mask should be established according to the user and the activity performed.

Replication of the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) genome requires the synthesis of minus-strand DNA from an RNA template, the pregenome, by reverse transcription. During this reaction, the 5' end of minus-strand DNA becomes covalently linked to a protein. The position of the 5' end of minus-strand DNA was identified previously, but the initiation site for DNA synthesis on pregenomic RNA remained ambiguous because of a sequence repetition at the termini of the RNA template for reverse transcription. Employing a recently designed expression vector for the production of infectious WHV, we localized the origin of minus-strand DNA synthesis to the 3' end of pregenomic RNA. In addition, we identified the nucleotide sequences on pregenomic RNA that provide the signal for the initiation of reverse transcription. Removal of this signal sequence from pregenomic RNA abolished minus-strand DNA synthesis. Insertion of a DNA oligomer bearing this signal sequence at the 3' end of pregenomic RNA restored the production of minus-strand DNA joined to protein. Our results support a model in which protein is the primer for reverse transcription of minus-strand DNA of WHV.

The genomes of umbraviruses differ from those of most other viruses in that they do not encode a coat protein, and thus no virus particles are formed in infected plants. Protection of umbraviral RNA outside the host plant, during vector transmission, utilizes the coat protein of an assistor luteovirus, but this review focuses on the mechanisms that compensate for the lack of a coat protein in processes within the host plant. As well as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, umbravirus genomes encode two other proteins from almost completely overlapping open reading frames. One of these is a cell-to-cell movement protein that can mediate the transport of homologous and heterologous viral RNAs through plasmodesmata without the participation of a coat protein. The other, the ORF3 protein, binds to viral RNA to form filamentous ribonucleoprotein particles that have elements of helical structure. It serves to stabilize the RNA and facilitates its transport through the vascular system of the plant. It may also be involved in protection of the viral RNA from the plant's defensive RNA-silencing response, although it is not a suppressor of silencing. The ORF3 protein also enters the cell nucleus, specifically targeting the nucleolus. Although the function of this localization is unknown, the ORF3 protein may provide a valuable tool for investigating plant nucleolar function.

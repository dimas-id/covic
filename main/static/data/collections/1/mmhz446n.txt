High frequency oscillations (HFO) from, MEG (magnetoencephalography) and intracerebral EEG are considered as effective tools to identify cognitive status and several cortical disorders especially in epilepsy diagnosis. The aim of our study is to evaluate stationary wavelet transform (SWT) technique performance in efficient reconstruction of pure epileptic high frequency oscillations, reputed as biomarkers of epileptogenic zones: generators of inter ictal epileptic discharges, and offhand seizures. We applied SWT on simulated and real database to detect non-contaminated HFO by spiky element. For simulated data, we computed the GOF of reconstruction that reaches for all studied constraint (relative amplitude, frequency, SNR and overlap) a promising results. For real data we used time frequency domain to evaluate SWT robustness of HFO reconstruction. We proved that SWT is an efficient filtering technique for separation HFO from spiky events. Our results would have an important impact on the definition of epileptogenic zones.

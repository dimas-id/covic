OBJECTIVE To determine long-term clinical outcomes in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections after hospitalization or intensive care unit admission. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO were searched. STUDY SELECTION Original studies reporting clinical outcomes of adult SARS and MERS survivors 3 months after admission or 2 months after discharge were included. DATA EXTRACTION Studies were graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was used to derive pooled estimates for prevalence/severity of outcomes up to 6 months, and beyond. DATA SYNTHESIS Of 1,169 identified studies, 28 were included in the analysis. Pooled analysis revealed that common complications up to 6 months were: impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (prevalence 27%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15-45%); and reduced exercise capacity ((mean 6-min walking distance 461 m, CI 450-473 m). The prevalences of post-traumatic stress disorder (39%, 95% CI 31-47%), depression (33%, 95% CI 20-50%) and anxiety (30%, 95% CI 10-61) beyond 6 months were considerable. Low scores on Short-Form 36 were identified at 6 months and beyond. CONCLUSION Lung function abnormalities, psychological impairment and reduced exercise capacity were common in SARS and MERS survivors. Clinicians should anticipate and investigate similar long-term outcomes in COVID-19 survivors.

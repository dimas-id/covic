The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to dramatic changes in oncology practice. It is currently unknown whether PD-1 blockade therapy impacts severity of illness from COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To address this uncertainty, we examined consecutive patients with lung cancers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and examined severity based on no or prior receipt of PD-1 blockade. Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer was high, including need for hospitalization in more than half of patients and death in nearly a quarter. Prior PD-1 blockade was, as expected, associated with smoking status. After adjustment for smoking status, PD-1 blockade exposure was not associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19. PD-1 blockade does not appear to impact the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancers.

Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) that dispense methadone got a fast and clear reprieve from federal authorities last week in the face of COVID‐19. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued policies that give OTPs flexibility in take‐homes, limiting the frequency of face‐to‐face contact and opportunities for transmission of COVID‐19. There is also greater flexibility for office‐based opioid treatment (OBOT) with buprenorphine.

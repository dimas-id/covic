Hormesis is a generalizable dose–response relationship characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition. Despite debate over this biphasic dose–response curve, hormesis is challenging central beliefs in the evaluation of chemicals or drugs and has influenced biological model selection, concentration range, study design, and hypothesis testing. We integrate the traditional Chinese philosophy – Yin/Yang doctrine – into the representation of the Western hormetic dose–response relationship and review the Yin/Yang historical philosophy contained in the hormesis concept, aiming to promote general acceptance and wider applications of hormesis. We suggest that the Yin/Yang doctrine embodies the hormetic dose–response, including the relationship between the opposing components, curve shape, and time-dependence, and may afford insights that clarify the hormetic dose–response relationship in toxicology and pharmacology.

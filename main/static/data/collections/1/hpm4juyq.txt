BACKGROUND: In this study we investigated changes in the status of antibiotic use in Tianjin since the implementation of the Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) (2011–2013), as well as existing problems, strategies, and outcomes to promote rational clinical antibiotic use. MATERIAL/METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was performed to investigate situations of antibiotic use in secondary and tertiary general hospitals in Tianjin from April 2011 to 2013. Five major indicators were analyzed: percentage of antibiotic use in inpatient cases (%), antibacterial use density (AUD), proportion of prophylactic antibiotic application for type I surgical incision, compliance rate of medication administration 0.5–2.0 h before such procedures, and antibiotic prophylaxis for ≤24 h in patients receiving these surgeries. RESULTS: There was a decrease in the percentage of antibiotic use across general hospitals (60.38% to 46.88%), in AUD (51.60% to 35.37%), and in the proportion of prophylactic antibiotic applications for type I incisions (86.67% to 25.08%). For patients undergoing these procedures, there was an increased compliance rate of medication administration of 0.5–2.0 h prior to surgery (86.38% to 100%), and of antibiotic prophylactic use for ≤24 h (40.30% to 96.37%). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the ASP campaign has reduced irrational antibiotic use, promoted rational antibiotic use, and delayed antibiotic resistance.

OBJECTIVE To determine the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic lumbar hernia repair. DESIGN Prospective clinical study. SETTING Abdominal wall unit, university hospital. PATIENTS Between January 1995 and December 2008, data from 55 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic (n = 35) or open (n = 20) lumbar hernia repair. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was recurrence; secondary endpoints were patient outcomes (morbidity, pain, and return to normal activity). RESULTS Mean operating time (P = .01), hospital stay, return to normal activity, analgesic consumption, and pain at 1 month (P < .001) were significantly less in the laparoscopic group. Complications were similar in the 2 groups (37% vs 40%, respectively; P = .50). Traumatic hernias increased local complications versus incisional lumbar hernias (71.4% vs 29%; P = .007). Consumption of analgesics (6.8 ± 6.5 vs 18.1 ± 9.1; P < .001) and pain during the first month (no pain: 90% vs 54.3%; P = .015) were significantly less with a lightweight versus medium-weight mesh. The risk factors associated with recurrences development were localization (P = .01) and size (P = .008). Recurrence rates were 2.9% in the laparoscopic group and 15% in the open group (P = .13). CONCLUSIONS Outcomes did not differ with respect to morbidity and recurrence rate after long-term follow-up; however, this study suggested that laparoscopic approach for lumbar hernia is safe, effective, and more efficient than open repair and can be considered the procedure of choice. Open surgery may be considered the best option in the diffuse hernias with size larger than 15 cm.

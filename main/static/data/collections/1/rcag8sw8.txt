Integrating lentiviral vectors based on the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) can transduce quiescent cells, which in lung account for almost 95% of the epithelial cell population. Pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the envelope glycoprotein from the Ebola Zaire virus, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the Mokola virus, and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) resulted in transduction of mouse alveolar epithelium, but gene expression in the lung of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice waned within 90 days of vector injection. Intratracheal delivery of the four pseudotyped lentiviral vectors resulted in transgene-specific T-cell activation in both mouse strains, albeit lower than that achieved by intramuscular injection of the vectors. We performed an adoptive transfer of luciferase-specific T cells, isolated from spleen or lung of donor mice injected with VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector expressing luciferase into the muscle or lung, respectively, into recipient recombination-activating gene (RAG)–deficient mice transduced in lung with adenovirus expressing firefly luciferase (ffluc2). Gene expression declined within 7 days of adoptive transfer approaching background levels by day 36. Taken together, our results suggest that the loss of transduced cells in lung is due to VSV-G.HIV vector–mediated activation of transgene-specific T cells rather than as result of normal turnover of airway cells.

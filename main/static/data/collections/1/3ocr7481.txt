Semi-supervised relational learning methods aim to classify nodes in a partially-labeled graph. While popular, existing methods using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for semi-supervised relational learning have mainly focused on learning node representations by aggregating nearby attributes, and it is still challenging to leverage inferences about unlabeled nodes with few attributes—particularly when trying to exploit higher-order relationships in the network efficiently. To address this, we propose a Graph Neural Network architecture that incorporates patterns among the available class labels and uses (1) a Role Equivalence attention mechanism and (2) a mini-batch importance sampling method to improve efficiency when learning over high-order paths. In particular, our Role Equivalence attention mechanism is able to use nodes’ roles to learn how to focus on relevant distant neighbors, in order to adaptively reduce the increased noise that occurs when higher-order structures are considered. In experiments on six different real-world datasets, we show that our model (REGNN) achieves significant performance gains compared to other recent state-of-the-art baselines, particularly when higher-order paths are considered in the models.

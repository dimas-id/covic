The fractal statistics were applied to the daily new cases of COVID-19 in the USA. The Hurst parameter, which indicates the long-range correlations in the growth, was calculated using a simple R/S method based on the fluctuations of the daily growth for several US states. The values of Hurst parameters for different states were analyzed using two controlling parameters, stay-at-home order, and the population density.

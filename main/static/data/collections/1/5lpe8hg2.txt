Background: Currently, effective vaccines or specific therapeutic agents against COVID-19 are not available. However, in China, traditional Chinese herbal medicines have provided therapeutic benefit to patients with COVID-19. Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG) is a Chinese multi-herbal formula previously developed for the treatment of H1N1 influenza and has been encouraged for patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 during medical observation. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of JHQGG has not been confirmed. Objectives: We thus examined whether the administration of JHQGG affects hematological and immunological measures in healthy individuals. Method: We enrolled 18 healthy volunteers, all of whom tested negative for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood samples were collected 1 h after oral administration of JHQGG and subjected to hematological, biochemical, and cytokine tests. Results: JHQGG rapidly induced a significant decrease in the plasma level of IL-6 and an increase in the plasma level of IFN-{gamma}. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of JHQGG against COVID-19 is, in part, associated with its rapid immunomodulatory activity.

The safe transport of infants in critical condition requires highly reliable inter-professional transport teams that are equipped with the expertise to provide neonatal care in unfamiliar and resource-limited environments. Increasingly, transport teams are comprised of health professionals from various disciplines. Providing didactic and experiential learning alone is insufficient to fully prepare teams that have limited exposure to rare events. Simulation-based training supplements and reinforces knowledge, skills, and the experiences of team members. This article presents the current use of simulation in the training of neonatal transport teams and critically reviews how simulation methodologies may be further incorporated into curricula and quality improvement to achieve high-reliability teams.

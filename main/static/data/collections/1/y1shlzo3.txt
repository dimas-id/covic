We study Z' phenomenology at hadron colliders in an U(1)' extended MSSM. We choose a U(1)' model with a secluded sector, where the tension between the electroweak scale and developing a large enough mass for Z' is resolved by incorporating three additional SU(2) singlet fields into the model. We perform a detailed and systematic analysis of the production, followed by decays, including into supersymmetric particles, of a Z' boson with particular emphasis on its possible discovery. We choose three different scenarios consistent with the latest available experimental data and relic density constraints, and concentrate on final signals involving two leptons, four leptons and six leptons. Including possible SM backgrounds, we show the likelihood of observing a Z' boson is not promising for the HL-LHC at 14 TeV, but optimistic for 27 and 100 TeV.

Organisational resilience is most often defined as the ability to function during a shock and then return to normal function; consequently, it has been studied from the perspective of organisational disciplines closely related to crisis and crisis-recovery, such as supply-chain management and risk management. However, increasing complexity and the volume, variety and velocity of shocks has created an environment where the organisation must proactively and continuously demonstrate resilience, through the cultivation of anticipatory innovation.

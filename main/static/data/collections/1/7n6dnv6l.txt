Abstract Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), 67N strain, adapted to suckling mouse brain, grew readily in a porcine cell line, SK-K cell culture with cytopathic effect (CPE) consisting of syncytium formation and detachment of fused cells and round cells from glass surface. After further passages in SK-K cell monolayers with undiluted culture fluid, CPE developed earlier and became complete within 48 h postinoculation (p.i.). Viral specific antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the infected SK-K cells by indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. The SK-K-passaged virus as well as the original mouse-passaged virus formed clear plaques on SK-K cell monolayers under simple overlay medium. The plaque assay system for HEV 67N was established by studying various factors influencing the plaque formation in the SK-K cell cultures. By this system more than 106 PFU/0.2 ml of the virus yield was detected in the fluid phase of the infected cultures at 48 h p.i. The SK-K-passaged virus caused fatal infection in 4-week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation, but was inhibited by rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. Plaque formation and hemagglutinating activity of the virus were specifically inhibited by antisera against the mouse-passaged and SK-K-passaged 67N virus.

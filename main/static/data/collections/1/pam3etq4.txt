Data visualization is an essential tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, especially in epidemiological surveillance. The COVID19-Global online web application systematically produces daily updated data visualization and analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on a global scale. It collects automatically daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases and mortality worldwide from January 1st, 2020 onwards. We have implemented comparative data visualization between countries for the most common indicators in epidemiological surveillance to follow an epidemic: attack rate, population fatality rate, case fatality rate, and basic reproduction number. The application may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic worldwide.

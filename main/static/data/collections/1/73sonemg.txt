Place recognition is an important step in intelligent driving, allowing the vehicle recognize where it is to plan its route. Obtaining distinguishable features can ensure the success of image-based place recognition. However, generating robust features across drastically appearance changing images is still a challenging problem. Deep features are frequently chosen instead of local features in the tasks of place recognition following the development of convolutional neural networks. But even the deep features generated by powerful neural models can cause unsatisfactory recognition results. This is perhaps due to a lack of information selecting process. The technology of semantic segmentation allows recognizing and classifying image information. Semantic segmentation followed by image inpainting provide a possibility of detecting, deleting and reconstructing annoying information. This paper proves that dynamic information present in images such as vehicles and pedestrians damages the performance of place recognition and proposes a feature extraction system that includes a step to decrease the presence of dynamic information of an image. This system is composed of two stages: 1) dynamic objects detection and removing, 2) image inpainting to reconstruct the background of removed regions. Objects detection and removing consists of deleting unstable objects recognized by semantic segmentation method from images. Image inpainting and reconstructing deals with generating inpaint-images by repairing missing regions through image inpainting method. The robustness of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing to the non-selecting deep feature based place recognition approaches over three datasets.

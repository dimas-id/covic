Protecting health care workers is crucial during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and facemask wearing is considered an effective measure to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. However, long-time use of a facemask can cause pressure sores on the ears and nose bridge and increase the risk of infection. The topical recombinant human acidic fibroblast growth factor (rh-aFGF) was used to cure pressure sores for health care workers at Zhongfaxincheng campus of Tongji Hospital. The results from a small sample size survey conducted in Zhongfaxincheng campuses of Tongji Hospital showed that treatment with topical rh-aFGF could significantly inhibit the progression of pressure sores and accelerate the wound healing with no apparent ill-effects. Therefore, we propose that topical rh-aFGF is an effective therapeutic agent for facemask wearing-induced pressure sores and worth of popularizing and applying.

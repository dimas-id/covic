Swollen-head syndrome is a disease seen in broiler chickens between 4 and 6 weeks of age in Southern Africa. It appears to be caused by a mixed coronavirus and Escherichia coli infection. The coronavirus appears to be of a hitherto unrecorded serotype. The disease is controlled by an attenuated live-virus vaccine and antibacterial medication.

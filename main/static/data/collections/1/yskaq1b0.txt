SARS-CoV-2 infection, named COVID-19, can lead to a dysregulated immune response and abnormal coagulation responsible for a viral sepsis. In this review, we specify physiopathological mechanisms of each phase of COVID-19 - viral, immune and pro-thrombotic - notably because they involve different treatment. Finally, we specify the physiopathological mechanisms of organ injury.

Disposable single-port surgery devices have been used for transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS). Their advantage, compared to transanal endoscopic microsurgery, is that they do not require special equipment or training. The aim of this study was to assess our initial experience using the single-site laparoscopic (SSL™) access system (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) for TAMIS. Five patients eligible for local excision of rectal tumors, four males and one female, mean age 58 years (range 50-78), underwent surgery using the SSL™ device. The average distance from anal verge was 4 cm (range 1-6). Four patients had an initial diagnosis of adenoma, and one had a previous endoscopic excision of a T1 adenocarcinoma with positive margins. In one patient, due to the lack of exposure, the procedure was converted to a low anterior resection. In the remaining four patients, average setup time was 7 minutes (range 4-15) and average operative time was 52 minutes (range 38-72). All resection margins were tumor free. There were no postoperative complications. Two of the presumed adenomas were intramucosal adenocarcinomas, while one patient had a T2 tumor and underwent radical surgery. Although at the present time the appropriate use of local excision is still under debate, TAMIS is a technique with great potential. Because of its simplicity and similarity with conventional laparoscopic surgery, it can be learned easily by surgeons not trained in transanal endoscopic microsurgery.

BACKGROUND The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the gold standard treatment for morbid obesity. After LRYGB, the endoscopic access to the gastric remnant and pancreaticobiliary system is challenging. The laparoscopic gastric bypass with fundectomy and exploration of the gastric remnant (LRYGBfse) was introduced in an attempt to overcome this limitation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the medium-term outcomes and safety of LRYGBfse. METHODS Observational prospective single-arm multicenter cohort study. Patients with BMI > 35 kg/m2 were included. Previous open abdominal surgery was an exclusion criterion. Postoperative 1, 2, 3, and 5-year weight loss, BMI decrease, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were recorded. Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used for paired data. RESULTS Among 653 enrolled patients, 229 completed the 5-year follow-up. Preoperative median body weight (kg) and BMI (kg/m2) were 133.4 kg (interquartile range (IQR) = 12.0) and 48.2 kg/m2 (IQR = 10.1), respectively. Median 5-year body weight, BMI, and %EWL were 83.7 (IQR = 17.3), 31.2 (IQR = 7.7), and 74.8 (IQR = 23.4), respectively, all significantly improved compared to baseline (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, and p = 0.012, respectively). Comorbid improvement or resolution was observed in 88% of the patients. No major intraoperative complications were reported. Postoperative overall morbidity and mortality rates were 1 and 0%, respectively. Banding removal was necessary in one patient 62 months after the index operation. CONCLUSIONS The LRYGBfse seems safe and effective with durable results at 5-year follow-up. Endoscopic exploration of the gastric remnant is an additional valuable tool.

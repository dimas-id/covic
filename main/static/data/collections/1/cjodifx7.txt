The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a global health emergency and has led to more than 380,000 deaths worldwide The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two host proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 There is currently no vaccine available and also no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a novel gasotransmitter has been shown to protect against lung damage via its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, anti-viral, pro-survival, and anti-aging effects In light of the research advances on H2S signalling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H2S as a potential defence against COVID-19 It is suggested that H2S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H2S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H2S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19

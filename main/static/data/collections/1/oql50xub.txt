Projections of the near future of daily case incidence of COVID-19 in King County are valuable for informing public policy. Projections made with the latest data may be better for some purposes than projections based on older data freezes of more reliable data. Incidence-count half-life is a better statistic for many purposes than reproductive rate (R). Currently, an empirical fit to King County data predicts a half-life of 24.5 days (95% CI: 21.2 - 28.8), corresponding to an R of about 0.8. Under this model, the number of cases per day in King County is extrapolated to be 40 cases per day on May 24 and 20 cases per day on June 18, 2020.

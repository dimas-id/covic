BACKGROUND Renal oncocytoma is the most common benign renal tumor, and papillary renal cell carcinoma is the second most common histologic subtype of renal cell carcinoma. Renal tumors containing different components such as papillary renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma are extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION A renal mass was incidentally detected in a 52-year-old Korean woman, and a computed tomographic scan showed a 32-mm multicystic mass with some calcifications in the lower pole of the right kidney. She underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy without any perioperative complications. We found a papillary renal cell carcinoma and an oncocytoma in a tumor mass. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of a mixed malignant tumor should be considered while treating benign tumors such as oncocytoma.

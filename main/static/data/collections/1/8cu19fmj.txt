Infection, cross-infection, and infectious diseases are critical for health care personnel and patients in hospitals mainly owing to multi-drug-resistance pathogens. Textile materials and garments used in hospitals promote cross-infection as they are used as a vehicle by the pathogenic disease-causing bacteria to spread the infection. However, smart textile materials play a vital role in protecting against the transmission of diseases not only in hospitals but also in other environments where people gather in large numbers. This chapter discusses the application of such materials for infection control management including wound infection management in hospitals. The role of hospital protective garments is summarised. Test methods and standards that cover surgical gowns, drapes, and clean air suits are highlighted.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be a global public-health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of April 9, 2020, the novel coronavirus (named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on February 11) has infected 83,251 and 1,484,811 patients in China and the world, respectively. However, we have neither confirmed effective antiviral medications nor vaccines available to deal with this emergency. In this commentary, we offer an alternative promising therapy for COVID-19, that is, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation.

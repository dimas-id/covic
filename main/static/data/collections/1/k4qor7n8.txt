The first key message in the landmark Future of Nursing report is that “Nurses should practice to the full extent of their education and training” (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Although there has been significant progress across states to remove or diminish barriers to the exercise of full scope of practice by advanced practice registered nurses (APRN), state regulations continue to unnecessarily restrict APRN practice in most of the United States. This article integrates data from studies that examine how state and local regulation affects psychiatric mental health APRN practice with the literature on how state scope of practice regulation affects the size and distribution of the broader APRN workforce, access to care, health care costs and prices, and innovation in health care service delivery. Common themes include confusion about regulatory requirements and mixed experiences of mandated physician supervision.

ABSTRACT Introduction. Several viral respiratory infections - notably influenza - are associated with secondary bacterial infection and additional pathology. The extent to which this applies for COVID-19 is unknown. Accordingly, we aimed to define the bacteria causing secondary pneumonias in COVID-19 ICU patients using the FilmArray Pneumonia Panel, and to determine this tests potential in COVID-19 management. Methods. COVID-19 ICU patients with clinically-suspected secondary infection at 5 UK hospitals were tested with the FilmArray at point of care. We collected patient demographic data and compared FilmArray results with routine culture. Results. We report results of 110 FilmArray tests on 94 patients (16 had 2 tests): 69 patients (73%) were male, the median age was 59 yrs; 92 were ventilated. Median hospital stay before testing was 14 days (range 1-38). Fifty-nine (54%) tests were positive, with 141 bacteria detected. Most were Enterobacterales (n=55, including Klebsiella spp. [n= 35]) or Staphylococcus aureus (n=13), as is typical of hospital and ventilator pneumonia. Community pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (n=8) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), were rarer. FilmArray detected one additional virus (Rhinovirus/Enterovirus) and no atypical bacteria. Fewer samples (28 % vs. 54%) were positive by routine culture, and fewer species were reported per sample; Klebsiella species remained the most prevalent pathogens. Conclusion. FilmArray had a higher diagnostic yield than culture for ICU COVID-19 patients with suspected secondary pneumonias. The bacteria found mostly were Enterobacterales, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, as in typical HAP/VAP, but with Klebsiella spp. more prominent. We found almost no viral co-infection. Turnaround from sample to results is around 1h 15 min compared with the usual 72h for culture, giving prescribers earlier data to inform antimicrobial decisions.

Viruses are significant causes of nosocomial infections, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) where seriously ill and vulnerable patients are being cared for. Four major routes of nosocomial virus transmission in the ICU are identified, viz. respiratory, faecalâ€“oral, exposure to blood and body fluid and direct contact with infected patients or through fomites. Different infection control measures are available according to the natural history, biology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and mode of transmission of each virus. In this chapter, we discuss some of the important viruses that could be associated with nosocomial infections in the ICU. Intensivists should work closely with microbiologists, virologists and the laboratory to diagnose such infection early, work proactively to prevent outbreaks and manage viral infections using appropriate strategies.

BACKGROUND Single-port surgery has recently become popular, however, many surgeons have to use additional ports during the surgery due to difficulties. OBJECTIVES We performed two-port MCAP (with an additional port using a multi-channel device through the umbilicus) without a suspension suture in a group of patients. We compared the results of this technique to the LC and SILC techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 90 patients with gallbladder disease were included in the study. LC (n = 30) and SILC (n = 30) were performed in two groups. The other group underwent cholecystectomy (MCAP) by using an additional 5 mm port through the subxiphoid region with a multi-channel port through the transumblical. A transabdominal suspension suture was not used for the patients in this group. The surgery duration, estimated blood loss, length of hospitalization, visual analogue scale (VAS) score in the postoperative 1st and 7th day, need for analgesia in the postoperative period and complications, and the conversion rate were compared between the three methods. RESULTS A total of 62 females (68.9%) and 28 males (31.1%) participated in the study. MCAP duration was significantly shorter than LC and SILC (38.1 ± 16.6, 49.4 ± 15.8, 77.8 ± 26.7 min respectively) (p < 0.05). The conversion rate was similar in all three groups. Hernia developed in the port area in two patients after SILC (6.7%). No significant difference was found between the groups for the other data we compared. CONCLUSIONS MCAP seems to be an easier technique with a shorter operation time compared to the other two techniques. However, there is a need for other studies to evaluate the cosmetic results.

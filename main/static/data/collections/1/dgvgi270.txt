Application of infection prevention and control (IP&C) measures is synonymous with safety, quality, resource saving, and the rights of all patients, staff and visitors. An extensive literature review was undertaken to identify key IP&C measures that address pediatric-specific requirements, taking into account age-related factors, diseases that occur most frequently among pediatric populations, and the important role of the caregiver in prevention and disease transmission. IP&C initiatives that target and incorporate both human (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic) sources of infection are population specific and guide practices and provide safe caring environments when used appropriately. Categories of care specifically geared to the pediatric age-group (0â€“14 years) are divided into two categories: within-the-healthcare system and outside-of-the-healthcare setting. By taking into account the child's developmental age; physiological, psycho-social and immunological development; differing impacts on the body's natural defense mechanisms, including procedural, device type and length of utilization; and availability of specific technologies and disciplines, the caregiver IP&C strategies can be developed and tailored to address specific needs. Within-the-healthcare setting strategies focus on surveillance, standard and transmission-based precautions, the immune system, age-related factors, institutional regulations, the family and visitation. Outside the healthcare setting preventative and protective measures are vital for providing maximum and comprehensive care. Care provided within and outside the healthcare setting can either be independent of each other or work together to maximize the health and safety of the child. This review article highlights the importance of IP&C knowledge, need for strict adherence to approved standards, and need for auditing compliance to achieve the ultimate goal of providing safe, quality care as well as an infection-free environment.

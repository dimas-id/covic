Heart rate variability in the frequency domain can now be obtained at the bedside in the ICU. Promising data suggest that it may help to characterize a patient response to a spontaneous breathing trial. Refinement of the analysis could even help to predict the outcome of extubation or at least help to detect early patients at risk of failure. It is possible that combining this type of analysis, the breathing pattern variability, and other objective indices could help clinicians in the decision-making process of weaning and extubation.

99mTc-tricarbonyl chemistry provides an elegant technology to site-specifically radiolabel histidine-tagged biomolecules. Considering their unique biochemical properties, this straightforward technology is particularly suited for Nanobodies. This chapter gives a detailed guide to generate highly specific Nanobody-derived radiotracers for both in vitro binding studies and in vivo molecular imaging.

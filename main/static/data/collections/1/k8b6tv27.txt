OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to review the safety and efficacy of thermal ablation of lung malignancies after pneumonectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed patients who underwent thermal ablation for malignant lung tumors after pneumonectomy between 1999 and 2009. Patient demographics, complications, procedural success, and oncologic outcomes were recorded. Technique effectiveness was evaluated at imaging 4-6 weeks after ablation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate overall survival. A cumulative incidence and competing risk method was used to account for progression-free tumors at the time of patient death. RESULTS Of 619 lung ablations, 17 were performed to treat 13 tumors (nine primary and four metastatic) in 12 patients with a single lung. The median tumor size was 2 cm (range, 1.2-4 cm). Technical success was documented in all 17 cases. Technical effectiveness was documented in 10 of 12 patients. Local tumor progression occurred in five lesions within a median of 12 months (range, 10-22 months) after ablation and was treated with repeat ablation in four lesions. Complications included six (35%) of 17 pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy. Deaths occurred within 2-12 days after three (19%) of 16 ablation sessions. The median time to primary local tumor progression was 18 months (95% CI, 12 months through not reached), and the median time to assisted (after repeat ablation) local tumor progression was 33 months (95% CI, not reached). Median overall survival was 21 months (95% CI, 18-53 months). After excluding the two early deaths complicating the initial ablation procedure, median overall survival was 37 months. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation can offer local tumor control after pneumonectomy, despite a relatively high postprocedure clinical risk.

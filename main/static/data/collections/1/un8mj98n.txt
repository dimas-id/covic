Coronavirus nucleocapsids (CoV N's) play both structural and non-structural roles in viral life-cycle. Here, we propose a mechanism for host stress granule (SG) subversion by CoV N proteins. We posit that disordered domains of CoV N's can engage in &#960;-&#960; intermolecular fuzzy interactions with host SG proteins and are crucial to the viral hijacking of host machineries.

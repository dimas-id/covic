Despite advances in the prevention and management of urinary calculi, calculus removal remains a common need in small animal practice. In fact, changes in calculus management have increased the percentage of calculi that are difficult to manage medically.1 Endoscopic techniques that reduce the need for calculus removal by traditional laparotomy and cystotomy have been developed. In my experience, most cystic and urethral calculi can be removed by transurethral or laparoscopic-assisted cystoscopy. These techniques decrease trauma to and urine contamination of the abdomen. Endoscopy also improves the ability to examine the urinary system for disease and the presence of more calculi.

The trajectory, and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa is unclear, but it is seemingly varied between different countries, with most reporting low numbers. We use the situation in Zimbabwe to build an argument that the epidemic is likely to be attenuated in some countries with similar socio-economic and cultural structures. However, even an attenuated epidemic may overwhelm weak health systems, emphasising the importance of prevention. These prevention strategies should be tailored to the unique social and cultural networks of individual countries which may facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV 2. It is also equally important to maintain services for the major infectious diseases in the region such as tuberculosis and malaria. A breakdown of treatment and prevention services for these conditions may even overshadow the projected morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

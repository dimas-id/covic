Abstract This paper examines the effects of the “Equalization Program of Basic Public Health and Family Planning Services for Migrants” (EHFPSM), a novel internal migrant-targeted public health policy, of China implemented in 2013. By combining the individual-level data from the “China Migrants Dynamic Survey” and city-level statistical data, we find that EHFPSM contributes to a 6.9% statistically significant increase in the probability of electronic health records coverage and a 7.2% increase in the probability of reimbursement in the last inpatient visit, as well as a 1.2% decrease in the probability of one-year prevalence. The mechanism test shows that this program promotes the migrants' understanding of the policies and social insurance coverage to enhance their health status. EHFPSM brings about more significant decreases in disease prevalence for male and less-educated migrants, and higher reimbursement probability for urban hukou migrants. Our paper facilitates better understanding of the role of public health policies in promoting the internal migrants' health from the perspective of China.

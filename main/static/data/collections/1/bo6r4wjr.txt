The COVID-19 pandemic situation may be viewed as an opportunity to accelerate some of the ongoing transformations in modern Pathology. This refers primarily to the digitalization of the practice of tissue and cellular pathology diagnostics. However, it is also an opportunity to analyse the modus operandi of a discipline that has practiced in a similar manner for over 100 years. The challenge is to define the next generation of interconnectivity tools that would be necessary to achieve a new operational model that, while ensuring low face-to-face interaction between the main players of the diagnostic pipeline, allows maximum interconnectivity to serve our patients and the immediate teaching and research needs associated with clinical tissue/cellular samples. This viewpoint aims to describe what this new paradigm, a low-contact & high-interconnectivity pathology (LC&HC Path) operation, may require in the near future.

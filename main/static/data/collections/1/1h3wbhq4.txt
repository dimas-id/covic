Abstract One hundred and three patients (90 nonatopics and 13 atopics) with respiratory infections to various viral agents were studied retrospectively with respect to IgE immunoglobulin levels during acute (1 to 7 days) and convalescent (8 to 30 days) phases of infection. It was found that 59% of patients had a decrease of 20% or more in IgE level, 27% remained the same, and only 14% showed a rise of 20% or more from the acute to the convalescent phases of infection. IgE levels decreased up to 3 to 4 wk after symptoms and the degree of decrease was more apparent for the nonatopics who had higher IgE levels in their acute phase of infection. Less dramatic decrease in IgE was observed for the 13 atopics studied. The changes in IgE levels during the viral infectious period are discussed in terms of possible cellular mechanisms that may control IgE immunoglobulin.

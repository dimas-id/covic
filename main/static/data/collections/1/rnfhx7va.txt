Rabbit polyclonal antiidiotypic antibodies were generated against a neutralizing mAb specific for a conformational epitope on the S glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59). These anti-Id were directed predominantly against an Id that was undetectable in rabbit and rat anti-MHV-A59 sera and weakly represented in syngeneic and allogeneic antiviral sera. However, some partial idiotypic sharing was observed between the Id-bearing antibody and a mAb with a similar antigenic site specificity. The anti-Id inhibited the virus-binding and neutralizing activities of the immunizing antibody, demonstrating that they recognize paratope-associated idiotopes. Mice immunized with affinity-purified anti-Id developed MHV-A59-specific antibodies that neutralized viral infectivity to high titers. Moreover, these animals survived an otherwise lethal challenge with viral murine hepatitis virus, unlike control mice immunized with normal rabbit Ig. These results indicate that at least a subpopulation of the polyclonal anti-Id could induce a protective immune response directed toward a biologically important MHV-A59 epitope, and demonstrate the feasibility of antiidiotypic vaccination against a coronavirus infection.

Traumatic events are experienced by most people at some point in their life. Following a traumatic event many individuals return to previous functioning and some feel an increased sense of efficacy. However, a sizable minority experience adverse psychological and behavioral effects. These effects include distress reactions, health risk behaviors, and psychiatric disorders. Workplace traumatic events and responses most studied in physicians include exposure to injured and dying patients, medical errors and complications, bullying, disasters, and workplace violence. Developmental issues confer specific risks for medical students and residents, as well as early and late career physicians. Prevention measures which reduce exposure to workplace trauma are optimal. Physicians exposed to traumatic events will benefit from the use of prompt, evidence-based interventions. Many will seek and benefit from self-help interventions and peer support, but some may need formal assessment and treatment through employee assistance programs and traditional psychiatric care. Effective prevention and treatment can enhance physician well-being and career retention as well as patient outcomes.

A 22-year-old female presented the Emergency Department on the 14th March 2020 with a 3 day history of cough, pyrexia, sore throat, chills and rigors. Dyspnoea, myalgia, anosmia did not feature at presentation. The patient had a history of early-stage unfavourable-risk, classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) for which she was diagnosed in May 2017. She underwent two cycles of adriamycin/bleomycin/vinblastine/dacarbazine (ABVD) with escalation to bleomycin/etoposide/adriamycin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisolone (escBEACOPP) for four cycles due to a suboptimal response on interval positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

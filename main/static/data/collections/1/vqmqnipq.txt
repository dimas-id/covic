While the total number of organs transplanted in this country has increased over the years, there is still an ever-widening gap between the need for organs and our capacity to meet that need as the overall waiting list continues to grow. This is due in part to significant advances in transplant techniques and outcomes such that Americans with organ failure now seek transplants in greater numbers. Additionally, life-expectancy gains in the United States are creating an aging population who are more likely to suffer organ failure than younger Americans. The national transplant waiting list has continued to shift toward older candidates. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) reported that at the end of 2007, 59.7% of all 97,248 candidates on the waiting list for all organs were 50 years old or older, and 14.9% were 65 years or older. These percentages are substantially higher than they were in 1998 (41.5 and 8.1%, respectively) [1].

In this paper, we propose a new model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, the recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution to considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresp onding stability. Hence, the actual reproduction number was calculated . We analyzed the dependence of basic reproductions R_0 on the confidence of our model. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease out if the number of reproduction was less than one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemic's differential equations.

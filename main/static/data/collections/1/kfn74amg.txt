The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of ubiquitous and exclusively eukaryotic proteins with an astoundingly significant number of binding partners. Their binding alters the activity, stability, localization, and phosphorylation state of a target protein. The association of 14-3-3 proteins with the regulation of a wide range of general and specific signaling pathways suggests their crucial role in health and disease. Recent studies have linked 14-3-3 to several RNA and DNA viruses that may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of infections. Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of host–virus interactions is vital for understanding the viral life cycle and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Moreover, pharmaceutical research is already moving towards targeting host proteins in the control of virus pathogenesis. As such, targeting the right host protein to interrupt host–virus interactions could be an effective therapeutic strategy. In this review, we generated a 14-3-3 protein interactions roadmap in viruses, using the freely available Virusmentha network, an online virus–virus or virus–host interaction tool. Furthermore, we summarize the role of the 14-3-3 family in RNA and DNA viruses. The participation of 14-3-3 in viral infections underlines its significance as a key regulator for the expression of host and viral proteins.

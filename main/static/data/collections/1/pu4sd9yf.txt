Objective: Computed Tomography (CT) has an important role to detect lung lesion related to Covide 19. The purpose of this work is to obtain diagnostic findings of Ultra-Low Dose (ULD) chest CT image and compare with routine dose chest CT. Material and Methods: Patients, suspected of Covid 19 infection, were scanned successively with routine dose, and ULD, with 98% or 94% dose reduction, protocols. Axial images of routine and ULD chest CT were evaluated objectively by two expert radiologists and quantitatively by Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and pixel by pixel noise measurement. Results: It was observed that the ULD and routine dose chest CT images could detect Covid 19 related lung lesions in patients with PCR positive test. Also, SNR and pixel noise values were comparable in these protocols. Conclusion: ULD chest CT with 98% dose reduction can be used in non-pandemic situation as a substitute for chest radiograph for screening and follow up. Routine chest CT protocol can be replaced by ULD, with 94% dose reduction, to detect patients suspected with Covid 19 at an early stage and for its follow up.

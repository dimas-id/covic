OBJECTIVE This study was undertaken in order to provide new insight into sensorimotor control of posture when wearing high-shaft (HS) boots as ski boots. BACKGROUND Previous studies into the effects of HS boots on postural control have produced controversial results. Some studies reported postural control impairments with ski boots in bipedal postural tasks due to ankle movement restrictions without quantifying the actual restrictive effect of these boots and specifying the adaptations of the postural control system. METHOD Eighteen young healthy subjects took part in the experiment. Bilateral postural control was assessed on stable and unstable surfaces, while standing barefoot or wearing ski boots. Center of pressure (COP) parameters, ankle, knee, and hip joints movements were calculated and EMG activity from main postural muscles was recorded. RESULTS Ski boots did not restrict the amplitude of ankle angular movements and largely impacted COP parameters and EMG activity on stable ground. In conditions of mediolateral instability, COP data illustrated an enhanced postural control in the frontal plane when wearing ski boots. CONCLUSIONS Ski boots do not affect bipedal postural balance by restricting the ankle angular motions but induce complex adaptations of the postural control system which combine factors of a mechanical, motor, and sensorial nature. They impede postural control mainly when standing on stable ground without producing similar deleterious effects on unstable surfaces. APPLICATION Our results show that HS boots as ski boots can improve lateral balance on unstable surfaces, which can contribute to prevent fall risk and ankle sprain.

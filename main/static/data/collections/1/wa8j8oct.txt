Two patients were admitted to our hospital due to giant bullae. During thoracoscopic surgery, saline-cooled radiofrequency coagulation devices were used to shrink the wall of the bulla. In each case, the volume of the bulla was gradually reduced and the boundary between the lung and bulla was clearly delineated. This method is considered to be useful for performing thoracoscopic surgery of giant bulla.

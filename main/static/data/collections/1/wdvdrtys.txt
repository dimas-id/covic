An ostrich egg at 21 days of development was used to propagate primary embryo cell cultures. Primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells (for fibroblasts) were prepared by routine typsinization techniques. The ostrich embryo fibroblasts were tested for their ability to propagate stock avian viruses of infectious bronchitis virus, paramyxiovirus-1 (PMV-1), PMV-2, PMV-3, infectious bursal disease virus, quail bronchitis virus, avian reovirus, turkey coronavirus, and two ostrich-originating specimens (one of which was a possible coronavirus identified by electron microscopy). Cytopathic effects were seen by light microscopy in cell cultures inoculated with PMV-1, turkey coronavirus, and the two ostrich specimens. Hemaglutinating titers of 4 or more were determined for PMV-1, turkey coronavrius, and the two ostrich specimens after inoculation onto monolayers of ostrich embryo fibroblasts. Hemagglutination-inhibition tests confirmed the identification of PMV-1 when homologous antisera were used as the specific inhibitor. Bovine coronavirus antisera inhibited the hemagglutination of one of the cultured ostrich specimens.

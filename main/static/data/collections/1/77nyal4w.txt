Many applications require generating catalogues of combinatorial objects, that do not contain isomorphs. Several efficient abstract schemes for this problem exist. One is described independently by I. A. Farad≈æev and R. C. Read and has since been applied to catalogue many different combinatorial structures. We present an Isabelle/HOL verification of this abstract scheme. To show its practicality, we instantiate it on two concrete problems: enumerating digraphs and enumerating union-closed families of sets. In the second example abstract algorithm specification is refined to an implementation that can quite efficiently enumerate all canonical union-closed families over a six element universe (there is more than 100 million such families).

BACKGROUND Underrepresented minority (URM) cancer survivors experience disparities in mortality and quality of life, compared with non-Hispanic whites. Disparities are associated with poor social determinants of health, enhanced by mistrust of the healthcare system. Trust can be facilitated by provider-patient racial/ethnic concordance, yet URM survivors rarely experience concordance. Effective health communication is needed for this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the composition and utility of health education videos among adult URM survivors. METHODS Literature searches were conducted in Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and CINAHL databases. Articles that included adult URM cancer survivor samples and either described or tested a video intervention aimed to improve health outcomes were included. Two researchers independently screened articles for inclusion and quality appraisal and abstracted and synthesized relevant data to identify themes. RESULTS Eight articles, detailing 7 independent studies, met inclusion criteria. Quality appraisal of the included studies was fair to good. Six themes were identified: (1) video development with stakeholders, (2) focus on designing culturally appropriate videos, (3) in-clinic video delivery, (4) video intervention effects, (5) provider and URM survivors support video interventions, and (6) building trust through personal stories. CONCLUSIONS Video interventions are well received by URMs and improve outcomes yet are underutilized. More rigorous studies are warranted to develop best practices for video development and application. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Videos serve as an easy, effective tool to achieve favorable outcomes in the care of URM survivors.

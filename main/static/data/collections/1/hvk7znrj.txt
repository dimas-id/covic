SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has today multiplied globally and various governments are attempting to stop the outbreak of the disease escalation into a worldwide health crisis. At this juncture, readiness, candor, clarity, and partaking of data are of paramount importance to speed up factual evaluation and starting pattern control activities, including serendipitous findings. Owing to the involvement of COVID-19, many facts regarding virulence, pathogenesis, and the real viral infection source and/or transmission mode still need to be addressed. The infected patients often present clinical symptoms with fever, dyspnea, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, and dry cough, as well as pulmonary, infiltrates on imaging. Extensive measures to decrease person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 are being implemented to prevent, recognize, and control the current outbreak as it is very similar to SARS-CoV in its clinical spectrum, epidemiology, and pathogenicity. In response to this fatal disease and disruptive outbreak, it is extremely vital to expedite the drug development process to treat the disease and vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 that would help us defeat this pandemic expeditiously. This paper sums up and unifies the study of virological aspects, disease transmission, clinically administered techniques, therapeutics options, managements, future directions, designing of vaccines, and news dissemination pertaining to COVID-19.

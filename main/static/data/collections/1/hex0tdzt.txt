Coronavirus was isolated in HRT-18 tissue culture from nasal swabs of 4 from 15 calves showing respiratory symptoms. The strains showed cytopathic effects and could be identified as coronaviruses of bovine origin by their mouse erythrocyte agglutinating activity as well as serological specific hemagglutination inhibition and electron microscopical methods. This is the first report on the isolation of coronaviruses in tissue culture from the respiratory tract of calves in the FRG.

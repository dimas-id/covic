The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic disease that is dominated by pulmonary symptoms. However, recent reports of isolation of the virus from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) coupled with radiological evidence of zones of necrosis in the brain, have elucidated the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2. The acute respiratory failure seen in patients with COVID-19 is alarming and could be due to the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central respiratory regulatory centers in the brainstem. Appropriate interventions can be implemented to prevent severe outcomes of neurological invasion by SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. It is of paramount importance that the scientific community alerts the healthcare professionals of the pieces of evidence that can herald them on the covert neurological deficits in progress in COVID-19.

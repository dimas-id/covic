DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus encompass a range of ubiquitous and clinically important viruses, from acute pathogens to persistent tumor viruses. These viruses must co-opt nuclear processes for the benefit of the virus, whilst evading host processes that would otherwise attenuate viral replication. Accordingly, DNA viruses induce the formation of membraneless assemblies termed viral replication compartments (VRCs). These compartments facilitate the spatial organization of viral processes and regulate virusâ€“host interactions. Here, we review advances in our understanding of VRCs. We cover their initiation and formation, their function as the sites of viral processes, and aspects of their composition and organization. In doing so, we highlight ongoing and emerging areas of research highly pertinent to our understanding of nuclear-replicating DNA viruses.

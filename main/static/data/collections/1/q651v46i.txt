Blood samples were collected from six captive bears and nine free-ranging Marsican brown bears (Ursus arctos marsicanus) in the Abruzzo National Park, Italy, between 1991 and 1995. Sera were tested for evidence of exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type 2, canine coronavirus, and canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2). Serologic evidence of CDV and CPV-2-exposure was found in both captive and free-ranging bears. This may be the first report of CDV exposure in free-ranging bears.

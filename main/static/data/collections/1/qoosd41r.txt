BACKGROUND Surgical energy-based devices emit energy, which can interfere with other electronic devices (eg, implanted cardiac pacemakers and/or defibrillators). The purpose of this study was to quantify the amount of unintentional energy (electromagnetic interference [EMI]) transferred to an implanted cardiac defibrillator by common surgical energy-based devices. METHODS A transvenous cardiac defibrillator was implanted in an anesthetized pig. The primary outcome measure was the average maximum EMI occurring on the implanted cardiac device during activations of multiple different surgical energy-based devices. RESULTS The EMI transferred to the implanted cardiac device is as follows: traditional bipolar 30 W .01 ± .004 mV, advanced bipolar .004 ± .003 mV, ultrasonic shears .01 ± .004 mV, monopolar Bovie 30 W coagulation .50 ± .20 mV, monopolar Bovie 30 W blend .92 ± .63 mV, monopolar instrument without dispersive electrode .21 ± .07 mV, plasma energy 3.48 ± .78 mV, and argon beam coagulator 2.58 ± .34 mV. CONCLUSION Surgeons can minimize EMI on implanted cardiac defibrillators by preferentially utilizing bipolar and ultrasonic devices.

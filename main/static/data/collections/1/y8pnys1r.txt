BACKGROUND Surgeon modification of commercially available aortic stent grafts represents a salvage option to treat complex aortic pathologies in high-risk patients. TECHNIQUE A 68-year-old male was referred to our hospital with a contained rupture of the visceral aorta. The patient was previously treated with an infrarenal tube graft 16 years earlier as well as with a Crawford procedure with island patch of the celiac trunk (TC) and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and bypasses to both renal arteries 6 years before admission. The computed tomography demonstrated a "blowout aneurysm" of the TC and SMA patch. The bypass to the left renal artery originated from the level of the TC. We therefore modified a commercially available t-branch (CookÂ® Medical, Bloomington, IN) with surgeon-made fenestrations for both renal arteries. The procedure was successful, and the patient could be discharged to home on the seventh postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS The use of surgeon-modified "off-the-shelf" t-branches broadens the possibilities of treating even anatomically very challenging aortic pathologies otherwise not suitable for the t-branch.

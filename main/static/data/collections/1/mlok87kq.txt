BACKGROUND We report our experience of an unexpected complication of internalization of a pulmonary artery (PA) band in the vascular lumen, which occurred in a chronic porcine model of repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). METHODS Twelve piglets were divided into 3 groups: (1) TOF model animals (PA band plus pulmonary valvotomy, n = 4), (2) pulmonary insufficiency (PI) animals (pulmonary valvotomy, n = 4), and (3) control animals (n = 4). A nonabsorbable, coated braided polyester tape was used to perform the main pulmonary artery banding. Echocardiography was performed 4 months postoperatively. After each animal was euthanized, PA histological analysis was performed in animals with band internalization. RESULTS Significant postsurgical pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular enlargement were present in the TOF and PI, compared with control animals, whereas no significant pulmonary stenosis was observed in TOF animals when compared with PI group. Postmortem examination of all TOF animals revealed the constricting band to be intact but partially internalized into the PA lumen, allowing blood flow around the stenosis. Histological sections of the banded PA in the area of internalization showed a significant disorganization of the medial layer, with significant scarring and fibrotic reaction surrounding the outside of the band and the presence of inflammatory cells suggesting a significant inflammatory response during band internalization. CONCLUSIONS Band internalization may occur after PA banding using a nonabsorbable, coated braided polyester tape in a chronic porcine model of repaired TOF. This unusual complication was likely due to the type of material used for banding.

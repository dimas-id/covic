INTRODUCTION: Handoffs and transitions of care are common weak points in healthcare provider communication as patients move between sites. With no consistent pattern of communication between St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital (St. Jude) and its affiliated clinics, the Affiliate Program Office at St. Jude developed and implemented a standardized communication tool to facilitate patient transitions between different healthcare sites. METHODS: Each team of providers created flow diagrams to define the current state of communication when patients were transitioning between remote sites. Fishbone diagrams identified the common barriers to effective communication as a lack of consistent communication and ownership. We developed a communication tool to address these barriers, which was disseminated by secure email. We measured the percent usage of the completed hand-off tool before a patient transitioned, staff experience, and the number of errors. RESULTS: The time to send or receive the communication bundle was <10 minutes. Within 3 months of implementing the SMART bundle at 3 pilot sites, the bundle was used completely in 6 of 8 patient transitions and was associated with somewhat improved staff satisfaction. We identified no adverse events related to the communication bundle. CONCLUSIONS: In this small pilot study, we accomplished closed-loop communication between geographically remote healthcare sites by using an electronically transmitted standardized communication bundle.

To describe a simple and efficient technique for suturing the vaginal cuff in robotic-assisted single-site hysterectomy using barbed suture and a straight needle. Consecutive patients undergoing robotic-assisted single-site hysterectomy from February 2014 to August 2015 at Dong San Hospital, Keimyung University were included. Surgeons used two barbed sutures in a running fashion to close the vaginal cuff. A barbed suture was exclusively used with a straightened needle in upward direction from posterior vaginal cuff to anterior vaginal cuff which played a pivotal role for closure. A total of 100 patients underwent robotic-assisted single-site hysterectomy. The total operation time was 132.5 min and vaginal cuff closure time was 12.0 min. There were no postoperative complications; vaginal cuff dehiscence, vaginal cuff infection, and vaginal bleeding that require surgical intervention or admission. The use of barbed suture with straightened needle to close the vaginal cuff in robotic-assisted single-site hysterectomy is easy to perform and demonstrates safety and efficacy. This technique offers secure, fast, and effective incision closure.

We present a refutationally complete superposition calculus for a version of higher-order logic based on the combinatory calculus. We also introduce a novel method of dealing with extensionality. The calculus was implemented in the Vampire theorem prover and we test its performance against other leading higher-order provers. The results suggest that the method is competitive.

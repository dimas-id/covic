Data sources The authors provide no detail as to how the review was undertaken. Therefore the paper does not provide any methodological processes for data extraction. The paper describes the assimilation of available information regarding 2019-nCoV at the time of writing. The authors provide information on the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform front-line dentists.The paper is as essay on the available information relating to:Background to the pandemicâ¢ Coronaviruses in generalâ¢ Pathogenesisâ¢ COVID-19â¢ Clinical manifestationsâ¢ Patient characteristicsâ¢ Diagnosisâ¢ Protocol for managing the disease in the clinical settingâ¢ Transmission dynamicsâ¢ Transmission dynamics in dentistry practiceâ¢ Infection controlâ¢ Mouth rinsesâ¢ Rubber dam isolationâ¢ Anti-retraction handpieceâ¢ Appropriate disinfectantsâ¢ Management of medical waste.Conclusions Face-to-face communication and consistent exposure to body fluids such as blood and saliva predispose dental care workers to risk of infection and there is high risk of cross-infection. The authors apply available international guidelines to provide a protocol for managing possible exposure to patients or those suspected of having a 2019-nCoV infection. Dentists play a significant role in disrupting the transmission trail of the virus by simply postponing non-emergency care for all patients.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine levels of specific IgG antibodies against measles, rubella, vaccinia, corona (OC43) and mumps viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 18 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS), 8 patients with optic neuritis (ON), 27 patients with other neurological disease (OND), and 88 control subjects without central nervous system disease. Serum antibody levels were not significantly different between the four groups. Differences in the frequency and levels of CSF antibodies between the four groups were observed. Control patients had serumCSF antibody ratios from 2.0 to 3.0 (log) with an average of 2.5 corresponding to a 320-fold difference between serum and CSF antibody levels. MS patients had ratios from 1.1 to 2.1 with an average of 1.6. The average was 2.0 for the ON patients. The average for the OND patients was similar to the controls. The altered serumCSF ratios for several viruses within an individual patient was similar. These results suggest that nonspecific immunostimulation is responsible for the increased levels of CSF virus antibodies.

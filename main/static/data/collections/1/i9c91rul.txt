PURPOSE Single-port laparoscopic surgery has the intention to further minimize the access trauma similar to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. While special trocars and instruments are needed, the spectrum of clinical indications corresponds to the conventional laparoscopic surgery. This review gives an overview of the current applications and advances in single-port laparoscopic surgery. METHODS The PubMed database was searched for "single incision laparoscopic surgery" or "single port" and different operations (e.g., cholecystectomy, colectomy, and appendectomy). The references and our own experiences were considered for historic development and current advances. RESULTS The spreading of single-port laparoscopic surgery is not as fast as expected. References show that operations using a single-port technique are feasible, safe, and efficient. More technical difficulties for the surgeon and higher costs must be considered. A better cosmetic result, less postoperative pain, and a faster recovery could be potential benefits for the patients. CONCLUSIONS Current advances in single-port laparoscopic surgery are difficult to define. The most common procedures are single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies, colectomies, and appendectomies. Significant clinical benefits have not yet been proven even in prospective, randomized studies.

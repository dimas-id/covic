Placing a double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) in an appropriate position to facilitate lung isolation is essential for thoracic procedures. The novel ANKOR DLT is a DLT developed with three cuffs with a newly added carinal cuff designed to prevent further advancement by being blocked by the carina when the cuff is inflated. In this prospective study, the direction and depth of initial placement of ANKOR DLT were compared with those of conventional DLT. Patients undergoing thoracic surgery (n = 190) with one-lung ventilation (OLV) were randomly allocated into either left-sided conventional DLT group (n = 95) or left-sided ANKOR DLT group (n = 95). The direction and depth of DLT position were compared via fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) after endobronchial intubation between the groups. There was no significant difference in the number of right mainstem endobronchial intubations between the two groups (p = 0.468). The difference between the initial depth of DLT placement and the target depth confirmed by FOB was significantly lower in the ANKOR DLT group than in the conventional DLT group (1.8 ± 1.8 vs. 12.9 ± 9.7 mm; p < 0.001). In conclusion, the ANKOR DLT facilitated its initial positioning at the optimal depth compared to the conventional DLT.

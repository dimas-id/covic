Four Bovidae cell lines (BEK‐1, MDBK, Bu and EBTr) were characterized by means of enzymatic biochemical markers. Out of 15 enzymatic systems, 3 — adenosine dea‐minase [Ada), phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) and nucleoside phosphorylase (Np) —were found to be polymorphic and quite suitable for biochemical identification of each cell line. The Bu cell line has shown a Np phenotypic pattern which could be distinctive of the Bison bison species.

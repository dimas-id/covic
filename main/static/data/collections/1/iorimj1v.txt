INTRODUCTION: Delayed graft function (DGF) is associated with poorer graft survival and higher rate of acute rejection (AR). It is unknown if this negative influence relies on the increased risk of AR or the DGF itself. The different Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) values may also play a role in this interaction. METHODS: Retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of DGF on graft function and graft survival in a subset of KT recipients (2004-2017). We also analyzed the relationship between KDPI and DGF. RESULTS: The study includes601 KT,226of them (37%) developed DGF. Graft survival was lower in patients with DGF compared with non-DGF patients. Multivariable analysis revealed DGF as risk factor for graft loss, independently of the presence or not of acute rejection. Between DGF patients we observed poorer graft survival in patients with higher KDPI value (>85%).We observed a trend of a greater impact of KDPI in patients with DGF, although this interaction was not statistically significant. Additionally, we observed poorer 12-month graft function in DGF patients. CONCLUSION: DGF is related to poorer graft survival independently of the developed of acute rejection. This negative impact might be influenced by high KDPI values.

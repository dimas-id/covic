Aortic root reconstruction in the setting of redo aortic valve procedures or infective endocarditis may be technically challenging, particularly because of variable destruction or distortion of the left ventricular outflow tract. Homograft aortic root replacement is an excellent option for aortic root abscesses but is limited by homograft availability. We describe a simple technique of a bioprosthetic valved conduit constructed on the table using a Dacron (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) skirt below the valve. The use of the Dacron skirt facilitates easy reconstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract.

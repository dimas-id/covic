Recently, a new viral-based infection has emerged as a respiratory disease caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, China. With any or many reasons, this newly emerged novel-Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has now been recognized in more than 70 locations around the globe. The disease caused by 2019-nCoV has been named as “coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19”. Due to the rising number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infected cases and widespread detection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced 2019-nCoV as a threatening health concern, and urgent robust actions are of supreme interest to tackle this global health emergency. Owing to this new emergence, we know relatively little about 2019-nCoV, which is a highly pathogenic human pathogen. To completely overcome this life-threatening 2019-nCoV pathogen, further in-depth studies are needed to gain insight and complete understanding about its fast mode spread, replication, and pathogenesis. Since the first appearance and detection of 2019-nCoV and COVID-19, respectively, the current literature lacks the global perspective and replication cycle of 2019-nCoV. Thus, herein, an effort has been made to cover this literature gap. A proper understanding of the 2019-nCoV replication will further insight and strengthen the infection control measures, transmission prevention, and vaccine development, effectively.

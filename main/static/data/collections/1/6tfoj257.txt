INTRODUCTION The objective of this study is to determine the extent and describe the nature of patient-generated health data (PGHD) integration into electronic health records (EHRs) using systematic scoping methods to review the available literature. PGHD have the potential to enhance decision making by providing the valuable information that may not be ordinarily captured during a routine care visit. These data which are captured from mobile devices, such as smartphones, activity trackers and other sensors, should be integrated into clinical workflows to allow for optimal use by clinicians. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study aims to conduct a rigorous scoping review to explore evidence related to the integration of PGHD into EHRs. Using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley, we will create a systematic search strategy, chart data from the relevant articles, and use a qualitative, thematic approach to analyse the data. This review will enable the identification of types of integration and describe challenges and barriers to integrating PGHD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Database searches will be initiated in June 2019. The review is expected to be completed by October 2019. As the content of the full-text articles emerges, the authors will summarise the characteristics related to the integration of PGHD. The findings of this scoping review will identify research gaps and present implications for future research.

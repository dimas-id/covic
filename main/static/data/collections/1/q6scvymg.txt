This describes the pathology found in the respiratory system of laboratory animals and how this differs from pulmonary disease reported in humans which is greatly influenced by the use of tobacco products. It discusses the changes that can be induced by therapy by different routes of administration including agents administered by inhalation or the intranasal route. There is a discussion of inhalation technology and how species differences in anatomy and physiology of the lungs and airways can influence the disposition and pathological effects of administered drugs. It discusses the potential adverse effects of fine particles, particularly nanoparticles. Pathology of the pleural cavity is described including the effects of fibers and nanoparticles. Finally there is an analysis of the comparative pathology of neoplasms that occur in the respiratory tract and pleura of laboratory animals and humans.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute respiratory failure and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Rhesus θ-defensin (RTD)-1 is an antimicrobial peptide with immunomodulatory activity. As airway inflammation and neutrophil recruitment and activation are hallmarks of ALI, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of RTD-1 in preclinical models of the disease. We investigated the effect of RTD-1 on neutrophil chemotaxis and macrophage-driven pulmonary inflammation with human peripheral neutrophils and LPS-stimulated murine alveolar macrophage (denoted MH-S) cells. Treatment and prophylactic single escalating doses were administered subcutaneously in a well-established murine model of direct endotoxin-induced ALI. We assessed lung injury by histopathology, pulmonary edema, inflammatory cell recruitment, and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the BAL fluid. In vitro studies demonstrated that RTD-1 suppressed CXCL8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis, TNF-mediated neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion, and proinflammatory cytokine release in activated murine alveolar immortalized macrophages (MH-S) cells. Treatment with RTD-1 significantly inhibited in vivo LPS-induced ALI by reducing pulmonary edema and histopathological changes. Treatment was associated with dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6), peroxidase activity, and neutrophil recruitment into the airways. Antiinflammatory effects were demonstrated in animals receiving RTD-1 up to 12 hours after LPS challenge. Notably, subcutaneously administered RTD-1 demonstrates good peptide stability as demonstrated by the long in vivo half-life. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that RTD-1 is efficacious in an experimental model of ALI through inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion, and the attenuation of proinflammatory cytokines and gene expression from alveolar macrophages.

The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Given the current lack of treatments or vaccines available, it may be useful to trace the evolu-tion and spread of the virus to better develop methods of preventative intervention. In this study, we analyzed over 4,000 full genome sequences of human SARS-CoV-2 using novel tool ViReport [13], an automated workflow for performing phylogenetic analyses on viral sequences and generating comprehensive molecular epidemiologi-cal reports. The complete ViReport output can be found at https://github.com/mirandajsong/ViReport-SARS-CoV-2.

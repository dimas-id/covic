Objective: In recent years, although reduced port surgeries (RPS) have been reported for many urological diseases, there have been no reports regarding simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes and complications of simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS. Methods: We performed a preliminary case series of 4 patients with synchronous upper urinary tract (UUT) tumor and invasive bladder cancer who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS between 2014 and 2017 at our hospital. Demographic data, pathologic features, the surgical technique, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Result: All 4 patients were men whose median age was 79 years (range 65-85 years) and median body mass index was 24.2 kg/m2 (range 21.5-27.3 kg/m2). The laparoscopic approach was technically successful in all 4 patients without the need for open conversion. The median total operative time was 434 minutes (range 372-481 minutes). The median estimated blood loss was 773 ml (range 153-923 ml), median interval to resuming oral intake was 2 days (range 1-7 days), and median hospital stay was 16 days (range 13-20 days). Conclusion: The reduced port approach is technically feasible in terms of many outcome measures, with significant cosmetic advantages. This method can be performed safely and recommended as a viable option for patients with concomitant UUT and bladder cancer.

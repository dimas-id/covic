The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019‐nCoV, or SARS‐CoV‐2) has caused an epidemic of the acute respiratory syndrome known as COVID‐19 in humans. SARS‐CoV‐2 rapidly spread to multiple regions of China and multiple other countries, posing a serious threat to public health. The spike (S) proteins of SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2 may use the same host cellular receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and the SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein is much higher than that of ACE2 binding to the SARS‐CoV S protein, explaining why SARS‐CoV‐2 seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we report that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2, or by the stimulation with inflammatory cytokines such as interferons. We propose that SARS‐CoV‐2 may positively induce its cellular entry receptor, ACE2, to accelerate its replication and spread; high inflammatory cytokine levels increase ACE2 expression and act as high‐risk factors for developing COVID‐19, and the infection of other viruses may increase the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Therefore, drugs targeting ACE2 may be developed for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of coronaviruses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Enabling full interoperability within and between population-based patient- registry domains would open up access to a rich and unique source of health data for secondary data usage. Previous attempts to tackle patient-registry interoperability have met with varying degrees of success, but a unifying solution remains elusive. The purpose of this paper is to show by practical example how a solution is attainable via the implementation of an existing framework based of the concept of federated, semantic metadata registries. One important feature motivating the use of this framework is that it can be implemented gradually and independently within each patient-registry domain. By employing linked open data principles, the framework extends the ISO/IEC 11179 standard to provide both syntactic and semantic interoperability of data elements with the means of specifying automated extraction scripts for retrieval of data from different registry content models. The examples provided address the domain of European population-based cancer registries to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. One of the examples shows how quick gains are derivable by allowing retrieval of aggregated core data sets. The other examples show how aggregated full sets of data and record-level data might also be retrieved from each local registry. An infrastructure of patient-registry domains adhering to the principles of the framework would provide the semantic contexts and inter-linkage of data necessary for automated search and retrieval of registry data. It would thereby also lay the foundation for making registry data serviceable to artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

Due to stringent but necessary infection control mandates, the COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly resulting in family separation from loved ones admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Even in normal circumstances, ICU families frequently experience significant psychological dysfunction-including posttraumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related reactions, especially during the end of life period. The COVID pandemic likely will exacerbate these reactions as more and more families are being barred from the ICU. Consequently, ICU families are facing additional barriers in fully understanding the complex medical needs of their loved ones (and hence being able to make informed care decisions on their behalf); establishing rapport and bonding with nurses and other members of the ICU treatment team; and, in the event that a loved one passes, achieving closure. ICU health care providers can take steps to mitigate these outcomes by being mindful of the unique stressors ICU families are currently facing and tailoring their communication and behavior accordingly.

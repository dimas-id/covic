Humans are susceptible to various infectious diseases. However, humanity still has limited responses to emergent and recurrent infectious diseases. Recent developments in medical technology have led to various vaccines being developed, but these vaccines typically require a considerable amount of time to counter infectious diseases. Therefore, one of the best methods to prevent infectious diseases is to continuously update our knowledge with useful information from infectious disease information systems and taking active steps to safeguard ourselves against infectious diseases. Some existing infectious disease information systems simply present infectious disease information in the form of text or transmit it via e-mail. Other systems provide data in the form of files or maps. Most existing systems display text-centric information regarding infectious disease outbreaks. Therefore, understanding infectious disease outbreak information at a glance is difficult for users. In this paper, we propose the infectious disease outbreak statistics visualization system, called to DOVE, which collects infectious disease outbreak statistics from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and provides statistical charts with district, time, infectious disease, gender, and age data. Users can easily identify infectious disease outbreak statistics at a glance by simply entering the district, time, and name of an infectious disease into our system. Additionally, each statistical chart allows users to recognize the characteristics of an infectious disease and predict outbreaks by investigating the outbreak trends of that disease. We believe that our system provides effective information to help prevent infectious disease outbreaks. Our system is currently available on the web at http://www.epidemic.co.kr/statistics.

Abstract Caused by a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious disease associated with significant fatality that emerged in 2003. The molecular cause of the unusually high human pathogenicity of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is still unknown. In an effort to characterize molecular components of the virus that are absent in other coronaviruses, all of which are considerably less pathogenic for humans, we recombinantly produced the SARS-unique domain (SUD) within non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) of SARS-CoV and characterized its nucleic-acid binding properties. Zone-interference gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a specific affinity of SUD for oligo(G)-strings. A few such segments are present in the SARS-CoV genome, but also in mRNAs of host proteins involved in the regulation of signaling pathways. A putative role of SUD in virus-induced apoptosis or survival of host cells is discussed.

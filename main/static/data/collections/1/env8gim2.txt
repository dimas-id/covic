Using a self-developed questionnaire, this study examined the knowledge of coronary heart disease (CHD) in 467 Hong Kong Chinese, comprising participants with a low risk (LR) of CHD and high risk (HR) of CHD, and those who had had a myocardial infarction (MI). The results showed that the LR and HR respondents were less likely to respond correctly to items regarding knowledge of typical symptoms and certain risk factors for CHD. The MI group had the highest level of CHD knowledge. Significant differences were found across the 3 target populations in most of the domains of CHD knowledge. Women and older respondents of the LR population were found to have better CHD knowledge than their counterparts. The study highlighted that CHD prevention in Hong Kong should not focus on secondary prevention at the expense of primary prevention. Promotion of knowledge should be targeted to primary education, in particular among the male population and younger Chinese.

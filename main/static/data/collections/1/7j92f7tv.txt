AIM Single-incision laparoscopy is a rapidly evolving technique in the spectrum 'standard laparoscopy-natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES)'. From a commercial perspective, purchase of articulating instruments is advised. However, here we present our early experience with single-incision laparoscopy for right hemicolectomy with standard laparoscopic instrumentation. METHOD Between June 2010 and December 2011, 25 patients presenting with malignant disease underwent single-incision laparoscopy for right hemicolectomy. Four different ports (SILS™ port, Covidien; SSL(®) Access system, Ethicon; X-Cone/S-Portal(®) , Storz; and OCTO™ port, AFS Medical) were used. Patients were recruited prospectively and all data were processed retrospectively. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included in our study (and their characteristics, described later in this paragraph, are expressed as median (range)). Four conversions to standard laparoscopy were performed. The age of patients was 69 (36-89) years, and they had a body mass index (BMI) of 24.5 (19.1-34.2). The duration of surgery was 110 (70-148) min with a healed skin incision length of 35 (20-60) mm. Hospital stay was 5 (2-15) days. In four patients discharge was delayed because of comorbidity. One patient suffered an overwhelming pneumonia. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopy using standard laparoscopic instruments appears to be a safe and feasible technique for malignant disease requiring right hemicolectomy. Randomized, prospective trials are ongoing to prove the benefits of this technique and to compare its oncological outcome measures with those of conventional laparoscopy. In our experience, a low-profile port with a wide intra-abdominal range of motion is most preferable.

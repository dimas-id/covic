Leishmania spp. affecting cats include L. infantum, L. mexicana, L. venezuelensis, L. amazonensis, and L. braziliensis. Leishmania infantum is the species most frequently reported in cats and causes feline leishmaniosis (FeL). Cats exposed to L. infantum are able to mount a cell-mediated immune response that does not parallel antibody production. Cats with L. infantum-associated clinical disease have positive blood PCR and low to very high antibody levels. About half of the clinical cases of FeL are diagnosed in cats with impaired immunocompetence. Skin or mucocutaneous lesions are the most common clinical findings; however, FeL is a systemic disease. Skin or mucocutaneous lesions and lymph node enlargement are seen in at least half of cases, ocular or oral lesions and some aspecific signs (weight loss, anorexia, lethargy) in about 20â€“30% of cases, and many other clinical signs (e.g., respiratory, gastrointestinal) are sporadically observed. Ulcerative and nodular lesions due to diffuse granulomatous dermatitis are the most frequent skin manifestations, mainly distributed on the head or symmetrically on the distal limbs. Diagnosis can be obtained by cytology and histology, and immunohistochemistry is useful to confirm the causative role of Leishmania infection in the dermopathological manifestations; however, other skin diseases may coexist with FeL. Polymerase chain reaction is used in case of suggestive lesions with lack of parasites and for Leishmania speciation. Comorbidities, coinfections, and chronic renal disease influence the prognosis and should be investigated. Treatment is currently based on the same drugs used for canine leishmaniosis, and generally clinical cure is obtained; however recurrence is possible.

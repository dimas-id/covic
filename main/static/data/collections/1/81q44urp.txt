The intensive care unit (ICU) is integral in any successful transplant program, as the care of these transplant recipients requires exhaustive multidisciplinary care. After transplantation, these patients have a host of hemodynamic changes that affect both the allograft and global end-organ function. All organ systems remain intricate in the ICU and must be monitored closely as the acuity remains high even after the immediate postoperative period. Managing these patients requires an in-depth understanding of immunosuppressive medications as well as their side effect profiles and drug interactions to safely navigate the care of these patients. Not surprisingly, given these patients have an innate immunosuppressive state in addition to these medications, they remain susceptible to aggressive post-transplant infections. Communication between the ICU and the transplant team remains key to the success of each individual transplanted graft and patient.

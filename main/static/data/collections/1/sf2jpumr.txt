BACKGROUND Splenic flexure cancer (SFC), identified as tumors raised in the distal transverse colon and proximal descending colon, accounts for 2 to 5% of all surgically treated colorectal cancers. Despite the fact that the laparoscopic approach has become the gold standard for many colorectal procedures, it has never been extensively investigated in SFC due to lack of an agreed consensus on the appropriate operative procedure. The aim of this multicenter retrospective study is to evaluate the oncologic value of laparoscopic segmental resection with complete mesocolic excision (CME) for cancer located in the splenic flexure. METHODS All data of consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic resection with CME for SFC from January 2005 to December 2017 at five different tertiary centers were retrospectively analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) test was used to assess the overall survival (OS) and the disease-free survival (DFS) rates after surgery. Univariate Cox regression was used to explore the association between OS and other independent factors. RESULTS Recurrence was observed in 13 (11.6%) patients and a significant association between disease stage and recurrence (P < 0.001) was found with a higher proportion of stage IV patients in the recurrence group (46.1% vs. 7.1%). During a median follow-up of 43 months (range 12-149), 13 deaths occurred, all of them due to disease progression. KM curves for all stages showed an estimated survival rate of 51% at 148 months. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic segmental resection with CME appears to be an oncologically safe and effective procedure for treatment of SFC and may be considered as a standard surgical method for elective management of the disease. In the future, routine lymph node mapping could be used to confirm this hypothesis.

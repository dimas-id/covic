Abstract The focus of the research is on the analysis of genome sequences. Based on the inter-nucleotide distance sequence, we propose the conditional multinomial distribution profile for the complete genomic sequence. These profiles can be used to define a very simple, computationally efficient, alignment-free, distance measure that reflects the evolutionary relationships between genomic sequences. We use this distance measure to classify chromosomes according to species of origin, to build the phylogenetic tree of 24 complete genome sequences of coronaviruses. Our results demonstrate the new method is powerful and efficient.

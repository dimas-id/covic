Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increased interest in telehealth as a means of providing care for children by a pediatric cardiologist. In this article, we provide an overview of telehealth utilization as an extension of current pediatric cardiology practices and provide some insight into the rapid shift made to quickly implement these telehealth services into our everyday practices due to COVID-19 personal distancing requirements. Our panel will review helpful tips into the selection of appropriate patient populations and specific cardiac diagnoses for telehealth that put patient and family safety concerns first. Numerous practical considerations in conducting a telehealth visit must be taken into account to ensure optimal use of this technology. The use of adapted staffing and billing models and expanded means of remote monitoring will aid in the incorporation of telehealth into more widespread pediatric cardiology practice. Future directions to sustain this platform include the refinement of telehealth care strategies, defining best practices, including telehealth in the fellowship curriculum and continuing advocacy for technology.

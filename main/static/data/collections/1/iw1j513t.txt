BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from highly contagious, life-threatening infections should be treated in specialized clinical facilities that follow the highest infection control standards. Consensus statements defining technical equipment and operational procedures have been published in recent years, but the level of adherence to these has not been evaluated. METHODS: Data summarized here comparing German and European isolation facilities are the partial results of a cross-sectional analysis conducted by the “European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases” that included 48 clinical care facilities in 16 European nations. Data collection was conducted using questionnaires and on-site visits, focussing on aspects of infrastructure, technical equipment, and the availability of trained personnel. RESULTS: Although all centres enrolled were listed as “isolation units”, all aspects evaluated differed broadly. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a ‘High Level Isolation Unit’, as 6/8 enrolled German facilities did. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital. DISCUSSION: Within and between nations contributing data disparities regarding the fulfilment of guidelines published were seen. German isolation facilities mostly fulfilled all criteria evaluated and performed on a high technical level. However, data presented do not reflect the current situation in Germany due to the time that has elapsed since the study was conducted. Hence, longitudinal data collection and harmonisation of terminology at least on national level needs to be implemented.

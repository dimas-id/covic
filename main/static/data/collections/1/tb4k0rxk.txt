Abstract In this study, by partial sequence analysis of the genome segments encoding VP5* and VP7, we characterized a novel bovine group A rotavirus, namely, Tak2, that was detected from adult cattle diarrhea in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. The nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the genome segments encoding VP5* and half of the amino terminal portion of VP7 of Tak2 revealed a low identity with those of group A rotaviruses carrying previously published P and G type specificities (VP5*: nt identity, 61.6%–67.6% and aa identity, 58.0%–71.4%; half of the amino terminal portion of VP7: nt identity, 57.8%–73.5% and aa identity, 61.2%–70.9%). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the nt sequences of the genome segments encoding VP5* and half of the amino terminal portion of VP7 revealed that Tak2 formed a branch separate from the established P and G types. These results suggested that Tak2 could possess novel P and G types yet not reported among group A rotaviruses.

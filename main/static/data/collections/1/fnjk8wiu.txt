Performance evaluation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks is becoming more and more important due to the increasing demand for quality of service (QoS). In addition to basic statistical properties based on the distribution of interarrival times of packets, actual network traffic exhibits correlations over a wide range of time scales associated with long-range dependence (LRD). This article focuses on examining the impact of both LRD and number of nodes that transmit packets in a typical IoT wireless local network, on performance of the backhaul link. The analysis of latency and packet loss led to an interesting observation that the aggregation of packet streams, originating from single nodes, lowers the importance of LRD, even causing an underestimation of performance results when compared to the queueing system with Markovian input.

The analysis of bio-aerosols poses a technology challenge, particularly when sampling and analysis are done in situ. Mass spectrometry laboratory technology has been modified to achieve quick bacteria typing of aerosols in the field. Initially, aerosol material was collected and subjected off-line to minimum sample treatment and mass spectrometry analysis. More recently, sampling and analysis were combined in a single process for the real-time analysis of bio-aerosols in the field. This chapter discusses the development of technology for the mass spectrometry of bio-aerosols, with a focus on bacteria aerosols. Merits and drawbacks of the various technologies and their typing signatures are discussed. The chapter concludes with a brief view of future developments in bio-aerosol mass spectrometry.

Summary The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak has almost mandated a re-evaluation of infection control practices in hospitals, clinics, schools and domestic environments, especially for patients with respiratory tract symptoms. Triage, early case detection followed by prompt isolation and quarantine are major preventive measures. Respiratory tract infections are the most common childhood illnesses and paediatric SARS poses special problems in diagnosis because of its non-specific presentation. The main lessons learnt from the outbreak were: (1) despite well established guidelines on infection control precautions, poor understanding of underlying principles and deficiencies in compliance are common among healthcare professionals, especially during emergencies; (2) even a slight lapse can be fatal; and (3) over-protection can be counterproductive. Hence it is important to: (1) be protected to protect others; (2) be vigilant and prepared for emerging infections; (3) be proficient and scrupulous in infection control measures; (4) be apposite and practical on personal protective equipments to ensure sustainability; and (5) be dutiful and prompt in informing of potential threats and work closely with others.

We retrospectively reviewed eight prospective epidemiological studies conducted between 1991 and 1995 for dual respiratory virus infection (DRVI) to determine the frequency, associated comorbid conditions, clinical presentations, and morbidity related to DRVI among immunocompetent persons. Two viruses were identified as the cause of 67 (5.0%) of 1,341 acute respiratory virus infections. DRVI was detected in patients from <1 year to 79 years of age, in both sexes, and in many races. Forty-two percent of patients with DRVI were â©½4 years old. Fifty-eight percent of patients with DRVI had underlying chronic lung disease. DRVI was associated with upper respiratory tract illness; lower respiratory tract illness, including pneumonia; systemic influenza-like illnesses; and exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All of the common acute respiratory viruses were identified; picornaviruses and influenzavirus A were the most common. The rate of DRVI (11.6%) was highest in the epidemiological studies in which cell culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction were used together. Patients with DRVI were hospitalized significantly more often than those with respiratory infection due to a single virus (46.3% vs. 21.7%; P < .01). The percentage of DRVIs increased proportionally with the number of diagnostic methods used.

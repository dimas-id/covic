The COVID‚Äê19 dramatically changed employment across sectors in 2020. This Viewpoint essay examines public sector labor relations during the pandemic and describes the impact bargaining process used to protect public employees. We draw on our own experience in impact bargaining negotiations and the public labor relations, conflict management, and civil service reform literatures to develop recommendations for public union labor leaders in times of crisis. We suggest that public unions have an important role in crisis management, but must act strategically in order to develop good working relationships with leadership and successfully negotiate employee protections in uncertain times.

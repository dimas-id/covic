BACKGROUND Major impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is one of the main reasons why obese patients request surgical treatment. OBJECTIVE To prospectively analyze the impact of HRQoL between obese patients who underwent surgery and those who were wait-listed. METHODS Between April 2017 and March 2018, 70 surgical and 69 wait-listed patients were interviewed twice, at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured by the SF-12v2 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL-Lite) questionnaires. Sociodemographic-, clinical-, and surgical-related variables were collected. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients were analyzed, showing similar baseline characteristics but differences in HRQoL. Performing more qualified work improved scores on some aspects of the SF-12 survey. In contrast, women scored worse on the self-esteem domain, and men scored worse on the mental health domain. By group, at the 12-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were found among all aspects of the questionnaires between both groups (P < 0.001) and between baseline and postoperative 12-month follow-up in the surgical group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, scores were lower in all domains in the evolution of wait-listed patients, with statistically significant differences among the Bodily Pain, Emotional Role, Mental Health, and Mental Component Summary Domains (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION HRQoL is a multimodal concept that allows the identification of factors impacting obese patients' quality of life. It promotes the benefit of surgery against waiting list delays, which can take up to 4 years in our hospital. Therefore, HRQoL is an important pillar to justify more resources for reducing unacceptable surgical delays.

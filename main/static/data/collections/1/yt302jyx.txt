Abstract Objectives In this study, an infection screening system was developed to detect patients suffering from infectious diseases. In addition, the system was also designed to deal with the variability in age and gender, which would affect the accuracy of the detection. Furthermore, to enable a low-cost, non-contact and embedded system, multiple vital signs from a medical radar were measured and all algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array, named PYNQ-Z1. Methods The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, were implemented. Results The Student's t-test showed that our proposed digital signal processing algorithms coped well with the variability of human cases in age and gender. Meanwhile, the f1-score of roughly 98.0% represented the high sensitivity and specificity of our proposed machine learning methods. Conclusion This study outlines the implementation of an infection screening system, which achieved competent performance. The system might be beneficial for fast screening of infected patients at public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare.

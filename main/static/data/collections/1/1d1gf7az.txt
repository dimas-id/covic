Interferon‐α/β (IFN‐α/β) is increasingly used as antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies. Unfortunately, bioavailability varies with IFN species and mode of administration, and all IFN species are potentially immunogenic. Assays for antiviral activity (IFN) and antiviral neutralization (antibodies, NAb) have been used for some time to monitor patients on IFN biologicals. These assays require laborious titrations making them unsuitable for large‐scale clinical use. Our laboratories have therefore modified the antiviral assays for IFN bioactivity and Nab, so that they are suitable for large‐scale screening in specialized laboratories. The read‐out is survival of a subcloned A549 cell line in the presence of an otherwise lethal amount of virus. Thus, survival increases in the presence of type 1 IFN and decreases in the presence of NAb against the IFN added to the cells. MxA is induced by type 1 IFN and can be used for measuring the Nab activity. In another assay, the MxA level in the A549 cell line is measured. In an attempt to find a new and better reporter gene for type 1 IFN than MxA and genes specific for either IFN‐α or ‐β, a micro array screen was carried using the U133A chip from Affymetrix. The expression of 22,000 genes can be studied simultaneous with this technology. The results will be presented at the conference.

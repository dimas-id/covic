BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Autoantibodies as new tumor markers may play an important role in the early diagnosis and evaluating the prognosis of lung cancer. In this study, we detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) autoantibodies using peptide array and screen the epitopes which are recognized by EGFR autoantibodies. METHODS: Peptide array covering the extracellular domain of EGFR protein was synthesized by a synthesizer (ASPSL) made by Intavis company. EGFR autoantibodies in the serums of non-small cell lung cancer patients was detected using peptide array. RESULTS: Six of 20 patients were found to have EGFR autoantibodis. The positive rate is 30%. Nine high frequency spots were found in the 6 positive patients and 8 high frequency spots clustered in the Ⅲ and Ⅳ domains. CONCLUSION: These findings will offer new clues for the futher studies of EGFR and EGFR autoantibodies.

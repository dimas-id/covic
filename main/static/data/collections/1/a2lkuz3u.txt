Canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) emerged in 1978 as one of the most pathogenic etiologic agents in dogs. Under the influence of evolution, the original CPV-2 was replaced, a few years later, by 2 variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b. In 2000, a new variant, CPV-2c, was detected first in Italy and later in other countries. The current study was conducted to provide data about the CPV types circulating in Bulgaria. Forty-two fecal samples from dogs with clinical signs of parvovirosis, collected between June 2009 and February 2010, were tested for CPV using a rapid test based on detection of CPV antigens and a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of viral DNA. Positive samples were characterized by means of minor groove binder probe PCR assays. Forty samples were positive, of which 30 were identified as CPV-2a, 9 as CPV-2b, and 1 as CPV-2c. The results from this molecular investigation of CPV show the prevalence of type 2a and occurrence of type 2c for the first time in Bulgaria.

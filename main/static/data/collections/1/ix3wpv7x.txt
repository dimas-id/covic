In this paper, we consider the decision tables provided by experts in the field. We construct an algorithm for executing a highly parallel program represented by a fuzzy Petri net from a given decision table. The constructed net allows objects to be identified in decision tables to the extent that appropriate decisions can be made. Conditional attribute values given by experts are propagated by the net at maximum speed. This is done by properly organizing the netâ€™s work. Our approach is based on rough set theory and weighted generalized fuzzy Petri nets.

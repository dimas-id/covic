Bed bug infestation, as a growing crisis in the hospitality and tourism industry, has been featured in news coverage. This study conducted a framing analysis of news coverage that is pertinent to the bed bug crisis and to the hospitality and travel industry. Selected news articles, representing three different destinations, were retrieved from five national newspapers. Results showed that bed bug infestation has been framed as a typical health crisis, with aspects of consequence and seriousness featured. Findings further confirmed the hospitality and travel industry as frequently cited in the bed bug news coverage. A positive correlation existed between the mention of the hospitality and travel industry, and the use of either a thematic frame or the news frame consequence. Based on the findings, implications for tourism crisis management were discussed.

Abstract Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the newer generation advanced materials for diverse applications, starting from physical, mechanical, chemical and biological sciences. However, the present era of healthcare industry is extensively using CNTs for exploring their applications in mitigating diverse needs. The considered attention in CNTs is due to their inimitable properties such as size and aspect ratio covering surface area to the length, and amenable electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. Available in diverse forms, viz. single-walled, double walled or multi-walled structures, CNTs of different forms possess multiple advantages in various healthcare segments, and especially in drug delivery for the treatment of diseases. CNTs have proven to be useful in specific drug delivery applications such as controlled and targeted drug delivery to desired sites such as lymphatic and ocular systems, brain and other cancerous tissues. Multiple research reports have been published till date, which unequivocally gives testimony to the potential applications of CNTs. The present book chapter, in this regard, endeavor to provide an overview on synthesis, characterization and drug delivery applications of CNTs. The chapter highlights on recent regulatory standards on commercial production and safety testing of the CNTs for translating them into market.

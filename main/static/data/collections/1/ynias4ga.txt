Abstract A new coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China; the virus escalated rapidly and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic.Emerging data suggests that older patients with COVID-19 associated with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and lung diseases are particularly more susceptible, compared to general populations, and have higher mortality. It is not yet clear whether this increased association of high blood pressure with COVID-19 and the increased risk of mortality are directly related to high blood pressure or other associated comorbidities, or to antihypertensive treatment.Although the underlying pathogenic mechanism linking hypertension and severity of COVID-19 infection remains to be elucidated, it has been hypothesized that excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could contribute to the progression of COVID-19 related lung injury.Concern about whether angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have deleterious effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 is based on speculation that these drugs would increase the regulation of angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which would increase viral load and lung damage.Recent studies are consistent with the recommendations of scientific societies that propose avoiding the suspension or change of antihypertensive medication, as there is no evidence that shows that these can be taken as risk factors for severity or mortality from COVID-19.

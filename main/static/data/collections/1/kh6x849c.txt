Those of us working in bioethics field take it for granted that the rest of the world reads our work and uses it as part of their scholarship and reasoning processes. Having widespread national and international influence is true for some of the biggest name bioethicists, but interactions at new international conferences or browsing through publications often brings revealing - and potentially humbling - news about how little effect our research tends to have on what is going on elsewhere. We are unrecognized outside of our small, tightly bound professional groups, and our ideas fail to be incorporated freely throughout outsiders' scholarly work. Putting our professional hurt feelings aside, we should have far greater concerns of possibly unneeded effort and hampered progress in the field based on unintentional ignorance of how other geographic regions are doing their bioethics. It makes no practical sense for efforts to be duplicated, especially if someone else has done it better, or at least, earlier. More wasteful is exploring already well-examined ground, and then previously found not worth any further resources. At the very least, needless research is a lost opportunity to make bioethics better.

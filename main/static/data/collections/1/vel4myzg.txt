We investigated learning curves for robotic suturing of expert and non-expert laparoscopic surgeons to explore the length of time required to reach an acceptable plateau of technical skills. Laparoscopic suturing skills were evaluated in a training box with conventional laparoscopic instrumentation in phase 1. In phase 2, robotic suturing skills were evaluated during a training program on non-surviving animals by analyzing time required for five intracorporal stitches on the small bowel. Learning curves were plotted. A significant difference in technical skills between the expert and non-expert surgeons was demonstrated in phase 1 and at the beginning of phase 2. Both surgeons reached a learning-curve plateau exhibiting similar robotic suturing skills at the end of 90 min of training. Skills were subsequently retained equally by both surgeons. Short duration of training was sufficient for the non-expert laparoscopic surgeon to match the robotic suturing performance of the expert laparoscopic surgeon.

PURPOSE The acromial and coracoid process morphology is of clinical relevance due to associations with functional limitations and shoulder pathology. Our objective was to describe the anatomical characteristics of the acromial and coracoid process using computed tomography (CT). METHODS Descriptive, observational, transversal and retrospective study. A total of 155 CT of patients without shoulder pathology, of both genders, and indistinct age were evaluated and grouped by age: Group 1 < 25 years; group 2 25-40 years; group 3 > 40 years. The following parameters were evaluated: Acromial type (AcT), vertical coracoid distance (VCD), acromial tilt (AT), acromial projection (AP), critical shoulder angle (CSA), type of the subcoracoid outlet (TSO), and the area of the subcoracoid outlet (ASO). RESULTS Statistically significant differences were found between men and women for VCD (14.44 ± 4.79 vs. 11.76 ± 4.00 mm; p < 0.001) and AP (3.66 ± 4.71 vs. 1.62 ± 4.99 mm; p < 0.05) as well as between age groups 1 and 3 for AT (35.08 ± 11.53 vs. 28.41 ± 6.60; p < 0.05) and ASO (398.99 ± 153.91 vs. 255.56 ± 124.58 mm2; p < 0.001). An unexpected high ASO variation was identified with 11% of S-shaped acromion and 1.3% clock-shaped TSO. CONCLUSION The age group between 25-40 years had the most uniform distribution of data. There is a high morphological variability present in an asymptomatic population, which should be considered in the clinical assessment such as shoulder impingement syndrome.

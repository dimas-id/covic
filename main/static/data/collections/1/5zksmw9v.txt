Minimally invasive pancreatic resections remain technically challenging. Distal pancreatectomy has been embraced at multiple centers as an acceptable minimally invasive technique in selected patients. In contrast, minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy has not achieved broad acceptance, partly due to technical challenges. We detail a minimally invasive technique that utilizes both laparoscopic and robotic approaches which capitalizes on the advantages of each. Our early results have encouraged the continued development of this minimally invasive pancreatic surgery program. This hybrid technique may be an approach that is useful for surgeons striving to adopt the advantages of minimally invasive surgery for their patients.

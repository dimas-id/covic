Abstract With a population of 35million people spread over a vast area, Canada is a highly decentralized federation. Provincial governments have most of the responsibility for the governance, organization and delivery of health services although the Government of Canada has an important role in maintaining high level standards for universal health coverage through the Canada Health Act as well as pharmaceutical regulation, health research and data collection. With 70% of total health spending financed by federal, provincial and territorial governments, most are used to provide universal access to hospital and physicians services as well as more targeted coverage for prescription drugs and long-term care. In the last decade, provincial and territorial governments have focused on reorganizing their regional delivery systems and improving the quality, timeliness and patient experience with acute, chronic care and primary care medical services. While Canada's system of universal coverage for Medicare has been effective in providing deep financial protection, the narrow scope of coverage has resulted in gaps in coverage and equitable access.

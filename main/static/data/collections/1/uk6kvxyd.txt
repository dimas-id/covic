The aim of this study was to examine association between IFNL4 gene ss469415590 and treatment efficiency in group of Ukrainian PEG-interferon/ribavirin-treated chronic hepatitis C patients. Study group consisted of 92 unrelated hepatitis C virus genotype 1 mono-infected patients: case group–29 patients with late or absent virological response; control group–63 patients with sustained virological response. Study material was genomic DNA. Genotyping was performed using amplification-refractory mutation system PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using GenePop and OpenEpi statistical packages. Obtained results show that ss469415590 ΔG/ΔG genotype is associated with poor virological response (OR = 3.62; CI 95%: 1.12–11.67) in PEG-interferon/ribavirin-treated chronic hepatitis C patients from Ukraine.

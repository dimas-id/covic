There is a fundamental difference between descriptive and performance indicators of a water use system. The former responds to the question “What is happening?”, and the latter focuses on the questions, such as “Does it matter? Are we reaching targets?” To answer these questions, we use efficiency as a performance indicator, which “helps us attain more of the things we value.” To this end, we employ the theory presented in the previous Chapter to develop systemic, comprehensive and objective performance indicators based on a universal principle integrating the differentials of the three Pillars of water management, namely water quantity, water quality and water benefit. They reveal trade-offs among the three Pillars at three levels of management with climate and energy descriptors and stakeholder enablers. The internal behaviour and the trade-offs of these Sefficiency indicators are explained and shown graphically.

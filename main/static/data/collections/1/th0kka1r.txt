Fifteen infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) isolated from broiler and broiler breeder flocks in Slovenia between 1990 and 2005 were molecularly characterised. IBV strains were divided into four genotypes by the analysis of the S1 gene region. Four strains belonged to the Massachusetts genotype, one strain was placed into the QX genotype, one strain formed a cluster together with the B1648 strain and nine strains were classified into the 624/I genotype. Nine Slovenian strains of the 624/I genotype formed two subgroups independently of the time of isolation and the geographical origin. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene sequences revealed lower sequence variability and different clustering of the Slovenian IBV. Fourteen strains were grouped together with the strains H120 and D1466. One strain formed a cluster with the strain 793/B.

The first description of the circulation of blood through the lungs has been attributed to Ibn Nafis (1210–1288).1 The concept was rediscovered by Michael Servetus, a Spanish physician during the Renaissance (1511–1553) and recorded, oddly enough, in two pages of his religious treatise, Christianismi Restitutio (1553).2 The definitive exposition of the pulmonary circulation was made by William Harvey in DeMotu Cordis (1628).3 The first observation of the pulmonary capillaries was first reported by Marcellus Malpighi (1661).4 Heart catheterization in humans, driven by a desire to obtain the perfect mixed venous specimen and measure cardiac output, was first performed in 1929 by the German urologist Forssmann,5 using a ureteral catheter to access his own right atrium. Over a decade later, Cournand and Richards at Columbia University in New York subsequently used right heart catheterization to record pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with shock and secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension (PHT). For these accomplishments, which were inspired by an interest in the pulmonary circulation and PHT related to mitral stenosis, Forssmann, Cournand, and Richards received the Nobel Prize in 1956.

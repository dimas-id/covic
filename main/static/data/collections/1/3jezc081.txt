BACKGROUND: In patients with hematological malignancies, febrile neutropenia (FEN) is the most frequent complication and the most important cause of mortality. Various risk factors have been identified for severe infection in neutropenic patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is not defined whether there is a change in the risk of febrile neutropenia according to seasons. The first aim of study was to determine the difference in frequency of febrile neutropenic episodes (FNEs) according to months and seasons. The second aim was to document isolated pathogens, as well as demographical and clinical characteristics of patients. METHODS: In the study, 194 FNEs of 105 patients who have been followed with hematological malignancies between June 2013 and May 2014 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Although the number of FNEs increased in autumn, there was no significant difference in frequency of FNEs between months (p = 0.564) and seasons (p = 0.345). There was no isolated pathogen in 54.6% of FNEs. In 45.4% of 194 FNEs, pathogens were isolated. Of all pathogens, 50.4% were gram negative bacteria, 29.2% were gram positive bacteria, 13.3% were viruses, 5.3% were fungi, and 1.8% were parasites. CONCLUSÄ°ONS: The frequency of FEN does not change according to months or seasons. Also, the relative proportions of different pathogens in the cause of FEN do not vary according to seasons.

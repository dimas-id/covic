OBJECTIVE To study the method for cultivation and inactivation of SARS-CoV. METHODS In order to choose the sensitive cell strain and the best infection dose of the virus, Vero, Vero-E6 and 2BS cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV. The cultivation temperature was selected among 25 degrees C, 33 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The best inactivating time and effect were observed with beta-propiolactone whose concentration ranged from 1:2000 to 1:20,000 at room temperature. RESULTS Vero and Vero-E6 cell lines were sensitive to SARS-CoV. The cytopathic changes of the cells were 75% at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 incubator after infection. SARS-CoV was inactivated completely in beta-propiolactone (1:4000). The toxicity of beta-propiolactone was hydrolyzed completely when the inactivated virus was cultured for 16 hours at 2 degrees C, 8 degrees C and in water bath for 2 hours at 37 degrees C. CONCLUSION The titer of SARS-CoV was the highest when it was cultured in Vero or Vero-E6 cells for 72 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 incubator. SARS-CoV was inactivated completely in beta-propiolactone when its concentration was 1:4000 and the interaction time was 1 hour.

Abstract This study reported cumulative 6-day (lag 0â€“5 days) relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) of daily outpatient visits for total respiratory disease (RD), asthma, and chronic airway obstruction not otherwise classified (CAO) associated with three ozone metrics (daily 1-h maximum (O3, 1 h max), 8-h average maximum (O3, 8 h max), 24-h average (O3, 24 h avg)), and an alternative oxidant indicator (Ox) in Taipei Metropolitan, using distributed lag non-linear models after controlling for potential confounders. The Ox showed the strongest association with outpatient visits for total RD (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.11) and asthma (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.39) in the cold season. The O3, 24 h avg appeared to be the optimal ozone metric associating with total RD than O3, 1 h max and O3, 8 h max based on model selection. In conclusion, outpatient visits for total RD associated with ozone vary with ozone metrics, disease and season.

Regarding limited availability of organ donors for heart transplantation, it is necessary to discuss optimal donor evaluation and donor management. In this manuscript general donor-related parameters as well as heart-specific parameters are discussed regarding international literature. In addition, "marginal" donors and in contrast "optimal" donors are defined. Donor management including optimal hemodynamic management and additional specific intensive care aspects are presented. Exact donor evaluation allows for matching the organ to the most suitable recipient and is therefore especially in the context of marginal donors a crucial step within transplantation process.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the gold standard treatment method of localized prostate cancer. Today, this surgery is performed with open or minimally invasive methods. The history of open perineal RP (RPP) is very old, but it is not often preferred by urologists. The use of robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RALP) is very frequently applied today. Robotic perineal RP (r-RPP) by using a Gel-Point and insufflating CO2 into the perineal region was first described in 2014. In this case report, we report a 68-year-old patient with localized prostate cancer in whom we successfully performed gasless r-RPP, and according to our knowledge, this is the first case of gasless r-RPP to be reported.

Epidemiology studies suggest that comorbid diabetes may have negative impact on the progression and severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first occurred in Wuhan. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. A recent study on another type of coronavirus infection, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), investigated its relationship with diabetes. This essay aims to give a brief introduction to this report and related studies, and to propose suggestions on what we can learn from these investigations to conduct further studies on the potential mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes mellitus on COVID-19.

Objective@#To investigate the first chest HRCT imaging manifestations infected with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).@*Method@#A retrospective analysis of the first chest HRCT images of 106 patients with NCP clinically diagnosed in our hospital from January 3 to 25, 2020. Lesion distribution, morphology and surrounding involvement were analyzed.@*Result@#Lesions were found in the first lung HRCT of 106 patients, with unilateral lung distribution in 11 cases (10.4%), bilateral lung distribution in 95 cases (89.6%), and peripheral distribution of lung in 65 cases (61.3%). 41 cases (38.7%) were distributed at the same time; 8 cases (7.5%) were 1 lesion, 5 cases (4.7%) were 2 lesions, 93 cases (87.8%) were multiple lesions, and 12 cases were nodular lesions (11.3%). 94 cases of ground-glass lesions (88.7%), 7 cases of cord-like lesions (6.6%), 15 cases (14.2%) of coexisting lesions of two or more forms; 10 cases (9.4%) involving one lung lobe There were 96 cases (90.6%) involving two or more lung lobes; 24 cases (22.6%) with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (19 cases over 60 years old, accounting for 79.2%); 3 cases with pleural effusion (2.8 %), 1 case had pericardial effusion (0.9%), and 2 cases had pleural involvement / thickening (1.9%). Patients over 60 years of age mostly present with multiple lesions, multiple morphology, peripheral and central distribution of lungs, involving multiple lung lobes, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.@*Conclusions@#Lung lesions of NCP patients can be detected for the first time by chest HRCT, which is the preferred imaging method. Thoracic HRCT scans play an important role in the early diagnosis of new coronavirus (NCP). .

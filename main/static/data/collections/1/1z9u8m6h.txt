BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Neuroendovascular surgery is a medical subspecialty that uses minimally invasive catheter-based technology and radiological imaging to diagnose and treat diseases of the central nervous system, head, neck, spine, and their vasculature. To perform these procedures, the practitioner needs an extensive knowledge of the anatomy of the nervous system, vasculature, and pathological conditions that affect their physiology. A working knowledge of radiation biology and safety is essential. Similarly, a sufficient volume of clinical and interventional experience, first as a trainee and then as a practitioner, is required so that these treatments can be delivered safely and effectively. METHODS This document has been prepared under the aegis of the Society of Neurological Surgeons and its Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training in conjunction with the Joint Section of Cerebrovascular Surgery for the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology. RESULTS The material herein outlines the requirements for institutional accreditation of training programs in neuroendovascular surgery, as well as those needed to obtain individual subspecialty certification, as agreed on by Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training, the Society of Neurological Surgeons, and the aforementioned Societies. This document also clarifies the pathway to certification through an advanced practice track mechanism for those current practitioners of this subspecialty who trained before Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training standards were formulated. CONCLUSIONS Representing neuroendovascular surgery physicians from neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and neurology, the above mentioned societies seek to standardize neuroendovascular surgery training to ensure the highest quality delivery of this subspecialty within the United States.

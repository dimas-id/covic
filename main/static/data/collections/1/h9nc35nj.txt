INTRODUCTION Since World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic, urology services have developed strategies to prioritize and not to differ urgent and oncological patient's medical attention, in order to optimize resources and decrease infection probability among staff and patients. This unprecedented situation has generated a decrease in assistance and academic activities in most medical residences. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the impact of this health crisis on training programs through a survey addressed to urology medical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cross sectional designed study, with multiple-choice non validated survey answered online by residents. Questionnaire was developed through the CAU EDUCACION platform. RESULTS A total of 148 responses from 18 countries coming from Latin America and Spain answering the survey. Of total, 82% answered that the activity of their urology department was significantly reduced, attending only urgent surgical pathologies, 15 % that, the urology activity has been closed completely and the staff was assigned to COVID-19 patients care, 3% continue with the regular clinic activity. Likewise, 75% stated that their surgical training has been completely affected, 93% receive urological information through tools such as Skype, ZOOM meeting, Cisco Webex, being Webinar modality the most used. Despite technological boom, 65% answered their academic training has been partially or completely affected. Most of the surveyed residents consider that period of residence should be extended to retrieve the educational targets. CONCLUSION This unprecedented reality is negatively impacting the heterogeneous residency programs that American Confederation of Urology (CAU) nucleates. It is necessary to continue with technological innovation and allocate time and resources to easily generate accessible tools to favor the training of future urologists.

Hypoxemic respiratory failure is usually accompanied with a certain extent of consolidation and alveolar derecruitment, which may still be present even after the patients have achieved the status of readiness to extubate. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is an indicator of lung aeration. This study aimed to evaluate whether pre-extubation FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We prospectively included 92 patients intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. We used a technique based on a nitrogen multiple breath washout method to measure FRC before the planned extubation. The median FRC before extubation was 25 mL/kg (Interquartile range, 20–32 mL/Kg) per predicted body weight (pBW). After extubation, 20 patients (21.7%) were reintubated within 48 hours. The median FRC was higher in the extubation success group than in the extubation failure group (27 versus 21 mL/Kg, p < 0.001). Reduced FRC was associated with higher risk of extubation failure (odds ratio, 1.14 per each decreased of 1 mL/Kg of FRC/pBW, 95% CI, 1.05–1.23, p = 0.002). In conclusion, pre-extubation FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure. Reduced FRC may be incorporated into the traditional risk factors to identify patients at high risk for extubation failure.

Isolated laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is increasingly being used for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, doubts still persist regarding long-term weight loss, and the 5-year results are awaited. Whether the aetiology of failed excess weight loss is the result of an inadequate sleeve or attributable to dilatation of the sleeve is not clear. In an effort to prevent gastric dilatation and increase gastric restriction to promote further weight loss in the long term, we performed a combined procedure of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with sleeve gastrectomy. The patient was a 39-year-old woman with a life-long history of obesity and a body mass index of 79.8 kg/m(2). The surgical technique of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded sleeve gastrectomy is described. There were no immediate complications, and the patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day. She is doing extremely well on clinic follow-up at 6 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded sleeve gastrectomy, as a primary operation, has not been described in the literature. It is hoped that this combined procedure will be most useful in the super-super obese (body mass index > 60) patients. More patients with a long-term follow-up are necessary to provide definitive conclusions regarding long-term benefits and complications of this combined bariatric procedure.

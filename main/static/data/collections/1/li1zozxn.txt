Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease of putatively autoimmune origin. Novel models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have demonstrated that T cells specific for various myelin and even nonmyelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. The encephalitogenic T cell response directed against different CNS antigens not only determines the lesional topography of CNS inflammation but also the composition of the inflammatory infiltrates. The heterogeneity of the lesional distribution seen in EAE might therefore be useful for the understanding of the various clinical subtypes seen in MS. In this review the possible candidate autoantigens in MS are discussed with special regard to the human T cell and B cell responses against various myelin and nonmyelin proteins.

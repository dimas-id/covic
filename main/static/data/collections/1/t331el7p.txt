Abstract An adenovirus (AV) group-specific latex agglutination test (LA) was assessed for its ability to detect AVs in faeces and to confirm the isolation of AVs in cell culture. It detected all of 62 strains belonging to subgenus F (AdF) but only 4 40 non-AdF serotypes. This is possibly due to the concentration of AdF strains in faeces being greater than non-AdF strains. No false positive reactions were found with 55 AV-negative faeces, 42 of which contained other viruses frequently found in faeces. Only one of the 157 specimens examined gave a non-specific reaction, i.e. test and control latexes both agglutinated. All of 14 AV isolates but none of the 12 isolates of other viruses were LA positive. It is concluded that LA would be useful for detecting AdF strain in faeces and for confirmation of AV isolates, especially if electron microscopic facilities were not available.

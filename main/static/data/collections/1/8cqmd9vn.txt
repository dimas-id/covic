The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-18 was originally discovered as an interferon-γ-inducing factor in 1995. IL-18 is known to play an important role in Th1/Tc1 polarization and promoting the production of Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13) by T cells, NK cells, basophils, and mast cells. IL-18 can act as a cofactor for Th2 cell development and IgE production, and also plays an important role in the differentiation of Th17 cells. IL-18 is a key player in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, Sjögren's syndrome, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Furthermore, many lines of evidence suggest that IL-18 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammatory diseases, including bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Here, we review the pathological roles of IL-18 in pulmonary inflammatory diseases.

The evolution of critical care and mechanical ventilation has been dramatic and rapid over the last 10 years and can be expected to continue at this pace into the future. As a result, the competencies of the respiratory therapist regarding mechanical ventilation in 2015 and beyond are expected to also markedly increase. Respiratory therapists are expected to be the experts on the mechanical ventilator and all aspects of the application of mechanical ventilation. They will be considered consultants on all aspect of ventilatory support. This requires an expanded education in a number of areas. To achieve these levels of competency, as recommended by the third "2015 and Beyond" conference, the entry level education of the respiratory therapist of the future must be at the baccalaureate level.

Abstract Purpose This study explored the factors influencing disaster response competency, that is, demographic and disaster-related characteristics, personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness, disaster risk perception, and self-efficacy in handling disasters among emergency medical technicians in South Korea. Methods The study follows a descriptive, cross-sectional design and uses a self-reported questionnaire. Emergency medical technicians, amounting to 1,020 in all, currently working in firefighting organizations from four South Korean cities (Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, and Ulsan) participated in the study. Results Disaster risk perception, self-efficacy for disaster, participation experience in disaster education/training, and personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness predicted the disaster response competency of emergency medical technicians in South Korea. Conclusion There is a need for an antidisaster program to enhance the disaster risk perception, self-efficacy, personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness, and the disaster education/training participation rate toward enhancing disaster response competency of emergency medical technicians in South Korea.

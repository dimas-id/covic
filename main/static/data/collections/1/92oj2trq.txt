The goal of molecular simulation stability is to predict the detailed structure and physical properties of molecules in bioengineer's experiment curriculum. This work succeeds in citing minimum energy and some computer graphics technologies to support this theme. Molecular structure is that given the uncountable number of possible conformations for a protein, how we can determine the lowest energy structure. In this article the authors employed the previous researches‐WebDeGrator and some existing molecular graphics tools to simulate various protein folding, ligand acceptor interaction, and molecular visualization. For this reason, bioengineer experimental curriculum will be visualization and interactive among learning members. Finally, Simpson's Taxonomy and pre‐ and post‐test examinations are applied to System Evaluation, and molecular simulation and minimum energy will be discussed. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

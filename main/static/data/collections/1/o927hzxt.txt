In accordance with the tension-free principles for other hernias, umbilical and epigastric hernia repair should probably be mesh-based. The number of randomized studies is increasing, most of them showing significantly less recurrences with the use of a mesh. Different devices are available and are applicable by several approaches. The objective of this review was to evaluate recent literature for the different types of mesh for umbilical and epigastric hernia repair and recurrences after mesh repair. A multi-database search was conducted to reveal relevant studies since 2001 reporting mesh-based repair of primary umbilical/epigastric hernia and their outcomes in adult patients. A total of 20 studies were included, 15 of them solely involved umbilical hernias, whereas the remaining studies included epigastric hernias as well. A median of 124 patients (range, 17-384) was investigated per study. Three quarters of the included studies had a follow-up of at least 2 years. Six studies described the results of laparoscopic approach, of which one reported a recurrence rate of 2.7 %; in the remaining studies, no recurrences occurred. Two comparative studies reported a lower incidence of complications and postoperative pain after laparoscopic repair compared to open repair. Seventeen studies reported results of open techniques, of which seven studies showed no recurrence. Other studies reported recurrence rates up to 3.1 %. A wide range of complication rates were reported (0-33 %). This collective review showed acceptable recurrence rates for mesh-based umbilical and epigastric hernia repair. A wide range of devices was investigated. A tendency toward more complications after laparoscopic repair was found compared to open repair.

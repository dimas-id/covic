BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested increased arrhythmic and cardiovascular risk with the combination use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: The arrhythmic safety profile of HCQ monotherapy, which remains under investigation as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent in COVID-19, is less established and we sought to evaluate this. METHODS: In 245 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the University of Washington hospital system between March 9 and May 10, 2020, we identified 111 treated with HCQ monotherapy. Patients treated with HCQ underwent a systematic arrhythmia and QT interval surveillance protocol including serial electrocardiograms (ECG) (baseline, following second HCQ dose). The primary endpoint was in-hospital sustained ventricular arrhythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. Secondary endpoints included clinically significant QTc prolongation. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients with COVID-19 underwent treatment with HCQ monotherapy (mean age 62Â±16 years, 44 women [39%], serum creatinine 0.9 [interquartile range 0.4] mg/dL). There were no instances of sustained ventricular arrythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. In 75 patients with serial ECGs, clinically significant QTc prolongation was observed in a minority (N=5 [7%]). In patients with serial ECGs, there was no significant change in the QTc interval in pre-specified subgroups of interest, including those with prevalent cardiovascular disease or baseline use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis inhibitors. CONCLUSION: In the context of a systematic monitoring protocol, HCQ monotherapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was not associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. A minority of patients demonstrated clinically significant QTc prolongation during HCQ therapy.

In January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 an epidemic in China and the possibility of evolving into a pandemic During early phases, most emergency departments did not have contingency plans for an outbreak of this scale and therefore necessitating adequate preparation This study aims to describe the utility of in situ simulation in identifying system errors and latent safety hazards in response to preparation for the expected COVID-19 surge We also aim to describe the corrective measures taken to improve our outbreak response locally We hope that others may be able to use this information as foresight in preparing their own departments for this outbreak The emergency department and anesthesiology department of Galway University Hospital conducted a series of multidisciplinary, in situ simulations to rapidly identify operational errors and latent safety hazards in response to this outbreak Each simulation involved an interdisciplinary response to a suspected/COVID-19 patient The cases were used as a training opportunity for staff and ultimately a platform to expeditiously implement system changes in response to deficits identified during the simulations Conclusively, with the complexities and intricate structure of every emergency department, we understood that preparation for an outbreak requires evaluation of the current system before implementing any changes It is not a "one size fits all" concept Therefore, conducting in situ simulations and the use of foresight, is pivotal as it could prevent loss of resources and time in preparing for an outbreak

Adult-onset Stillâ€™s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by quotidian or double quotidian fever, a peri-febrile cutaneous eruption, polyarthritis, and multiorgan involvement. AOSD is a challenging disease with protean disease manifestations and rare, albeit potentially life-threatening, complications. In such cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment may prove life-saving. The purpose of this chapter is to review the diagnosis and management of challenging clinical situations in AOSD patients that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and to provide the readers with information that could aid their decision-making process.

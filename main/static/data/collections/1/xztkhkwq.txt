Cardiac disease is increasingly diagnosed in pet rabbits, presumably because of their lengthening life span and the increased sophistication of their veterinary care. However, relatively little is known about the origins of and therapy for cardiac disease in pet rabbits. Dyspnea, murmurs, and arrhythmias are common clinical signs in rabbits with cardiac disease. However, rabbits with congestive heart failure may hide signs of illness until the disease has become severe. Unique physiologic characteristics (e.g., obligate nasal breathing and limited collateral circulation to the myocardium) predispose rabbits to collapse from stress and oxygen deprivation; therefore, oxygen supplementation and stabilization are priorities for the rabbit presenting in cardiorespiratory distress. The diagnostic workup for cardiac disease in rabbits is very similar to that for traditional pets and involves radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Cardiomyopathy and valvular degeneration are relatively common forms of cardiac disease in rabbits, while congenital anomalies are rare. Use and dosing of therapeutic agents is extrapolated from dogs and cats. Spontaneous arteriosclerosis is prevalent in rabbits, with an historical incidence of up to 40% in large breeds.

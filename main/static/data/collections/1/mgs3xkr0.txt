Corona virus disease (COVID-19) emerged as an epidemic from China, with quick spread globally. The disease can lead to serious problems, like pneumonia or even death especially among vulnerable people with existing health conditions. Its treatment and management require huge efforts from medical professionals often at the cost of their own health and life. Nutrition is the epicenter for the management of such diseases which works synergistically with the medical treatment for quick and better recovery. It has been associated with great human and economic toll and it is still not contained. Currently over two million people are affected and over 300,000 deaths globally. However, due to its newness and unfamiliarity, the understanding of this novel virus is still evolving. This viral infection poses numerous metabolic challenges to those severely affected and addressing them is a key to better outcomes. Medical nutritional therapy is thus among the mainstay of core components of comprehensive treatment measures for patients with COVID-19. This manuscript therefore aims to highlight the role of nutritional management and support in covid-19 disease.

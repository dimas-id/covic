Abstract Interaction of a single dose (36 mg/kg body wt) of the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin with mouse peritoneal macrophages was examined in C57Bl 6 , ( C57Bl 6 × A J )F1 , and A J strains of different genetic resistance to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection. In vivo studies showed increased susceptibility to MHV3 acute disease of C57Bl 6 and ( C57Bl 6 × A J )F1 animals challenged with the pesticide. Significant decrease of mean time of death in dieldrin-exposed, MHV3-infected susceptible C57Bl 6 mice was observed similarly upon po or ip administration of a single, sublethal dose of dieldrin. In addition, decrease of humoral response to the virus was quantified by determination of anti-MHV3 IgG antibodies in spleen cell supernatant fractions and in blood sera of dieldrin-exposed C57Bl 6 mice. A single dose of dieldrin did not alter the in vivo resistance of A J animals to acute MHV3 disease. The resistant A J mice, however, showed increased mortality upon two subsequent exposures to dieldrin followed by infection with high lethal doses of MHV3. Phagocytic activity, cell adherence capacity, and attachment and uptake of 3H-radiolabeled MHV3 by C57Bl 6 peritoneal macrophages were determined by in vitro studies. These affector activities of peritoneal macrophages were slightly decreased or unchanged in cells originating from animals exposed to the pesticide. However, the intrinsic activity of MHV3 restriction appeared to be affected in macrophages derived from dieldrin-treated animals: (i) peritoneal C57Bl 6 macrophages collected from the early phase of acute MHV3 disease contained increased MHV3 antigen and (ii) increased cytolysis was observed after in vitro MHV3 infection of macrophages originating from dieldrin-exposed C57Bl 6 mice.

BACKGROUND: The many economic, psychological, and social consequences of pandemics and social distancing measures create an urgent need to determine the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and especially those considered most stringent, such as stay-at-home and self-isolation mandates. This study focuses specifically on the efficacy of stay-at-home orders, both nationally and internationally, in the control of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational analysis from April to May 2020 and included countries and US states with known stay-at-home orders. Our primary exposure was the time between the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 to an implemented stay-at-home mandate for each region. Our primary outcomes were the time from the first reported case to the highest number of daily cases and daily deaths. We conducted simple linear regression analyses, controlling for the case rate of the outbreak. RESULTS: For US states and countries, a larger number of days between the first reported case and stay-at-home mandates was associated with a longer time to reach the peak daily case and death counts. The largest effect was among regions classified as the latest 10% to implement a mandate, which in the US, predicted an extra 35.3 days to the peak number of cases (95 % CI: 18.2, 52.5), and 38.3 days to the peak number of deaths (95 % CI: 23.6, 53.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the potential beneficial effect of earlier stay-at-home mandates, by shortening the time to peak case and death counts for US states and countries. Regions in which mandates were implemented late experienced a prolonged duration to reaching both peak daily case and death counts.

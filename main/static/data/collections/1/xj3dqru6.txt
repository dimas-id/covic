Patients with chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1 (CEAS) develop multiple circular, longitudinal, or eccentric ulcers in the ileum. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish CEAS from Crohn's disease. CEAS and primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO) are together known to be caused by a mutation of SLCO2A1 gene. The case of a 65-year-old man whose characteristic appearance due to pachydermia of the forehead folds led to the diagnosis of CEAS with PHO is presented.

Patients with immunodeficiencies or some types of autoimmune diseases are dependent on safe therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. State-of-the-art manufacturing processes provide a high safety standard by incorporating virus elimination procedures into the manufacturing process. Based on their mechanism, these procedures are grouped into three classes: partitioning, inactivation, and removal based on size. Because of current socioeconomic and ecological changes, emerging pathogens continue to be expected. Such pathogens may spread very quickly because of increased intercontinental traffic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and the West Nile virus are recent examples. Currently, it is not possible to predict the impact such a pathogen will have on blood safety because the capacity for a globally coordinated reaction to such a threat is also evolving. The worst-case scenario would be the emergence of a transmissible, small, nonenveloped virus in the blood donor population. Examples of small nonenveloped viruses, which change host and tissue tropism, are discussed, with focus on parvoviridae. Although todayâ€™s immunoglobulins are safer than ever, in preparation for future challenges it is a high priority for the plasma industry to proactively investigate such viruses on a molecular and cellular level to identify their vulnerabilities.

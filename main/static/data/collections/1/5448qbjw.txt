Pericytes, as a key cellular part of the blood-brain barrier, play an important role in the maintenance of brain neurovascular unit. These cells participate in brain homeostasis by regulating vascular development and integrity mainly through secreting various factors. Pericytes per se show different restorative properties after blood-brain barrier injury. Upon the occurrence of brain acute and chronic diseases, pericytes provoke immune cells to regulate neuro-inflammatory conditions. Loss of pericytes in distinct neurologic disorders intensifies blood-brain barrier permeability and leads to vascular dementia. The therapeutic potential of pericytes is originated from the unique morphological shape, location, and their ability in providing vast paracrine and juxtacrine interactions. A subset of pericytes possesses multipotentiality and exhibit trans-differentiation capacity in the context of damaged tissue. This review article aimed to highlight the critical role of pericytes in restoration of the blood-brain barrier after injury by focusing on the dynamics of pericytes and cross-talk with other cell types.

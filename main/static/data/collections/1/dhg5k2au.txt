Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as an entry receptor. Mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) does not support MERS-CoV entry; however, changes at positions 288 and 330 can confer permissivity. Position 330 changes the charge and glycosylation state of mDPP4. We show that glycosylation is a major factor impacting DPP4 receptor function. These results provide insight into DPP4 species-specific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range and may inform MERS-CoV mouse model development.

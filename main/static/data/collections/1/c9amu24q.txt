Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a neurologic disease of psittacine birds suspected to be caused by a recently identified Avian bornavirus (ABV). In the current report, data supporting the causal association of ABV with PDD are presented. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against ABV nucleocapsid protein was used to identify cell and organ distribution of viral antigen. The ABV antigen was most consistently detected in brain, spinal cord, adrenal gland, pancreas, and kidney. Histopathologic evaluation was correlated with ABV-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical tests in multiple tissues from 16 psittacine birds with and without PDD. Using histopathologic diagnosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of IHC for ABV antigens were found to be 100% and 100%, respectively. Many more tissues were positive for ABV RNA by reverse transcription PCR than were positive for pathologic changes or viral antigens by IHC, indicating the presence of subclinical or asymptomatic infection at many sites.

Several known trans-splicing RNA structures were used to define a canonical trans-splicing structure which was then used to perform a computer search of the EMBL nucleotide database. In addition to most known trans-splicing structures, many putative new trans-splicing sites were detected. These were found in a broad range of organisms including the vertebrates. Control experiments indicate that the search predicts known false positives at a rate of only 20%. Trans-splicing may therefore be a very wide-spread phenomenon.

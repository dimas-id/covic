Abstract Objective: Aim of this study was to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and laboratory findings and outcome of neurological patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary hub center. Methods: All adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED for neurological manifestations from February 20 th through April 30 th 2020 at Spedali Civili of Brescia entered the study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between patients with and without COVID-19. Results: Out of 505 consecutively patients evaluated at ED with neurological symptoms, 147 (29.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These patients displayed at triage higher values of CRP, AST, ALT, and fibrinogen but not lymphopenia (p<0.05). They were older (73.1 + 12.4 vs 65.1 + 18.9 years, p=0.001) had higher frequency of stroke (34.7% vs 29.3%), encephalitis/meningitis (9.5% vs 1.9%) and delirium (16.3% vs 5.0%). Compared to patients without COVID, they were more frequently hospitalized (91.2% vs 69.3%, p<0.0001) and showed higher mortality rates (29.7% vs 1.8%, p<0.0.001) and discharge disability, independently from age. Conclusions: COVID-19 impacts on clinical presentation of neurological disorders, with higher frequency of stroke, encephalitis and delirium, and was strongly associated with increased hospitalisation, mortality and disability.

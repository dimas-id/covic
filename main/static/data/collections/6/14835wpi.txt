Total thoracoscopic segmentectomy is an appealing concept in terms of providing a parenchyma-sparing treatment. We describe our technique of two seperate total thoracoscopic segmentectomies by using a vessel sealing system (VSS). A 76-year old female with four gradually enlarging ground glass lesions on the right segment 2 (10 and 3 mm) and segment 6 (8 and 3 mm) was admitted to our institute for surgical diagnosis and treatment. Preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography showed that the A2 is composed of descending A2 and ascending A2, branch of V6 coursed to V2 and B1a originated from B2 and B1b from B3. Two separate segmentectomies were subsequently scheduled. Pulmonary vessel division was performed with VSS after proximal ligation. Intersegmental division by VSS and electrocautery was performed with the use of inflation-deflation demarcation line and the pulmonary veins along the intersegmental plane (V2a and V2c for segment 2 and V6b and V6c for segment 6) as guides to confirm the intersegmental plane after pulmonary artery and bronchial divisions. The intraoperative frozen-section examinations revealed adenocarcinoma in situ. Two separate segmentectomies were successfully completed, with a total operative time of 240 min and blood loss of 30 ml. VSS is a very useful and safe device for intersegmental division and pulmonary vessel division.

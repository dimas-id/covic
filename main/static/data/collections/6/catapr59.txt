Epidemiological mathematical models and time series models can be used to forecast about the spread of an infectious disease. In this article, without using such models, we are going to show how exactly the pattern evolves day by day once a pattern is seen to be approximately followed by the data. Although in Italy as well as in India the novel corona virus appeared on the same day, in Italy the spread is nearly logarithmic by now and in India it is nearly exponential even now.

Abstract Objective Describe the epidemiological and clinical pattern of Bordetella pertussis infection (whooping cough) among hospitalised infants less than one year-old in a paediatric hospital in Gran Canaria. Patients and methods A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. Results A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 and 425.0 cases per 100000 infants <12 months old, with 2 peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (p <.05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. Conclusions The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.

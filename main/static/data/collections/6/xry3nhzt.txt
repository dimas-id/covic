Among patients hospitalized for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), between 10 and 14% develop an acute kidney injury and around half display marked proteinuria and haematuria. Post-mortem analyses of COVID-19 kidney tissue suggest that renal tubular cells and podocytes are affected. Here we report two cases of collapsing glomerulopathy and tubulointerstitial lesions in living COVID-19 patients. Despite our use of sensitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques in this study, we failed to detect the virus in blood, urine and kidney tissues. Our observations suggest that these kidney lesions are probably not due to direct infection of the kidney by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

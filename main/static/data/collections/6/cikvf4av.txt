PURPOSE A valved ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (V-P shunt) as a vesico-amniotic shunt (V-A shunt) preserves the filling/emptying cycle and normal bladder development in fetal lambs with bladder outlet obstruction. The optimal pressure for such shunts is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS We created obstructive uropathy in 60-day gestation fetal lambs. A V-A shunt was placed 3 weeks later, using a low-pressure (Group L: 15-54 mmH2O) or a high-pressure (Group H: 95-150 mmH2O) V-P shunt. We included non-shunted (obstructive uropathy, Group O) and control lambs (Group C). All were delivered at 130 days. Bladder volumes, bladder thickness, renal and bladder histology were compared. RESULTS Seventeen lambs had an obstructive uropathy created. Five Group L (four survived), four Group H (three survived) and five Group O survived. Body weight and crown-to-rump lengths of the three groups were not significantly different. Group H lambs had a dilated urachus, urinary ascites and severe ureteral dilatation similar to Group O lambs. There were four Group C lambs. Bladder volume was 10, 15 and 1,150 ml in Group H, 115 ± 67.9 ml in Group L, 128 ± 99.8 ml in Group O and 24.5 ± 3.84 ml in Group C. Unlike Group O lambs, Group L did not have urinary ascites, urinomas or renal dysplasia. CONCLUSION Low-pressure shunts preserved both bladder volume and renal development. High-pressure shunts did neither.

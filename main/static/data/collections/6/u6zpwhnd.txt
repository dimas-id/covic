COVID-19 is a new zoonotic disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus Since its emergence in Wuhan City, China, the virus has rapidly spread across the globe causing calamitous health, economic and societal consequences It causes disproportionately severe disease in the elderly and those with co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes There is currently no proven treatment for COVID-19 and a safe and effective vaccine is at least a year away The virus gains access to the respiratory epithelium through cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus is unlikely to mutate without loss of pathogenicity and thus represents an attractive target for antiviral treatment Inhaled modified recombinant human ACE2, may bind SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate lung damage This decoy strategy is unlikely to provoke an adverse immune response and may reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups

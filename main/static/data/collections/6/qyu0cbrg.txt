Photonic crystals (PCs) are periodic dielectric structures that have a band-gap that forbids propagation of a certain range of wavelengths of light. This property enables control of light with remarkable facility by modification of the band-gaps and produce effects that are impossible with conventional optics. Using chemically functionalized PCs, where the chemical functional group consists of amine and carboxyl group, in conjunction with a biomolecular probe material, the detection of pathogens and viral disease is possible, indicated by the shift in wavelength signal. Moreover, this system using the bioinspired PCs allows specific target detection in biosensor chip fields through control of the PCs. In this study, we demonstrated that two bacterial pathogens (Fusobacterium necrophorum and Acinetobacter baumannii) causing sepsis were detected by DNA-probe hybridization and a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was detected by antigen-antibody interaction using the functional PCs. Optical readout with the integrated sensor detecting the signals from PCs, allows for low cost and robust readout of resonance peak shift. This biosensor system using the functional PCs on the photonic crystal-fabricated chip can efficiently and effectively detect various targets, and be easily prepared with high productivity and economic property.

True splenic artery aneurysms (SAA) are a rare, but potentially fatal, pathology. They are the third most common type of abdominal aneurysm, after aneurysms of the aorta and of the iliac artery, and account for almost the all aneurysms of visceral arteries. True aneurysms account for 60% of SAA and affect four times as many women as men, generally related to increased incidental or symptomatic findings that coincide with use of ultrasonography in pregnancy. Among pregnant patients, mortality after rupture is 65-75%, with fetal mortality exceeding 90%. There are multiple etiologies and it is believed that hormonal influences and changes in portal flow during gestation play an important role in development of SAA. This review discusses their history, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis and current treatment techniques.

Abstract Sweet leaf, Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, is a perennial plant species widely known for its sweet-tastingent-kaurene type diterpenoid glycosides (steviol glucosides). Steviol glucosides include rubusoside (Ru), stevioside (Ste), and rebaudioside (Reb), which have immunomodulatory capability and protective effects against hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammation, tumors, and diarrhea. In addition, they can enhance the solubility of epotoside, liquiritin, paclitaxel, curcuminoids, quercetin, and wheat bran flavonoids, thus increasing their permeability. The hydrolysis of three glucosyl groups at positions C13 and C19 of Ste will produce steviolbioside, steviol, isosteviol, steviol mono-glucoside, or Ru. S. rebaudiana contains these hydrolyzed products in trace amounts. This chapter describes recent advances in the preparation of various steviol glycosides from Ste by using different β-glycosidases, with particular focus on their potential industrial applications as natural solubilizers of insoluble compounds. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism of β-glycosidases and their kinetic properties are summarized.

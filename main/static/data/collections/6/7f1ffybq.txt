Introduction-Timely diagnosis is essential for the containment of the disease and breaks in the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The present situation demands countries to scale up their testing and design innovative strategies to conserve diagnostic kits and reagents. The pooling of samples saves time, manpower, and most importantly diagnostic kits and reagents. In the present study, we tried to define the pool size that could be applied with acceptable confidence for testing. Material and methods- We used repeatedly tested positive clinical sample elutes having different levels of SARS CoV 2 RNA and negative sample elutes to prepare seven series of 11 pools each, having pool sizes ranging from 2 to 48 samples to estimate the optimal pool size. Each pool had one positive sample elute in different compositions. All the pools were tested by SARS CoV 2 RT-qPCR. Results- Out of the 77 pools, only 53 (68.8%) were found positive. The sensitivity of pools of 2 to 48 samples was decreased from 100% (95% CL; 98.4-100) to 41.41% (95% CL; 34.9-48.1). The maximum size of the pool with acceptable sensitivity (>95%) was found to be of 6 samples. For the pool size of 6 samples, the sensitivity was 97.8% and the efficiency of pooling was 0.38. Conclusion- The pooling of samples is a practical way for scaling up testing and ultimately containing the further spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A patient undergoing general anaesthesia for neurosurgery exhibited an unexpected sudden decrease in the BiSpectral Index (BIS) value to near-zero. This prompted the detection of profound hypotension using non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement and expedited urgent assessment and treatment, with the patient making a full recovery. Widely regarded as a 'depth of anaesthesia' monitor, this case demonstrates the potential extra clinical benefit BIS may have in the detection of critical incidents such as anaphylaxis during general anaesthesia.

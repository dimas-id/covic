SETTING: This paper documents a participatory process of Health Portfolio staff in the design of a clock, and announces the 2020 Canadian Health Clock, with links to numerous online health calculators. The clock is part of the Health Portfolio’s celebration activities in 2019 of “100 Years of Health”, as the Department of Health was established in Canada in 1919. INTERVENTION: The intervention was the development of a clock on the Government of Canada website with linkage to calculators as a health promotion tool. The clock was built on the concept of the 2004 Chronic Disease Clock, which shows the number of deaths so far today, and so far this year. The clock was developed using a consultative approach, following a review of the original clock. OUTCOMES: The 2020 clock incorporates new data visualization concepts. New features, facilitated by improved technology, include: expansion to all causes of death; blinking red dots to enhance visual impact; and three clock versions (analogue, featuring a moving circle; digital, table format; and graphical, bar chart format). The clock also provides links to a number of health calculators, to allow people to seek personalized information to improve their health. IMPLICATIONS: The online health clock and health calculators are good examples of innovation in health risk communication tools for effective knowledge translation and dissemination. They inform people about health statistics (clock) and their health (calculators). The clock engages people in the context of the Canadian population, whereas the calculators provide personalized information about improving an individual’s future health.

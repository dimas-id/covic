Artificial oxygen carriers are not blood substitutes. They serve to carry oxygen to tissues and are either hemoglobin based or perfluorocarbon based. Driving the development of artificial oxygen carriers are concerns involving both the safety and quantity of the blood supply. No artificial oxygen carriers are currently approved for clinical use in the United States. Hemopure has been approved for use in South Africa. The companies producing Hemopure and PolyHeme, both of which are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, have filed a Biologic License Application in the United States. Phase III trials have been completed for Hemopure, while PolyHeme is currently undergoing phase III trials in the PolyHeme Urban Ambulance Trial. No North American trials are under way for perfluorocarbons.

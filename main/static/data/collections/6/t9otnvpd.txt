RATIONALE Late-onset bronchopleural fistula (BPF) induced by chemotherapy after lobectomy for lung cancer is rarely reported, lacking reliable preventive approaches. A timely identification and individualized treatment is essential for prognosis. PATIENT CONCERNS A 52-year-old female patient complained of fever, productive cough, and fatigue 1 week after adjuvant chemotherapy following right lower lobectomy and systemic mediastinal lymph node dissection. Chest computed tomography (CT) indicated pneumothorax and thick-walled empyema cavity within her right-sided thorax. DIAGNOSES The patient was diagnosed as late-onset BPF based on clinical manifestation and chest radiography. INTERVENTIONS In addition to antibiotics, a chest tube was reinserted under CT guidance, and vacuum suction was utilized for continuous drainage. Next cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy was terminated. OUTCOMES The empyema cavity was gradually closed in 1 month after conservative treatment, and the patient survived with good condition up to now. LESSONS Late-onset BPF should be kept in mind when the patient suffered from productive cough and chills during postoperative chemotherapy. And a prompt conservative management might be effective.

Abstract Virus-induced modulation of mouse cerebral endothelial cell class I and class II antigens by the neurotropic coronavirus, MHV-4 (JHM), was examined by flow cytometry. In susceptible BALB/c, H-2Kd was downregulated, while H-2Dd was upregulated following infection by MHV-4. In contrast, H-2K and H-2D antigens were both upregulated in either MHV-4-susceptible B10.S and (BALB/c Ã— SJL) F1, or MHV-4-resistant SJL-derived cerebral endothelial cells following infection with this virus. Class II antigen expression was unchanged following MHV-4 infection. Virus-induced MHC class I modulation is genetically regulated, and may influence virus clearance by class I-dependent CTL.

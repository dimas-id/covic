Abstract The social, economic and political consequences of emerging infectious disease (EID) may escape the sphere in which they first arise. In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs.

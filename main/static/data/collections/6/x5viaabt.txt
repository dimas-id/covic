Earlier definitions of status epilepticus (SE) were based on the duration of seizures, but newer definitions rely more on a pragmatic staging based on treatment failures (Table 23.1). Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is defined as SE that continues despite administration of both benzodiazepines and an appropriately dosed second-line antiseizure drug. Depending on the semiology of the seizures and comorbidities of the patient, this stage may be treated with further antiseizure drugs or anesthesia. When seizures recur upon weaning the anesthetic agent, typically after 24 h of seizure suppression, or in the rare cases where seizure control cannot be achieved with anesthesia, status epilepticus is considered to be super refractory (SRSE). The incidence of status epilepticus has been increasing, from 3.5 to 12.5/100,000 population between 1979 and 2010. During this time hospital mortality has not changed [1].

A shelter for trafficked women has unique infection control needs that require a comprehensive infection control plan, balancing the needs of infection prevention with respect for the vulnerable population served. Using a trauma‐informed model and evidence from infection control in other shelter settings, a group of senior baccalaureate students developed a program in a short‐term shelter for commercially sexually exploited individuals that included a written infection control manual, policies and procedures, and staff training. This partnership between academia and a nonprofit agency was an experiential service learning project in the domain of public health nursing, allowing students the opportunity to apply evidence toward a sustainable intervention for the agency.

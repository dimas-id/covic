Most patients with COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), display neurological symptoms, and respiratory failure in certain cases could be of extra-pulmonary origin. Hypothalamic neural circuits play key roles in sex differences, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and aging, all risk factors for severe COVID-19, besides being connected to olfactory/gustative and brainstem cardiorespiratory centers. Here, human brain gene-expression analyses and immunohistochemistry reveal that the hypothalamus and associated regions express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane proteinase, serine 2, which mediate SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, in correlation with genes or pathways involved in physiological functions or viral pathogenesis. A post-mortem patient brain shows viral invasion and replication in both the olfactory bulb and the hypothalamus, while animal studies indicate that sex hormones and metabolic diseases influence this susceptibility.

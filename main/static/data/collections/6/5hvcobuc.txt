Case summary A 2.5-year-old Bengal queen was admitted with a 12-h history of a mass protruding from the vulva during labor. At that time, three healthy kittens had already been delivered. Physical examination identified the mass as a portion of the uterus that was eviscerated without eversion of the mucosa. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a vaginal vault rupture with a large portion of the uterus herniated through the tear and eviscerated through the vulva. Ovariohysterectomy was performed, and a dead fetus was removed with the uterus. Reconstruction of the vaginal rupture required careful dissection and urethral catheterization. The queen recovered without complications. Relevance and novel information Uterine evisceration through a vaginal tear is a very rare condition that sometimes is erroneously referred to as 'prolapse'. Uterine prolapse and uterine evisceration may have similar presenting signs; however, proper identification and surgical correction is key when the uterus is eviscerated. This case highlights the importance of differentiating these two conditions and of rapid identification and surgical intervention for successful patient survival.

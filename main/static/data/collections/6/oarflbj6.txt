The world is facing a viral pandemic of a new coronavirus called COVID‐19. Pentoxifylline is a methyl‐xanthine and it inhibits phosphodiesterase IV (PDE IV). This drug is known for its unique features as an immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory agent, also it could have antiviral affects. This is a scoping review, in which all related articles on COVID‐19 and the probable benefits of Pentoxifylline against COVID‐19 pathogenesis, in Medline, Scopus, Web of Sciences and Google Scholar up to March 20, 2020 with proper keywords including: pentoxifylline, Pentoxil, COVID‐19, coronavirus, treatment, anti‐inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti‐fibrosis, oxygenation, circulation, bronchodilator, ARDS and organ failure. We found many confirmatory data on proper efficacy of pentoxifylline n controlling COVID‐19 and its consequences. The antiviral, anti‐inflammatory, anti‐oxidative, immune‐modulatory, bronchodilator and respiratory supportive effects and protective roles in organ failures of PTX, along with its main functions means better circulation‐oxygenation properties, low price and safety, make it a promising drug to be considered for covid‐19 treatment, especially as an adjuvant therapy in combination with other drugs.

Abstract Continued improvements in vaccination technologies have led to remarkable progress in the control of human infectious diseases. Our fundamental view of the nature of a vaccine was changed with the discovery of DNA immunization in the early 1990s when it was determined that the genetic material that encodes for antigens, rather than the actual antigens themselves, can be effective in eliciting an immune response. Given the ever increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for bioterrorism purposes, the opportunities that DNA vaccine technology provides could not have come at a more critical time in history. Since its inception, DNA vaccination technology has undergone significant advancements and many candidate human vaccine formulations have already been developed. Improved modes of administration, the use of codon and antigen gene optimization, and the implementation of vaccination DNA prime/boost regimens have led to the quick progression of DNA vaccines from research laboratory benches to human clinical trials. Significant progress has been made in developing DNA vaccines against various biodefense and emerging infectious disease targets, such as HIV-1, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola, the viral encephalitides, anthrax, plague, and botulism, among others with some already moving into early phase clinical trials with promising results. Having the ability to respond to a potential bioterrorism threat or to some other emerging infectious disease outbreak is crucial and the advancements associated with DNA vaccination technology will allow us to do so in a prompt and rational matter.

2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a highly pathogenic human CoV that first emerged in Wuhan in 2019.2019-nCoV has a zoonotic origin and poses a major threat to public health.However, little is known about the viral factors contributing to the high virulence of 2019-nCoV.Many animal viruses, including CoVs, encode proteins that interfere with host gene expression, including those involved in antiviral immune responses, and these viral proteins are often major virulence factors.Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known respiratory pathogens associated with a range of respiratory infection.In the past 17 years, the onset of 2019-nCoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have thrust HCoVs into spotlight of the research community due to their high pathogenicity in humans.The recent study of HCoVs-host interactions has contributed extensively to our understanding of infection pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV.This review discuss various host physiopathologic mechanism, such as apoptosis, innate immunity, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x03BA;B) pathway that may be modulated by HCoVs and provides evidence for the intensive investigate of 2019-nCoV infection.

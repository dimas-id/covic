Since the first demonstration in 1971 that solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) could be used for the quantitative determination of antigens and antibodies, this method has been widely applied in serodiagnosis of parasitic and infectious diseases. In addition to the classic ELISA variants using antigen or antibody to coat the plastic plates, there has recently been growing interest in the application of fixed-cell ELISA to research and diagnostic work on viral diseases. The authors discuss the development and applications of this technique to basic research and diagnosis of transmissible gastroenteritis, a highly contagious disease of swine. The success of this technique, as the name suggests, is largely due to the use of a suitable fixative, which preserves the antigenicity of the neo-synthesised viral proteins, and the presence of optimal conditions for viral antigen synthesis. In addition, various parameters are optimised, and this is discussed with reference to transmissible gastroenteritis virus. These parameters would help veterinarians and research workers to develop this technique in their own laboratories.

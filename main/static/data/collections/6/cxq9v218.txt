We developed a set of three real-time reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays that amplify three different regions of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), can be run in parallel or in a single tube, and can detect <10 genome equivalents of SARS-CoV. The assays consider all currently available SARS-CoV sequences and are optimized for two prominent real-time PCR platforms.

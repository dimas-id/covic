AIM Study the circulation of respiratory viruses in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) during the period from October 2012 to May 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS 136 children with CAP aged from 3 months to 16 years with ARI symptoms at the disease debut were studied. RNA/DNA of influenza A, B, parainfluenza (PI); adeno-, rhino-, RS-viruses, corona-, metapneumo- (MPV) and bocaviruses were detected in nasopharynx smears by PCR with hybridization-fluorescent detection in real time. Antibodies against influenza viruses A/H1N1/pdm09 California/07/09, epidemic reference strains of influenza viruses A/H1N1/Brisbane/59/07, A/ H3N2/Victoria/361/201 1, B/Wisconsin/1/10, against PI viruses type 1, 2, 3 were determined in paired sera by HAI. RESULTS In February-March 2013 the number of children protected by antibodies against influenza decreased, and circulation of influenza viruses A/H3N2 and A/H1N1/ pdm09 was detected. Rhinoviruses and PI viruses were determined throughout the epidemic season, bocavirus and adenoviruses--during the autumn-winter period, RS-virus and MPV--during winter-spring. Coronaviruses were not detected. The peak of virus detection was established in February when the threshold of influenza and ARI morbidity was exceeded. The main pathogens of children of the first 3 years of life are rhinoviruses, RS-virus, PI viruses and bocavirus. RS-virus infection at the debut of CAP in children younger than 3 years in 55.5% of cases is associated with the development of broncho-obstructive syndrome. Bocavirus infection in 50% of cases progresses with laryngo-tracheitis and bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION The fraction of viruses in etiologic structure ofARI in children varies depending on immune layer, season and age of children. Etiology of viral infection at the debut of CAP could only be proven using specialized laboratory studies.

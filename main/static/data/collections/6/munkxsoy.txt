BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) offers cosmetic benefits and may represent further progress towards reducing the invasiveness of surgical interventions. We report our initial experience with LESS totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal herniorrhaphy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Beginning March 2009, we transitioned from a multiport laparoscopic TEP (MLH) technique to a single-incision TEP (SITE) technique. The first 52 consecutive patients who underwent SITE at our institution were compared with the preceding 52 MLH repairs. RESULTS Of the first 52 patients undergoing SITE, there were no conversions to either open or multiport surgery. The mean operative time for the SITE cases did not differ significantly from that of MLH. Complications were equivalent between the 2 groups and included postoperative seroma and urinary retention. CONCLUSIONS Transitioning from MLH to SITE was readily accomplished without significantly altering operative time or morbidity.

AIM: To summarise the features of chest computed tomography (CT) of a series of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) to speed up recognition and have a better understanding of COVID-19 disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical information and chest CT images of 93 patients infected with 2019-nCov from multiple centres were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 93 cases, abnormalities in 91 cases were located at the subpleural level, presenting with ground-glass opacity (GGO; n=69, 74.2%) and consolidation (n=56, 60.2%) in multiple lobes. Other CT features included vascular dilatation (n=83, 89.2%), interlobular septal thickening (n=29, 31.2%), bronchodilatation (n=44, 47.3%), the crazy-paving sign (n=34, 36.6%), the sieve-hole sign (n=12, 12.9%), pleural thickening (n=21, 22.6%), and pleural effusion (n=8, 8.6%). Multiple lobe involvement, including the presence of consolidation, the crazy-paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural thickening and pleural effusion, was more common in critical patients with heavy/critical infection (p<0.05), whereas the presence of GGO, involvement of one or two lobes, and the halo sign were more common in patients with mild/common-type infections (p<0.05). Moreover, older age, higher body temperature, complaints of chest tightness and breathlessness, and lymphopenia was associated with heavy/critical infections. CONCLUSION: The CT and clinical appearances of COVID-19 are variable and reflect the severity of COVID-19 to some extent.

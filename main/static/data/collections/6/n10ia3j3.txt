About 20%â€“30% of genome products have been predicted as membrane proteins, which have significant biological functions. The prediction of the amount and position for the transmembrane protein helical segments (TMHs) is the hot spot in bioinformatics. In this paper, a new approach, maximum spectrum of continuous wavelet transform (MSCWT), is proposed to predict TMHs. The predictions for eight SARS-CoV membrane proteins indicate that MSCWT has the same capacity with software TMpred. Moreover, the test on a dataset of 131 structure-known proteins with 548 TMHs shows that the prediction accuracy of MSCWT for TMHs is 91.6% and that for membrane protein is 89.3%.

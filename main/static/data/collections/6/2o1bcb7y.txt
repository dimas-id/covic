While the mechanisms underlying exercise limitations and symptoms during leg activities have been investigated in detail, knowledge of potential differences between leg and arm activities are not well understood and results from individual studies are contradictory. Thus, the aim of the present study was to synthesize physiological and symptomatic responses during activities involving the arms relative to activities involving the legs in people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Any study with a cross-sectional comparison of acute physiological (cardiorespiratory, metabolic) and symptomatic responses to activities performed with the arms versus the legs were included. Studies were sub-grouped based on the type of activity performed (cycle ergometer, resistance exercises, or functional test/activities). Eighteen studies with 423 individuals with COPD were included. Leg cycle ergometer resulted in greater tidal volume (137 mL), minute ventilation (4.8 L/min), and oxygen consumption (164 mL/min) than arm cycle ergometer, while symptomatic responses were similar. Resistance exercises resulted in similar physiological and symptomatic responses irrespective of whether the legs or the arms were involved while studies on functional activities report different results depending on the type and intensity of the activity performed. With the exception of cycle ergometer activities, physiological and symptomatic responses do not seem to depend on whether the arms or the legs are used, but rather seem to be task and intensity dependent. These novel findings suggest, for example, that strategies used to increase exercise tolerance should not be dependent on whether the arms or the legs are used, but rather the intensity of specific activity performed.

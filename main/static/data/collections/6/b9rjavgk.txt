An antioxidant molecule namely, adenosyl homocysteinase (AHc) was identified from the earlier constructed transcriptome database of Spirulina, where it was cultured in a sulphur deprived condition. From the AHc protein, a small peptide NL13 was identified using bioinformatics tools and was predicted to have antioxidant property. Further, the peptide was synthesised and its antioxidant mechanism was addressed at molecular level. NL13 was subjected to various antioxidant assays including DPPH assay, HARS assay, SARS Assay, NO assay and ABTS assay, where NL13 exhibited significant (P < 0.05) potential antioxidant activity compared to its antioxidant control, Trolox. Cytotoxicity was performed on Human whole blood and the cell viability was performed on VERO fibroblast cells. In both assays, it was found that NL13 did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect towards the cells. Further, the intracellular ROS was performed on Multimode reader followed by imaging on fluorescence microscope which showed scavenging activity even at lower concentration of NL13 (31.2 ÂµM). An effective wound healing property of NL13 on VERO cells was confirmed by analysing the cell migration rate at two different time intervals (24 and 48 h). Overall, the study shows that NL13 peptide scavenges the intracellular oxidative stress.

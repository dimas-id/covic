INTRODUCTION Respiratory viruses, such as those that cause influenza and the common cold, are a regular feature of life for the entire human population. Among people with CF, these viruses are associated with prolonged respiratory illness and show a clear association with pulmonary exacerbations which in turn are associated with lung function decline and risk of death. Human rhinovirus is the most commonly encountered respiratory viral pathogen in CF although adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus are all also responsible for infections in this population. Areas covered: This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical impact and therapeutic options for respiratory virus infection in both children and adults with CF. Expert commentary: The management of CF to date has largely focused on airway clearance strategies, nutritional support and aggressive antibacterial therapy. We highlight the significant role that respiratory viruses play in CF lung disease and argue that these pathogens represent an under-exploited target in the battle to control patients' symptoms and disease progression.

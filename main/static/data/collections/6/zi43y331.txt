Feline Infectious Peritonitis (F.I.P.) was diagnosed in the kittens of two successive litters born to a female presumed also infected. At the same time, the two fathers and the other subjects of the cattery remained asymptomatic of F.I.P. The clinical observations, supported by electrophoretic data, suggest the possibility of a direct transmission of the disease by the mother to her offspring, either by the transplacentary pathway (epigenetic transmission) or via the milk.

Never heard of harpacticoids, ostracods, gastrotrichs or microturbellarians? This is no surprise, they are so tiny! Yet these taxa and many others more famous (nematodes, rotifers, or tardigrades) show complex behaviours and extraordinary physiologies that allow them to colonize inland waters worldwide. This exuberant fauna is better known as the meiofauna (or meiobenthos). Meiofaunal organisms have been fascinating study objects for zoologists since the seventeenth century and recent research has demonstrated their intermediate role in benthic food webs. This special issue highlights how meiofauna can help freshwater ecologists to describe and predict species distribution patterns, to assess production of biomass and trait functions relationships, as well as to examine the trophic links between microscopic and macroscopic worlds and to better understand speciesâ€™ resilience to environmental extremes. Overall, meiofaunal organisms are bridging scales, and as such they deserve better integration to develop more comprehensive concepts and theories in ecology.

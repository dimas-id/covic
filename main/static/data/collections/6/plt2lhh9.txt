OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to evaluate the surgical times for removal of ovaries, and the frequency of intra-operative complications with two different instruments used for canine laparoscopic ovariectomy. METHODS A randomised prospective clinical study. Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed under general anaesthesia on 10 healthy female dogs admitted for elective ovariectomy. Each ovary was randomly assigned to removal by use of either a SonoSurg™ ultrasonic surgical device (Olympus), or a LigaSure™ vessel-sealing system (Valleylab/Covidien). Surgical time for removal of each ovary was measured and the frequency of intra-operative complications was recorded. A follow-up was made by interview with the owners, 2·5 years after surgery. RESULTS The two techniques did not statistically differ with regard to surgical time, or frequency of complications. All owners were very satisfied with the procedure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Both the SonoSurg™ and the LigaSure™ devices appear to be effective, safe and easy to use when performing laparoscopic ovariectomy in dogs.

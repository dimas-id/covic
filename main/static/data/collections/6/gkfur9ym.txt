BACKGROUND Choledocholithiasis is traditionally managed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or T-tube insertion following common bile duct exploration. This study examined the efficacy and safety of primary duct closure following laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) via choledochotomy. METHODS Between September 2011 and September 2013, 157 consecutive patients underwent LCBDE via choledochotomy. RESULTS Of 157 LCBDE procedures, 138 (87.9%) were successfully completed with primary closure of the choledochotomy. Eight patients (5.1%) underwent closure with T-tube drainage after choledochotomy and 11 patients (7.0%) were converted to open surgery. The biliary tree was free of stones at the end of surgery in 154 patients (98.1%). Postoperative bile leak occurred in 6 patients (3.8%). The median follow-up period was 18 (2-33) months, with no evidence of further bile duct stones or bile duct stricture in any patients. Univariable analysis revealed that successful duct clearance (p = 0.010) and diameter of the common bile duct (p < 0.001) were two significant risk factors for bile leak. CONCLUSIONS Primary duct closure following LCBDE is effective and safe for the management of choledocholithiasis. The postoperative bile leak rate may be low in skilled laparoscopic surgeons with a careful selection of patients.

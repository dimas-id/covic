Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has become a major public health problem. The elderly people are the most affected population by the COVID‐19 outbreak in terms of mortality and morbidity. Delirium caused by hypoxia, a prominent clinical feature of COVID‐19, may increase the need for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (1). Therefore, drug‐drug interactions should be considered in AD patients while receiving COVID‐19 treatment.

Abstract Analysis of bodily fluids using vibrational spectroscopy has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In particular, infrared spectroscopic screening of blood products, particularly blood serum, for disease diagnostics has been advanced considerably, attracting commercial interests. However, analyses requiring quantification of endogenous constituents or exogenous agents in blood are less well advanced. Recent advances towards this end are reviewed, focussing on infrared and Raman spectroscopic analyses of human blood serum. The importance of spectroscopic analysis in the native aqueous environment is highlighted, and the relative merits of infrared absorption versus Raman spectroscopy are considered, in this context. It is argued that Raman spectroscopic analysis is more suitable to quantitative analysis in liquid samples, and superior performance for quantification of high and low molecular weight components, is demonstrated. Applications for quantitation of viral loads, and therapeutic drug monitoring are also discussed.

1. In an experiment on broiler cockerels, the influence of tannic acid (TA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), weight of intestine and liver, the activities of serum enzymes LDH, AST, ALT and intestinal absorption function were investigated. 2. Broiler cockerels were given either a commercial diet alone (control group) or a commercial diet with TA (20 g/kg), PEG (10 g/kg) or TA plus PEG (20 + 10 g/kg), for 10 d. 3. On the last day of the experiment, all birds and remaining feed were weighed individually and a sample of blood was taken to measure the serum activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The capacity of intestinal cells for the absorption of D-xylose was measured. Finally all birds were killed humanely and the intestine and liver were weighed. 4. The results showed that TA significantly reduced BWG and FCR, as well as the activity of LDH, AST and ALT. 5. TA also increased the relative weight of the intestine. Adding PEG alone had no effect on any of the measured parameters. 6. However, PEG improved significantly BWG, FCR and the activity of LDH and AST of TA-fed birds. 7. The plasma D-xylose concentration of experimental birds was similar for all dietary treatments most likely because of temporal separation between feeding the dietary TA and administering the D-xylose. 8. It was concluded that the presence of tannins in the GI lumen of the bird was necessary to affect the processes involved in the absorption of simple sugars such as D-xylose, at the level of intestinal absorptive cells.

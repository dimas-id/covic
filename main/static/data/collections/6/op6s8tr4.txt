Recent data from multiple public health departments across the U.S. highlighting the disproportionate burden of COVID‚Äê19 infections in vulnerable populations serve as an urgent call to action. As rheumatologists, we are acutely aware of the higher morbidity and mortality, and for a number of our diseases, the higher incidence and prevalence among racial/ethnic minorities and individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES). Comorbidities are frequent, timely access to subspecialty care is limited, receipt of high quality care is less common, and care is more often fragmented with frequent, avoidable acute care use.

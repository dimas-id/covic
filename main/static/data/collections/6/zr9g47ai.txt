The virus, called COVID-19, which has emerged in China in December 2019, has been known to spread through droplets and close contact, and has evolved into a pandemic today. It is also known that in all patients who have come into contact with COVID-19, the infection is not severe and may even occur without symptoms. There is no consensus yet on how to take measures to protect the patient and the surgeon in case of diseases requiring urgent or elective surgery, and how preoperative preparation, perioperative phase, and postoperative care should be performed. The aim of this study was to prepare a guide on how the surgeon should behave in patients whose operation is mandatory in light of the available data.

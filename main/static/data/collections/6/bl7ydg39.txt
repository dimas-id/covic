Low antibody titers to Neospora caninum have been reported in humans, but infection has not been confirmed. We used N. caninum-specific PCR to test 600 clinical samples from patients with toxoplasmosis signs but Toxoplasma gondii-negative PCR results. We did not detect N. caninum DNA, demonstrating it is an unlikely opportunistic zoonotic agent.

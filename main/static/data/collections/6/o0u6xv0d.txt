BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common respiratory disorder, which brings an enormous financial burden to the medical system. However, the current treatment options for pneumonia are limited because of drug resistance and side effects. Our previous study preliminarily confirmed that Yinlai Decoction (YD), a common prescription for pneumonia in clinical practice, can regulate the expression of inflammatory factors, but the mechanisms are unknown yet. METHODS: In our work, a method named network pharmacology was applied, which investigated the underlying mechanisms of herbs based on a variety of databases. We obtained bioactive ingredients of YD on TCMSP database and collected potential targets of these ingredients by target fishing. Then the pneumonia-related targets database was built by TTD, Drugbank, HPO, OMIM, and CTD. Based on the matching targets between YD and pneumonia, the PPI network was built by STRING to analyze the interactions among these targets and then input into Cytoscape for further topological analysis. DAVID and KEGG were utilized for GO and pathway enrichment analysis. Then rat model based on LPS stimulated pneumonia was used to verify the possible mechanism of YD in treating pneumonia. RESULTS: Sixty-eight active ingredients, 103 potential targets and 8 related pathways, which likely exert a number of effects, were identified. Three networks were constructed using Cytoscape, which were herb-component-network, YD-pneumonia target network, and herb-component-YD target-pneumonia network. YD was verified to treat LPS-induced pneumonia by regulating the inflammatory factor IL-6, which was a predicted target. CONCLUSION: Network analysis indicated that YD could alleviate the symptoms and signs of pneumonia through regulating host immune inflammatory response, angiogenesis and vascular permeability, the barrier function of the airway epithelial cells, hormone releasing and cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.

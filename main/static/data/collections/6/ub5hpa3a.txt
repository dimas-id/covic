OBJECTIVE Endoscopic Zenker diverticulotomy (EZD) is a primary treatment for Zenker diverticulum (ZD). During EZD, the diverticulum is not excised, and interpretation of postoperative videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) is challenging. The purpose of this investigation was to describe normal VFSS findings status post-successful EZD. METHODS The charts of all patients with ZD treated at our center between October 01, 2011, and May 30, 2014, were abstracted. Outcome measures included recidivistic diverticulum size, Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), penetration aspiration scale, pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), and pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) opening. RESULTS Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 70.5 (± 13) years. Seventy percent of the patients were male. Mean EAT-10 decreased 72.1% from 17.9 (± 8.2) to 5 (± 6.9) (P < 0.0001), and diverticulum size decreased 50.9% from 1.96 cm (± 0.68) to 0.96 cm (± 0.57) (P < 0.001). The PCR improved 33.6% from 0.17 (± 0.13) to 0.11 (± 0.11) (P < 0.001). Mean PES opening increased 61.6% from 0.53 cm (± 0.3544) to 0.86 cm (± 0.29) in lateral view and increased 40.0% from 1.00 cm (± 0.54) to 1.39 cm (± 0.46) in anteroposterior view (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION VFSS following successful EZD demonstrates an approximate 50% reduction in diverticulum size and significant improvement in PCR and PES opening. These data provide a framework for the expected fluoroscopic outcomes of successful diverticulotomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4. Laryngoscope, 127:1762-1766, 2017.

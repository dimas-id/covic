Internal rectal prolapse can lead to obstructed defecation, faecal incontinence and pain. In treatment of frail or technically difficult patients, a perineal approach is often used, such as a Delorme's or a STARR. However, in case of very high take-off prolapse, these procedures are challenging if not unsuitable. We present trans-anal endoscopic microsurgery as surgical option for management of this uncommon type of rectal prolapse in specific cases.

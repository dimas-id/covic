Doxycycline (DOX) is a key antimalarial drug that is thought to kill Plasmodium falciparum parasites by blocking protein translation in the essential apicoplast organelle. Although parasite resistance to DOX has not emerged, clinical use is primarily limited to prophylaxis due to delayed second-cycle parasite death at 1-3 μM, the DOX concentration readily achieved in human plasma at current dosing. Slow antiparasitic activity is thought to be a fundamental limitation of DOX and other antibiotics that target apicoplast maintenance. We report that slightly higher 8-10 μM DOX concentrations kill parasites with first-cycle activity that blocks apicoplast biogenesis. This faster activity is rescued by exogenous isopentenyl pyrophosphate, an essential apicoplast product, confirming an apicoplast-specific target. Exogenous iron rescues first- but not second-cycle activity by 1 or 10 μM DOX, revealing that first-cycle activity involves a metal-dependent mechanism that is distinct from the canonical delayed-death mechanism. These results provide a new paradigm for understanding fundamental antiparasitic mechanisms of DOX and suggest the possibility of repurposing DOX as a faster-acting antimalarial at higher dosing, which remains well tolerated. Multiple mechanisms of DOX activity would be expected to limit parasite resistance.

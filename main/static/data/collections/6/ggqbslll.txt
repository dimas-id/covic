BACKGROUND Post-operative diaphragmatic hernias (PODHs) are serious complications following esophagectomy or total gastrectomy. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the incidence of PODHs at a high volume center over time and analyze the outcomes of patients who develop a PODH. METHODS A prospective database of all resectional esophagogastric operations performed for cancer between January 2001 and December 2015 was analyzed. Patients diagnosed with PODH were identified and data extracted regarding demographics, details of initial resection, pathology, PODH symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS Out of 631 patients who had hiatal dissection for malignancy, 35 patients developed of PODH (5.5 % overall incidence). Median age was 66 (range 23-87) years. The incidence of PODH in each operation type was: 2 % (4/221) following an open 2 or 3 stage esophagectomy, 10 % (22/212) following laparoscopic hybrid esophagectomy, 7 % (5/73) following MIO, and 3 % (4/125) following total gastrectomy. The majority of patients had colon or small bowel in a left-sided hernia. Of the 35 patients who developed a PODH, 20 (57 %) patients required emergency surgery, whereas 15 (43 %) had non-urgent repair. The majority of the patients had had suture repair (n = 24) or mesh repair (n = 7) of the diaphragmatic defect. Four patients were treated non-operatively. In hospital post-operative mortality was 20 % (4/20) in the emergency group and 0 % (0/15) in the elective group. Further hernia recurrence affected seven patients (n = 7/27, 26 %) and 4 of these patients (15 %) presented with multiple recurrences. CONCLUSION PODH is a common complication following hybrid esophagectomy and MIO. Given the high mortality from emergency repair, careful thought is needed to identify surgical techniques to prevent PODH forming when minimal access esophagectomy are performed. Upper GI surgeons need to have a low index of suspicion to investigate and treat patients for this complication.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the technical effectiveness, technical success and patient safety of MR-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation of liver malignancies using a wide-bore 1.5-T MR system. METHODS In 110 patients, 56 primary liver lesions and 157 liver metastases were treated in 157 sessions using percutaneous RF ablation. Mean lesion diameter was 20 mm (range 4-54 mm). All planning, procedural and post-interventional control MR investigations were carried out using a wide-bore 1.5-T MR system. Technical success was assessed by a contrast-enhanced MR liver examination immediately after the intervention. Technique effectiveness was assessed by dynamic hepatic MR study 1 month post ablation; mean follow-up period was 24.2 months (range 5-44). RESULTS Technical success and technique effectiveness were achieved in 210/213 lesions (98.6 %). In 18/210 lesions (8.6 %), local tumour progression occurred 4-28 months after therapy. Seven of these 18 lesions were treated in a second session achieving complete ablation, 6 other lesions were referred to surgery. Overall RF effectiveness rate was 199/213 (93.4 %); overall therapy success (including surgery) was 205/213 (96.2 %). Two major complications (1.3 %) (bleeding and infected biloma) and 14 (8.9 %) minor complications occurred subsequent to 157 interventions. CONCLUSION Wide-bore MR-guided RF ablation is a safe and effective treatment option for liver lesions.

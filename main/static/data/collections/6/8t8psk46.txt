Zhang et al. (2020) reported that mandating face coverings in public is necessary to decrease the rate of new COVID-19 infections. We present a counterexample that disproves this finding. We agree with Zhang et al. that masks can be an important element in reducing virus transmission and that widespread use may be essential for returning to full activity. However, their analysis neglects the potential importance of physical distancing for limiting COVID-19 transmission by misattributing its effect to mask requirements. A full suite of epidemiological tools is necessary in these challenging times.

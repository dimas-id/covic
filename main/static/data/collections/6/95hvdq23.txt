During a 17-month period, 19 full-term newborn infants were hospitalized for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). 10 of these infants had no apparent risk factors. Only 7 suffered acute fetal distress. 16 of the 19 infants were born in the same hospital. Toxicological and bacteriological investigations of possible cause revealed no specific agent. Virological analysis of 8 stool samples revealed the presence of corona virus in 5 of the 8.

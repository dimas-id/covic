Infection with agents interpreted as causing or contributing to diarrhea (rotavirus, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and cryptosporidia) were demonstrated in 24 of 32 newborn calves that had naturally occurring diarrheal disease. The calves were from 12 herds in Iowa. Infections as well as enteric lesions and hypoglobulinemia occurred more frequently among diarrheal calves than among nondiarrheal calves from these same herds. In most calves, infections were mixed; ie, both viruses, one or both viruses plus cryptosporidia, or rotavirus plus enterotoxigenic E coli.

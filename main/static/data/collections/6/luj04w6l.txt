BACKGROUND The management of intracranial aneurysm (IA) is challenging. Clinicians often rely on varied and intuitively disparate ways of evaluating rupture risk that may only partially take into account complex hemodynamic and morphologic factors. We developed a prototype of a clinically oriented, streamlined, computational platform, AView, for rapid assessment of hemodynamics and morphometrics in clinical settings. To show the potential clinical utility of AView, we report our initial multicenter experience highlighting the possible advantages of morphologic and hemodynamic analysis of IAs. METHODS AView software was deployed across 8 medical centers (6 in the United States, 2 in Japan). Eight clinicians were trained and used the AView software between September 2012 and January 2013. RESULTS We present 12 illustrative cases that show the potential clinical utility of AView. For all, morphology and hemodynamics, flow visualization, and rupture resemblance score (a surrogate for rupture risk) were provided. In 3 cases, AView could confirm the clinicians' decision to treat; in 3 cases, it could suggest which aneurysms may be at greater risk among multiple aneurysms; in 5 cases, AView could provide additional information for use during treatment decisions for ambiguous situations. In one stent-assisted coiling case, flow visualization predicted that the intuitive choice for stent placement could have resulted in sacrifice of an anterior cerebral artery due to blockage by coils and led clinicians to reconsider treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS AView has the potential to confirm decisions to treat IAs, suggest which among multiple aneurysms to treat, and guide treatment decisions. Furthermore, the flow visualization it affords can inform aneurysm treatment planning and potentially avoid poor outcomes.

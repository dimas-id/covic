The incidence of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is 1.6Ã— greater than in patients undergoing the same procedure for osteoarthritis. This higher risk "may" be due to the immunosuppressive therapies for RA patients including corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. There is a debate about the role of DMARDs in increasing the incidence of subsequent PJI. Studies show conflicting results, with some demonstrating no significant increase in the rates of PJI and some finding otherwise. The International Consensus Meeting on PJI recommended that DMARDs should be halted prior to an elective total joint arthroplasty based on their half-life. Moreover, the International Consensus Meeting stated that cessation of immunosuppressant medications should be performed in consultation with and under the direction of the treating physician. In this review, we aimed to provide an introduction to the available treatment options and cover the recommendations on the treatment protocols for RA patients who undergo elective total joint arthroplasty.

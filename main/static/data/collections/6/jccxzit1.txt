Although there are few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of drugs to treat COVID‐19, different molecules have been used empirically and with great interest in those intended to control the excessive inflammatory response produced by SARS‐CoV‐2. By blocking the IL‐6 receptor, tocilizumab has a role in controlling the inflammatory response. Clinical improvement of respiratory parameters and hospital stay have been described in small series in a series of patients without a control group [1]. There are currently numerous ongoing clinical trials aimed to clarifying the role of this molecule in COVID‐19. The guidelines for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia from the Spanish Ministry of Health contemplate the use of tocilizumab as a therapeutic tool for those patients with severe respiratory failure or rapid respiratory deterioration with criteria for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).

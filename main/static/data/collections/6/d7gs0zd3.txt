• Clinicians are looking for a reliable prognostic marker for patients with COVID-19; • In our cohort, clinical improvement was predicted by younger age and a NLR below 3; • Transfer to ICU was instead predicted by a NLR over 4 (p=0.046); • NLR is a fast, widely available and relatively inexpensive assessment; • NLR may be a useful tool in the early screening of patients with COVID-19.

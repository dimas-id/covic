We conducted a cross-sectional survey of nursing staff (n = 51) in an academic hospital finding a significant inverse relationship between the frequency of chaplaincy interaction and perceived stress (r = âˆ’ 0.27, p = 0.05). We also found a significant positive relationship between rated importance of having a chaplain at the hospital and secondary trauma (r = 0.30, p = 0.03). There was a significant positive relationship between religiosity and rated importance for having a chaplain (r = 0.30, p = 0.03) and rated helpfulness of chaplains (r = 0.32, p = 0.02). Similarly, there was a significant positive relationship between spirituality and average length of conversations with a chaplain, rated importance for having a chaplain, and helpfulness of chaplains (r = 0.32, p = 0.03; r = 0.44, p = 0.001; and r = 0.52, p = 0.0001, respectively). Interaction with chaplains is associated with decreased employee perceived stress for nursing staff who provide care for severely ill patients.

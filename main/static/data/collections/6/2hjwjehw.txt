The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops in 25%-50% of patients with proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite the use of standard anticoagulant therapy and elastic compression stockings. PTS is a major cause of quality of life impairment in DVT patients and often leads to limiting venous claudication, work disability, and venous ulcers. Endovascular thrombolytic procedures that eliminate venous thrombus, restore venous flow, and show strong potential to prevent PTS are now under study in multicenter randomized clinical trials. In addition, endovascular procedures can be used to treat valvular reflux and venous obstruction and thereby provide symptom improvement to patients with chronic established PTS.

This paper discusses countermeasures of Republic of Singapore towards mosquito-borne infectious diseases, particularly, dengue and chikungunya virus infection to identify an essential factor in controlling emergence of infectious diseases. In spite of expanding areas affected by and upsurge of these diseases in the region, the tropical urban country is known to have sustained an effective vector control, which often resulted in moderate prevalence and/or quick control of domestic outbreaks. This research has adopted an inter-disciplinary review of previous studies combined with field studies: interviewing at the Ministry of Health, Singapore and the National Environment Agency, Singapore; visiting a laboratory and hospitals; and observing on-site vector mosquito surveillance operations conducted by the agency. The findings have pointed out the national vector surveillance and control system implemented by 1970s, followed by improved countermeasures like vector and virus surveillance which have incorporated science and technology especially in the last two decades. The analysis produces an influential role of a government in promoting and supporting public health measures, which have been typically demonstrated through inter-ministry collaboration, public-private cooperation, and community involvement. In light of increasing transnational nature of emerging infectious diseases, Singapore’s contribution in the region like sharing its knowledge of and experiences in dengue and chikungunya virus infection is illustrated. The resilient model of Singapore’s vector control and governmental action warrants a further study to investigate transferability in other parts of the region.

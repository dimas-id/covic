With the increasing number of confirmed cases and accumulating clinical data, our understanding of COVID-19 continues to evolve. Here we describe the case of a patient who was initially admitted for decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Only later in his course did he develop fever that led to testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2). Although we are aware of the common respiratory failure induced by SARS-COV-2, we have scant information that describes cardiac manifestations caused by this novel virus.

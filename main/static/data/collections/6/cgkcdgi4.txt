Abstract A novel approach involving the preparation of mannose-bearing chitosan microspheres with entrapping complexes of HBV DNA and PEI was developed to improve the delivery of DNA into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. Compared with the traditional chitosan microspheres, the microspheres could quickly release intact and penetrative PEI/DNA complexes. What's more, chitosan was modified with mannose to target the primary APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) owing to the high density of mannose receptors expressing on the surface of immature DCs. After i.m. immunization, the microspheres induced significantly enhanced serum antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in comparison to naked DNA.

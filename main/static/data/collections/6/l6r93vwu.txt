This chapter examines state capacity as an explanatory factor in order to reconceptualise political leadership in a regional context. This chapter argues that state capacity is crucial in the provision of political leadership in a regional context as it helps to sustain the benefits of regional community-building, and to continually, over time, build and strengthen regional community-building through policy implementation and policy continuation. This chapter compares the role, and the implications of, the Franco-German alliance in steering the development of the EU, with the more circumspect role of Indonesia as the de facto leader in ASEAN, whether in providing sole leadership, or through a coalition with other countries. It also examines and compares both the potential and challenges for smaller member states such as Singapore in ASEAN and the Benelux countries in the EU, to exert increased influence in their regional community-building efforts.

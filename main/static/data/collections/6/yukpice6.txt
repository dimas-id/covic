Osteoid osteomas of the wrist are relatively rare and the diagnosis is challenging due to atypical clinical features. We describe a case of an osteoid osteoma of the scaphoid bone associated with calcific tendinitis of the adjacent flexor carpi radialis tendon and periarticular soft tissue calcifications in a 21-year-old man presenting with radial-sided wrist pain. The lesion was successfully treated with CT-guided RF ablation. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an osteoid osteoma of the wrist associated with calcific tendinitis and periarthritis. In addition, we discuss the technical details and difficulties of CT-guided RF ablation of scaphoid osteoid osteomas.

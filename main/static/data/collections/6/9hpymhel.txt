Methods Recanalization was assessed using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score. Neurological outcomes were assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale. Results Fifteen patients were evaluated. The mTICI score was 2b-3 in 80%, and it was 3 in 60% of patients. No intracranial hemorrhage was seen. At three months, modified Rankin Scale scores â‰¤ 2 were observed in 60% of patients and the mortality rate was 13.3%. Conclusions The ADAPT appears to be a safe, effective, and fast recanalization strategy for treatment of acute ischemic stroke resulting from large vessel occlusions.

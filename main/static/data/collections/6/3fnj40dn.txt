BACKGROUND Circulating l-lactate concentration is commonly measured in hospitalized horses by sampling from indwelling intravenous (IV) catheters. However, there are no published evidence-based recommendations to prevent contamination by lactated Ringer's solution (LRS). HYPOTHESIS Withdrawing 10 mL of blood from the LRS-containing extension set connected to the IV catheter before obtaining the sample for analysis should be adequate to obtain accurate measurement of blood lactate concentration (BLC). ANIMALS Thirty-three adult hospitalized horses receiving constant rate infusion of LRS. METHODS Immediately after disconnecting the LRS, 5 sequential 5 mL blood samples were obtained by aspiration from an extension set connected to an indwelling IV catheter, followed by 3 samples collected by direct venipuncture of the contralateral jugular vein. Samples were analyzed with 1 portable blood lactate analyzer. A linear mixed model was used to examine differences in lactate concentrations among samples collected from the catheter and by direct venipuncture. RESULTS After considering differences in age, breed, sex, and reason for hospitalization, BLCs were higher (P < .001) in the first and second 5 mL samples collected through the extension set/catheter than in all other extension set/catheter samples or the direct venipuncture samples. The largest difference observed between the third and subsequent catheter or venipuncture samples was 0.34 mmol/L with an upper 95% CI of 1.12 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Withdrawing 15 mL of blood from a LRS-containing extension set connected to an IV catheter (5.9 mL total volume capacity) before obtaining the sample for blood lactate analysis is suggested to optimize accuracy of BLC measurements.

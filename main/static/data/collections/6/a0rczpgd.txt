A healthy patient presented to Klinikum Altmühlfranken Weißenburg Hospital, Germany, with two‐morning attacks of painful muscle spasm in left upper and lower limbs, without altered consciousness. Full examinations, radiological imaging, electroencephalography, lumbar puncture, and autoimmune profile were either normal or not consistent. Subsequent epileptic episodes were observed on admission day and following days; thus, the patient was diagnosed with focal epilepsy. The patient started to develop a fever and severe cough at day 4, and SARS‐Coronavirus‐2 was confirmed through a nasopharyngeal swap. She received anticonvulsants and symptomatic treatments and completely recovered. This report emphasizes on potential nervous system involvement in SARS‐Coronavirus‐2 pathogenesis.

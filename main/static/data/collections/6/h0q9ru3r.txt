Researchers are expanding the applications of nanotechnology in the field of medicine since mid-2000. These technologies include nanoarrays, protein arrays, nanopore technology, nanoparticles as a contrivance in immunoassays and nanosensors, among others. Nanobiotechnologies are clinically applicable and possess the potential to be useful in laboratory diagnosis of infections in general and viral infections in particular. Nanotechnology is a significant advance in molecular diagnostics. The technology strengthens and expands the DNA and protein microarray methods. In particular, the waveguide technology is an emergent area with many diagnostic applications. Nanosensors are the new contrivance for detection of bioterrorism agents. All these new technologies would have to be evaluated in clinical settings before their full import is appreciated and accepted.

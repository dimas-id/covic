As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes a global pandemic, policy makers must enact interventions to stop its spread. Data driven approaches might supply information to support the implementation of mitigation and suppression strategies. To facilitate research in this direction, we present a machine-readable dataset that aggregates relevant data from governmental, journalistic, and academic sources on the county level. In addition to county-level time-series data from the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dashboard, our dataset contains more than 300 variables that summarize population estimates, demographics, ethnicity, housing, education, employment and in come, climate, transit scores, and healthcare system-related metrics. Furthermore, we present aggregated out-of-home activity information for various points of interest for each county, including grocery stores and hospitals, summarizing data from SafeGraph. By collecting these data, as well as providing tools to read them, we hope to aid researchers investigating how the disease spreads and which communities are best able to accommodate stay-at-home mitigation efforts. Our dataset and associated code are available at https://github.com/JieYingWu/COVID-19_US_County-level_Summaries.

The rational design of broad‐spectrum antivirals requires data on antiviral activity of compounds against multiple viruses, which are often not available. We have developed a panel of (+)ssRNA viruses composed of Enterovirus and Flavivirus genera members allowing to study these activity spectra. Antiviral activity profiling of a set of nucleoside analogues revealed N (4)‐hydroxycytidine as an efficient inhibitor of replication of coxsackieviruses and other enteroviruses, but ineffective against tick‐borne encephalitis virus. Furano[2, 3‐d]pyrimidine nucleosides with n‐pentyl or n‐hexyl tails showed selective inhibition of Enterovirus A representatives. 5‐(Tetradec‐1‐yn‐1‐yl)‐uridine showed selective inhibition of tick‐borne encephalitis virus at the micromolar level.

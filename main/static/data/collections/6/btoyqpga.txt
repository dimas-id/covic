BACKGROUND Most ventral incisional hernias are repaired using 1 of 2 principal techniques: (1) prosthetic repair (open or laparoscopic) and (2) primary reconstruction by fascial component separation. Primary midline restoration provides physiological advantages, and avoidance of mesh may reduce complications. This report describes 128 cases of incisional hernia repair by fascial release. Evolution of the technique produced modifications and fewer complications. METHODS Fascial component separation was performed either by "classic" technique (broad skin flaps) in group 1 and by "perforator preservation" (fascial release through separate inferolateral incisions) in group 2. RESULTS Mortality was .75% (1/128). Major complications occurred in 7 patients (5.5%). Total recurrence rate is 16% (21/128) with major recurrences in 9.3% (12/128). Both groups were statistically equivalent in demographics, comorbidities, and recurrences. Group 1 had significantly higher rates of skin necrosis (P < .001) and chronic pain (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS Fascial component separation can provide satisfactory results in uncomplicated incisional hernias, but skin necrosis is prohibitive without perforator preservation.

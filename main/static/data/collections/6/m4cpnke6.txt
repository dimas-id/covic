The frontal sinus is an airspace behind the brow ridge in the skull and can affect the accuracy of the regional cerebral oxygen saturation measurements. We evaluated the optimal location for placement of a cerebral oximeter probe while avoiding the frontal sinus in pediatric patients. This retrospective observational study included 203 pediatric patients aged 3-17 years who had undergone brain computed tomography from November 2010 to December 2015. The patients were divided into five subgroups based on their age. The frontal sinus height was measured from the superior orbital rim. Pneumatization of the frontal sinus was not visible in 78% (3-5 years) and 22% (6-8 years) of the patients. The mean (SD) of the frontal sinus height was 5.9 (3.4), 9.5 (4.1), 14.0 (6.2) 18.6 (8.4), and 21.1 (7.9) mm in the 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, and 15-17 year age-groups, respectively. Age was positively correlated with the frontal sinus height (r = 0.61, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.513-0.688). A frontal sinus height shorter than 1, 2, and 3 cm were seen in 10 of 11 (91%), 69 of 74 (94%), and 108 of 118 (90%) patients aged 3-5, 6-10, and 11-17 years, respectively. When oximeter probes are applied in pediatric patients, placement based on age can help avoid the frontal sinus.

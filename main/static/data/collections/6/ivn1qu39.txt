BACKGROUND Since the first report of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in December of 2019, it has become rapidly prevalent and been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. There are quite a few cases reported involving delivery with COVID-19 infection, but little valuable suggestion was provided about what healthcare providers of obstetrics and neonatology should do in their clinic practice for unknown status or presumed negative women. Here, we summarized the current practice of delivery management in China that successfully prevented rapid increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes and nosocomial infection in departments of obstetrics and neonatology during the pandemic of COVID-19.

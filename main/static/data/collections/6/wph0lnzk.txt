Abstract The spread of infectious diseases has become a global health concern. In order to diagnose infectious diseases quickly and accurately, next-generation DNA sequencing techniques for genetic analysis of infectious viruses have been developed rapidly. However, it takes a very long time to pretreat clinical samples for genetic analysis using next-generation sequencers. We have therefore developed a microfluidic chromatography chip that can purify and enrich viruses in a sample using hydroxyapatite particles packed in a micro-column. We demonstrated the purification of virus from a mixture of virus and FBS protein, and enrichment of the virus using this novel microfluidic chip.

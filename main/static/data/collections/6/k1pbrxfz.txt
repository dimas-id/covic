Emerging outbreaks of arboviroses are most often tied to the convergence of a set of factors which have physical and environmental, genetic and biological, ecological, social, political and economic origins. Thirteen out of these factors are known as main determinants of emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This paper assesses the role of these factors from exploring the Chikungunya outbreak which occurred in Indian Ocean in 2004-2007, as case study. Chikungunya is an alphavirus borne and transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

COVID-19 has placed an increased burden on the NHS. Changes were made to expand patient capacity including hospital restructuring, cancellation of most elective surgeries and early graduation of final year medical students. 1 The UK foundation programme (UKFP) curated a new training position for graduates as foundation interim year 1 (FiY1) doctors, where they voluntarily work in paid positions prior to entering formal foundation year 1 (FY1) roles. 2 Expediting the process of fulfilling these positions, the General Medical Council facilitated early provisional registration of doctors. We discuss the positives, pitfalls, and perils of the new roles and the first impressions of three newly qualified FiY1 s in medical, obstetrics and gynaecology and surgical posts, a surgical FY1 doctor and a clinical supervisor in surgery.

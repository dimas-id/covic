A seminested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for the detection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) in semen. Five boars were inoculated intranasally with CSFV isolate propagated in PK15 cells. Two boars inoculated with the supernatant of noninfected PK15 cells were kept as controls. Semen and serum samples were collected twice weekly for 63 days postinoculation (dpi). Samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to CSFV by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for the presence of CSFV nucleic acid by seminested RT-PCR. Antibodies to CSFV could be detected as early as 7 dpi in 1 boar, and all 5 infected boars were found positive by 14 dpi. CSFV from boar semen was infrequently identified by virus isolation compared with seminested RT-PCR. CSFV nucleic acid was detected in semen by seminested RT-PCR as early as 7 dpi in 3 infected boars and persistently thereafter in all 5 infected boars until 63 dpi. When separated fractions of CSFV-contaminated semen were analyzed by the seminested RT-PCR, the CSFV nucleic acid was detected mainly in seminal fluid and occasionally in nonsperm cells. CSFV antigen was also detected in nonsperm cells from semen smear by immunohistochemistry. Thus, infection via semen, specially through CSFV-infected seminal fluid, seems to be a major route of transmission of CSFV.

BACKGROUND Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an essential role in maintenance of normal brain function as well as in repair after traumatic brain injuries (TBI). However, massive and uncontrolled release of these cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, can also result in a great deal of additional brain damage. Levels of these cytokines may increase in the brain thousands of times more than do the corresponding levels in serum. RESEARCH DESIGN Narrative literature review. Outcome and conclusions: Strategies to control the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and to reduce the cytokine-induced brain damage are discussed. There is extensive evidence from experiments in animal models that suppression of cytokines is effective in ameliorating neurologic damage after TBI. However, the efficacy of this approach remains to be proven in patient trials.

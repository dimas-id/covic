BACKGROUND The role of minimally invasive approach for pancreaticoduodenectomy has not yet been well defined in Australia. We present our early experience with laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) from Brisbane, Australia. METHODS Retrospective review in a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing LPD between 2006 and 2016 was performed. Patients who underwent a hybrid LPD (HLPD) mobilization approach and resection followed by open reconstruction and totally LPD (TLPD) approach were included in this study. Operative characteristics, perioperative outcomes, pathological and survival data were collected. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients underwent LPD including 17 HLPD (63%) and 10 TLPD (37%) patients. HLPD patients were mostly converted to open for planned reconstruction or vascular resection. With increasing experience, more TLPDs were performed, including laparoscopic anastomoses. Median operating time was 462 min (504 min for TLPD). Median length of hospital stay was 10 days. Histology showed 21 invasive malignancies, two neuroendocrine tumours, two intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and two benign lesions. Median nodal harvest was 22. Margin negative resection was achieved in 84% of patients. Twenty-two percent of patients developed a Grade 3/4 complication, including 19% clinically significant pancreatic fistula. There was one perioperative mortality (4%) due to pancreatic fistula, post-operative haemorrhage and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS LPD is a technically challenging operation with a steep learning curve. The early oncological outcomes appear satisfactory. It remains to be determined whether the minimally invasive approach to pancreaticoduodenectomy offers benefits to patients.

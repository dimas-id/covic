BACKGROUND To present the technique of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic mediastinal tumor resection, which includes limited thymectomy, extended thymectomy, cyst excision and posterior mediastinal tumor excision, and the early results of resection with the use of this technique. METHODS Forty patients with mediastinal tumors were treated with single-port thoracoscopic mediastinal resection at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between April 2014 and September 2015. The surgical intervention was performed through the fourth or fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line. A 5 or 10 mm 30 degree video camera and working instruments were employed simultaneously at this incision site throughout the surgery. RESULTS Among the 40 cases included in the final analysis, 10 extended thymectomies, 7 limited thymectomies, nine cyst excisions and 14 tumor excisions were performed successfully without the need for conversion. For the 40 patients who underwent single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the mean operation time was 97.3±31.2 min and the average blood loss was 29.75±39.77 mL. The average length of the incision wound was 3.22±0.79 cm and the average length of postoperative hospital stay was 3.72±1.63 days. There were no mortalities and mobility was achieved within 30 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary report suggests that uniportal VATS for mediastinal tumor resection is a promising and safe technique within a short-term period.

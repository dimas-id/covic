Since the vast array of scientific contributions by Dr. C. R. Rao are difficult to summarize in a short paper, we focus on (1) concepts relevant for applied statisticians including econometricians, (2) using the R software to explain the concepts to be better understood by Economics students who may lack sufficient background in mathematical statistics, (3) topics that are covered in publicly and freely available R packages. The range of R packages influenced by Raoâ€™s research is impressive. Dr. Rao will be 100 years old in 2020, and it is high time the Economics profession recognizes and honors his foundational contributions to econometrics.

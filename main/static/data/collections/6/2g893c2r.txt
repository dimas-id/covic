Modern societal issues occur in a broad spectrum with very high levels of complexity and challenges, many of which are becoming increasingly difficult to address without the aid of cutting-edge technology. To alleviate these social problems, the Korean government recently announced the implementation of mega-projects to solve low employment, population aging, low birth rate and social safety net problems by utilizing AI and ICBM (IoT, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Mobile) technologies. In this letter, we will present the views on how AI and ICT technologies can be applied to ease or solve social problems by sharing examples of research results from studies of social anxiety, environmental noise, mobility of the disabled, and problems in social safety. We will also describe how all these technologies, big data, methodologies and knowledge can be combined onto an open social informatics platform.

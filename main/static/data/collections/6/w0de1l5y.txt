Primary human and primate brain microvascular endothelial cells were tested for permissiveness to coronaviruses JHM and 229E. While sub-genomic viral RNAs could be detected up to 72 hours post-infection, primate cells were abortively infected and neither virus caused cytopathology. Human cells were non-permissive for JHM but permissive for 229E replication; peak production of progeny 229E and observable cytopathic effects occurred approximately 22 and 32 hour post-infection, respectively. Using the criterion of cytopathology induction in infected endothelial cells, 229E was compared to other human RNA and DNA viruses. In addition, virus induced modulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and HLA I was monitored by immunostaining of infected cells.

Accumulating clinical observations suggest pathogenesis beyond viral pneumonia and its secondary consequences in COVID-19 patients. In particular, many patients develop profound hyperinflammation and hypercoagulopathy with disseminated thrombogenesis and thromboembolism, which we observe also in a Swedish COVID-19 intensive care patient cohort. To understand these vascular manifestations, it is important to establish the potential vascular entry point(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, i.e. which vascular cell types express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We present data that ACE2 is specifically and highly expressed in microvascular pericytes, but absent from endothelial cells, perivascular macrophages and fibroblasts. Mice with pericyte ablation show increased expression and release of Von Willebrand Factor from microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting that pericytes orchestrate thrombogenic responses in neighboring endothelial cells. Identifying pericytes rather than endothelial cells as the ACE2-expressing cells in the vasculature may explain why hypertension, diabetes and obesity are risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients, as these conditions are characterized by an impaired endothelial barrier function, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to reach and infect the pericytes that are normally shielded from the blood behind an intact endothelial barrier. This novel COVID-19-pericyte hypothesis is testable, offers explanations for some of the most enigmatic and lethal aspects of COVID-19 and calls for further investigations into the possible benefits of preventive anticoagulant therapy.

In this study, we performed a single-centered study of 307 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. It was found that co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus was common during COVID-19 outbreak. And patients coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza B virus have a higher risk of developing poor outcomes so a detection of both viruses was recommended during COVID-19 outbreak.

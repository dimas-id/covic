1. The Office of Occupational Health Nursing, within the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), actively advocates for workers and occupational health nurses. 2. Although an enforcement agency by law, OSHA has and is in the process of building bridges to the regulated community through its cooperative development of programs intended to enhance employer efforts for improving and maintaining employee health and workplace safety. 3. OSHA's service of consultation is geared toward the small employer seeking assistance in the recognition and correction of workplace hazards, while improving worksite health and safety programs. Voluntary Protection Programs participation, the recognition of exemplary larger employers, often leads to improvements in employee safety motivation while improving product quality, worker productivity, and corporate profits. 4. OSHA produces a wealth of publications, pamphlets, audiovisual, computer access programs and other documents designed to ease compliance while providing a foundation to the understanding of workplace health and safety.

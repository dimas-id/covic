Over the last decade, major advances have been made in stem cell-based therapy for ischemic stroke, which is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Various stem cells from bone marrow, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), have shown therapeutic potential for stroke. Concomitant with these exciting findings are some fundamental bottlenecks that must be overcome in order to accelerate their clinical translation, including the low survival and engraftment caused by the harsh microenvironment after transplantation. In this chapter, strategies such as gene modification, hypoxia/growth factor preconditioning, and biomaterial-based methods to improve cell survival and homing are summarized, and the potential strategies for their future application are also discussed.

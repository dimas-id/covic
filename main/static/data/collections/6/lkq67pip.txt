The chicken has a different repertoire of tissues, cells and genes of the immune response compared to mammals, yet generally survives infection with viral, bacterial, protozoal and fungal pathogens, and also worms and ectoparasites, just like mammals. Poultry are also probably the most heavily vaccinated group of farmed animals. Antigen presentation to the adaptive immune response therefore obviously normally occurs efficiently in birds. Although comparatively much is known about macrophages and B cells in the chicken, there is as yet little work on the other, professional, antigen-presenting cells, the dendritic cells (DC). Birds also have at least two other sets of phagocytic cells, heterophils and thrombocytes, which may also have the ability to present antigen. Here we review the current state of knowledge about antigen presenting cells in the chicken, concentrating mainly on recent advances in our knowledge of DC.

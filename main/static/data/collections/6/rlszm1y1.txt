Abstract Pandemics such as COVID-19 bring significant challenges for all health services, especially those in low-to low-middle income countries, where access to supplement and expand services may be difficult. For these countries with a limited workforce the loss of key workers to the illness itself or the need to self-isolate following contact can paralyse service delivery. This article looks at some of the issues that may arise and strategies to overcome them. It includes a case study from Viet Nam illustrating the need for a rapid integrated response to contact and prevent further outbreaks. Caring for COVID-19 patients is a heavily dependent on the skills and expertise of the nurses. There is therefore a need to share nursing interventions that can be implemented without major resource implications in all hospital departments.

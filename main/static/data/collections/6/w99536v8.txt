The fulminant nature of group A streptococcal sepsis poses impressive challenges from diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. Most patients are seen early in the course of infection by primary care providers or emergency department physicians and sent home, only to return in 12 to 24 hours with fully developed group A streptococcal sepsis. Early diagnosis is imperative, but the clinician must have a high index of suspicion. Often, the diagnosis is established only after aggressive interventional management has begun. This review emphasizes salient clinical features and provides general recommendations for critical care management.

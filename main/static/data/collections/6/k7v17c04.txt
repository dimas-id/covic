Abstract The antigenic structure of the S glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) has been determined and correlated with the physical structure. Four antigenic sites have been defined (A, B, C, and D). The sites involved in the neutralization of TGEV are: A, D, and B, sites A and D being antigenically dominant for TGEV neutralization in vitro. These two sites have specific properties of interest: site A is highly conserved and is present in coronaviruses of three animal species, and site D can be represented by synthetic peptides. Both sites might be relevant in protection in vivo. PRCV does not have sites B and C, due to a genomic deletion. Complex antigenic sites, i.e., conformation and glycosylation dependent sites, have been represented by simple mimotopes selected from a library expressing recombinant peptides with random sequences, or by anti-idiotypic internal image monoclonal antibodies. An epidemiological tree relating the TGEVs and PRCVs has been proposed. The estimated mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 substitutions per nucleotide and year indicates that TGEV related coronaviruses show similar variability to other RNA viruses. In order to induce secretory immunity, different segments of the S gene have been expressed using avirulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium and adenovirus. These vectors, with a tropism for Peyer's patches may be ideal candidates in protection against TGEV.

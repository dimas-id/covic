OPINION STATEMENT The incidence of vascular access site related complications ranges between 0.8 % to 1.8 % of diagnostic cardiac catheterization and up to 9 % of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1]. The femoral vessels at the groin are used as the access site for the majority of percutaneous coronary, peripheral arterial and venous, and electrophysiologic interventions. With emergence of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR), and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), larger access sheaths (up to 18Fr-24Fr) are required, which further increases the potential for access site complications. The true incidence of access site complications arising from non-coronary interventions is unknown; hence it is likely that the total incidence of vascular access site complications is greatly underestimated. Vascular closure devices (VCDs), radial artery access, fluoroscopic guidance, and ultrasound guidance have all been used with a hope to minimize these complications. Despite these attempts, vascular access complications have not been eliminated. Cardiovascular specialists must promptly identify these complications and manage them appropriately.

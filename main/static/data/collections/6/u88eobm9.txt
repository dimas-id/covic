The Seeplex RV Detection kit was used to identify specific respiratory viruses from specimens collected during respiratory outbreaks in the Greater Toronto Area from 1 September 2007 to 1 February 2008. Two hundred-thirty-one patient samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) were collected from 63 respiratory outbreaks. The distribution of outbreaks characterized by molecular means was: 30% (n=19) no identification; 52.5% (n=33) one pathogen; 14.5% (n=9) two pathogens; and 3% (n=2) three pathogens. In contrast, culture-based protocols identified pathogens in fewer outbreaks: 63 % (n=40) no identification; 35% (n=22) 1 pathogen; and 2% (n=1) 2 pathogens (p<0.05). Compared to virus isolation, molecular testing identified a greater proportion of positive specimens for rhinovirus: 22% (n=51/231) vs 5% (n=12/231) (p=0.01); and RSV A/B: 12% (n=27/231) vs 5% (n=11/231) (p<0.05). Superiority of the molecular assay to detect rhinovirus and RSV outbreaks compared to culture is evident from this study.

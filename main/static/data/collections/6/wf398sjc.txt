OBJECTIVE We evaluated the efficacy of low-voltage coagulation (LVC) with polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil, GUNZE Ltd., Japan) and fibrin glue to control intraoperative alveolar air leaks after lung surgery. METHODS We included 176 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomies. When alveolar air leak was confirmed after lung resection, we applied LVC system to the pleural defect followed by layers of PGA sheets and fibrin glue (n = 40). We then analyzed postoperative air leaks (rate of occurrence and duration time). RESULTS 73% of patients (29/40 cases) experienced no postoperative air leaks. Although 11 patients experienced air leaks after surgery, there were no prolonged air leaks (>7 days) (resolution time, 3.5 Â± 1.4 days; range, 2-6 days). Two patients required drainage for late-onset air leaks, but their conditions improved without further treatment. There were no further adverse events. CONCLUSIONS The use of LVC with PGA sheets and fibrin glue following pulmonary resection efficiently prevented both intraoperative air leaks and prolonged air leaks after lung surgery.

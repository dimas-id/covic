The outbreak of COVID‐19 has stricken more than 203,000 people in Italy up to 30(th) of April 2020, with over 27,000 died according to official estimates(1). While Italy was one of the most affected countries in Europe, the impact of the disease in the southern part of the state was less dramatic than in the north, due to some still not understood reasons. Particularly in Sicily, ‘only’ 3,140 cases have been recorded, of whom 533 encountered in the province of Messina.

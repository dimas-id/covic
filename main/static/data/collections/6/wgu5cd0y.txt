Abstract Little is known about how plant viruses of a single species exhibit different movement behavior in different host species. Two Cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) isolates, M1 and M2, were studied. Both can infect Phalaenopsis orchids, but only M1 can systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Protoplast inoculation and whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that both isolates can replicate in N. benthamiana; however, M2 was restricted to the initially infected cells. Genome shuffling between M1 and M2 revealed that two control modes are involved in CymMV host dependent movement. The M1 coat protein (CP) plays a dominant role in controlling CymMV movement between cells, because all chimeric CymMV viruses containing the M1 CP systemically infected N. benthamiana plants. Without the M1 CP, one chimeric virus containing the combination of the M1 triple gene block proteins (TGBps), the M2 5′ RNA (1–4333), and the M2 CP effectively moved in N. benthamiana plants. Further complementation analysis revealed that M1 TGBp1 and TGBp3 are co-required to complement the movement of the chimeric viruses in N. benthamiana. The amino acids within the CP, TGBp1 and TGBp3 which are required or important for CymMV M2 movement in N. benthamiana plants were mapped. The required amino acids within the CP map to the predicted RNA binding domain. RNA–protein binding assays revealed that M1 CP has higher RNA binding affinity than does M2 CP. Yeast two-hybrid assays to detect all possible interactions of M1 TGBps and CP, and only TGBp1 and CP self-interactions were observed.

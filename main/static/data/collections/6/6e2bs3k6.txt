Camels have cultural value in the Arab society and are considered one of the most important animals in the Arabian Peninsula and arid environments, due to the distinct characteristics of their meat and milk. Moreover, there is a great interest in camel racing and beauty shows. Therefore, treatment of elite animals, increasing the number of camels as well as genetic improvement is an essential demand. Because there are unique camels for milk production, meat, or in racing, the need to propagate genetically superior camels is urgent. Recent biotechnological approaches such as stem cells hold great promise for biomedical research, genetic engineering, and as a model for studying early mammalian developmental biology. Establishment of stem cells lines from camels would tremendously facilitate regenerative medicine for genetically superior camels, permit the gene targeting of the camel genome and the generation of genetically modified animal and be a mean for genome conservation for the elite breeds. In this mini-review, we show the current research, future horizons and potential applications for camel stem cells.

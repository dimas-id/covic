Serological assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are now of critical importance to support diagnosis, guide epidemiological intervention, and understand immune response to natural infection and vaccine administration. We developed and validated new anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA tests (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.) based on whole-virus antigens. We used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions. Overall, the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially for IgG and IgA, we observed high sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively); specificity was high (>96%) for all antibody types ELISAs. In addition, sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset (DSO) due to the seroconversion window, and for ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 DSO, respectively. The results showed that ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, covering all different antibody types developed in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.

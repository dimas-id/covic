BACKGROUND: No studies investigated the prevalence of arrhythmias among clinically-stable patients affected by COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We assessed prevalence, type, and burden of arrhythmias, by a single-day snapshot in seven non-intensive COVID Units at a third-level center. RESULTS: We enrolled 132 inhospital patients (mean age 65Â±14y; 66% males) newly diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Arrhythmic episodes were detected in 12 patients (9%). In detail, 8 had atrial fibrillation, and 4 self-limiting supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. There were no cases of ventricular arrhythmias or new-onset atrioventricular blocks. In addition, we report no patients with QTc interval >450 ms. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-day snapshot survey suggests that the prevalence of arrhythmias among clinically stable COVID-19 patients is low. In particular, no life-threatening arrhythmic events occurred.

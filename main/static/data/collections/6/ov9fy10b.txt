The host-associated defence system responsible for the clearance of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from infected pigs is currently poorly understood. To better understand the dynamics of hostâ€“pathogen interactions, seventy-five of 100 pigs infected with PRRSV-JA142 and 25 control pigs were euthanized at 3, 10, 21, 28 and 35 days post-challenge (dpc). Blood, lung, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial lymph node (BLN) samples were collected to evaluate the cellular immune responses. The humoral responses were evaluated by measuring the levels of anti-PRRSV IgG and serum virus-neutralizing (SVN) antibodies. Consequently, the highest viral loads in the sera and lungs of the infected pigs were detected between 3 and 10 dpc, and these resulted in moderate to mild interstitial pneumonia, which resolved accompanied by the clearance of most of the virus by 28 dpc. At peak viremia, the frequencies of alveolar macrophages in infected pigs were significantly decreased, whereas the monocyte-derived DC/macrophage and conventional DC frequencies were increased, and these effects coincided with the early induction of local T-cell responses and the presence of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the lungs, BAL, and BLN as early as 10 dpc. Conversely, the systemic T-cell responses measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were delayed and significantly induced only after the peak viremic stage between 3 and 10 dpc. Taken together, our results suggest that activation of immune responses in the lung could be the key elements for restraining PRRSV through the early induction of T-cell responses at the sites of virus replication.

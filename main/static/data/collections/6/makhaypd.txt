The virion of the Aichi virus contains a single-stranded RNA molecule as the genome. The homology of Aichi virus structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1) with corresponding polypeptides of other picornaviruses varies between 19% and 32%. The epidemiology of the Aichi virus as a medically important pathogen has not been well defined. Stool samples from adult patients in six oyster-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks were examined for variation, based on their reactivity with a monoclonal antibody raised against the standard strain (A486/88) and on reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) of three genomic regions. Antibody to the Aichi virus could be detected using a neutralization test and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These methods were used for the identification of Aichi virus infection in paired serum samples. The chapter concludes with a discussion on other diarrheagenic enteroviruses.

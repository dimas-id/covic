Telemedicine could solve the problem of the lack of infrastructure and insufficient number of qualified healthcare staff in many countries/regions. The aim of this research is to investigate the futures of such solution by having a better understanding of the acceptance of the Telemedicine Cabin by high-educated Millennials. To reach this goal, a survey was built using specific dimensions to measure the perception of Telemedicine Cabin, the Unified-Theory-of-Acceptance-and-Use-of-Technology 2(nd) version (UTAUT2) and finally the Personal Innovativeness and the Privacy Concern scales. Our sample was composed of 158 students from different Business Schools and data were analysed using a Partial Least Approach. Findings highlight the key role of all Telemedicine Cabin dimensions (Accessibility, Availability and Compatibility) on Performance Expectancy, the importance of three UTAUT2 constructs (Performance Expectancy, Price Value and Habit) and the negative impact of Privacy Concern on the Intention to Use a Telemedicine Cabin. In addition, results demonstrate that Personal Innovativeness does not affect the Intention to Use Telemedicine Cabin.

Evidence for the involvement of viruses,Mycoplasma pneumoniae, andChlamydia spp. was studied by the complement fixation test in paired sera from 310 young adults (297 men and 13 women) with acute maxillary sinusitis. The diagnosis of acute sinusitis was confirmed by radiography and sinus puncture. Elevated antibody titres were found in 102 patients (33%). A four fold or greater titre rise was detected in 21.5%, and a high stable titre suggestive of recent viral infection was present in a further 11.5%. Adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, andMycoplasma pneumoniae accounted for most of the elevated antibody titres. Elevated titres were found in 79 (32%) of the 245 patients with purulent maxillary sinusitis (pathogenic bacteria isolated in sinus secretion) and in 23 (35%) of the 65 patients with non-purulent sinusitis (no pathogenic bacteria isolated). About 90% of the fourfold or greater titre rises in bacteriologically negative cases were due to adeno- or influenza viruses. A fourfold rise in antibody titre was also found in 7 of 101 control patients (7%). The results of this study suggest that respiratory viruses andMycoplasma pneumoniae may be potential etiological agents in acute maxillary sinusitis, either alone or in combination with the common bacterial pathogens of sinusitis.

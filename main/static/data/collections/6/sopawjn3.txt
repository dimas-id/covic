Serological investigations were performed between 1977-1978 with 972 serum samples from 243 subjects having either direct (group A) or sporadic (group B) occupational contact with wastewater or sludge. the control group (C) was represented by 100 persons having no contact with such material. The sera were tested against influenza, parainfluenza, adeno-, herpes, coronavirus, rickettsial and chlamydial antigens, as well as for the presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs. Statistically significant differences between group A and groups B and C were found as regards the prevalence of antibodies to adenovirus and parainfluenza virus type 1 antigens.

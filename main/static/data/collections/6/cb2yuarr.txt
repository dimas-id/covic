Biosurveillance is crucial to detect, identify and minimise the negative consequences of infectious disease. Its value to society and importance to global public health and global health security are growing. Despite the long history and global importance of biosurveillance, a systematic review of all existing biosurveillance systems across the 'One Health' spectrum has not yet been published. This study conducted a systematic review to identify all extant and defunct biosurveillance systems from 1900 to 2016. Of the 815 systems examined, the majority surveyed human, animal or plant data discretely. Some 105 collected human and animal data, whereas only 31 collected data on all three categories. The authors found a large increase in the number of global biosurveillance systems between 1900 and 2008, but a reduction in the number of biosurveillance systems from 2008 to the present. The number of syndromic systems created, versus laboratory-based biosurveillance systems, increased rapidly after 1980 across the globe.

This review provides an insight into the various opportunities for vaccine intervention, analysis of strategies for vaccine development, vaccine ability to modulate immune responses and resultant rational vaccine design. In addition, wider aspects are considered, such as biotechnological advances, advances in immunological understanding and hostâ€“pathogen interactions. The key question addressed here is, with all our research and understanding, have we reached a new echelon in vaccine development, that of rational design?

DNA replication in metazoan cells initiates at multiple discrete chromosomal sites called replication origins. Recent genome-wide studies have mapped thousands of origins in animal and plant cells, but without yielding a distinct and universal consensus sequence. However, origin-associated regions with particular base composition features have been identified, such as the G-rich OGRE motif, predicted to form G-quadruplexes. Epigenetic marks such as histone modifications that promote open chromatin also favor origin formation. Before DNA replication can initiate at origins, they need to be “licensed” by the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and other proteins to form pre-replication and pre-initiation complexes. Origin-associated proteins are themselves subject to multilayered regulation, notably by posttranslational modification and proteasomal degradation. Origins are organized into replicons and replicon clusters, whose firing occurs at discrete subnuclear bodies known as replication foci. A still poorly characterized nuclear matrix structure might be involved in the attachment of replication units and the formation of replication foci. Preferential genomic sequences responsible for these attachments have been reported, as well as factors playing roles in their regulation. There appears to be great flexibility in the choice of origins used in each S-phase, being affected by factors including cell identity and replication stresses. Origin selection also changes dramatically during embryogenesis in concert with developmental signaling pathways. Dysregulation of origin positioning and recognition are implicated in human disease, as mutations in origin-binding proteins have been found in developmental disorders, and expansions in repeat-containing genomic regions promote genome instability. This chapter summarizes current understanding about replication origins, the most recent discoveries, and outlines key unanswered questions in this exciting field.

BACKGROUND Reduced cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) is associated with increased risk of ischemic events in carotid steno-occlusive diseases. OBJECTIVE To determine whether pretreatment CVR can predict postoperative ischemic lesions after carotid artery stenting (CAS) by retrospective analysis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 46 patients (42 men; mean age 74.2±8.3 years) who underwent CAS and preprocedural cerebral blood flow measurement by quantitative single-photon emission CT. Ischemic lesions were evaluated by diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 72 h after the intervention. We also evaluated plaque characteristics using black-blood MR plaque imaging. RESULTS New ipsilateral DWI-positive lesions were found in 11 cases (23.9%). Patients were classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of new DWI-positive lesions, and no significant differences in characteristics were found between the DWI-positive and DWI-negative groups, except for age and CVR of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The DWI-positive group was significantly older than the DWI-negative group (79.7±4.1 vs 72.5±8.6 years; p=0.0085) and had lower average regional CVR (1.4±18.2% vs 22.4±25.8%; p=0.016). MR plaque imaging showed no significant difference in relative overall plaque MR signal intensity between the two groups (1.53±0.37 vs 1.34±0.26; p=0.113). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, lower CVR of the ipsilateral MCA territory (<11%) was the only independent risk factor for new ischemic lesions following CAS (OR=6.99; 95% CI 1.17 to 41.80; p=0.033). CONCLUSIONS Impaired pretreatment CVR was associated with increased incidence of new infarction after CAS.

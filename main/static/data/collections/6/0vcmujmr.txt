OBJECTIVES Our primary objective was to assess the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) using indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging for uterine and cervical malignancies. METHODS NIR fluorescence imaging for the robotic platform was obtained at our institution in 12/2011. We identified all cases planned for SLN mapping using fluorescence imaging from 12/2011-4/2013. Intracervical ICG was the fluorophobe in all cases. Four cc (1.25mg/mL) of ICG was injected into the cervix alone divided into the 3- and 9-o'clock positions, with 1 cc deep into the stroma and 1 cc submucosally before initiating laparoscopic entry. Blue dye was concurrently injected in some cases. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-seven cases were performed. Median age was 60 years (range, 28-90 years). Median BMI was 30.2 kg/m(2) (range, 18-60 kg/m(2)). The median SLN count was 3 (range, 1-23). An SLN was identified in 216 cases (95%), with bilateral pelvic mapping in 179 (79%). An aortic SLN was identified in 21 (10%) of the 216 mapped cases. When ICG alone was used to map cases, 188/197 patients mapped, for a 95% detection rate compared to 93% (28/30) in cases in which both dyes were used (P=NS). Bilateral mapping was seen in 156/197 (79%) ICG-only cases and 23/30 (77%) ICG and blue dye cases (P=NS). CONCLUSIONS NIR fluorescence imaging with intracervical ICG injection using the robotic platform has a high bilateral SLN detection rate and appears favorable to using blue dye alone and/or other modalities. Combined use of ICG and blue dye appears unnecessary.

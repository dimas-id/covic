Using six monoclonal antibodies to epitopes a-f on the glycoprotein E2 of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) we found antigenic differences between E2 in infected cells and in virus particles, respectively, if glycosylation was impaired by 2-deoxy-D-glucose or inhibited by N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin. Furthermore we concluded that a conformational change of E2 takes place on virus budding.

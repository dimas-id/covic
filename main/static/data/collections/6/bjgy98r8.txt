A candidate treatment for COVID-19 has shown convincing—albeit modest—benefit for the first time in a large, carefully controlled clinical trial in hospitalized patients The infected people who received remdesivir, an experimental drug made by Gilead Sciences that cripples an enzyme several viruses use to copy their RNA, recovered in an average of 11 days versus 15 in patients who received a placebo “Although a 31% improvement doesn’t seem like a knockout, 100% [success], it is a very important proof of concept,” said Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), during an Oval Office meeting in which President Donald Trump was asked by media about a statement Gilead had released on the results The patients treated with remdesivir also had a lower mortality rate—8% versus 11 6% in the group given the placebo—but this positive trend did not reach statistical significance, Fauci noted (The full results from the trial have not been made public in a preprint or peer-reviewed paper )

Abstract The eye is susceptible to adverse toxic effects by direct application, inadvertent ocular contact, or systemic exposure to chemicals or their metabolites. Although the albino rat is a less than ideal model for ocular toxicity studies, it has gained popularity for specific applications and may be the first species in which the ocular toxicity of a systemically administered xenobiotic becomes evident. This chapter reviews the embryology, anatomy, and physiology of the eye and associated glands and describes common nonneoplastic and neoplastic lesions encountered in laboratory rats.

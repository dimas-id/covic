The cancer risk of nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus is very low (0.33-0.5 per year). Therefore, any endoscopic ablation technique is an overtreatment. Patients with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia confirmed by a specialized GI pathologist seem to have a significant risk for developing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or cancer. Therefore, endoscopic treatment in this case seems to be justified. However, up to now there has been no prospective study supporting this. In recent years, endoscopic treatment of HGIN and mucosal Barrett's cancer has become a widely accepted treatment approach and even the therapy of choice in many countries. Endoscopic resection (ER) is the best validated treatment method in patients with HGIN and mucosal Barrett's cancer, and is widely used all over the world. In contrast to ablative treatment methods like argon plasma coagulation and radiofrequency ablation, ER allows histological assessment of the resected specimen in order to assess the depth of infiltration of the tumor. However, ER of the neoplastic lesions should always be followed by ablation of the nondysplastic remaining Barrett's esophagus in order to reduce the risk of recurrence or metachronous neoplasia. The long-time complete remission rate with this two-step strategy is â‰¥95%. A matter of continuing debate is whether patients with Barrett's cancer infiltrating the upper third of the mucosal layer (pT1sm1) can be treated by ER. Data from our and other centers indicate that a subgroup of patients with pT1sm1 adenocarcinomas without the presence of risk factors (poor differentiation grade, lymph or blood vessel infiltration, size >20 mm, ulcerated lesion) have a very low risk for lymph node metastasis (<2%) and endoscopic therapy can be an alternative to radical surgery.

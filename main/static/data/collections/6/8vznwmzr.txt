The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of bovine torovirus (BoTV) in bovine fecal samples from diarrhea cases submitted to the Ohio Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL) and to assess if a relationship exists between BoTV and the other enteric pathogens detected. From November 1999 to May 2001, 259 specimens from 53 calves (< or = 6 months old), 27 young adults (52 years), 125 adults (> or = 2 years), and 54 animals of unknown age were examined by an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay developed to detect BoTV. Testing for other enteric pathogens was performed by ADDL, and the results were analyzed with the BoTV data. The BoTV was detected using ELISA or RT-PCR in 9.7% (25/259) of the clinical samples, 56% (14/25) of which were from calves (P < 0.001) representing 26.4% (14/53) of the calves tested. Of the BoTV-positive calves, 71% (10/14) were less than 3 weeks of age. In 11/25 positive specimens, BoTV was the only pathogen detected among those examined. Other enteric organisms detected alone or in combination with BoTV in calf samples were rotavirus, coronavirus, Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.; but no consistent association between BoTV and these organisms was observed. In summary, BoTV was detected in fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea, principally in young calves less than 3 weeks of age. Future studies of infectious diarrhea in cattle should also include assays for this etiologic agent.

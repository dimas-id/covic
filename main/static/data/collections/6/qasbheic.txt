Many bacterial and archaeal genomes are of a similar size to molecules that have been cloned in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and thus might be clonable as single, circular episomes in this host. Yeast offers a variety of efficient tools for the manipulation and study of cloned DNA. One strategy to clone a genome in yeast is to cotransform yeast spheroplasts with the genome of interest and a linear yeast vector whose termini are homologous to a spot in the genome. Clones are selected on auxotrophic medium and then screened for completeness and size; they may also be sequenced.

In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we are seeing widespread disease burden affecting patients of all ages across the globe. However, much remains to be understood as clinicians, epidemiologists, and researchers alike are working to describe and characterize the disease process while caring for patients at the frontlines. We describe the case of a 6-month-old infant admitted and diagnosed with classic Kawasaki disease, who also screened positive for COVID-19 in the setting of fever and minimal respiratory symptoms. The patient was treated per treatment guidelines, with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose aspirin, and subsequently defervesced with resolution of her clinical symptoms. The patient's initial echocardiogram was normal, and she was discharged within 48 hours of completion of her intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, with instruction to quarantine at home for 14 days from the date of her positive test results for COVID-19. Further study of the clinical presentation of pediatric COVID-19 and the potential association with Kawasaki disease is warranted, as are the indications for COVID-19 testing in the febrile infant.

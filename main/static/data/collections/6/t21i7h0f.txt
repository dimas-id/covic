We describe the characteristics of 31 people living with HIV (PLWH) hospitalized for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. All patients were on antiretroviral therapy and virologically suppressed at the time of admission. Clinical course and outcomes were similar to those reported in other hospitalized cohorts.

INTRODUCTION The diagnosis of intraoperative anaphylaxis is important but can be difficult as the symptoms can be varying and dependent on patient factors. PRESENTATION OF CASE We describe an acute, unexpected and life threatening cardiovascular (CV) collapse, presumed to be due to an acute anaphylactic reaction secondary to gelatin administration, following induction of general anaesthesia (GA), in an ASA 3 patient scheduled for axillo-bifemoral bypass. DISCUSSION The management of the profound cardiovascular (CV) collapse was greatly assisted by sophisticated haemodynamic, depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oximetry monitoring.(1) As far as we are aware this is the first such case where the full haemodynamic, depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oxygenation changes during CV collapse, presumed due to an acute anaphylactic reaction under GA have been fully documented. CONCLUSION The use of advanced monitoring intraoperatively proved extremely useful in guiding the resuscitation of a life threatening allergic reaction under general anaesthesia.

Graphene oxide and its derivatives have lately been the subject of increased attention in the field of bioscience and biotechnology. In this article, we report on the use of graphene oxide (GO) derivatives to inhibit herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infections, mimicking the cell surface receptor heparan sulfate, and the GO derivatives compete with the latter in binding HSV-1. The inhibition does not affect cell-to-cell spreading. Media content has a significant effect on the inhibition properties of the nanomaterials. These have no cytotoxic effect, suggesting that this is a promising approach for the development of antiviral surfaces and for diagnostic purposes.

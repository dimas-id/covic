Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19; caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2) is a currently global health problem. Previous studies showed that blocking nucleocytoplasmic transport with exportin 1 (XPO1) inhibitors originally developed as anticancer drugs can quarantine key viral accessory proteins and genomic materials in the nucleus of host cell and reduce virus replication and immunopathogenicity. These observations support the concept of the inhibition of nuclear export as an effective strategy against an array of viruses, including influenza A, B, and SARS-CoV. Clinical studies using the XPO1 inhibitor selinexor as a therapy for COVID-19 infection are in progress.

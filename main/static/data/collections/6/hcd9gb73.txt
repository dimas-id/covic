Pulmonary infection is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Many infections occur in individuals with concomitant intrapulmonary or extrathoracic diseases; however, they commonly develop in otherwise healthy people. In the non-immunocompromised population, pneumonia is the most prevalent community-acquired infection and the second most common nosocomial infectious disorder. In immunocompromised patients, in children, and in the elderly, pneumonia, as well as other pulmonary infections, may develop into a life-threatening condition.

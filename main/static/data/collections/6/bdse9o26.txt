We have investigated novel vaccine strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV using cDNA constructs encoding the structural antigens: (S), (M), (E), or (N) protein, derived from SARS CoV. PBL from healthy human volunteers were administered i.p. into IL-2 receptor Î³-chain disrupted SCID mice, and SCID-PBL/hu mice were constructed. These mice can be used to analyze the human immune response in vivo. SARS M DNA vaccine and N DNA vaccine induced human CTL specific for SARS CoV antigens. Alternatively, SARS M DNA vaccines inducing human neutralizing antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies against SARS CoV are now being developed. These results show that these vaccines can induce virus-specific immune responses and should provide a useful tool for development of protective and therapeutic vaccines.

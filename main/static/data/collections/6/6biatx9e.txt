The 2020 COVID pandemic has forced everyone to update the usual medical procedures and adapt them to a new situation characterized by a high risk of contamination of the health operator. The placement of a venous access device is no exception. In the experience of the vascular access team of our hospital, hit by the COVID epidemic in March 2020, the safety of both the patient and the staff can be ensured by an insertion bundle of few smart strategies, which include choice of long dwelling peripheral catheters (midline catheters) rather than short venous cannulas; use of power injectable peripherally inserted central catheters in the COVID patients in intensive care unit requiring a central line; use of wireless probes-easy to carry, easy to clean-for ultrasound guided venipuncture; avoidance of x-rays, using alternative methods for tip location such as intracavitary electrocardiography or trans-thoracic echocardiography; strict adoption of the barrier precautions recommended by the international guidelines.

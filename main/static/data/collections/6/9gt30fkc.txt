A skin rash has been reported in 2 out of 1.099 patients presenting with Coronavirus disease 2019 in China [1], as in 14 of 48 patients with the same disease in Italia, but unfortunately without further description of its semiology [2]. We wish to report here the case of a woman who presented, coincidently with Covid‐19, a skin rash that had an original picture.

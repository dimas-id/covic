Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, the public-facility-turned temporary hospital (PFTH) has played an important role in preventing the spread of the epidemic. Wuchang PFTH is the first one to put into clinical practice and the last one suspended in Wuhan. The National Emergency Medical Rescue Team of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, together with other 13 medical teams (841 medical staff in total), have fulfilled the task for the treatment of non-severe COVID-19 patients, without any medical staff infected. The first author of the article was the only pediatrician working in the Wuchang PFTH. The author describes and summarizes the features/functions, management/operations, and advantages/challenges of the PFTH, in order to provide reference for medical institutions and relevant departments to deal with public health emergencies.

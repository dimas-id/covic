There are currently numerous suggestions on the potential effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)/acupuncture in the treatment of SARS-CoV‑2 infections and their associated symptoms. These reflections are based on molecular virology and clinical investigations resulting from the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003. The antiviral properties of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) against SARS-CoV‑2 have not yet been investigated in depth. Clinical data relies on studies conducted prior to the corona pandemic. Current data is limited to a few internationally published case reports and observational studies published in China. There is a promising number of ongoing registered clinical trials. Evidence regarding TCM treatments other than CHM is poor. Based on the available data, a combination of Western and TCM approaches in the Western Hemisphere seems justified only if all conventional treatments are exhausted.

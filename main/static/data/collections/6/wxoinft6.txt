Little evidence exists to guide the clinician caring for pregnant patients with infectious morbidities. The already‐small pool of evidence shrinks rapidly as the pathogen becomes more exotic, making therapeutic decisions increasingly speculative when emerging infectious diseases appear in the pregnant patient.

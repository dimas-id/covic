Now, more and more complete video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (cVATS) surgeons are capable of performing lobectomy by uniportal approach. However, concerns regarding the safety of uniportal procedures for complex cases such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, bronchial sleeves or vascular reconstructions still remains. As experience with uniportal VATS has increased, its application toward more technically demanding operations has also expanded. This article describes a uniportal cVATS left upper lobectomy with partial pulmonary arterioplasty for lung cancer with calcified lymph nodes. In order to reduce the risk of bleeding, we looped the left main pulmonary artery and applied two-stage maneuvering for left upper lobe (LUL) bronchus, cut the bronchus at the distal end and close the stump using a stapler at the end, which are conducive to maximal safety.

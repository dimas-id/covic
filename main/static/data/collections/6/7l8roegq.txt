This chapter studies control strategies. Control strategies are listed and explained. It focuses on modeling vaccination in single-strain and multistrain diseases. Different modes of introducing vaccination in models are shown. Imperfect vaccination as a mechanism leading to backward bifurcation and strain replacement is explained. Strain replacement with perfect vaccination is demonstrated. Quarantine and isolation are discussed and included in a model. Introduction to optimal control theory is incorporated and the theory is illustrated on a specific example with optimal control treatment. Matlab code for computing the optimal control is included.

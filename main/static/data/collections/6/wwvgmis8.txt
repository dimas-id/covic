OBJECTIVE To evaluate the haemostatic efficacy and safety of the LigaSure vessel sealing system in major head and neck cancer surgery. METHODS This two-year, prospective study included 34 patients who underwent major head and neck cancer surgery at a university hospital. The LigaSure Precise handpiece and LigaSure 8 vessel sealing system were utilised as the primary means of haemostasis, except when sealing vessels larger than 7 mm in diameter. Surgical outcomes were evaluated. In addition, in each patient the diameter of the largest vein and artery sealed (all were >2 mm) was measured before sealing. RESULTS In all cases except one (33/34 patients), a sutureless technique was performed. Post-operative bleeding was observed in two cases. Thirty veins and 22 arteries were measured. The mean diameter of the largest sealed vein was 3.8 mm, while that of the largest sealed artery was 2.7 mm. CONCLUSION Our experience indicates that the surgical technique described is safe and effective. The main advantages of the LigaSure system are that it simplifies the procedure and eliminates the need for clips and suture ligations.

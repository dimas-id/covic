Abstract Background Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) detection in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from infants with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) does not prove the hRSV etiology of the current ARTI episode. HRSV RNA quantification may help in affording this issue. Objectives hRSV was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in NPAs taken upon admission to hospital and, whenever possible, at discharge and subsequent medical visits. Study design Prospective study, including 63 infants affected by either hRSV upper or lower ARTI. Results Based on the kinetics of viral load, hRSV etiology was identified in 25 infants in whom hRSV load dropped from 2.5×106 upon admission (presence of respiratory symptoms) to 7.5×102 RNAcopies/ml NPA upon discharge (absence of symptoms) after a median time of 5 days, and in 19 infants, in whom hRSV load was determined at admission only, in association with clinical symptoms (2.4×106 copies/ml). Furthermore, low levels of hRSV RNA (<1×105 copies/ml NPA) identified 14 patients with non-hRSV ARTI. Finally, in 14 infants with hRSV coinfections or sequential infections, hRSV quantification defined the hRSV role in the current ARTI episode. Conclusions hRSV RNA quantification is critical in defining the hRSV role in respiratory infections.

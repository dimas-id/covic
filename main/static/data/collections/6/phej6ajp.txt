Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the primary causative organism in corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) infections, is a novel member of the human coronavirus family which was first identified in Wuhan, China, towards the end of 2019. This letter reveals new vital missing links in our current understanding of the mechanisms that lead to cell death triggered by ferroptotic stress in COVID-19 infection. It further reveal the importance of homocysteine mediated trans-sulfuration pathway in COVID-19 infection. Hence, Vitamin B6, folic acid, and Vitamin B12 should be incorporated in the treatment regimen for SARS CoV-2 infections to suppress complications, as the virus mediates altered host cell metabolism.

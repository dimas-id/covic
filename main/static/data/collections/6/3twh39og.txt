Abstract Alumina has been extensively used due to its high toughness and hardness, low bulk density, and thermal stability without interaction with the matrix at high temperature. However, the non-conductivity at room temperature narrows its broader applications. Carbon nanotube (CNT) is a suitable candidate to adjust the electrical property of alumina matrix composites due to its high electrical conductivity. By using material extrusion 3D printing (ME3DP), we fabricated 3D CNT/alumina green bodies using inks with controlled rheological properties for high printability. The printed green bodies with CNT loading from 3 wt% to 10 wt% were thermally treated to remove binders and sinter the 3D parts at temperatures from 900 to 1400 Â°C. The sintered samples showed a good dispersion of CNT in the alumina matrix and improved electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the composites measured up to 10-1 S/m at 7 wt.% CNT loading, compared to the electrical conductivity of 10-13 S/m of pure alumina.

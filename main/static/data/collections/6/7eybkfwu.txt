Although it usually occurs in adolescents aged from 15 to 24 years old, it is not uncommon to develop in adults either. Boys are more frequently affected, particularly with severe forms of the disease.An adequate and continuous treatment of the disease is required in order to reduce acne lesions, prevent permanent scarring and limit the duration of the disorder.

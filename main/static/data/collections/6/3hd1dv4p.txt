The COVID-19 pandemic has caused critical staff shortages and thus required innovative approaches to bring providers into the hospital workforce (1), including those who may not have performed inpatient general medicine care for many years. Our educational group felt an urgent need to create educational content to re-familiarize these anxious providers with common inpatient scenarios. Our goal was to rapidly author and distribute high-yield educational resources to non-inpatient medical providers who could be pulled to cover inpatient general medicine services.

Abstract Drug discovery and development are long and financially taxing processes. On an average it takes 12â€“15 years and costs 1.2 billion USD for successful drug discovery and approval for clinical use. Many lead molecules are not developed further and their potential is not tapped to the fullest due to lack of resources or time constraints. In order for a drug to be approved by FDA for clinical use, it must have excellent therapeutic potential in the desired area of target with minimal toxicities as supported by both pre-clinical and clinical studies. The targeted clinical evaluations fail to explore other potential therapeutic applications of the candidate drug. Drug repurposing or repositioning is a fast and relatively cheap alternative to the lengthy and expensive de novo drug discovery and development. Drug repositioning utilizes the already available clinical trials data for toxicity and adverse effects, at the same time explores the drug's therapeutic potential for a different disease. This review addresses recent developments and future scope of drug repositioning strategy.

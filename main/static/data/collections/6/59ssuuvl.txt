In this paper, we proposed the morphing simulation method on the Cartesian grid in order to realize flow simulations for shape optimization with lower cost and versatility. In conventional morphing simulations, a simulation is performed while deforming a model shape and the computational grid using the boundary fitting grid. However, it is necessary to deform the computational grid each time, and it is difficult to apply to a model with complicated shape. The present method does not require grid regeneration or deformation. In order to apply the present method to models with various shapes on the Cartesian grid, the seamless immersed boundary method (SIBM) is used. Normally, when the SIBM is applied to a deformed object, the velocity condition on the boundary is imposed by the moving velocity of the boundary. In the present method, the velocity condition is imposed by zero velocity even if the object is deformed because the purpose of the present morphing simulation is to obtain simulation results for a stationary object. In order to verify the present method, two-dimensional simulations for the flow around an object were performed. In order to obtain drag coefficients of multiple models, the object was deformed in turn from the initial model to each model in the present morphing simulation. By using the present method, the drag coefficients for some models could be obtained by one simulation. It is concluded that the flow simulation for shape optimization can be performed very easily by using the present morphing simulation method.

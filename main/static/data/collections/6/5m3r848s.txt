PURPOSE Prewarming prior to surgery is effective in preventing perioperative hypothermia. There is a paucity of evidence, however, regarding the hemodynamic effects of prewarming. We hypothesized that the nadir mean arterial pressure during anesthesia induction would be higher after prewarming than after no prewarming. METHODS We randomized 32 patients prior to elective neurosurgery to receive either one hour of forced-air convective warming at 46Â°C or routine care (full body blanket with convective warmer attached but not turned on). All patients had invasive blood pressure, heart rate, and core temperature monitoring before and during warming and underwent a protocolized intravenous anesthetic induction with propofol and remifentanil target-controlled infusions. The primary endpoint was the nadir mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during induction. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg, MAP < 60 mmHg, or a reduction in either SBP or MAP > 20% from baseline values. RESULTS No difference was found in the mean (SD) nadir MAP between the prewarmed group and the control group [64 (11) mmHg vs 68 (16) mmHg, respectively; mean difference, 5 mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI), -6 to 15; P = 0.36]. Similarly, there was no difference between groups in the incidence of hypotension (100% of prewarmed vs 93% of control patients; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.23; P = 0.32) or in the requirement for vasopressors during induction (four patients in each group required metaraminol; P = 1.00). CONCLUSION Prewarming with convective forced air for one hour prior to intravenous anesthetic induction did not prevent hypotension during the induction period (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry [ANZCTR] ACTRN12615000431527).

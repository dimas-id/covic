Taro (Colocasia esculenta) corm is a rustic staple food, rich in small starch granules, fibers, and bioactive phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, tannins, phytates, micronutrients, and proteins, including tarin, a GNA‐related lectin. Tarin exhibits recognized biocide activities against viruses and insects, has antitumoral properties and is an immunomodulator molecule candidate. It has been isolated in highly purified form (>90%) from taro corms through low‐cost and single‐step affinity chromatography. It comprises 2‐domain 27 to 28 kDa protomer, posttranslational cleaved into 2 nonidentical monomers, 11.9 and 12.6 kDa, held by noncovalent binding. At least 10 tarin isoforms sharing over 70% similarity have been described. The monomers assume the β‐prism II fold, consisting of 3 antiparallel β‐sheets formed by 4 β‐strands each. Tarin exhibits an expanded‐binding site for complex and high‐mannose N‐glycan chains 49, 212, 213, 358, 465, and 477 found on cell surface antigens of viruses, insects, cancer, and hematopoietic cells, explaining its broad biological activities. Tarin may stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses, enabling hosts to recover from infections or immunosuppressed status inherent to several pathological conditions. In a murine model, tarin stimulates the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of total spleen and bone marrow cells, especially B lymphocytes. Granulocyte repopulation has also been demonstrated in long‐term mice bone marrow cell cultures. As a potential immunomodulator, tarin, administered to immunosuppressed mice, attenuated cyclophosphamide‐induced leukopenia. We propose a molecular model that unites the potential prophylactic and therapeutic action of tarin on hematopoietic and cancer cells, as a potential immunomodulator.

Thromboembolic disease is strongly associated with, or even an integral part of, COVID-19 pneumonia. Indeed, endothelial/microvascular damage to pulmonary capillaries seems to be the main trigger of the pneumonia. Here we report a case of pulmonary embolism in a COVID-19 patient with an atypical clinical presentation. Blood gas analysis and lung ultrasound allowed the correct diagnosis to be reached. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with cardiovascular complications and pulmonary embolisms. Lung ultrasound can aid diagnosis by visualizing small peripheral pulmonary embolisms.

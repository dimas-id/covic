Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic interventions.

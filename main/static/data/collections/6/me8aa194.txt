Once past the lockdown stage in many parts of the world, the important question now concerns the effects of relaxing the lockdown and finding the best ways to implement further lockdown(s), if required, to control the spread. With the relaxation of lockdown, people migrate to different cities and enhances the spread of the virus. In the present work we study a modified SEIRS model with population migration between two cities: a fraction of population in each city is allowed to migrate. Possible infection during transit is also incorporated - a fraction of exposed population becomes infected during transit. A punctuated lockdown is implemented to simulate a protocol of repeated lockdowns that limits the resurgence of infections. A damped oscillatory behavior is observed with multiple peaks over a period.

INTRODUCTION: Many bacteria are responsible for infections in humans and plants, being found in vegetables, water, and medical devices. Most bacterial detection methods are time-consuming and take days to give the result. Aptamers are a promising alternative for a quick and reliable measurement technique to detect bacteria present in food products. Selected aptamers are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that can bind with bacteria or other molecules with affinity and specificity for the target cells by the SELEX or cell-SELEX technique. This method is based on some rounds to remove the non-ligand oligonucleotides, leaving the aptamers specific to bind to the selected bacteria. Compared with conventional methodologies, the detection approach using aptamers is a rapid, low-cost form of analysis. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes obtention methods and applications of aptamers in the food industry and biotechnology. Besides, different techniques with aptamers are presented, which enable more effective target detection. CONCLUSION: Applications of aptamers as biosensors, or the association of aptamers with nanomaterials, may be employed in analyses by colorimetric, fluorescence, or electrical devices. Additionally, more efficient ways of sample preparation are presented, which can support food safety to provide human health, with a low-cost method for contaminant detection.

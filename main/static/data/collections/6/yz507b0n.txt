The management of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure in hemodynamically unstable patients is one of the most challenging situations in critical care medicine. Inadequate therapy, e.g. aggressive fluid resuscitation or invasive ventilation, may even harm patients with pulmonary hypertension. Identifying the underlying etiology therefore remains the primary focus for initiating successful management of patients with decompensated pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure. Pulmonary embolism requires immediate restoration of pulmonary vascular patency. The body of evidence from studies is scarce and favors dobutamine, NO inhalation, and intravenous prostacyclin. However, the use of other vasoactive substances, inotropes, and supportive measures has been successful in individual patients; it should be guided by the expected effects on the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricle, and should be adapted to the patientâ€™s concomitant diseases.

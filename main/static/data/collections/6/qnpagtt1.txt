Serious recurrent and emerging communicable diseases, such as novel influenza strains, highly pathogenic viral hemorrhagic fevers, and novel coronaviruses in an era of increased globalization and travel, necessitate heightened vigilance and preparedness. Last year over four billion persons traveled by air. Systems and processes need to be in place to not just recognize and treat individuals, who harbor a serious pathogen, but also to manage and transport them safely while minimizing the risk of transmission to healthcare workers and others in the community. In this chapter, environmental and administrative controls, work practices, and personal protective equipment necessary to prevent transmission are described for the management and transportation of patients in both the out-of-hospital and hospital settings.

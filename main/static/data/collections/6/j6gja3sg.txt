BACKGROUND Mitomycin C (MMC) and limbal conjunctival autograft (LCAU) are two known useful adjuvants in the prevention of pterygial recurrence. This study was conducted to compare the outcome of these two treatments. METHODS Prospective study on consecutive cases of primary pterygium (February 2001 to March 2002) randomised into two adjuvant groups: (1) intraoperative 0.02% MMC for 5 minutes or (2) LCAU. Patients were followed for recurrence (defined as fibrovascular tissue invading the cornea >1.5mm) and complications for a period of one year. RESULTS 115 eyes in 114 patients who completed the study were randomised to receive MMC (n = 63) and LCAU (n = 52). There were 10 recurrences (15.9%) in the MMC group and only one recurrence (1.9%) in the LCAU group. There was a statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between the two groups (p = 0.04). There were a total of three conjunctival cysts, three symblephara, one granuloma, and one dellen. No other visually significant complications were encountered in either group. CONCLUSION Although LCAU resulted in better one year success rates, it is technically more difficult and inapplicable in cases with previous limbal disturbance. Simple excision followed by MMC or LCAU are both safe and acceptable adjuvants for pterygium excision. Choice of adjuvant should be carefully made based on assessment of recurrence risk, local practices, and surgeon's expertise.

The protein kinase inhibitor dasatinib, targeting BCR-ABL and Src family kinases, is used in chronic myeloid leukaemia and Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb has received one report of nephrotic syndrome associated with the use of dasatinib. With some other protein kinase inhibitors, targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, nephrotic syndrome is a well-known adverse drug reaction. The Dutch and European pharmacovigilance databases and scientific literature contain several cases indicating a causal relationship between dasatinib and nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome was recently added to the list of adverse drug reactions in the Dutch summary of product characteristics for dasatinib. It is important to recognise the possibility of this adverse drug reaction when a patient develops nephrotic syndrome under treatment with dasatinib.

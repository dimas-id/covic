OBJECTIVE To investigate a new therapy for effectively correcting severe hypoxemia in patients with infectious diseases by infusion of oxygen-enriched liquid, in order to raise the partial pressure of blood oxygen without passing through pathologically damaged alveoli of such patients. METHODS Intravenous drip with oxygen-enriched liquids was given to 6 cases suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and 3 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the course of treatment for 1 to 5 days, 500-700 ml per day. RESULTS For all the 9 SARS cases, their hypoxemia was gradually corrected to normal in 20 minutes' or 4 hours' intravenous drip with oxygen-enriched liquid. Respiratory rate decreased from 29-49 breath/min to 18-22 breath/min, heart rate decreased from 89-145 beats/min to 60-79 beats/min, two faint patients regained consciousness, hypoxemia was redressed, partial pressure of oxygen in artery increased from 56 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) to 87 mm Hg, saturation of oxygen increased from 0.89 to 0.96. CONCLUSION Intravenous drip of the oxygen-enriched liquid effectively helped correct the hypoxemia of SARS and other infectious diseases cases by bypassing the diseased alveoli through which oxygen would not pass into the blood by conventional oxygen inhalation. This therapy of oxygen-enriched liquid infusion could be quite life-saving in the combined treatment for SARS and other infectious diseases.

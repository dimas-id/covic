BACKGROUND Flow-diverter stent (FDS) placement for treatment of intracranial aneurysms can cause flow changes in the covered branches. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of the treatment of carotid siphon aneurysms with FDS on the posterior communicating artery (PComA) flow. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2011 and January 2015, 125 carotid siphon aneurysms were treated with FDS. We retrospectively analyzed all cases with PComA ostial coverage. The circle of Willis anatomy was also studied as the flow changes in PComA postoperatively and during angiographic follow-up. Data from neurological examination were also collected. RESULTS Eighteen aneurysms of the carotid siphon in 17 patients were treated with FDS covering the ostium of the PComA. Based on the initial angiography, patients were divided into two groups: the first with a P1/PComA size ratio >1 (10 cases) and the second with a ratio â‰¤1 (8 cases). Follow-up angiography (mean time of 10 months) showed 90% of PComA flow changes in group 1 but only 12.5% in group 2. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.002). Nevertheless, no patient had new symptoms related to these flow changes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, covering the PComA by FDS when treating carotid siphon aneurysms appeared safe and the P1/PComA ratio is a good predictor of flow changes in PComA.

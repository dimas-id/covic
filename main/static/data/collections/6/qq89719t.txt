PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of proteasome inhibitor MG132 in cancer cachexia and to delineate the molecular mechanism underlying. METHODS: We established an experimental cancer cachexia model by subcutaneously implanting colon 26 cells into the armpits of BALB/c mice. Following administration of MG132 at various time points, body weight, food intake, gastrocnemius muscle weight, spontaneous activity and survival of tumor-bearing mice were examined along with tumor growth. Moreover, cachectic markers including glucose, triglyceride, albumin and total proteins as well as levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue were measured. Finally, mRNA and protein levels of p65, IκBα, and ubiquitin E3 ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx in gastrocnemius muscle were assessed. RESULTS: MG132 treatment significantly alleviated cancer cachexia as demonstrated by attenuated weight loss, altered carbohydrate metabolism and muscle atrophy and increased spontaneous activity and survival time of tumor-bearing mice. MG132 reduced tumor growth and the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue. NF-κB, MuRF1 and MAFbx were also inhibited by MG132. Unexpectedly, MG132 was more efficient when administrated during the early stages of cachexia. MG132 had no effect on food intake of tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that MG132-induced inhibition of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in cancer cachexia decreased the activity of NF-κB and the degradation of IκBα, and reduced the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue, accompanied by downregulation of MuRF1 and MAFbx. These data suggest that MG132 is a potential therapeutic and preventive agent for cancer cachexia.

[Image: see text] With the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), our knowledge of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still in its infancy. Almost every aspect of the pathogen remains largely unknown, ranging from mechanisms involved in infection transmission, interplay with the human immune system, and covert mechanisms of end-organ damage. COVID-19 has manifested itself worldwide with a syndromic appearance that is dominated by respiratory dysregulations. While clinicians are focused on correcting respiratory homeostasis, echoing the original SARS, SARS-CoV-2 is also invading other end-organs, which may not exhibit overt clinical features. Nervous system involvement was not initially considered to play a significant role in patients with COVID-19. However, since this viewpoint was initially published, multiple studies have been released regarding the possible neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2. In our previous viewpoint, we implored our colleagues to recognize the covert tactics of SARS-CoV-2 and emphasized that symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, ataxia, and altered mental status could be early signs of the neurotropic potential of this virus. The past few weeks, after the viewpoint surfaced, it was noticed that it has enabled clinicians and healthcare professionals to compute the neurovirulence associated with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by very recently reported studies.

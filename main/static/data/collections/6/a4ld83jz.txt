The activation energy of recovery in 99.999% aluminium deformed at 4.2 K is investigated at temperatures between 50 to 180 K by means of the change of slope method. The activation energy varies from 0.15 to 0.60 eV with raising temperature. This behaviour is simulated by considering an overlapping of several first order processes within stage II. It is supposed that the variation of activation energy in stage II is due to recovery of vacancies and their small clusters by pipe diffusion mechanism.

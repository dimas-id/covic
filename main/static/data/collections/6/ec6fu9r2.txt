Advances in digital technologies have opened new opportunities for creating more reliable, time‐ and cost‐effective, safer and mobile methods of diagnosing, managing and treating diseases. A few examples of advanced nano‐ and digital technologies are already FDA‐approved for diagnosing and treating diseases. Plasma treatment is still emerging as a new healthcare technology, but it is showing a strong potential for treatment of many diseases including cancers and antimicrobial‐resistant infections, with little or no adverse side effects. Here, we argue that with the ever‐increasing complex healthcare challenges facing communities, including the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, it is critical to consider combining unique properties of emerging healthcare technologies into a single multimodal treatment modality that could lead to unprecedented healthcare benefits. In this article, we focus on the healthcare opportunities created by establishing a nexus between plasma, nano‐ and digital technologies. We argue that the combination of plasma, nano‐ and digital technologies into a single multimodal healthcare package may significantly improve patient outcomes and comfort, and reduce the economic burden on community healthcare, as well as alleviate many problems related to overcrowded healthcare systems.

Abstract Coinciding with the pandemic wave of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, other respiratory viruses have co-circulated in our area and were responsible for many acute respiratory infections and influenza-like illness (ILI). Apart from the pandemic virus that was responsible for most ILI cases, incidence rates of other viruses have varied among geographical areas. In general, human rhinovirus was the most frequent among individuals from the community, and respiratory syncytial virus among hospitalized patients. Detection rates of other respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, adenovirus or parainfluenza viruses have been much lower. On the basis of an interference mechanism, human rhinovirus may contribute to modulate the pandemic wave, although available data are not conclusive to support this hypothesis. In contrast, the epidemic wave of respiratory syncytial virus during 2009â€“2010 was similar to previous seasons. Overall, incidence rates of respiratory viruses other than influenza did not change significantly during the pandemic season compared to other seasons. No association has been found between coinfection of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses with the prognosis of patients with influenza. The involvement of clinical virology laboratories in the etiological diagnosis of ILI cases has improved and has optimized diagnostic procedures.

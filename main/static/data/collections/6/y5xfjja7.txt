Aiming toward the production and characterization of delicious and functional gel foods, this communication studies the flavor release from cinnamon-containing κ-carrageenan gel. Cinnamaldehyde, which provides the flavor of cinnamon, was released in a trace amount from the gel and detected by flame ionization detector gas chromatography. The retention of cinnamaldehyde in κ-carrageenan gel and the interaction between flavor and polysaccharide were investigated by high-resolution magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) and pulsed-field gradient NMR (PFG NMR). The intact cinnamaldehyde in the gel was also observed by HR-MAS NMR. The relative mobility difference of the flavor and polysaccharide molecules was observed from the diffusion-ordered NMR spectrum of PFG NMR.

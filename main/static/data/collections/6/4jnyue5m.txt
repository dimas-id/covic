OBJECTIVE To analyze the immediate and long-term outcome after laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases and difference between observed and predicted [Fong's and Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) scores] survivals. BACKGROUND : Laparoscopic liver resection has been reported safe and feasible and improves postoperative course. The oncologic outcomes after resection of colorectal metastases are poorly reported. METHODS Between August 1998 and January 2010, 122 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colorectal liver metastases during 135 procedures at Rikshospitalet. Patients undergoing surgery between August 1998 and June 2009 were included in research analysis. The patients had median Fong's and BPI's scores of 2 (0-5) and 7 (0-23), respectively. Mainstream analysis of hospital data was done on intent-to-treat basis. Intraoperative incidents and postoperative complications were analyzed according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications. Median follow-up was 24 (0-100) months. RESULTS One hundred fifty-one liver resections were performed in 107 patients during 118 procedures: 117 nonanatomic and 34 anatomic liver resections. There were 5 conversions to laparotomy (4.2%). The resection margin was free of tumor tissue in 141 (93.4%) of 151 specimens, and the distance between the resection margin and tumor tissue was median 6 (0-40) mm. Intraoperative incidents occurred in 14 cases (11.9%), including 5 (4.2%), 8 (6.8%), and 1 (0.8%) cases of grades I, II, and III, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 16 cases (14.3%), including 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, and 1 cases of grades I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V, respectively. During follow-up, 21 patients received repeat liver resection of recurrences (11 by laparoscopy and 10 by laparotomy). The 5-year overall survival rates were 51% as laparoscopically completed cases and 47% as intent-to-treat. The observed actuarial survival values exceeded the values expected by Fong's and BPI's score, with 10.2% and 6.7% as laparoscopically completed cases and with 3.8% and 2.4% as intent-to-treat, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection is a favorable alternative to open liver resection for patients with colorectal liver metastases. The observed actuarial survival values after laparoscopic resection surpass the values expected by major scoring systems.

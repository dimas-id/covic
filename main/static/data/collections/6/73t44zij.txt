Diaper need is a form of material hardship that acutely affects families with young children, is not currently addressed by US antipoverty programs, and has received little public or scientific attention. This study examined the association between diaper need and risk for food insecurity in a statewide sample of participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Families enrolled in Vermont WIC in August 2019 were invited to an online survey. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the relationship between risk for food insecurity measured by the Hunger Vital Sign tool and diaper need, with and without adjustment for household factors. Follow-up questions asked those with diaper need what they do when they run out of diapers and those without diaper need how they access enough diapers. Complete data were available for 501 households. Over half (52.3%) were at risk for food insecurity and nearly one-third (32.5%) reported diaper need. The odds of experiencing risk for food insecurity were 3.852 (95% CI=2.557, 5.803) times greater for families with diaper need than for families that had enough diapers. The association persisted with adjustment for location, age of respondent, number of children in diapers, and length of time participating in WIC (adjusted OR=4.036, 95% CI=2.645, 6.160). Strategies to avoid running out of diapers included borrowing, stretching supplies, switching to cloth or underwear, and buying on credit. It is possible that public health interventions that address diaper need may reduce food insecurity in households with children.

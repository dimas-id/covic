Accurate diagnostic strategies to rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals for management of patient care and protection of health care personnel are urgently needed. The predominant diagnostic test is viral RNA detection by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens, however the results of this test are not promptly obtainable in all patient care locations. Routine laboratory testing, in contrast, is readily available with a turn-around time (TAT) usually within 1-2 hours. Here we present a machine learning model incorporating patient demographic features (age, sex, race) with 27 routine laboratory tests to predict an individual's SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Laboratory test results obtained within two days before the release of SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR result were used to train a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) model from 3,346 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tested patients (1,394 positive and 1,952 negative) evaluated at a large metropolitan hospital. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.853 (95% CI: 0.829-0.878). Application of this model to an independent patient dataset from a separate hospital resulted in a comparable AUC (0.838), validating the generalization of its use. Moreover, our model predicted initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in 66% individuals whose RT-PCR result changed from negative to positive within two days. Overall, this model employing routine laboratory test results offers opportunities for early and rapid identification of high-risk SARS-COV-2 infected patients before their RT-PCR results are available. This may facilitate patient care and quarantine, indicate who requires retesting, and direct personal protective equipment use while awaiting definitive RT-PCR results.

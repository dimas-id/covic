Complications of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) include band slippage, material infection, and band erosion. Band erosion can lead to chronic infection, obstruction, delayed perforation, and ineffectiveness; therefore, removal is indicated. A myriad of approaches exist for band removal and many authors have described novel techniques. A minimally invasive approach, including laparoscopic or endoscopic assistance, is favored given the reduction of postoperative complications compared with laparotomy. We present a novel approach to band retrieval following partial erosion involving a complete endoscopic/transgastric technique. Perioperative management and a review of the literature also are described.

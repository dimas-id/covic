The host immune response determines the clinical course of a viral infection, for example in case of COVID-19 infection. The effectiveness of vaccination also depends on the induced immune response. Currently there is no method to measure the cellular immune response in blood samples. The functional activity of cells of innate and adaptive immune system is determined by coordinated activity of signaling pathways, especially the JAK-STAT pathways. Using a previously described approach we developed mRNA-based tests to measure activity of these signaling pathways, and show that they can be used to measure in a quantitative manner the cellular innate and adaptive immune response to a viral infection or vaccine in whole blood, PBMC, and specific immune cell type samples. Pathway activity level and range in healthy individuals was established, enabling interpretation of a pathway activity score on a patient sample without the need for a reference sample. Evidence is presented that the pathway activity analysis may also be useful for in vitro vaccine development and assessment of vaccine immunogenicity. Other envisioned applications lie in development of immunomodulatory drugs and drug response prediction and monitoring. Tests are expected to be of value in the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the described Affymetrix microarray-based pathway tests for measuring host immune response, qPCR-based versions are in development; the latter can in principle be performed within three hours in routine hospital labs.

Our simulation framework for wound closure by suture is designed for education and training purposes. Currently, it is designed specifically to support a simulation of the Endo StitchTM suturing instrument by Covidien, and could be extended for other surgical instruments designed for intracorporeal suturing. The framework allows the user to perform a virtual wound closure by suture with real surgical instrument handles customized to fit on haptic devices. The wound simulation is based on a triangular surface mesh embedded in a linear hexahedral finite element mesh, whereas the suture simulation is based on a simplified Cosserat theory of elastic rods. The simulation utilizes a combination of physically-based and control-based simulations.

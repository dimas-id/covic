PURPOSE OF REVIEW Nosocomial infections (NI) constitute a significant public health problem and contribute to prolonged hospitalization, additional healthcare costs, and excess morbidity and mortality. Immunocompromised patients, including HIV-infected individuals, are at increased risk for NI, and 15-18.3% of them are represented by lower respiratory tract infections. Nosocomial pulmonary infections (NPI) appear to be more common in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as a result of the degree of immunosuppression, prior use of antibiotics, and exposure to invasive procedures. RECENT FINDINGS This article reviews the epidemiologic and clinical evidences and reports on the occurrence of NPI in HIV-infected inpatients. SUMMARY Although underestimated, NI occur commonly in HIV-infected patients, and among them nosocomial pneumonia, including tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The improvement of antiretroviral therapeutic options in developed countries has resulted in a decreased hospitalization rate of HIV-infected individuals. Healthcare delivery in the in- and outpatient setting represents a potential for infections, including lower respiratory tract ones, according to the degree of immunosuppression and the intensity of invasive procedures. To minimize the risk of acquisition of healthcare associated low respiratory tract infections, adherence of healthcare workers to common infection practices, specific respiratory precautions, and early identification of persons who have tuberculosis or are at high risk for active tuberculosis, should be strengthened.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of lockdown for COVID-19 on community mobility using spatial time-series change over different states and UTs of India. Data & Methods This study has been organized based on states & union territories (UTs) wise time-series data of the daily percentage of change of community mobility from baseline in India, collected from 15(th) February to 30(th) April 2020. Conditional formatting techniques, time-series trends plotting method, spatial Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation mapping techniques have been employed to show pre and post lockdown mobility trends due to COVID-19 i.e. to fulfill the objective. RESULTS: Across India, retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, visits to parks, transit stations, and workplaces mobility dropped by -73.4%, -51.2%, -46.3%, -66% and -56.7% respectively.

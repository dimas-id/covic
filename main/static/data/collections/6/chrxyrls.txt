28924 hoverflies of 85 species were caught in a Malaise trap in an English suburban garden during the eight‐year period 1972–79, and three additional species were hand‐netted. Hoverfly larvae fall into five trophic categories all of which were represented by adults in the trap sample. 82.71% of the hoverflies trapped have larvae that feed on aphids, 12.04% feed on decaying organic material, 5.14% eat living plants, 0.09% scavenge in Hymcnoptera nests, and 0.02% are associated with tree sap or rotting wood. The relative frequency of the different trophic groups varied annually and seasonally although the aphid‐feeders were nearly always the most abundant. 22 species are believed to breed in the garden, and a further 29 in the surrounding area; 15 species are regarded as casual and 22 as chance visitors. It is suggested that the high plant diversity and spatial heterogeneity of gardens result in them supporting more species than would be found in a natural area.

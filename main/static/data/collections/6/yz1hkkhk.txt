Genomic RNA extracted from the purified murine coronavirus JHM sediments between 52S and 54S in aqueous sucrose gradients. The RNA is single-stranded and has an apparent mol. wt. of 5.4 to 6.5 X 10(6), as determined by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide agarose gels of different concentrations. The presence of polyadenylate sequences in the RNA is demonstrated by binding to oligo-)dT) cellulose and digestion with ribonucleases A and T1. The purified RNA does not dissociate into subunits at high temperatures or in high concentrations of DMSO and is infectious.

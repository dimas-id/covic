Abstract We introduce a new approach to investigate problem of DNA sequence alignment. The method consists of three parts: (i) simple alignment algorithm, (ii) extension algorithm for largest common substring, (iii) graphical simple alignment tree (GSA tree). The approach firstly obtains a graphical representation of scores of DNA sequences by the scoring equation R 0 * R − S 0 * S − T 0 * ( a + bk ) . Then a GSA tree is constructed to facilitate solving the problem for global alignment of 2 DNA sequences. Finally we give several practical examples to illustrate the utility and practicality of the approach.

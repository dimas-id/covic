BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Failure to recanalize predicts mortality in acute ischemic stroke. In the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke registry, we investigated parameters associated with mortality in successfully recanalized patients. METHODS Logistic regression was used to evaluate baseline characteristics and recanalization parameters for association with 90-day mortality. A multivariable model was developed based on backward selection with retention criteria of P<0.05 from factors with at least marginal significance (P≤0.10), then refit to minimize the number of excluded cases (missing data). RESULTS Successfully recanalized patients had lower mortality (25.2% [59/234] versus 46.9% [38/81] P<0.001). There was no difference in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between patients with successful versus failed recanalization (9% [21/234] versus 14% [11/79]; P=0.205). However, mortality was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (72% [23/32] versus 26% [73/281]; P<0.001). Proximal occlusion (internal carotid artery or vertebrobasilar), initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale≥18, use of rescue therapy (P<0.05), and 3+ passes (P<0.10) were associated with mortality in recanalized patients. In the multivariate model with good predictive power (c index=0.72), proximal occlusion, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale≥18, and use of rescue therapy remained significant independent predictors of 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS Failure to recanalize and presence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage resulted in increased mortality. Despite successful recanalization, proximal occlusion, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and need for rescue therapy were predictors of mortality.

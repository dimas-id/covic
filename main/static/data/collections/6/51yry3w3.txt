We read with great interest the article by Piccolo et al(1). describing chilblain‐like lesions (CLL) on feet and hands during the COVID‐19 Pandemic. They mention the rate of association to autoimmune conditions was very low, which led the to exclude a note autoimmune disorder as main cause of CLL. Here, we hypothesize the possible relationship between the development of these lesions and immune‐chained phenomena following viral infection in a certain group of patients.

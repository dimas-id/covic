Blended learning (BL) refers to a systematic teaching method, which combines the aspects of face-to-face and online interactions using appropriate Information and Communication Technologies. This mixed-method systematic review (SR) protocol is developed with the objective to determine the effectiveness and appropriateness of BL in the health-care professional education. Mixed-method SR protocol: For the purpose of this SR, PICO is defined as P-entry level graduate students of health sciences program; I-BL; C-traditional face-to-face training; and O-achievement of learning outcomes, learner's and teacher's perception (primary). The search will be done through possible database using predetermined search strategy. Eligible studies will be appraised independently by authors. Joanna Briggs Institute's mixed-method protocol will be used to assess and synthesis the data. This protocol is registered with the International Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the registration number CRD42018082699.

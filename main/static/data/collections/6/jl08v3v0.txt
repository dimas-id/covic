Circovirus infection is a growing problem in the field of veterinary and public health. It is associated with enteric diseases in both mammalian and avian hosts. In this study, we detected and isolated porcine circovirus strains in the tissue samples of minks that died from diarrhoea in Shandong Province, China. We sequenced the whole genome of two porcine strains of Circovirus, designated as MiSD-1 and MiSD-2ï¼Œ which had a 97.34% similarity on nucleotide sequence and were closely related to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), but distantly related to mink circoviral species. Phylogenetically MiSD-1 and MiSD-2 are a part of the PCV2b genotype cluster, which is a highly prevalent genotype worldwide. The closer relationship of MiSD-1 and MiSD-2 to PCV2 from pigs than to other mink circoviral species may be evidence of cross-species transmission and considerable zoonotic potential.

Respiratory diseases are among the most important problems affecting nonhuman primate husbandry, especially among newly imported and outdoor-housed primates. Respiratory diseases are also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in wild populations. Respiratory problems can affect the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses, the laryngeal air sacs, the larynx, trachea bronchi, and lung parenchyma (including vasculature and alveoli) and may be caused by direct infection with a variety of agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, as well as by noninfectious, inflammatory stimuli such as particulates, allergens, pneuotoxins, and endogenous inflammatory mediators. Many of the respiratory pathogens reported in this chapter also affect humans or are of human origin (zoonotic or anthropozoonotic). This chapter reviews comparative respiratory anatomy and physiology as well as the diseases affecting all components of the respiratory system of nonhuman primates.

INTRODUCTION Transgastric NOTES(Â®) procedures remain without a simple method to close the gastrotomy. In four survival swine studies, we have tested a novel gastric closure device: the loop-anchor purse-string (LAPS) closure system. METHODS In four anesthetized pigs, an endoscopic gastrotomy was performed. Four loop anchors were arrayed in a 2-cm square pattern around the gastrotomy. The endoscope was passed into the abdominal cavity, and the gastrotomy was cinched closed. RESULTS Procedure times ranged from 50-180 minutes. Three pigs survived 14 days. One animal was sacrificed early due to signs of sepsis. Another animal developed fevers and was treated with antibiotics. At necropsy, there were no abscesses, including in the septic animal. Histologic examination revealed evidence of healing in all animals. DISCUSSION The LAPS system holds promise with early success in an animal model. Future human studies are needed to determine viability as a human visceral closure device.

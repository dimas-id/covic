PURPOSE Epigastric hernias represent about 4 % of all abdominal hernias in children and require surgical repair. Traditionally, these hernias are repaired by an open surgical technique. More recently, laparoscopic epigastric hernia repairs have been described using two trocars in the upper abdomen. In this paper, we describe a novel single-incision pediatric endosurgical (SIPES) technique. METHODS Patients with symptomatic epigastric hernias that were deemed to be too far superior to be repaired with an open technique through an umbilical incision were selected for SIPES repair. Two trocars (5 and 3 mm) were introduced through a single umbilical incision and the hernia repair was performed using looped 4-0 polypropylene sutures introduced through a 17-gage spinal needle in a lasso technique. RESULTS Five girls (age 4.4-12.6, median 6.4 years) underwent single-incision endosurgical epigastric hernia repair. The mean operative time was 25 Â± 6 min, and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients were discharged home from the recovery room on the day of surgery. All patients were followed up 2-3 weeks after the operation, with no recurrence and excellent cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS The described SIPES technique offers a virtually scarless, quick, and simple option for the repair of symptomatic epigastric hernias that can be performed with standard laparoscopic equipment.

BACKGROUND Minimally invasive techniques have been applied with increasing frequency to stoma creation. A recent focus in the field of minimally invasive surgery is laparoscopic single-site surgery. The aim of this study was to assess whether this procedure is a feasible option compared with other techniques of stoma creation. MATERIALS AND METHODS We introduced laparoscopic surgery to fecal diversion in April 2010 at the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. This technique was performed on 53 patients, including 15 laparoscopic single-site surgeries, from April 2010 to December 2011. RESULTS Of these 15 cases, 8 ileostomies and 7 colostomies were created. The mean operative time was 65.9 minutes (range, 32 to 93 min). The estimated volume of blood loss was small in all cases. There were no intraoperative complications. All patients started an oral diet on the second postoperative day with the exception of 1 patient who suffered from prolonged paralytic ileus. CONCLUSIONS A laparoscopic single-site approach to stoma creation may be a feasible option in fecal diversion.

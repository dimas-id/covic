Abstract Rapid, scalable, point-of-need, COVID-19 diagnostic testing is necessary to safely re-open economies and prevent future outbreaks. We developed an assay that detects single copies of SARS-CoV-2 virus directly from saliva and swab samples in 30 min using a simple, one-step protocol that utilizes only a heat block and microcentrifuge tube prefilled with a mixture containing the necessary reagents and has a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 100%, respectively.

Feces collected from 40 horses with diarrhea and 34 horses without diarrhea were examined to determine if an association existed between isolation of Aeromonas spp. and diarrhea. Samples were also examined for Salmonella spp., and identification of viruses and parasite ova. Neither Salmonella spp. nor Aeromonas spp. were isolated from the feces of 34 control horses. Aeromonas spp. were isolated from feces of 22 of 40 (55%) horses with diarrhea. Salmonella spp. were isolated from feces of 8 (20%) horses, and of these, 5 (12.5%) were also positive for Aeromonas spp. Twenty‚Äênine isolates of Aeromonas spp. were recovered from the feces of 22 diarrheic horses. Of these isolates, more than 80% were susceptible on in vitro testing to amikacin, ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin. All isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin. Diarrheic horses positive for Aeromonas were significantly (P= .04) older than diarrheic horses negative for Aeromonas spp. A significantly greater number of fecal samples were positive for Aeromonas spp. during March through August than samples examined in other months (P= .014). Results of this study indicate that Aeromonas spp. should be considered as a cause of diarrhea in horses.

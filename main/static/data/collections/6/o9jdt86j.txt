The S2 gene of several strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to the Arkansas, Connecticut, and Florida serotypes was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the S2 gene nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data resulted in groups of strains that were the same as groupings observed when S1 sequence data was used. Thus, it appears that S2 subunits are conserved within a serotype but not between serotypes. Although the sequence differences were small, we found that only a few amino acid differences were responsible for different secondary structure predictions for the S2 subunit. It is likely that these changes create different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits, which could affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotype specific epitopes are located. Based on this sequence data, we hypothesize that the S2 subunit can affect specific antibody binding to the S1 subunit of the IBV spike glycoprotein.

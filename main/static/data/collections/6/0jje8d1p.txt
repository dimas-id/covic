FFA2 and FFA3 are receptors for short chain fatty acids which are produced in prodigious amounts by fermentation of poorly digested carbohydrates by gut bacteria. Understanding the roles of these receptors in regulating enteroendocrine, metabolic and immune functions has developed with the production and use of novel pharmacological tools and animal models. A complex (patho)physiological scenario is now emerging in which strategic expression of FFA2 and FFA3 in key cell types and selective modulation of their signaling might regulate body weight management, energy homeostasis and inflammatory disorders.

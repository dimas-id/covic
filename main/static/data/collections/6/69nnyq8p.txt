Abstract The Zika virus is transmitted to humans primarily through Aedes mosquitoes and through sexual contact. It is documented that the virus can be transmitted to newborn babies from their mothers. We consider a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of the Zika virus infectious disease that spreads in, both humans and vectors, through horizontal and vertical transmission. The total populations of both humans and mosquitoes are assumed to be constant. Our models consist of a system of eight differential equations describing the human and vector populations during the different stages of the disease. We have included the hospitalization/isolation class in our model to see the effect of the controlling strategy. We determine the expression for the basic reproductive number R 0 in terms of horizontal as well as vertical disease transmission rates. An in-depth stability analysis of the model is performed, and it is consequently shown, that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number R 0 < 1. It is also shown that when R 0 > 1, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. We showed that the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. We were able to prove this result in a reduced model. Furthermore, we conducted an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to recognize the impact of crucial model parameters on R 0. The uncertainty analysis yields an estimated value of the basic reproductive number R 0 = 1.54. Assuming infection prevalence in the population under constant control, optimal control theory is used to devise an optimal hospitalization/isolation control strategy for the model. The impact of isolation on the number of infected individuals and the accumulated cost is assessed and compared with the constant control case.

We assess pre-outbreak and during-outbreak vaccination as control strategies for SARS epidemics using a mathematical model that includes susceptible, latent (traced and untraced), infectious, isolated and recovered individuals. Scenarios focusing on policies that include contact tracing and levels of self-isolation among untraced infected individuals are explored. Bounds on the proportion of pre-outbreak successfully vaccinated individuals are provided using the the basic reproductive number. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses on the reproductive number are carried out. The final epidemic size under different vaccination scenarios is computed.

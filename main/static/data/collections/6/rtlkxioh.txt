Acute shock and metabolic failure appeared in a diarrheic calf being studied intensively to determine kinetics of glucose and lactate metabolism. Intravenous therapy significantly improved its condition. During metabolic failure, the rapid increase in blood lactate and concomitant decrease in glucose were due to inhibited gluconeogenesis, as glucose entry and lactate oxidation were not modified. Therapy restored metabolic activity and decreased the severe hyperkalemia.

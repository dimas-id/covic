No animals tested were positive for feline leukemia virus antigen and Chlamydia psittaci antibodies, but all were positive for antibodies to feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1) and rotavirus. They had antibodies to feline parvovirus (96%), feline coronavirus (84% and cowpox virus (2%). Antibody to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was found in 53% of animals, which were less likely to be infected with Haemobartonella felis, and had higher FHV antibody titres than cats without FIV. FCV was isolated from 51% cats and FHV1 and feline reovirus each from 4%. H. felis was present in 42% of animals, and antibody to Toxoplasma gondii in 62%. Clinical abnormality had a significant association with FIV and feline calicivirus infections, but sex, age, social status and feeding group had no significant association with prevalence of any parasites. Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina eggs were found, respectively, in 91% and 82% of animals tested.

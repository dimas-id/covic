Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) enables detection and quantification of antigen-specific antibodies in biological samples such as human or animal sera. Most current MERS-CoV serological assays such as neutralization, immunofluorescence, or protein microarray rely on handling of live MERS-CoV in high containment laboratories, highly trained personnel as well as the need for expensive and special equipment and reagents representing a hurdle for most laboratories especially when resources are limited. In this chapter, we describe a validated and optimized indirect ELISA protocol based on recombinant S1 subunit (amino acids 1â€“725) of MERS-CoV for qualitative and quantitative determination of MERS-CoV-binding antibodies.

The objectives were to evaluate the effects of feeding diets with 2 levels of negative dietary cation-anion differences (DCAD) during the last 42 or 21 d of gestation on performance and metabolism in dairy cows. The hypothesis was that extending feeding from 21 to 42 d and reducing the DCAD from -70 to -180 mEq/kg of dry matter (DM) would not be detrimental to performance. Holstein cows at 230 d of gestation were blocked by parity prepartum (48 entering their second lactation and 66 entering their third or greater lactation) and 305-d milk yield, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial. The 2 levels of DCAD, -70 or -180 mEq/kg of DM, and 2 feeding durations, the last 21 d (short) or the last 42 d (long) prepartum resulted in 4 treatments, short -70 (n = 29), short -180 (n = 29), long -70 (n = 28) and long -180 (n = 28). Cows in the short treatments were fed a diet with DCAD of +110 mEq/kg of DM from -42 to -22 d relative to calving. After calving, cows were fed the same diet and production and disease incidence were evaluated for 42 d in milk, whereas reproduction and survival was evaluated for 305 d in milk. Blood was sampled pre- and postpartum for quantification of metabolites and minerals. Reducing the DCAD linearly decreased prepartum DM intake between -42 and -22 d relative to calving (+110 mEq/kg of DM = 11.5 vs. -70 mEq/kg of DM = 10.7 vs. -180 mEq/kg of DM = 10.2 ± 0.4), and a more acidogenic diet in the last 21 d of the dry period reduced intake by 1.1 kg/d (-70 mEq/kg of DM = 10.8 vs. -180 mEq/kg of DM = 9.7 ± 0.5 kg/d). Cows fed the -180 mEq/kg of DM diet had increased concentrations of ionized Ca in blood on the day of calving (-70 mEq/kg of DM = 1.063 vs. -180 mEq/kg of DM = 1.128 ± 0.020 mM). Extending the duration of feeding the diets with negative DCAD from 21 to 42 d reduced gestation length by 2 d (short = 277.2 vs. long = 275.3 d), milk yield by 2.5 kg/d (short = 40.4 vs. long = 37.9 ± 1.0 kg/d) and tended to increase days open because of reduced pregnancy per artificial insemination (short = 35.0 vs. long = 22.6%). Results suggest that increasing the duration of feeding diets with negative DCAD from 21 to 42 d prepartum might influence milk yield and reproduction of cows in the subsequent lactation, although yields of 3.5% fat- and energy-corrected milk did not differ with treatments. Reducing the DCAD from -70 to -180 mEq/kg of DM induced a more severe metabolic acidosis, increased ionized Ca concentrations prepartum and on the day of calving, and decreased colostrum yield in the first milking, but had no effects on performance in the subsequent lactation. Collectively, these data suggest that extending the feeding of an acidogenic diet beyond 21 d is unnecessary and might be detrimental to dairy cows, and a reduction in the DCAD from -70 to -180 mEq/kg of DM is not needed.

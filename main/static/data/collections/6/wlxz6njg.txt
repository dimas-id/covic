Psychological practice has changed dramatically over the past 125 years. The two world wars both served to stimulate and change the scope of practice for psychologists. We surveyed over 3,000 doctoral psychologists about the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on their clinical practices. Practice changed from primarily in-office to mostly telepsychology practice over the course of 2 weeks in March of 2020. The long-term effect on professional practice in psychology is not known.

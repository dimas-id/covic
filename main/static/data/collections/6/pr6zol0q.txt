OBJECTIVE To compare a unidirectional barbed suture (V-Loc™) to its suture material equivalent (Biosyn™) in a single-layer end-to-end anastomosis of equine jejunum. STUDY DESIGN Experimental in vitro study. ANIMALS Jejunal sections from adult horses (n = 5) without gastrointestinal disease. METHODS Jejunal end-to-end anastomoses (n = 9) were performed for each group (V-Loc™, Biosyn™) with a continuous Lembert pattern with an interruption every 120°. Anastomosis construction time, luminal diameter, and number of suture bites were recorded. Anastomosis constructs were distended with fluid at 1 L/min until failure. Location and intraluminal pressure at failure were recorded and all measurements were compared between groups. RESULTS V-Loc™ anastomoses were significantly faster to perform (13.1 ± 0.35 minutes) when compared to the Biosyn™ group (15.6 ± 0.72 minutes; P = .0004). No differences were observed for anastomotic index or number of suture bites. V-Loc™ anastomosis constructs had a significantly decreased bursting pressure (160 ± 11.6 mmHg) compared to Biosyn™ constructs (184 ± 16.9 mmHg; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS V-Loc™ allowed faster construction time and did not cause a decreased anastomosis luminal diameter when compared with Biosyn™. V-Loc™ had a decreased bursting strength compared with Biosyn™, albeit well above pathologic pressures encountered clinically. Use of V-Loc™ may be beneficial for decreasing the amount of exposed suture material because of the absence of knots after construction and has the potential to result in decreased adhesions.

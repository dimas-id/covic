To date, there is no definitive treatment for the new SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Three evolutionary stages in SARS-CoV-2 infection are recognized (early infection, pulmonary phase, and systemic hyper inflammation), with characteristic clinical signs and symptoms. There are 80 international experimental trials underway seeking effective treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, there are only three that consider ozone therapy (major auto hemotherapy) as an alternative option. There is no study that evaluates rectal ozone insufflation, despite being a safe, cheap, risk-free technique. That technique is a systemic route of ozone administration (95–96%) and that could be extrapolated to the use of SARS-CoV-2, given the excellent results observed in the management of Ebola. Ozone has four proven biological properties that could allow its use as an alternative therapy in the different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ozone could inactivate the virus by direct (O3) or indirect oxidation (ROS and LOPs) and could stimulate the cellular and humoral immune systems, being useful in the early COVID-19 infection phase (stages 1 and 2a). Ozone improves gas exchange, reduces inflammation, and modulates the antioxidant system, so it would be useful in the hyper inflammation or “cytokine storm” phase, and in the hypoxemia and/or multi-organ failure phase (stage 2b and stage 3). Given the current pandemic, it is urgent to carry out an experimental study that confirms or rules out the biological properties of ozone and thus allows it to be an alternative or compassionate therapy for the effective management of SARS-Cov-2 infection. The Ethical Committee at our Hospital has authorized the use of this technique for compassionate management of SARS-CoV-2 infection, considering the four biological Ozone properties exposed previously.

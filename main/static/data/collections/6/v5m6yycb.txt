Viral factories are compartmentalized centers for viral replication and assembly in infected eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the formation of a replication focus by prototypical archaeal Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) in the model archaeon Sulfolobus This rod-shaped virus belongs to the viral family Rudiviridae, carrying linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes, which are very common in geothermal environments. We demonstrate that SIRV2 DNA synthesis is confined to a focus near the periphery of infected cells. Moreover, viral and cellular replication proteins are recruited to, and concentrated in, the viral replication focus. Furthermore, we show that of the four host DNA polymerases (DNA polymerase I [Dpo1] to Dpo4), only Dpo1 participates in viral DNA synthesis. This constitutes the first report of the formation of a viral replication focus in archaeal cells, suggesting that organization of viral replication in foci is a widespread strategy employed by viruses of the three domains of life.IMPORTANCE The organization of viral replication in foci or viral factories has been mostly described for different eukaryotic viruses and for several bacteriophages. This work constitutes the first report of the formation of a viral replication center by a virus infecting members of the Archaea domain.

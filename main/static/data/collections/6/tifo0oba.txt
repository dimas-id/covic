SHFV is a member of a new virus family which includes the genus arterivirus. We have cloned and sequenced 6,314 nt from the 3′ end of the SHFV genome. This sequence encompasses nine complete ORFs which is three additional ORFs as compared to the other arteriviruses. We have numbered these ORFs 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. At the 5′ end of this sequence is a partial ORF (ORF 1b) of 1590 nt and at the 3′ end is a poly(A) tract preceded by a 76 nt noncoding region. The coding capacity for each of the SHFV ORFs as well as the potential mass, pI and number of N-linked glycosylation sites for each of the encoded peptides was determined.

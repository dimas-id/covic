OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND The objective was to compare 2 year outcomes in patients treated with or without predilatation prior to drug coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions. METHODS This prospective multicentre pilot study was conducted at three sites in Germany. It compared claudicants undergoing predilatation with a bare percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon before DCB (predilatation group) with patients undergoing direct DCB (direct DCB group). Patients were followed for 2 years. Outcomes included late lumen loss at 6 months, and ankle brachial index (ABI), major adverse events, and primary patency at 2 years. A Clinical Events Committee and core laboratories analysed adverse events and angiographic/duplex images, respectively. RESULTS Between December 2011 and November 2012, 50 patients were enrolled to the predilatation group (12% total occlusions) and 28 to the direct DCB group (5% total occlusions). Follow-up compliance at the 2 year visit was 88% (n = 44) and 86% (n = 24), respectively. Late lumen loss at 6 months was lower in the direct DCB group (0.03 ± 0.68 mm vs. 0.54 ± 0.97 mm; p = .01). Major adverse events over 2 years occurred in seven (15%) patients who underwent predilatation and in five (19%) after direct DCB. Mean ABI at 2 years was 0.94 ± 0.15 after predilatation and 1.0 ± 0.12 after direct DCB. Over 2 years, primary patency (80.3% vs. 78.2%; p = .55) was not statistically different between the groups. After propensity score adjustments, 2 year findings remained unchanged. CONCLUSION Paclitaxel coated PTA, with or without bare predilatation, is effective over 2 years in symptomatic patients with femoropopliteal stenotic lesions. Adequately powered randomised controlled comparisons are required to confirm these preliminary results.

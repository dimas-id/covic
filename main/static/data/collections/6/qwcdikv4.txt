In the spring of 2014 infectious bursal disease (IBD) was confirmed in a Finnish layer flock exhibiting clinical signs and increased mortality. Organ and blood samples were sent for diagnosis to the Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira. IBD virus (IBDV) was detected in RT-PCR studies. Altogether hens from six layer farms associated with increased mortality (7-10%, worst case 30%) were diagnosed with IBD during 2014. Antibodies were also detected with IBD-ELISA tests in hens on two farms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the causative agent of the 2014 IBD outbreak was a non-reassortant very virulent type IBDV. The representative virus strains from previous IBD outbreaks in 1978, 1987 and 1993 were also included in the analysis. The strains isolated in 2014 and 1993 were very similar indicating circulation of a very virulent IBDV for over 20 years in the country. In spite of the comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, the definitive origin of the viruses from 2014 and previous outbreaks remains unclear.

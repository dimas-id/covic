Abstractâ€”The review summarizes literature data on the development of drugs based on natural and synthetic high-polymeric double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), their antiviral, immunoadjuvant, and antitumor properties. Special attention is paid to cell receptors responding to exogenous dsRNA, pathways of dsRNA-dependent antiviral reaction, ability of dsRNA to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of malignant cells. It has been shown that enhancing the innate immune response with dsRNA can be an effective component in improving methods for treating and preventing infectious and cancer diseases. The further use of dsRNA for the correction of pathological processes of different origin is discussed.

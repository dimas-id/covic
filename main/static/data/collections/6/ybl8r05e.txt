BACKGROUND: : In the days of the reorganization of healthcare systems due to SARS-Cov2 pandemic, patients suffering from chronic diseases are being often neglected. The aim of our study was to examine the attitudes and behaviors of patient suffering from relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis using disease-modifying drugs in Montenegro in relation to the current pandemic. METHODS: : The research was conducted through an online-generated questionnaire during the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: : There is a high level of concern about COVID-19 (3.22±1.23), especially about safety behavior intensification (3.80±1.29). Possibility of relapse during pandemic was considered as moderate (2.06±1.42), but relapse symptoms would be reported by the majority of subjects (1.55±1.23). Our unemployed patients statistically more often reported that they had more frequent mood changes, but also that they felt more energy loss. Surprisingly, there was no difference among the subjects according to smoking status. According therapy groups there was significant difference between the groups regarding some variables: patients using ocrelizumab are most concerned about COVID-19; patients using interferon beta 1a i.m. statistically more often have frequent changes in their mood, memory problems, poor appetite, feeling of nausea or upset stomach and patients on fingolimod have bigger afraid of coming to regular visits.

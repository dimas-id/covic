Scarce data exists about the hemostatic status of small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. We aimed at evaluating the hemostatic profile of SGA neonates, using thromboelastometry (TEM). This is an observational study performed in a Greek tertiary General Hospital during an 18-month period. Ninety-three neonates were included in the study: 48 appropriate for gestational age weight (AGA) neonates and 45 SGA neonates Extrinsically activated TEM (ex-TEM) parameters, such as clotting time, clot formation time, amplitude recorded at 5 and 10 min, a angle, maximum clot firmness, lysis index at 60 min, and also platelet count, were used for the evaluation of the hemostatic profile in all neonates. No statistically significant differences were noticed regarding all ex-TEM parameters between AGA and SGA neonates, while no event of hemorrhage or thrombosis was noticed in the study population.Conclusions: The coagulation system of SGA neonates seems to be fully functional, with no evident tendency toward coagulopathy or thrombosis, when compared with AGA neonates. TEM seems to provide a promising and valid assessment of coagulation and fibrinolysis systems and may be used as a valuable biomarker, in the future. Further studies, with large samples, are necessary to confirm our results. What is Known: • SGA neonates may present coagulation disorders mainly due to hepatic dysfunction, polycythemia, and thrombocytopenia owing to long-term intrauterine hypoxia. • In the literature, despite the statistically significant differences in laboratory results between SGA and AGA neonates, no clinical manifestations of significantly altered hemostasis were recorded. Data of TEM interpretation of hemostasis in SGA neonates are not available. What is New: • TEM seems to interpret coagulation mechanism of preterm and full-term SGA neonates and confirm previous relevant literature findings regarding hemostasis in these neonates.

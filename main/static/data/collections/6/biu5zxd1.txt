Sepsis is one of the most common causes of death in severely injured patients worldwide. The early detection of sepsis still has to be solved in clinical practice. The delayed diagnosis often contributes to inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and subsequent high mortality. Sepsis biomarkers are produced during the host response to infection. Traditional biomarkers are polypeptides and/or proteins derived from this response. Omics-based biomarkers are screening out from all kinds of molecules of host response while high-throughout omics technologies are emerging. This review describes traditional and potential omics-based sepsis biomarkers from currently available literatures. The combination of these biomarkers would refine the identification of sepsis for further clinical and experimental sepsis studies.

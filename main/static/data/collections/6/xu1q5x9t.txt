We read with interest the series of cases reported by Martín Carreras‐Presas et al. (2020). We believe that the described oral vesiculobullous manifestations were suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) co‐infections, which at present, are overlooked and poorly understood (Cox et al., 2020). Increased disease severity and mortality amongst individuals with respiratory viral infections are often attributed to subsequent bacterial co‐infections, accounting for approximately 95% of deaths during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic (Morens et al., 2008).

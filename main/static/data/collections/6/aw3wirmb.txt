Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) can be caused by endogenous host microbial flora or by exogenous microbes, including those found in the hospital environment. Efforts to decrease endogenous pathogens via decolonization and skin antisepsis may decrease the risk of infection in some settings. Controlling the spread of potential pathogens from the environment requires meticulous attention to cleaning and disinfection practices. In addition to selection of the appropriate cleaning agent, use of tools that assess the adequacy of cleaning and addition of no-touch cleaning technology may decrease environmental contamination. Hand hygiene is also a critical component of preventing transmission of pathogens from the environment to patients via healthcare worker hands.

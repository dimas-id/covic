Both public administration scholars and practitioners believe that “good governance” relies on the involvement of compassionate officials. However, they overlook the fact that “compassion fatigue” often occurs when officials face the dual pressure arising from superiors’ orders and empathy for service receivers. This would inevitably not only affect their individual behaviors, but also influence the effectiveness of their service. A full-scale investigation of animal protection administrators in Taiwan was conducted so as to analyze compassion fatigue that civil servants would encounter and further establish a relationship between various variables and the hypotheses of this study by combining the studies of public administration and psychology. It should be noted that compassion fatigue may affect animal protection administrators’ mental health in spite of little influence on their willingness to work hard. However, both “mindfulness” and “moral disengagement” are coping strategies which were developed for helping tackle the dilemma of compassion fatigue. Although applying the strategy of mindfulness can generate more positive impacts on individuals and organizations than that of moral disengagement, animal protection administrators tended to adopt the latter. Accordingly, encouraging animal protection administrators to adopt mindfulness instead of moral disengagement as their coping strategy will be a priority of work for the authorities in the future.

The effects of a recruitment manoeuvre (RM) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on lung compliance (CLUNG) are not well characterised in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP). Patients were allocated to group R (n = 10; with an RM) or C (n = 9; without an RM). An RM involved sustained inflation of 30 cmH2O for 30 s. The lungs were ventilated with volume-controlled ventilation with tidal volume of 7 mL kg-1 of predicted body weight and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5. End-tidal carbon dioxide pressure was maintained at normocapnia. Patients were in the horizontal lithotomy position (pre-op). After pneumoperitoneum, patients underwent RARP in a steep Trendelenburg lithotomy position at a PEEP level of 0 cmH2O (RARP0). An RM was used in the R group but not in the C group. Patients were then ventilated with 5 cmH2O PEEP for 1 h after RARP0 (RARP5.1) and 2 h after RARP0 (RARP5.2). Oesophageal pressure and airway pressure were measured for calculating CLUNG and chest wall compliance. CLUNG significantly decreased from pre-op to RARP0 and did not significantly increase from RARP0 to RARP5.1 and RARP5.2 in either group. CLUNG differed significantly between groups at RARP5.1 and RARP5.2 (103 ± 30 vs. 68 ± 11 mL cm-1 H2O and 106 ± 35 vs. 72 ± 9 mL cm-1 H2O; P < 0.05). In patients undergoing RARP, with the addition of RM, the CLUNG was effectively increased from the horizontal lithotomy position to the steep Trendelenburg lithotomy position under pneumoperitoneum.

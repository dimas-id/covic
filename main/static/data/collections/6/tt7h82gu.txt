Patients with COVID-19 and acute cardiac injury as measured by an elevated high-sensitivity troponin I or troponin T upon admission or during hospitalization have a mortality rate of over 50% in initial reports. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and associated myocardial injury, whether SARS-CoV-2 patients with myocardial injury are a distinct population, and possible treatment options for myocardial injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.

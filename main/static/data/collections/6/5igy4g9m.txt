Supernatants of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, nasopharyngeal and sera samples containing SARS-CoV-2 were submitted to heat inactivation for various periods of time, ranging from 30 seconds to 60 minutes. Our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 could be inactivated in less than 30 minutes, 15 minutes and 3 minutes at 56°C, 65°C and 95°C respectively. These data could help laboratory workers to improve their protocols with handling of the virus in biosafety conditions.

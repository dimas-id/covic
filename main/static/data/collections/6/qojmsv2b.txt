Time-course analyses of rapidly processed serum performed in parallel by SELDI and nanoscale LC-MS/MS have revealed the temporal correlation of several literature-based disease markers with ex vivo driven events such that their in vivo existence in healthy subjects is questionable. Identification by MS/MS reveals these putative biomarkers to be byproducts of the coagulation cascade and platelet activation and suggests plasmatic analysis may be preferred. In a pilot plasmatic study, a cohort of na√Øve prostate cancer (PCa) samples were uniformly distinguished from their age-matched controls (n = 20) on the basis of multiple peptidic components; most notably by a derivative of complement C(4) at 1863 m/z (GLEEELQFSLGSKINVK, C4(1353-1369) ). The fully tryptic nature of this and other putative PCa discriminants is consistent with the cleavage specificity of common blood proteases and questions the need for tumor-derived proteolytic activities as has been proposed. In light of the known correlation of disregulated hemostasis with malignant disease, we suggest the underlying differentiating phenomena in these types of analyses may lie in the temporal disparity of sample activation such that the case (patient) samples are preactivated while the control samples are not.

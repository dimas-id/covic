We evaluated a possible role for fibrinolytic components in nasal secretion by tissue localization with immunohistochemical techniques and by measuring their antigen concentrations in nasal discharge by means of ELISA and fibrin autography. Nasal mucosa was obtained surgically from the inferior turbinate. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) specific staining was observed in pseudostratified ciliated epithelium and was predominant in mucous cells of the seromucinous gland, while serous cells were almost devoid of stain. The pattern of staining of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 was similar to that of u-PA. In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1) immunoreactive material was localized exclusively in serous cells of seromucinous glands. Positive staining for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was observed in endothelial cells and basal cells, which differentiate into either ciliated or goblet cells. Nasal secretions were partially fractionated by immunospecific antibody-immobilized Sepharose. Subsequent fibrin autography patterns indicated the presence of u-PA, PAI-1, and t-PA. After methacholine provocation, the level of t-PA increased transiently but decreased rapidly with subsequent challenges. These differential stainings of fibrinolytic components and the existence of PAs and PAI-1 in the nasal discharge suggest that the fibrinolytic system may play a role in the movement and fluidity of nasal secretion.

In this paper, we present an RFID-enabled platform for hospital ward management. Active RFID tags are attached to individuals and assets in the wards. Active RFID readers communicate with the tags continuously and automatically to keep track of the real-time information about the locations of the tagged objects. The data regarding the locations and other transmitted information are stored in the ward management system. This platform enables capabilities of real-time monitoring and tracking of individuals and assets, reporting of ward statistics, and providing intelligence and analytics for hospital ward management. All of these capabilities benefit hospital ward management by enhanced patient safety, increased operational efficiency and throughput, and mitigation of risk of infectious disease widespread. A prototype developed based on our proposed architecture of the platform was tested in a pilot study, which was conducted in two medical wards of the intensive care unit of one of the largest public general hospitals in Hong Kong. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of the implementation of this RFID-enabled platform for practical use in hospital wards. Furthermore, the data collected from the pilot study are used to provide data analytics for hospital ward management.

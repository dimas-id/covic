A country-wide `lock-down' imposed on the 23red March 2020 in the UK had a significant impact on the UK's anthropogenic movements. The closure of work-places and restrictions imposed on visiting friends and family has radically reduced the amount of traffic on the roads. In this short communication, we use data from UK air-quality sensors to quantify air pollution trends pre- and post-lock-down. While we detect large falls in nitrogen dioxide at levels not seen over the last decade, trends in other pollutants were mixed especially when compared to historical data. It suggests that the implication that lock-down was beneficial for the environment was not so obvious.

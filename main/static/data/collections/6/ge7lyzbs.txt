There is tremendous interest in autologous fat grafting for the management of soft tissue volume deficiencies, treatment of cutaneous injuries, and regeneration of missing parts. Given its relative abundance and proximity to the surface of the skin, adipose tissue seems an excellent choice for the treatment of both congenital and acquired soft tissue defects, but the mesenchymal stem cells contained within the fat may provide unexpected opportunities for tissue replacement and repair. Although adipose transfer has been successfully used for reconstructive purposes since the end of the 19th century, numerous controversies about adipose harvesting, processing, delivery, survival, and efficacy still persist today. The purpose of this article was to highlight current practices, areas of controversy, and near-term future applications of fat grafting for reconstruction of the face.

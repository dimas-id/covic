Business intelligence (BI) tools for database analytics have come a long way and nowadays also provide ready insights or visual query explorations, e.g. QuickInsights by Microsoft Power BI, SpotIQ by ThoughtSpot, Zenvisage, etc. In this demo, we focus on providing insights by examining periodic spreadsheets of different reports (aka views), without prior knowledge of the schema of the database or reports, or data information. Such a solution is targeted at users without the familiarity with the database schema or resources to conduct analytics in the contemporary way.

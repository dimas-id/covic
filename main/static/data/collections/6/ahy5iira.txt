Understanding perceptions of parents is necessary to meet parents' needs during a child's resuscitation. Parent presence at pediatric resuscitations has been slow to become consistent practice in all hospital settings and remains controversial. The purpose of this integrative review was to synthesize research on parents' experience while present during a child's resuscitation to improve understanding for health care providers and to facilitate application in practice. Nine studies met inclusion criteria, identifying four major themes. Parents experienced conflicting emotions, articulated a need for communication and support, reported that being physically present was comforting, and described their reactions to the experience. The available research on parents' experience during presence at their child's resuscitation offers a foundation for further detailed study. Further study is needed about parents' perspective of support needed while present during a child's resuscitation, as well as about any long-term effects of presence on parent stress and coping.

Second generation supraglottic airway devices providing high seal airway pressures are suitable for patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy. We compared the seal pressure achieved by the new Ambu AuraGain™ versus LMA Supreme™ following pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position. Sixty female patients were randomly allocated to ventilation with either the AuraGain or the Supreme. A target-controlled system was used to administer total intravenous anesthesia. Intracuff pressure was maintained below 60 cm H2O. The following parameters were registered: Time, number of attempts and manoeuvres required for insertion; seal pressure and peak inspiratory pressure at four time points; ease of gastric tube insertion, flexible scope view, complications and postoperative morbidity. Both devices were quick and easily inserted, although the Supreme required less rotation manoeuvres (16 in AuraGain vs. 6 in LMA Supreme; p = 0.01). The AuraGain achieved higher seal pressures (34 ± 5 in AuraGain vs. 29 ± 5 in LMA Supreme; p = 0.0002). Following pneumoperitoneum in head-down position, peak airway pressure increased 9 ± 3 cm H2O in both groups, exceeding seal pressure in 3 patients in the Supreme group (p = 0.06). The vocal cords were seen through all AuraGain and 90% of the Supreme devices; epiglottis was often visible inside the tube (68%). No differences were found in the incidence of traces of blood on the mask or postoperative symptoms. Both devices allowed effective ventilation in patients undergoing gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery with a low rate of complications. The Ambu AuraGain provided higher seal pressures and a clear view of glottic inlet in all patients offering the possibility to guide direct tracheal intubation if required.

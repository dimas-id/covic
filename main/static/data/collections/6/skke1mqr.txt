Rho GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) have been reported to be of great importance in the initiation and development of many different cancers. However, their biological roles and regulatory mechanisms in lung cancer development and progression are poorly defined. Real-time PCR or western blotting analysis was used to detect Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24), WWP2, p27, p-STAT6 and STAT6 expression levels as well as the activity of RhoA and Rac1 in lung cancer. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis. Tumor growth of lung cancer cells was measured using a nude mouse xenograft experiment model in vivo. The correlation between WWP2 and p27 was measured by co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analysis. We found that ARHGAP24 expression was lower in lung cancer tissues collected from the The Cancer Genome Atlas and independent hospital database. Overexpression of ARHGAP24 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and the activity of RhoA and Rac1, induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at the G(0)â€“G(1) phase. ARHGAP24 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth in nude mice, whereas knockdown of ARHGAP24 significantly promoted cell proliferation and WWP2 expression and inhibited cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase through activating STAT6 signaling. ARHGAP24 overexpression inhibited WWP2 overexpression-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and the decreased p27 expression. Moreover, WWP2 was found interacted with p27, and WWP2 overexpression promoted the ubiquitination of p27. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ARHGAP24 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induces cell apoptosis of lung cancer via a STAT6-WWP2-p27 axis.

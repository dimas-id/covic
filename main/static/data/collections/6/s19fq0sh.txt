PURPOSE OF REVIEW Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has been increasingly reported to be a new less invasive approach. In the field of pediatric urology, in which even the application of laparoscopic surgery is still limited, recent studies are reviewed and the operative method and results evaluated. RECENT FINDINGS Nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy and partial nephrectomy have been reported in renal surgery. Varicocelectomy, orchidectomy and orchidopexy have been performed for intrascrotal diseases. The postoperative complication of hematoma was observed in one bilateral case out of three nephrectomies, and blood transfusion and percutaneous drainage were needed. Postoperatively, two male patients out of 11 nephrectomy cases developed unilateral ipsilateral hydroceles. A surgical repair of the hydrocele was performed in a 3.9-year-old boy. SUMMARY LESS for pediatric patients in urology is feasible but has just begun, and the number of cases experienced is still small. Further clinical evaluation including a large-scale study and comparison with standard laparoscopic surgery will reveal the true efficacy of this novel procedure.

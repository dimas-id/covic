This review summarizes the studies related to detection and occurrence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogens published during 2010. The first section of this review summarizes various detection methods for waterborne pathogens including endpoint, reverse transcriptase, and real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), microarrays, and immunoassays. Relevant literature on sample processing is also included. The second section focuses on phenotypic and genotypic methods for microbial source tracking. The third section summarizes studies related to occurrence, persistence, and transport with emphasis on microbial quality of recreational beaches and watersheds.

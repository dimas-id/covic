In recent decades, many new flavivirus-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavivirus-like viruses because, in contrast to the “classic” flaviviruses and other flavivirus-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions into the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter with either electron-translucent or electron-dense cores. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of Alongshan and Jingmen tick viruses.

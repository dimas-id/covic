Endovascular embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has improved with liquid occlusive agents, but flow-related and anatomic restrictions limit endovascular capabilities. AVM compartments supplied by leptomeningeal networks and feeding arteries too small and/or tortuous for safe catheterization are rarely penetrated by liquid occlusive agents. A case with both impediments prompted a novel solution. A balloon was inflated across the supply to a lenticulostriate feeder, thereby favoring penetration of the liquid occlusive agent, injected from a different feeding territory, back into the AVM compartment supplied by the temporarily occluded feeder. This technique may reduce the number of embolization stages in large high-flow AVMs and increase the likelihood of achieving complete occlusion. This technique is highly complex and requires meticulous monitoring of multiple events.

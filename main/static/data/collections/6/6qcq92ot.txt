Bronchiolitis is a common, acute, contagious lower respiratory tract illness of infants and young children. The majority of cases are secondary to respiratory syncytial virus. There are a number of risk factors for severe disease, including children less than six weeks of age and patients with atopy and/or asthma. The management requires vigilant monitoring and high-quality supportive care, including impressive use of fluids and nutritional support. Further research on anti-virals is essential to prevent respiratory syncytial virus induced bronchiolitis. Fortunately, the prognosis for the majority of normal infants who develop bronchiolitis is good.

Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the most common therapy used to treat dialysis patients with an occluded arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). AVF or AVG hemostasis after PTA is time consuming, and it may be complicated with acute thrombosis of the AVF or AVG and re-bleeding from the puncture site. In this study, we prospectively studied 145 hemodialysis patients with occluded AVF or AVG using a modified purse-string suture with short tubing tourniquet technique for hemostasis following PTA, during which we used heparin and urokinase infusion. The results indicated that the modified technique for hemostasis of AVF orAVG was effective and safe in achieving immediate hemostasis withoutmanual compression in all patients.

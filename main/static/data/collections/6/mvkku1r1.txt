There is no strong evidence to support ventilatory management for critical limitation of expiratory flow, such as bronchospasm during anesthesia or an acute exacerbation of severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Animal models cannot be used to develop reproducible experimental models for conducting mechanical ventilation strategy research relating to these etiologies due to the resulting respiratory and hemodynamic instabilities. Therefore, we developed a device model by modifying a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve that can simulate the characteristics of airway bronchoconstriction (i.e., limited peak expiratory flow and a prolonged expiratory phase). These characteristics were found to improve upon narrowing the expiratory port. We believe that this device model will facilitate future mechanical ventilation experiments.

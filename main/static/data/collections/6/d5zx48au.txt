PURPOSE A flow diverter (FD) is an effective treatment option for intracranial aneurysms. The Flow Re-direction Endoluminal Device (FRED) is a relatively new flow diverter with a unique dual-layer design. We report our experience and short-term results with the FRED. MATERIALS AND METHODS We did a retrospective review of all consecutive cases in which the FRED was used to treat intracranial aneurysms at a single institution from March 2014 till December 2015. Clinical parameters, aneurysm characteristics, technical results and short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Eleven intracranial aneurysms were treated with the FRED in 11 patients. The technical device deployment success rate was 100%. Immediate reduction in intra-aneurysmal flow after deployment was noted in 10 cases. The aneurysm occlusion rate at 6 months was 75%. There was 1 complication of in-stent thrombosis immediately after deployment. There was no side branch occlusion, delayed aneurysm rupture, stroke, or intraparenchymal haemorrhage. There was no neurological deficit, morbidity, or mortality. CONCLUSION The FRED is a new FD. It has shown to be safe and effective in our series. The unique dual-layer design of the device renders it to have technical advantages over other FDs. The 6-month aneurysm occlusion rate and complication profile of FRED are similar to other FDs.

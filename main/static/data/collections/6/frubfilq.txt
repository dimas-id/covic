In this paper, we argue that some of the most popular short-term interest models have to be revisited and modified to reflect current market conditions better. In particular, we propose a modification of the popular Black-Karasinski model, which is widely used by practitioners for modeling interest rates, credit, and commodities. Our adjustment gives rise to the stochastic Verhulst model, which is well-known in the population dynamics and epidemiology as a logistic model. We demonstrate that the Verhulst model's dynamics are well suited to the current economic environment and the Fed's actions. Besides, we derive new integral equations for the zero-coupon bond prices for both the BK and Verhulst models. For the BK model for small maturities up to 2 years, we solve the corresponding integral equation by using the reduced differential transform method. For the Verhulst integral equation, under some mild assumptions, we find the closed-form solution. Numerical examples show that computationally our approach is significantly more efficient than the standard finite difference method.

Abstract Certain future scenarios of technological change are dystopian in their predictions. Fewer are optimistic. Taking a pragmatic stance, this paper seeks to identify certain key threats associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies, giving voice to those in the literature on different sides of the debate. Novel literature is considered that suggests that innovations in the discovery, or research process itself, may hold the key to developing certain collaborative capabilities that can amplify collective intelligence. These capabilities are discussed together with their potential to meet the challenges associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies. Testable propositions are derived from literature, and four technological scenarios are developed for analysis. Certain key challenges are identified and discussed in relation to each of the technological scenarios. In doing so, what are hopefully useful insights are derived for how changes can be made in the present to help avoid meeting the fates described by certain of these scenarios.

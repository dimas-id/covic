C7-H functionalized indoles are ubiquitous structural units of biological and pharmaceutical compounds for numerous antiviral agents against SARS-CoV or HIV-1. Thus, achieving site-selective functionalizations of C7-H of indoles, while discriminating among other bonds, is highly demand. Herein, we disclose site-selective C7-H activations of indoles accomplished by ruthenium(II)biscarboxylate catalysis under mild conditions. Base-assisted internal electrophilic-type substitution C-H ruthenation by weak O-coordination enabled the C7-H functionalizations of indoles, offering ample scope including C-N and C-C bond formation. The versatile ruthenium-catalyzed C7-H activations were characterized by gram-scale syntheses and the traceless removal of directing group, providing easy access to pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds. Detailed mechanistic studies through spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses shed light on the unique nature of robust ruthenium catalysis for C7-H indole functionalizations.

We report a case of human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) bronchiolitis that led to life-threatening respiratory failure in a 9-month-old boy with no other pathogens detected. The virus-specific diagnosis was confirmed with the detection of HBoV1 DNA in respiratory samples and both DNA and IgM and IgG to HBoV1 in serum samples.

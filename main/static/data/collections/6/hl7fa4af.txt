Down syndrome (DS) is frequently comorbid with congenital heart disease and has recently been shown to reduce the sedative effect of benzodiazepine (BDZ)-class anesthesia but this effect in a clinical setting has not been studied. Therefore, this study compared midazolam sedation after heart surgery in DS and normal children. We retrospectively reviewed patient records in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of pediatric cardiovascular operations between March 2015 and March 2018. We selected five days of continuous post-operative data just after termination of muscle relaxants. Midazolam sedation was estimated by Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models. We enrolled 104 patients (average age 26 weeks) of which 16 (15%) had DS. DS patients had a high probability of receiving a higher midazolam dosage and dexmedetomidine dosage over the study period (probability = 0.99, probability = 0.97) while depth of sedation was not different in DS patients (probability = 0.35). Multi regression modeling included severity scores and demographic data showed DS decreases midazolam sedation compared with controls (posterior OR = 1.32, 95% CrI = 1.01â€“1.75). In conclusion, midazolam dosages should be carefully adjusted as DS significantly decreases midazolam sedative effect in pediatric heart surgery patients.

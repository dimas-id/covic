Many animal models have been established for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection of infants with the purpose of studying the pathogenesis, immunological response, and pharmaceutical testing and the objective of finding novel therapies and preventive measures. This review centers on a neonatal lamb model of RSV infection that has similarities to RSV infection of infants. It includes a comprehensive description of anatomical and immunological similarities between ovine and human lungs along with comparison of pulmonary changes and immune responses with RSV infection. These features make the newborn lamb an effective model for investigating key aspects of RSV infection in infants. The importance of RSV lamb model application in preclinical therapeutic trials and current updates on new studies with the RSV-infected neonatal lamb are also highlighted.

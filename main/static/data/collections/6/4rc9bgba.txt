Abstract Over the last several years a wealth of transformative human–virus interaction discoveries have been produced using loss-of-function functional genomics. These insights have greatly expanded our understanding of how human pathogenic viruses exploit our cells to replicate. Two technologies have been at the forefront of this genetic revolution, RNA interference (RNAi) and random retroviral insertional mutagenesis using haploid cell lines (haploid cell screening), with the former technology largely predominating. Now the cutting edge gene editing of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has also been harnessed for large-scale functional genomics and is poised to possibly displace these earlier methods. Here we compare and contrast these three screening approaches for elucidating host–virus interactions, outline their key strengths and weaknesses including a comparison of an arrayed multiple orthologous RNAi reagent screen to a pooled CRISPR/Cas9 human rhinovirus 14–human cell interaction screen, and recount some notable insights made possible by each. We conclude with a brief perspective on what might lie ahead for the fast evolving field of human–virus functional genomics.

This review documents how clinical inquiry expands as our knowledge base about canine herpesvirus (CHV) increases. We must understand the various forms of CHV infection that may occur in the dog population. This has prompted the veterinary community to develop more sensitive diagnostic assays. CHV is more common than we considered a decade ago. Up to 70% of some high-risk dog populations have been infected with and are latent carriers of CHV. Recognition of the various forms of CHV-induced disease, availability of diagnostic assays with increased sensitivity, and the formation of reliable biosecurity measures will allow for better control steps.

A 38-year-old woman presented with a lifelong history of involuntary urinary leakage. The patient reported that she had been operated for her urinary leakage with the diagnosis of stress incontinence with transobturator tape two times at two different institutions. Preoperative computed tomography scan showed complete duplication of the left kidney with poorly functioning upper pole and a tortuous left dilated ureter running down and opening into the vagina. Laparoscopic left upper pole heminephrectomy and ureterectomy were performed uneventfully. Her incontinence improved immediately after surgery.

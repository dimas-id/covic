PURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of single-port laparoscopic gastric resection (SPLGR) with multiport laparoscopic gastric resection (MPLGR) for gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). METHODS Between April 2009 and December 2012, 16 consecutive patients with gastric GISTs underwent SPLGR. The patients undergoing the SPLGR were case-matched for age, sex, body mass index and tumor location with those undergoing MPLGR. The demographic and surgical outcomes were analyzed and compared from the review of a prospectively collected database of 16 patients who underwent MPLGR. RESULTS All 16 patients underwent complete SPLGR without any intraoperative complications. No significant differences were observed in the mean length of the operation (91.4 vs. 94.1 min), blood loss (6.3 vs. 10.1 ml) and length of postoperative hospital stay (4.7 vs. 5.4 days) between the SPLGR and MPLGR groups. The tumor size was similar (37.8 vs. 32.1 mm) and negative surgical margins were achieved in all patients. At a mean follow-up of 27 months, all 16 SPLGR patients were disease-free. CONCLUSIONS Our initial comparison demonstrated that SPLGR, when performed by experienced surgeons, is a safe and feasible procedure for patients with gastric GISTs, resulting in good surgical and oncological outcomes.

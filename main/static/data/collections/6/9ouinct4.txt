The COVID-19 pandemic has swept the globe with more than 2,000,000 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 184 countries and territories. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two crucial actions can reduce the risk of person-to-person viral transmission: frequent hand washing and surface decontamination with specific environmental protection agency (EPA)-registered disinfectants. As hygiene recommendations evolve during the COVID-19 pandemic and community members adopt changing practices, dermatologists are likely to see a rise in adverse cutaneous reactions from prolonged irritant exposures and widespread use of antimicrobials. The purposes of this report are to familiarize dermatologists with the hygiene practices recommended for COVID-19 prevention, to highlight adverse cutaneous reactions associated with repeated exposures to detergents and disinfectants, and to discuss strategies which patients can implement during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize skin irritation white still performing hygiene practices effectively.

We have reported that serum C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation is an independent predictor of lung oxygenation impairment (LOI) after distal type acute aortic dissection (AAD). Systemic activation of the inflammatory system after aortic injury may play a role in the development of LOI. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of beta-blockers on systemic inflammation and the development of LOI after distal type AAD. A total of 49 patients, who were admitted with distal type AAD and treated conservatively, were examined. White blood cell (WBC) count, serum CRP level, and arterial blood gases were measured serially. Forty patients received beta-blocker treatment within 24 h of the onset, while 9 patients received no beta-blocker treatment. Maximum WBC count, maximum CRP level, lowest PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio, and patient background were compared between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups according to age, sex, coronary risk factors, blood pressure, serum level of CRP, WBC count, and oxygenation index on admission. Beta-blocker treatment was associated with lower maximum WBC count (P = 0.0028) and lower maximum serum CRP level (P = 0.0004). The minimum P/F ratio was higher in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without (P = 0.0076). Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of a beta-blocker was an independent negative determinant of LOI (P/F ratio â‰¤200 mmHg). In conclusion, early use of beta-blockers prevented excessive inflammation and LOI after distal type AAD, suggesting a pleiotropic effect of beta-blockers on the inflammatory response after AAD.

BACKGROUND In this study, we aimed to investigate preventable deaths due to trauma among cases in whom autopsy and postmortem examinations were performed in Diyarbakir Council of Forensic Medicine. METHODS In this study, which was planned as retrospectively descriptive, demographic data, type of injury, cause of injury, locations of injuries, cause of death, and scene of death data were withdrawn through the reports of deaths due to trauma in Diyarbakir Council of Forensic Medicine between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008. Medical errors in these deaths and preventable deaths were analyzed with this data. The criteria of American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma was used for definition-classification of errors and compose of preventability criteria. RESULTS It was concluded that of the 747 cases taken into consideration, 4.15% (n=31) were preventable, 16.20% (n=121) were potentially preventable and 79.65% (n=595) were unpreventable. Suboptimal care in 49.34% (n=75), delay in treatment in 41.45% (n=63), missed diagnosis in 10.53% (n=16), clinical judgment error in 10.53% (n=16), missed medical administration in 7.23% (n=11), and other mistakes in 3.95% (n=6) of the cases were determined. CONCLUSION When the results were compared with the studies performed in the areas in which modern trauma care and trauma centers are located, the preventable death ratio was found high. As a result, it has been determined that development of a modern trauma system and trauma centers have significant roles in decreasing preventable death ratios.

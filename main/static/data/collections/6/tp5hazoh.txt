Until recently, pronuclear microinjection of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was the standard method for producing transgenic animals. This technique is now being replaced by more efficient protocols based on somatic nucleartransferthat also permit targeted genetic modifications. Lentiviral vectors and small interfering ribonucleic acid technology are also becoming important tools for transgenesis. Transgenic farm animals are important in human medicine as sources of biologically active proteins, as donors in xenotransplantation, and for research in cell and gene therapy. Typical agricultural applications include improved carcass composition, lactational performance and wool production, as well as enhanced disease resistance and reduced environmental impact. Product safety can be ensured by standardisation of procedures and monitored by polymerase chain reaction and array technology. As sequence information and genomic maps of farm animals are refined, it becomes increasingly practical to remove or modify individual genes. This approach to animal breeding will be instrumental in meeting global challenges in agricultural production in the future.

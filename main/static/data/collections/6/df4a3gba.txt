Adult mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and infected with Citrobacter rodentium for developing a novel murine colitis model. C57BL/6N mice (7-week-old) were divided into four groups. Each group composed of control, dextran sodium sulfate-treated (DSS), C. rodentium-infected (CT), and DSS-treated and C. rodentium-infected (DSS-CT) mice. The DSS group was administered 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. The CT group was supplied with normal drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The DSS-CT group was supplied with 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The mice were sacrificed 10 days after the induction of C. rodentium infection. The DSS-CT group displayed significantly shorter colon length, higher spleen to body weight ratio, and higher histopathological score compared to the other three groups. The mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (INF)-γ were significantly upregulated; however, those of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were significantly downregulated in the DSS-CT group than in the control group. These results demonstrated that a combination of low DSS concentration (1%) and C. rodentium infection could effectively induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. This may potentially be used as a novel IBD model, in which colitis is induced in mice by the combination of a chemical and a pathogen.

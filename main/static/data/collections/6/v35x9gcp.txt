CLINICAL SUMMARY: The clinical findings, treatment and outcome for three cats that underwent laparoscopic splenectomy using bipolar vessel-sealing devices for resection of diffuse splenic disease are described. In each case, a three-portal laparoscopic technique was used. The spleen was manipulated and its mesentery and associated vessels sequentially cauterized and ligated to enable removal through a portal incision with minimal hemorrhage. Each of the three patients recovered from anesthesia without incident and was able to be discharged to the owner the next day. PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Laparoscopic splenectomy may be a safe and effective alternative to celiotomy in a select group of cats requiring splenectomy.

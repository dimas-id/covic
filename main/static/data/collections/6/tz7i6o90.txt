BACKGROUND Since its introduction, the role of laparoscopic surgery has grown and it has now become the standard approach for many surgical procedures. The benefits of smaller incisions, improved pain and convalescence, and shorter hospital stays have greatly improved patient care and satisfaction. In an effort to further minimize the morbidity of surgery, laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) or single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has emerged. We review the collective experience with this novel technique and share our initial observations and early results. METHODS We performed a literature search to review the published experience with this new technique including the breadth of applications and perioperative outcomes associated with LESS in urology. We also analysed the experience with this emerging technique at our institution. RESULTS There are numerous variations with regards to nomenclature as well as types of access to the abdominal cavity as it pertains to LESS. Urologic procedures involving single-port access have acceptable operating room time, blood loss, and postoperative pain, which are in line with standard laparoscopic surgical outcomes with the added benefit of improved cosmesis and smaller incisions. CONCLUSIONS Further studies and larger cohorts are needed to assess the real benefit of LESS procedures. The additional learning curve needed to master these techniques may be a barrier to wider acceptance, although improvements in instrumentation are likely to bridge this gap.

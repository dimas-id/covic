Calderihabitans maritimus KKC1 is a thermophilic, carbon monoxide (CO)-utilizing, hydrogen-evolving bacterium that harbors seven cooS genes for anaerobic CO dehydrogenases and six hyd genes for [NiFe] hydrogenases and capable of using a variety of electron acceptors coupled to CO oxidation. To understand the relationships among these unique features and the transcriptional adaptation of the organism to CO, we performed a transcriptome analysis of C. maritimus KKC1 grown under 100% CO and N2 conditions. Of its 3114 genes, 58 and 32 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated in the presence of CO, respectively. A cooS-ech gene cluster, an "orphan" cooS gene, and bidirectional hyd genes were upregulated under CO, whereas hydrogen-uptake hyd genes were downregulated. Transcriptional changes in anaerobic respiratory genes supported the broad usage of electron acceptors in C. maritimus KKC1 under CO metabolism. Overall, the majority of the differentially expressed genes were oxidoreductase-like genes, suggesting metabolic adaptation to the cellular redox change upon CO oxidation. Moreover, our results suggest a transcriptional response mechanism to CO that involves multiple transcription factors, as well as a CO-responsive transcriptional activator (CooA). Our findings shed light on the diverse mechanisms for transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to CO in CO-utilizing and hydrogen-evolving bacteria.

Oesophageal perforation is a rarely reported complication of transoesophageal echocardiography in infants. This case involves a 3.1-kg neonate with Trisomy 21, atrioventricular septal defect, and hypoplastic aortic arch undergoing aortic arch advancement and pulmonary artery banding. A paediatric transoesophageal echocardiography probe was placed intraoperatively causing a contained false passage from the oesophagus below the cricopharyngeus muscle with extension into the left posterior mediastinum. The perforation healed within 2 weeks without permanent sequelae after conservative medical management.

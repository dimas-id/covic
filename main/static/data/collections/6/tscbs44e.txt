Coronavirus disease-19 is a respiratory viral disease that commonly presents with mild symptoms. However, it can cause serious complications such as acute respiratory disease, especially in patients with comorbidities. As it is a new disease, the full picture of the disease and its complications are not yet fully understood. Moreover, the patients at risk of complications are not well identified; and the data about the risk in patients with hematological malignancies is limited. Here, we report a 65-year-old male with accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia, on dasatinib, tested positive for coronavirus disease-19, then complicated with febrile neutropenia acute respiratory distress syndrome.

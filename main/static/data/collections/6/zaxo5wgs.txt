BACKGROUND Surgeons have a range of materials to choose from to complete wound closure, yet surprisingly very little is still known about the body's immune response to the suture materials in current use. The growing literature of adverse suture material reactions provided the objective of this study, to use in vitro assays to quantify levels of inflammation produced by seven commonly used suture materials in surgical procedures. METHODS Human monocyte/macrophage THP-1 cells were exposed to suture materials for 1, 3 and 5 days. Gene expression and protein secretion of six inflammatory cytokines and two cell surface markers were assessed using qPCR and ELISA respectively, with LPS exposure providing a positive control. Furthermore, a IL-1Î²/IL-1RA marker ratio was assessed to determine the balance between pro-/anti-inflammatory expression. RESULTS The findings from our in vitro study suggest that four commonly used suture materials cause upregulation of pro-inflammatory markers indicative of an early foreign body reaction, with no balance from anti-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS As prolonged early pro-inflammation is known to produce delayed wound healing responses, the knowledge produced from this study has potential to improve informed surgical decision making and patient safety. This work has the capability to reduce suture-related adverse immune reactions, and therefore positively affect patient outcomes.

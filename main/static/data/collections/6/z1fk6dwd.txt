We report our experience with coaxial robot-assisted laparoendoscopic single-site (RA-LESS) myomectomy, including a detailed description of the technique and outcomes from our first 21 cases. This was a retrospective cohort study carried out at the reproductive endocrinology and gynecologic oncology divisions at two academic medical centers. RA-LESS myomectomy was performed with the da Vinci Si Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) employing standard rigid 8 or 5 mm instrumentation in a coaxial arrangement through a standard laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) port (GelPOINT Advanced Access Platform, Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA). Cases were completed between October 2011 and November 2013. Twenty-one patients underwent surgery. Mean age (±SD) was 38.1 ± 5.8 years, and mean BMI was 29.4 ± 4.7 kg/m2. Menorrhagia, pelvic pressure, and urinary frequency were the main presenting symptoms. Mean diameter of the largest tumor was 5.7 ± 1.9 cm (median 5.9 cm, range 2.1-9.5 cm), while mean number of tumors removed was 2.2 ± 1.8, ranging from 1 to 8 per surgery. Mean operative time was 154.2 ± 55.2 min (median 152 min, range 85-290 min). Mean blood loss was 57.9 ± 53.7 cc (median 50 cc, range 5-200 cc) and length of hospital stay ranged between 0 and 3 days (median 0). All procedures were successfully performed without conversion to conventional LESS surgery, multi-port laparoscopy or laparotomy. RA-LESS myomectomy with coaxial use of standard rigid instrumentation is a safe and reproducible addition to the minimally invasive surgeons' armamentarium, with excellent cosmetic and postoperative outcomes in selected patients. Further investigation is needed to define the patient groups that will most benefit from it.

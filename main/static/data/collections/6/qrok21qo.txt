Abstract Influenza remains a serious worldwide health threat with numerous deaths attributed to influenza-related complications. It is likely that transmission of influenza and both the morbidity and mortality of influenza could be reduced if inexpensive but reliable influenza screening assays were more available to the general public or local medical treatment facilities. This report provides the initial evaluation of a pilot system designed by Lucigen Corp. (Middleton, WI, USA) as a potential rapid near point-of-care screening system for influenza A and influenza B. The evaluation of specificity and sensitivity was conducted on stored nasal swab samples collected from emergency department patients presenting with influenza-like symptoms at a large military academic hospital and on de-identified nasal swabs and isolated RNA from a local epidemiology laboratory. The gold standard for assessment of specificity and sensitivity was the LuminexÂ® Respiratory Viral Panel.

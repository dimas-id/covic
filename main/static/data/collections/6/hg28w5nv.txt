Abstract Some of the respiratory viral infections in chickens pose a significant threat to the poultry industry and public health. In response to viral infections, host innate responses provide the first line of defense against viruses, which often act even before the establishment of the infection. Host cells sense the presence of viral components through germinal encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The engagement of PRRs with pathogen-associated molecular patterns leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory and interferon productions. Induced antiviral responses play a critical role in the outcome of the infections. In order to improve current strategies for control of viral infections or to advance new strategies aimed against viral infections, a deep understanding of host-virus interaction and induction of antiviral responses is required. In this review, we summarized recent progress in understanding innate antiviral responses in chickens with a focus on the avian influenza virus and infectious bronchitis virus.

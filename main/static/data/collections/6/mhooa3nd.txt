BACKGROUND Despite the value of simulation for surgical training, it is unclear whether acquired competencies persist long term. A prior randomized trial showed that structured simulation improves knowledge of the safe use of electrosurgery (ES) amongst trainees up to 3 months after the curriculum (Madani et al. in Surg Endosc 28(10):2772-2782, 2014). We now analyse long-term knowledge retention. This study estimates the effects of a structured simulation-based curriculum to teach the safe use of ES on knowledge after 1 year. METHODS Trainees previously participated in a 1-h didactic ES course, followed by randomization into one of two groups: an unstructured hands-on session where trainees used ES devices (control group) or a goal-directed hands-on training session (Sim group). Knowledge of pre- and post-curriculum (immediate, 3 months and 1 year) and knowledge of ES safety were assessed using different multiple-choice examinations. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range), *p < 0.05. RESULTS Fifty-nine trainees participated (30 control group; 29 Sim group). Despite equal baseline examination scores, Sim group demonstrated higher scores compared to control immediately (89% [83; 94] vs. 83% [71; 86]*), 3 months (77% [69; 90] vs. 60% [51; 80]*) and 1 year after curriculum (70% [61; 74] vs. 60% [31; 71]*). One-year score remained significantly greater compared to baseline in the Sim group (70% [61; 74] vs. 49% [43; 57]*), but was similar to baseline in the control group (60% [31; 71] vs. 45% [34; 52]). CONCLUSIONS After ES simulation training, retention of competencies persists longer when the hands-on component is designed to reinforce specific learning objectives in a structured curriculum. Despite routine clinical use of ES devices, knowledge degrades overtime, suggesting the need for ongoing formal educational activities to reinforce curricular objectives.

This review provides an overview regarding the main aspects of candidate COVID-19 vaccines and pathophysiology of disease The types of biotechnological candidate vaccines to be developed against COVID-19, their degree of protection and the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease were analyzed in this review article The literature data on which cruxes for the development of biotechnological candidate vaccines to be wended are based was researched Data that could give reference to various biotechnological candidate vaccines were reviewed For this purpose, up-to-date literature data was utilized The ways to succeed in the development of a vaccine requiring a technological infrastructure are to synthesize the data obtained from long term trials and to put them into practice subsequently The vaccines to be developed by means of recombinant DNA technology will be a source of inspiration to people for further studies After a rapid process of vaccine development, the use of COVID-19 vaccine can be mainstreamed among people to prevent the disease As a result of these practices, the evaluation of which vaccine will be more safe, reliable and effective will be performed after phase studies

A novel protein-folding function of RNA has been recognized, which can outperform previously known molecular chaperone proteins. The RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity is intrinsic to some ribozymes and is operational during viral infections. Our purpose was to test whether influenza hemagglutinin (HA) can be assembled in a soluble, trimeric, and immunologically activating conformation by means of an RNA molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity. An RNA-interacting domain (RID) from the host being immunized was selected as a docking tag for RNA binding, which served as a transducer for the chaperna function for de novo folding and trimeric assembly of RID-HA1. Mutations that affect tRNA binding greatly increased the soluble aggregation defective in trimer assembly, suggesting that RNA interaction critically controls the kinetic network in the folding/assembly pathway. Immunization of mice resulted in strong hemagglutination inhibition and high titers of a neutralizing antibody, providing sterile protection against a lethal challenge and confirming the immunologically relevant HA conformation. The results may be translated into a rapid response to a new influenza pandemic. The harnessing of the novel chaperna described herein with immunologically tailored antigen-folding functions should serve as a robust prophylactic and diagnostic tool for viral infections.â€”Yang, S.

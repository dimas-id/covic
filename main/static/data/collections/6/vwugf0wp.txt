Forced viral adaptation is a powerful technique employed to study the ways viruses may overcome various selective pressures that reduce viral replication. Here, we describe methods for in vitro serial passaging of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to select for mutations which increase replication on semi-permissive cell lines as described in Letko et al., Cell Rep 24, 1730â€“1737, 2018.

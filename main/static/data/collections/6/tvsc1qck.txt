Toxoplasma gondii is a worldwide-distributed protozoon that infects warm-blooded animals. We determined T. gondii exposure in one marine otter (Lontra felina) and four domestic cats (Felis catus) along the northern and central coast of Chile, indicating a low seroprevalence of 5% (1/19) and 8% (4/50) respectively, likely related to arid environment.

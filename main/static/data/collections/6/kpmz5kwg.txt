AIMS: The COVID‐19 pandemic poses unprecedented operational challenges to nephrology divisions in every country as they cope with COVID‐19‐related kidney disease in addition to regular patient care. Although general approaches have been proposed, there is a lack of practical guidance for nephrology division response in a hospital facing a surge of cases. Here, we describe the specific measures that our division has taken in the hope that our experience in Singapore may be helpful to others METHODS: Descriptive narrative RESULTS: A compilation of operational responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic taken by a nephrology division at a Singapore university hospital CONCLUSION: Nephrology operational readiness for COVID‐19 requires a clinical mindset shift from usual standard of care to a crisis exigency model that targets best outcomes for available resources. Rapid multi‐disciplinary efforts that evolve flexibly with the local dynamics of the outbreak are required. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

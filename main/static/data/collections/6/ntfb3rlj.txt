Peptide inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, currently causing a worldwide pandemic, are designed and simulated. The inhibitors are mostly formed by two sequential self-supporting &#945;-helices (bundle) extracted from the protease domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the &#945;-helical peptides maintain their secondary structure and provide a highly specific and stable binding (blocking) to SARS-CoV-2. To provide a multivalent binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, many such peptides could be attached to the surfaces of nanoparticle carriers. The proposed peptide inhibitors could provide simple and efficient therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease.

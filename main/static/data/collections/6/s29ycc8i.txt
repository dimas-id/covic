we read with great interest the article entitled “Should SARS‐CoV‐2 influence immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune blistering diseases?” published by Di Altobrando A. et al. in the JEADV. This is the first report of COronaVIrus DIsease 2019 (COVID‐19) in a patient affected by autoimmune blistering disease (ABD) during immunosuppressive treatment (i.e. azathioprine). The authors conclude that it is crucial to learn of more cases of ABD patients under immunosuppressive treatment who have developed COVID‐19, in order to better quantify the risk of infection under immunosuppressive therapy.

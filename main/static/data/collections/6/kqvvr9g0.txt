An enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detecting IgG antibodies to the Pitman Moore strain of rabies virus in sera from subjects immunised with HDCS vaccine. End‐point titres of antibody were determined using a pocket calculator preprogrammed to analyse absorbence values of test sera and negative controls. The assay was highly reproducible, and very close agreement was achieved when the results were compared with those of the mouse neutralization test. Rabies enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay is easy to perform, the results are obtained within 48 hours, and because it employs inactivated virus, the test can be used safely without special containment facilities.

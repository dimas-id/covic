Pelvic organ prolapse may adversely impact physical, sexual and emotional health. Women with symptomatic prolapse often experience altered bladder and bowel function, increased pelvic pressure, diminution of sexual satisfaction, and altered body image. With increasing vaginal descent, various bladder, bowel, and prolapse symptoms are increased. Approximately 200,000 women undergo inpatient procedures for prolapse in the United States each year, with regional and racial differences in rates of surgery reported. The demand for health care services related to pelvic floor disorders will increase at twice the rate of the population itself.

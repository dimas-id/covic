Nanocarbons, such as carbon nanohorns (CNH) and carbon nanotubes, are materials of interest in many fields of science and technology because of their remarkable physical properties. We report here a novel approach for using NIR laser-driven CNH as an antiviral agent. NIR laser-driven functional CNH complexes could open the way to a new range of antiviral materials.

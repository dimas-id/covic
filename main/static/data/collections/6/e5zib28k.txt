This is the main conclusion of a recent study describing a strong relationship between the degree of obesity and the severity of COVID‐19 infection. Obesity has various negative consequences relative to the course of COVID‐19, including adverse effects on lung physiology, and induces comorbidities such as type II diabetes or hypertension. However, additional mechanisms involving the low‐grade inflammatory state accompanying obesity can also be suggested.

OBJECTIVE To report the clinical features and outcomes of linear gastrointestinal incisions closed with skin staples in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Historical cohort study. ANIMALS 333 client-owned dogs. METHODS Medical records from 1 private referral hospital were searched for dogs that underwent gastrointestinal surgery between November 1999 and October 2015. Cases were included if skin staplers were used to close linear gastrointestinal incisions. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was collected. RESULTS Complications were diagnosed in 8 of 245 (3.27%) dogs, including 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs that died or were euthanized, 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs with incisional dehiscence, and 2 of 245 (0.81%) dogs with attachment of a linear foreign body to the staples at the intestinal lumen. Dehiscence was noted at the enterotomy sites in 3 dogs at a mean time of 44 hours after surgery (SD ± 6.93). Two dogs presented with another linear foreign body that was attached to the staples in the intestinal lumen at postoperative days 24 and 42. The risk factors associated with incisional dehiscence included multiple gastrointestinal incisions performed in 1 surgery (χ2 , P < .001) and the presence of a linear foreign body (χ2 , P = .02253). No associations were detected between dogs' age, sex, weight, surgery time, indication for surgical intervention, surgery location in the gastrointestinal tract, or surgeon experience and incisional dehiscence. CONCLUSION Skin staplers provide safe and effective closure of gastrotomies, enterotomies, and colonotomies in dogs. This method is reliable, efficient, and affordable in the hands of veterinary surgeons with varying skill levels.

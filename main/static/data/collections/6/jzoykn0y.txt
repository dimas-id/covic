Nanofabrication has been a critical area of research in the last two decades and has found wide-ranging application in improvising material properties, sensitive clinical diagnostics, and detection, improving the efficiency of electron transport processes within materials, generating high energy densities leading to pulse power, novel therapeutic mechanisms, environmental remediation and control. The continued improvements in the various fabrication technologies have led to realization of highly sensitive nanostructure-based devices. The fabrication of nanostructures is in principle carried out primarily using top-down or bottom-up approaches. This chapter summarizes the important bottom-up nanofabrication processes for realizing nanostructures and also highlights the recent research conducted in the domain of therapeutics and diagnostics.

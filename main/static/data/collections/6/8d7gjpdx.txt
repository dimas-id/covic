BACKGROUND Minimally invasive preperitoneal balloon tamponade (PPB) and abdominal aortic junctional tourniquets (AAJT) have been proposed as alternatives to open preperitoneal packing (OP) for the management of pelvic fracture-associated hemorrhage. We hypothesized that the PPB (SpaceMaker Pro) and AAJT would result in similar rates of survival and blood loss versus OP. METHODS Thirty-two swine underwent creation of a combined open-book pelvic fracture and major iliac vascular injuries. Animals were randomized to no intervention (n = 7), OP (n = 10), PPB (n = 9), or AAJT (n = 6) at a mean arterial pressure <40 mm Hg following initiation of uncontrolled hemorrhage. Survival (up to 60 minutes + 10 minutes after intervention reversal), hemodynamics, extraperitoneal pressures, blood loss, and associated complications were compared between groups. RESULTS Prior to injury, no difference was measured between groups for weight, hemodynamics, lactate, and hematocrit (all p > 0.05). The injury was uniformly lethal without intervention, with survival time (mean) of 5 minutes, peak preperitoneal pressure (PP) of 14 mm Hg, blood loss of 960 g, and peak lactate of 2.6 mmol/L. Survival time was 44 minutes with OP versus 60 minutes with PPB and AAJT (p < 0.01). Peak PP (mm Hg) was 19 with OP, 23 with PPB, and 23 with AAJT (p > 0.05). Blood loss (g) was 850 with OP, 930 with PPB, and 600 with AAJT (p > 0.05). Peak lactate (mmol/L) was 3.3 with OP, 4.3 with PPB, and 6.3 with AAJT (p < 0.01). Only 33% of AAJT animals survived intervention reversal versus 60% for OP and 67% for PPB (p < 0.01). Necropsy revealed bowel/bladder injury in 50% of AAJT subjects versus 0% in all other arms (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Preperitoneal balloon tamponade is a safe and potentially effective alternative to OP for the management of lethal pelvic fracture-associated hemorrhage. Abdominal aortic junctional tourniquet offers a similar survival benefit to PPB but has concerning rates of ischemia-reperfusion and compressive abdominal organ injury.

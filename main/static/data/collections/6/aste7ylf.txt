In this demo, we introduce an interactive system, which effectively applies multiple criteria analysis to rank association rules. We first use association rules techniques to explore the correlations between variables in given data (i.e., database and linked data (LD)), and secondly apply multiple criteria analysis (MCA) to select the most relevant rules according to user preferences. The developed system is flexible and allows intuitive creation and execution of different algorithms for an extensive range of advanced data analysis topics. Furthermore, we demonstrate a case study of association rule mining and ranking on road accident data.

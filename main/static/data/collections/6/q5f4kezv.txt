10‐(Pentamethyl disiloxanyl) decyl oxazoline (Si) was synthesized. It was copolymerized with either undecyl (U) or nonyl (N) oxazolines using methyl 4‐nitrobenzenesulfonate as initiator. Two series of random poly(N‐acylethylenimine) copolymers, U/Si and N/Si, were synthesized over the whole composition range of Si monomer with a total degree of polymerization of about 100. Narrow molecular weight distributions were obtained. At a monomer to initator ratio of about 1060, the final degree of polymerization was 374 with a polydispersity index of 1.93. This shows the effect of chain transfer in this system.

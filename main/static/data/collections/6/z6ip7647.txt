PURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain between single-incision, gasless, endoscopic transaxillary thyroidectomy (SET), and conventional open thyroidectomy. METHODS From March to December 2015, patients with thyroid disease underwent total thyroidectomy or lobectomy. Patient's clinical and pathological characteristics, postoperative pain score using visual analog scale (VAS) were compared between the 2 groups. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain evaluated by VAS score and postoperative analgesic use. Operation time and length of postoperative hospital stay were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Conventional, open cervical surgery was performed on 30 patients (group O) and SET was performed on 27 patients (group E). Pain scores in shoulder area, which is the ipsilateral side of the tumor location at 1 hour and 24 hours after surgery, were higher in group E patients (P < 0.05). Pain scores 7 days after surgery did not differ between the 2 groups according to the locations (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION In conclusion, endocrine surgeons should be concerned about immediate higher postoperative pain scores in patients who undergo SET.

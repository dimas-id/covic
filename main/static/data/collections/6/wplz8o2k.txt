Personal identification (PID) is an important, if often overlooked, barrier to accessing the social determinants of health for many marginalized people in society. A scoping review was undertaken to explore the range of research addressing the role of PID in the social determinants of health in North America, barriers to acquiring and maintaining PID, and to identify gaps in the existing research. A systematic search of academic and gray literature was performed, and a thematic analysis of the included studies (n = 31) was conducted. The themes identified were: (1) gaining and retaining identification, (2) access to health and social services, and (3) facilitating identification programs. The findings suggest a paucity of research on PID services and the role of PID in the social determinants of health. We contend that research is urgently required to build a more robust understanding of existing PID service models, particularly in rural contexts, as well as on barriers to accessing and maintaining PID, especially among the most marginalized groups in society.

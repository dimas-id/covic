OBJECTIVE To report the use of low-pressure carbon dioxide insufflation during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for resection of a noninvasive thymoma in a cat with secondary myasthenia gravis. STUDY DESIGN Clinical case report. ANIMAL Client-owned cat. METHODS An 11-year-old castrated male domestic shorthair cat was examined for generalized weakness, voice change, hypersalivation, hyporexia, vomiting, coughing, and gagging. Thoracic ultrasound revealed a cranial mediastinal mass for which cytology was consistent with a thymoma (or lymphoid tissue). Acetylcholine receptor antibody concentration was elevated at 3.16 mmol/L (reference interval < 0.3 mmol/L). Thoracic computed tomography showed two round, contrast-enhancing structures in the cranioventral mediastinum identified as the sternal lymph node and a cranial mediastinal mass (11 × 17 × 24 mm). A presumptive diagnosis of thymoma with paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis was made and surgical resection of both mediastinal masses was recommended. RESULTS Video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of the cranial mediastinal mass and sternal lymph node were performed with low-pressure carbon dioxide insufflation maintained at an intrathoracic pressure of 2-3 mmHg. The cat recovered from surgery without serious complications. Nineteen months after surgery, the cat developed hind limb stiffness. Thoracic radiographs ruled out a cranial mediastinal mass or megaesophagus. Acetylcholine receptor antibody concentration remained elevated at 2.72 mmol/L. CONCLUSION Low-pressure thoracic insufflation facilitated video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of cranial mediastinal masses in this cat.

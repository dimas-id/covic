The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) after chemoprophylaxis in patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures, and to identify risk factors for VTEs in this subgroup of patients. To detect VTE, multi-detector computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. Of 363 patients assessed, the incidence of symptomatic VTE was 12.4% (45 patients), and the incidence of symptomatic PE was 5.2% (19 patients). For the risk-factor analysis, a higher Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.037), and a history of external fixator application (p = 0.007) were associated with increased VTE risk. Among patients who had VTE, male sex (p = 0.017), and above-the-knee fractures (p = 0.035) were associated with increased pulmonary embolism (PE) risk. In conclusions, the incidence of VTE in post-traumatic patients is not low after chemoprophylaxis. Risk factors for VTE and PE are different among patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures.

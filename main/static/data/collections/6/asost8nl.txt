Abstract The humoral intrathecal immune response in coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis in rats associated with an autoimmune reaction to brain antigen, was analysed. The CSF of these animals revealed immune reactions which were directed against coronavirus and other, unknown, antigens. In general, no direct correlation between the disease, the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), intrathecal synthesis of Ig and the presence of virus-specific antibodies was detectable, suggesting that the humoral, in contrast to the cellular, immune response does not play a significant pathogenetic role in this CNS disease.

There have been three major global outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus in the last two decades. The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, is the most dangerous, which spread to 163 countries and 6 continents and caused a major public health emergency worldwide. The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human. As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%. There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important. In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures. We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.

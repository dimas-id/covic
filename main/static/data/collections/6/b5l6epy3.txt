Abstract Molecular analysis of respiratory viruses and the host response to both infection and vaccination have transformed our understanding of these ubiquitous pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care. Over the past decade a number of new respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses have been discovered using molecular techniques such as random primer amplification, pan-viral array and next generation sequencing. Analysis of the host transcriptional response during respiratory viral infection using in-vitro, animal models and natural and experimental human challenge have furthered the understanding of the mechanisms and predictors of severe disease and may identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent and ameliorate illness.

Cutaneous manifestations are becoming increasingly well-documented in adults with COVID-19. There is now also a growing body of literature regarding skin involvement in children, with reports of papulovesicular, petechial and widespread macular and papular lesions, as well as chilblains (pernio). We describe the case of a thirteen-year-old boy with confirmed COVID-19 in the United Kingdom who presented with skin findings localized to the plantar aspects of the feet, axillae and lower limbs. The morphology was predominantly maculopapular but also included petechiae and annular lesions.

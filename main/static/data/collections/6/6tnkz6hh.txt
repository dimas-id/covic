Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province,China, in December 2019 and soon after Chinese health authorities tookunprecedented prevention and control measures to curb the spreading ofthe novel coronavirus-related pneumonia. We develop a mathematicalmodel based on daily updates of reported cases to study the evolutionof the epidemic. With the model, on 95% confidence level, we estimatethe basic reproduction number, R0 = 2.82 ± 0.11, time between March19 and March 21 when the effective reproduction number becoming lessthan one, the epidemic ending after April 2 and the total number ofconfirmed cases approaching 14408 ± 429 on the Chinese mainlandexcluding Hubei province.

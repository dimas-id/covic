Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the predominant cause of severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea in swine. The lack of effective therapeutical treatment underlines the importance of research for new antivirals. In this study, we identified Q7R, which actively inhibited PEDV replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.014μg/mL. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of Q7R was over 100μg/mL and the derived therapeutic index was 7142. Several structural analogues of Q7R, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and catechin, also showed moderate anti-PEDV activity. Antiviral drugs and natural compounds revealed ribavirin, interferon-α, coumarin and tannic acid have relative weaker efficacy compared to Q7R. Q7R did not directly interact with or inactivate PEDV particles and affect the initial stage of PEDV infection by interfering of PEDV replication. Also, the effectiveness of Q7R against the other two viruses (TGEV, PRCV) was lower compared to PEDV. Q7R could be considered as a lead compound for development of anti-PEDV drugs to may be used to during the early stage of PEDV replication and the structure-activity data of Q7R may usefully guideline to design other related antiviral agents.

BACKGROUND Schools are a key setting for childhood obesity interventions, yet nurses are not often included in delivering these interventions. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine school-based interventions involving nurses in a role beyond anthropometric measurement for effect on change in body measures. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of these papers. RESULTS The literature search produced 2412 articles. Eleven met inclusion criteria for the systematic review (4 randomized controlled trail [RCT], 7 quasi-experimental) and 8 for the meta-analysis. None have been included in prior meta-analyses. Four studies restricted eligibility to overweight and/or obese children; 7 included all children regardless of body weight. Random effects meta-analytic models represent data from 6050 (body mass index [BMI]), 5863 (BMIz), and 416 (BMI percentile) children, respectively. Pooled analyses demonstrated statistically significant decreases in BMI (6 studies: -0.48 [95% CI -0.84, -0.12]; I(2) =91.2%, Q=68.1), BMIz (5 studies: -0.10 [95% CI: -0.15, -0.05]; I(2) =0, Q=2.3), and BMI percentile (3 studies: -0.41 [95% CI: -0.60, -0.21]; I(2) =0, Q=2.0). CONCLUSIONS These findings are similar to those of other meta-analyses of school-based interventions and suggest that school nurses can play a key role in implementing sustainable, effective school-based obesity interventions.

BACKGROUND Congenital inguinal hernia (CIH) is a commonly performed surgical procedure in infants and children. Single port laparoscopic hernia repair using percutaneous internal inguinal ring (IIR) suturing procedure is a widely employed technique for indirect inguinal hernia repair in children. The majority of extracorporeal techniques use extracorporeal knotting and burying the knot subcutaneously. This may result in many drawbacks. The aim of this multicenter study is to introduce a new technique for pediatric inguinal hernia repair using only needles without any laparoscopic instruments. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a multicenter study which was conducted at Pediatric Surgical Departments of Al-Azhar, Mansoura, Alexandria and Tanta Universities during the period from January 2015 to June 2017. 314 patients with CIH underwent Needlescopic Assisted Internal Ring Suturing (NAIRS) after cauterization of the hernia sac at its neck. The main outcome measures were: feasibility, safety of the technique, operative time, recurrence rate, hydrocele and cosmetic results. RESULTS A total of 314 patients with CIH were corrected by NAIRS. They were 232 males and 82 females. The mean age was 28.12 ± 1.3 months (range 6-120 months). The mean operative time was 12.6 ± 1.7 min (range 8-15 min) for unilateral cases and 18.6 ± 1.7 min (range 14-20 min) for the bilateral repairs. All cases were completed laparoscopically without major intraoperative complications. No recurrence was detected in this study. No wound complications or umbilical hernias developed. Hydrocele occurred in five males (2.16%), without detection of testicular atrophy or iatrogenic ascent of the testis. CONCLUSION This preliminary study showed that NAIRS after cauterization of the neck of the hernia sac in infants and children is safe, feasible, reproducible with excellent cosmetic results.

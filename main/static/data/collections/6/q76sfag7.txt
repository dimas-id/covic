Cox-maze IV ablation by bipolar radiofrequency clamp was considered to be only performed through median sternotomy (MS), but impossible through right minithoracotomy (RM). Now, we developed a novel technique of performing Cox-maze IV ablation entirely by bipolar clamp through RM. To compare the outcomes of RM or MS for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with entirely bipolar clamp. All 152 patients underwent mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with bipolar clamp through RM (n = 69) or MS (n = 83) were analyzed for outcome differences. The etiology of mitral valve disease was rheumatic (n = 97) and degenerative (n = 55). All patients had long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Diameter of left atrium ranged from 42 to 60 mm. All patients successfully underwent Cox-maze IV ablation by bipolar clamp. RM group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (130.3 ± 17.7 vs 115.3 ± 14.4 min; P < 0.001) and aortic cross-clamp time (91.8 ± 12.7 vs 74.6 ± 9.3 min; P < 0.001). But mechanical ventilation time (14.2 ± 6.6 vs 21.3 ± 9.0 h; P < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (9.3 ± 2.6 vs 11.7 ± 3.0 days; P < 0.001) were shorter in RM group. At discharge, the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) was 94.2% in RM group and 95.1% in MS group (P = 1.000). Cumulative maintenance of NSR at 2 years postoperatively was 85.1 ± 5.8% in RM group and 88.6 ± 3.6% in MS group (P = 0.767). RM can achieve similar therapeutic effect to MS for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with entirely bipolar clamp. In addition, patients through RM had faster recovery.

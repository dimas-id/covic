Fragment-based methods for drug discovery are increasingly popular because they provide drug leads with greater ligand efficiency than conventional high-throughput screening. However, established methods for fragment detection do not address the central question in fragment-based ligand discovery: how can a primary ligand be optimally extended by a secondary fragment? Dynamic screening methods solve this issue by using a protein target as a template for ligand assembly, thus yielding high-affinity binders from low-affinity fragments. This review summarizes recent work on dynamic screening methodology, which resulted in the development of several high-affinity binders for various targets. Strengths and limitations of the published approaches are discussed and possible contributions of dynamic screening methodology to the drug discovery process are highlighted.

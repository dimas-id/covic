Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an important risk to global health. This study surveyed 370 international orthopaedic surgeons affiliated with the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons to help identify the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient care. A total of 99 surgeons (27% of those surveyed) completed the questionnaire representing 32 different countries. Except for surgeons in Japan, all respondents noted that their practice had been affected to some degree and 70% of the surgeons have cancelled elective procedures. More than a third of the surgeons have had to close their practices altogether and the remaining open practices were estimated to be sustainable for 7 weeks on average given their current situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in marked changes to the majority of international arthroplasty practices.

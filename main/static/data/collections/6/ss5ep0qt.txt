PURPOSE This review covers the most recent evidence to discuss the incidence of occult uterine sarcoma, whether morcellation increases tumor dissemination or mortality, and whether there is a difference between different types of morcellation. We will also discuss techniques to reduce the spread of an undiagnosed uterine sarcoma. METHOD A comprehensive literature search was made in Pubmed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for articles related to the incidence of occult uterine sarcoma after morcellation. RESULTS Fibroids are benign uterine tumors and are a common indication for gynecologic surgery. Increasingly, gynecologists are approaching these surgeries with minimally invasive techniques. Uterine sarcomas are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors that are difficult to distinguish preoperatively from uterine fibroids. CONCLUSION During a minimally invasive surgery, there is a risk of disseminating an occult sarcoma during tissue extraction. Minimally invasive gynecologists are tasked with balancing taking a minimally invasive approach, which is shown to result in better patient outcomes, with minimizing the risk of spreading an occult sarcoma.

This chapter provides an overview of the current position and the possible future of Global Health Governance (GHG)—in terms of the connections and disconnections with the overall architecture of international organizations engaged in global governance. The main focus of this discussion is on the relationship between GHG and leadership summits, including both the “G8” and “G20.” The discussion first notes that while GHG has become a central focus for international diplomacy it has become ever more fragmented as new actors and venues negotiate aspects of global health without apparent reference to a central agency or process. It then briefly reviews the growing role of foundations before focusing on the role of G8 summitry in GHG. The final section and conclusion consider how the G20 could provide a further venue for GHG.

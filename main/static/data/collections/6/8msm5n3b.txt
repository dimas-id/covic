Abstract Introduction: This study compares the detection of 14 common respiratory viruses by two different real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods: in house singleplex tests developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the commercially available Fast Track Diagnostic (FTD®) Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex test. Methods: A total of 217 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed using CDC singleplex rRT-PCR and FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex assays, for the detection of 14 respiratory viruses. Results: The results showed that 179/217 (82.5%) samples were positive with the singleplex method and 183/217 (84.3%) with the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex test. Excellent or satisfactory agreement was obtained for all viruses (k > 0.6) except Parainfluenzavirus 4 (k = 0.24) and influenza B (k = 0.51). Conclusion: Although the multiplex FTD kits were more expensive than the singleplex assay, the FTD kits yielded rapid results in a shorter timeframe, increasing efficiency of diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is a recognized cause of influenza‐like illness (ILI). The proportion of ILI attributable to adenovirus is not known. Moreover, knowledge gaps remain with respect to the epidemiologic, virologic, and clinical characteristics of adenovirus‐associated ILI among otherwise healthy individuals. METHODS: An observational, longitudinal study of <65‐year‐old patients with febrile ILI at five medical centers was conducted from 2009 to 2014. Nasopharyngeal specimens obtained at enrollment were first tested by single‐reaction PCR for adenovirus, then further evaluated by a multiplex PCR assay for other respiratory viral pathogens. Symptoms over a 28‐day period were collected. RESULTS: We enrolled 1536 individuals, among whom 43 (2·8%) were positive for adenovirus. The median age of cases was 3·4 years (range: 4 months to 41 years). Three were hospitalized. Species and serotype information was available for 33 (76·7%) cases. Species C (n = 21) was the most common, followed by B3 (n = 9) and one each of E4a, D46, and A. Species C infections were more frequent in children (P < 0·01). Half of the cases were positive for at least one other respiratory viral pathogen. Symptoms were generally mild and most commonly included cough (90%), fatigue (79%), rhinorrhea (74%), loss of appetite (71%), and sore throat (64%). Children with non‐C adenovirus infection were more likely to report sore throat (P = 0·05) and hoarseness (P = 0·06) than those with species C infection. CONCLUSIONS: Adenovirus is frequently detected with other respiratory viruses. Persons with non‐C adenovirus infections reported more severe symptoms, suggesting there may be species‐specific differences in virulence and/or host response to infection.

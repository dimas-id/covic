Markovian credit migration models are a reasonably standard tool nowadays, but there are fundamental difficulties with calibrating them. We show how these are resolved using a simplified form of matrix generator and explain why risk-neutral calibration cannot be done without volatility information. We also show how to use elementary ideas from differential geometry to make general inferences about calibration stability.

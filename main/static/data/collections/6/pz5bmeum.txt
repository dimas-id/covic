INTRODUCTION The p64 flow diverter (FD) device is a fully resheathable and detachable stent dedicated for endovascular treatment (EVT) of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). We report our mid-term experience with this device. METHODS Between January 2015 and February 2016, we retrospectively identified, in our prospectively maintained database, all patients treated with p64 FDs in two institutions. Independent clinical follow-up was performed by a vascular neurologist. Imaging follow-up included a digitalized subtraction angiography (DSA) at 3, 6, and 12 months and a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 12 months. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients (22 women/17 men; median age 54 years) with 48 IAs (median aneurysm size 6.2 mm; mean neck size 3.4 mm) were identified. All IAs were saccular and unruptured. Failure of safe stent delivery occurred in 15% of cases (7/48 IAs) which were excluded. Transient neurological morbidity occurred in 2/35 patients (5.7%) including one delayed thromboembolic complication. No permanent morbidity or mortality was encountered. Complete aneurysmal occlusion at 3, 6, and 12 months was 20/30 (66.6%), 18/27 (66.6%), and 24/28 (85.7%), respectively. Intra-stent stenosis was observed in 9/29 patients (31%) and classified as moderate in 4/29 (13.7%) and mild in 5/29 patients (17.2%). These stenoses gradually improved over time, with only mild stenoses being identified at 6 months and at 12 months. CONCLUSION In our small case series, the p64 FD stent appears safe and effective for EVT of IAs. A high occlusion rate and a low morbidity rate were observed.

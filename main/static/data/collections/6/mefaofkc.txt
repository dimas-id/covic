OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) gene and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS). METHODS A case-control study was conducted and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to detect the T/G polymorphism at position-88 in the mxA gene promoter. Information on related factors of SARS was collected using a pre-testing questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted with SPSS software package. RESULTS Sixty-six cases and sixty-four controls were selected for the study. Comparing with GG genotype, the proportion of GT genotype were significantly higher in the case group (81.3%) than that in the control group (62.5%)) with an OR (95% CI) of 2.700 (1.208-6.037). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the significant association remained after factors as wearing masks, protection gowns and eye-protection when contacting with SARS patient etc. were adjusted with an OR (95 % CI) of 2.911 (1.027-8.250). CONCLUSION mxA promoter-88G/T SNP might be confered to host genetic susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population.

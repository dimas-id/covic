VP2 protein is the major host-protective immunogen of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) of chickens. Transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing recombinant VP2 were developed. The VP2 gene of an IBDV antigenic variant E strain was isolated, amplified by RT-PCR and introduced into a plant expression vector, pE1857, having a strong promoter for plant expression. A resulting construct with a Bar gene cassette for bialaphos selection in plant (rpE-VP2) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciensby electroporation. Agrobacterium containing the rpE-VP2 construct was used to transform Ar. thaliana and transgenic plants were selected using bialaphos. The presence of VP2 transgene in plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis and its expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. Western blot analysis and antigen-capture ELISA assay using monoclonal anti-VP2 were used to determine the expression of VP2 protein in transgenic plants. The level of VP2 protein in the leaf extracts of selected transgenic plants varied from 0.5% to 4.8% of the total soluble protein. Recombinant VP2 protein produced in plants induced antibody response against IBDV in orally-fed chickens.

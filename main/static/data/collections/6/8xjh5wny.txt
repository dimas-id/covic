This paper explores the lived experiences of college students who are stranded in the middle of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. It follows the approach of Heideggerian existential phenomenology in studying ontology or what it means to be. Five college students were purposively selected to participate in the study. The researcher gained insight into each world of the students using interview procedures and thematic analysis. The results are presented through emerging themes and contextual ground. A conceptual structure that depicts the essence of the lived experiences of the stranded college students is offered in the end of the paper.

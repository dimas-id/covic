We present here INSIGHT (Isothermal NASBA-Sequencing based hIGH-througput Test): a two-stage COVID-19 testing strategy, using a combination of an isothermal NASBA reaction and next generation sequencing. From commercially acquired human saliva with spiked-in viral RNA as input, the first stage employs isothermal amplification of viral RNA to give a rapid result in one to two hours, using either fluorescence detection or a dipstick readout, whilst simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes into the amplification product. In the first stage, fluorescent viral RNA detection can be consistently achieved at 10-100 copies per 20 Âµl reaction. The second stage pools post-amplification barcoded products from multiple samples for scalable sequencing that could be centralised, to further improve the accuracy of the test in a massively parallel way. Our two-stage testing strategy is suitable for further development into a home-based or point-of-care assay, and is potentially scalable to population level. IMPORTANT This protocol has not been validated on patient samples and should not be used for clinical diagnosis without further validation and certification. ***This is ongoing research to develop a testing strategy for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Wellcome Sanger Institute is not in a position to develop this into a commercial product, but would be open to discussions with third parties about how they could develop this further to achieve the societal benefits of this work.***

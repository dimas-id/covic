OBJECTIVES To evaluate the long-term results of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of small renal tumours in patients with a single functioning kidney (SFK). METHODS This is a single-centre prospective study. Patients with an SFK and a tumour smaller than 3.5 cm, treated with RFA over a 7.5-year period, were included. Nineteen consecutive patients (12 male), aged between 33 and 83 years (mean 61.4), were treated for 23 lesions. Primary endpoints were technical success and tumour recurrence rate. Secondary endpoints were the deterioration of renal function and overall survival rate. RESULTS The mean follow-up was 56.1 months (range 36-102). Primary technical success was 100 %. There were no major peri-procedural complications. In two cases, minor complications occurred. There was no significant difference between the baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and GFR at 3, 12 and 24 months post-procedure. In four lesions (17 %), recurrence was detected and an additional RFA session was performed. None of the patients developed renal failure during their lifetime. Three of the patients died because of other reasons. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous RFA of small renal tumours in patients with an SFK offers very satisfactory long-term results regarding preservation of renal function, local tumour control and overall survival. KEY POINTS • Tumour in a single functioning kidney requires minimally invasive treatment. • Radiofrequency ablation plays an established role in managing small renal tumours. • Long-term results of radiofrequency ablation have shown satisfactory local tumour control. • Long-term results have also shown that renal function may be preserved.

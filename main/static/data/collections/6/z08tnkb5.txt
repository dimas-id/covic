BACKGROUND Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is frequently performed for treating patients with gastric cancer; however, the absence of anastomotic techniques with greater superiority has impaired its popularization. We have compared two types of anastomotic techniques with regard to technical perspectives and clinical outcomes. METHODS We reviewed 43 patients with gastric cancer who underwent LTG. Two types of anastomotic techniques have been applied after LTG-the trans-orally inserted anvil (OrVil™) and the reverse puncture device (RPD). Data on the type of anastomosis, blood loss, operation time, anastomosis time, location of tumors, distance between the top border of tumors and top resection margin, diameter of tumor, length of postoperative hospital stay, early and late postoperative complications, and total cost of surgical consumables were obtained by reviewing patient medical records and analyzed thereafter. RESULTS We included 32 men and 11 women (mean age 61 years). The loss to follow-up rate was 13.2%. The median survival time for the OrVil™ and RPD groups was 23 and 22 months, respectively. The total rate of complications was 9.3%. The difference in the anastomosis times between the groups was statistically significant. OrVil™ required more time than RPD and cost more than RPD. CONCLUSIONS Both the OrVil™ and RPD techniques showed good safety and applicability in LTG. RPD showed an advantage with regard to lesser operative complexity and lower cost.

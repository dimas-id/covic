The present paper proposes a reconstruction of the epidemic curves from the fractal interpolation point of view. Looking at the epidemic curves as fractal structures might be an efficient way to retrieve missing pieces of information due to insufficient testing and predict the evolution of the disease. A fractal approach of the epidemic curve can contribute to the assessment and modeling of other epidemics. On the other hand, we have considered the spread of the epidemic in countries like Romania, Italy, Spain, and Germany and analyzed the spread of the disease in those countries based on their fractal dimension.

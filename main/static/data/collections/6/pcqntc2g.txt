INTRODUCTION Dyslipidemia affects up to 75% of morbidly obese individuals and is a key driver of cardiovascular disease. Weight loss is an established strategy to improve metabolic risk, including dyslipidemia. We aimed to determine weight loss goals for resolution of serum lipid abnormalities, by measuring improvements during progressive weight loss in obese individuals. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of obese individuals with the metabolic syndrome undergoing adjustable gastric banding. Lipid levels were monitored monthly for 9 months, then three monthly until 24 months. RESULTS There were 101 participants included, age 47.4 ± 10.9 years with body mass index 42.6 ± 5.9 kg/m2. At 24 months, total body weight loss (TBWL) was 18.3 ± 7.9%. This was associated with significant improvements in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (1.18 vs 1.47, p < 0.001), triglyceride (2.0 vs 1.4, p < 0.001), and total cholesterol to HDL ratio (TC:HDL) (4.6 vs 3.6, p < 0.001). Over this time, progressive and linear improvements in HDL, triglycerides, and TC:HDL were seen with incremental weight loss (observed at 2.5% TBWL intervals). Significant improvements occurred after a threshold weight loss of 7.5-12.5% TBWL was achieved, with odds ratio (OR) 1.48-2.50 for normalization. These odds improved significantly with increasing weight loss (OR 18.2-30.4 with > 25% TBWL). Despite significant weight loss, there was no significant change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL). CONCLUSION Significant improvements in triglycerides, HDL, and TC:HDL occur after 7.5-12.5% TBWL, with ongoing benefit after greater weight loss. LDL needs to be addressed independently, as this was not observed to respond to weight loss alone. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER Australian Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12610000049077).

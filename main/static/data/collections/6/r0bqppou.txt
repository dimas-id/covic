Depth of dormancy of alpine and subalpine perennial forbs in autumn was investigated, which was judged by the number of days required for growth initiation at 24 °C. The depth of dormancy differed depending on Raunkiaer's life‐form and shoot habits. Chamaephytes with perennial shoot‐axes showed shallower dormancy than hemicryptophytes with annual shoot‐axes, and geophytes with annual shoot‐axes showed the deepest dormancy. The results strongly suggest that the dormancy is more endogenously controlled in forbs less hardy to freezing stress. Potential growth ability of alpine herbaceous chamaephytes in autumn is an adaptive advantage, since they utilize the short vegetative period as long as possible. All of the species with annual shoot‐axes had winter buds covered with scales. In plants with perennial shoot‐axes, percentage of winter buds covered with scales increased with increasing depth of dormancy. The results indicate that the shoot apices are well protected by bud scales in forbs with a long endogeneous‐dormant period.

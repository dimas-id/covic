Environmental factors, in particular infectious agents, are thought to have a major influence on the development and course of MS. Some of these influences are also reflected in the animal model, EAE. In this chapter, the role of infectious agents in the development and course of autoimmunity in EAE is discussed. Other environmental agents including trauma, solar radiation exposure, temperature, stress, toxins, are discussed in terms of their relevance to MS and EAE.

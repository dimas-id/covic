The kinetics of appearance of antibodies directed to the major structural proteins N, M and E of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was followed in pigs naturally- and experimentally-exposed to the virus. Specific IgM antibody titers were first detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) at the end of the first week of PRRSV infection, peaked by day 14 to 21 post-inoculation (p.i.), then rapidly decreased to undetectable levels by day 35 to 42 p.i. On the other hand, specific IgG antibody titers peaked by day 21 to 28 p.i. and remained unchanged to the end of the 6- or 9-week observation period; in addition, a persistent viremia was observed. Virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers >8 were not detected until 3 to 4 weeks p.i. Taken together, the results obtained by Western blotting analyses using purified virus andE. coli-expressed ORFs 5 to 7 gene products, suggested that antibodies directed against the envelope E protein appear by day 7 p.i., whereas antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid N and membrane M proteins can only be detected by the end of the second week p.i. No correlation could be demonstrated between VN and IIF antibody titers, viremia, and viral protein specificities of circulating antibodies at various times p.i.

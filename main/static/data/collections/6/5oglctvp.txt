Stress can be temporary or chronic, and mild or acute. Depending on its extent and severity, cells either alter their metabolism, and adopt a new state, or die. Fluctuations in environmental conditions occur frequently, and such stress disturbs cellular homeostasis, but in general, stresses are reversible and last only a short time. There is increasing evidence that regulation of gene expression in response to temporal stress happens post-transcriptionally in specialized subcellular membrane-less compartments called ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. RNP granules assemble through a concentration-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation of RNA-binding proteins that contain low-complexity sequence domains (LCDs). Interestingly, many factors that regulate microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and alternative splicing are RNA-binding proteins that contain LCDs and localize to stress-induced liquid-like compartments. Consequently, gene silencing through miRNAs and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs are emerging as crucial post-transcriptional mechanisms that function on a genome-wide scale to regulate the cellular stress response. In this Review, we describe the interplay between these two post-transcriptional processes that occur in liquid-like compartments as an adaptive cellular response to stress.

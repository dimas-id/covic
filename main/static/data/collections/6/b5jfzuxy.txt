H9N2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is distributed worldwide and causes enormous economic losses in the poultry industry. Despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines, the disease still remains widespread. We speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of H9N2 viruses. In this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the M1 and HA2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic H9N2 virus strain. The M1-HA2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide, and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from L. lactis by Western blotting. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant L. lactis strain. Eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups, and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant L. lactis strain. Fecal and intestinal samples, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). Chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, T cell-mediated immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA). Following challenge with H9N2 virus at 21 dpv, chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed decreased weight loss, lower viral titers in the lung, and reduced lung pathological damage. In summary, our results demonstrated that a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity. This oral vaccine is H9N2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies. Our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection.

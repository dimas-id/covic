The assessment and optimization of cardiovascular and hemodynamic variables is a mainstay of patient management in the care for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) or the operating room (OR). It is, therefore, of outstanding importance to meticulously validate technologies for hemodynamic monitoring and to study their applicability in clinical practice and, finally, their impact on treatment decisions and on patient outcome. In this regard, the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing (JCMC) is an ideal platform for publishing research in the field of cardiovascular and hemodynamic monitoring. In this review, we highlight papers published last year in the JCMC in order to summarize and discuss recent developments in this research area.

Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a novel anti-diabetic drug blocks the reabsorption of glucose in proximal tubules of kidney, are demonstrated to have cardiovascular and renal benefits for people with diabetes. The benefits are associated with the significant increase of intrarenal angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) expression and blood volume contraction. However, the increased ACE2 may be detrimental to patients infected with the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which is found to invades cells via the entry receptor of ACE2. Besides, SGLT2i induced natriuretic effect may also increase the risk of acute kidney injury and affect the hemodynamic stability during systemic infection disease. In the article, we explain the mechanisms why the use of SGLT2i in people with diabetes may lead to worse outcomes and suggest clinician to judiciously use it during COVID-19 pandemic.

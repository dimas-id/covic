Anastomoses in major upper gastrointestinal surgery can be technically demanding, especially handsewn anastomoses traversing the diaphragmatic hiatus. The OrVil stapler is a unique circular stapler that allows rapid creation of various upper gastrointestinal anastomoses in technically challenging circumstances, particularly if additional proximal clearance is desirable. Little is reported in the literature regarding its outcomes and complication rates. In this 'How I do It' article, we describe our technique and experience with the OrVil in major upper gastrointestinal surgery.

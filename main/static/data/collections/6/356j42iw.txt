BACKGROUND Pregnancy in a rudimentary uterine horn is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy with a high risk of rupture. Management usually involves excision of the rudimentary horn. If diagnosed after the first trimester, it has been managed in the past by laparotomy. CASE A primigravid woman was found on routine ultrasound to have a rudimentary horn pregnancy. The diagnosis was confirmed on MRI, and a thin uterine wall was demonstrated. Management comprised fetal injection of potassium chloride followed by complete laparoscopic excision of the rudimentary horn at 16 weeks' gestation. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic management of a mid-trimester rudimentary horn pregnancy is feasible, but expert radiological characterization is required for optimal surgical planning.

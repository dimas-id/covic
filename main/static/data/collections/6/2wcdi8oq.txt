BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Validation of laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for patients with gastric cancer has not been fully investigated. In particular, the technique for esophagojejunostomy remains controversial. We performed 103 cases of LTG for patients with gastric cancer between 2007 and 2013, in which all esophagojejunostomy reconstruction was performed with intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil system except for the first 3 cases. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the clinical usefulness of LTG with intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil system and oncological feasibility of LTG as compared with open total gastrectomy (OTG). PATIENTS AND METHOD We retrospectively analyzed clinical course of consecutive 100 operations with LTG in comparison with consecutive 53 operations with OTG for patients with gastric cancer. As an estimation of short-term outcome, operative time, blood loss, postoperative hospital days and postoperative data of blood and drain examination were included. Moreover, relapse-free survival time and overall survival time stratified by each stage were calculated by log-rank test as an estimation of prognostic relevance. RESULTS Blood loss and postoperative hospital stay of LTG were significantly less than that of OTG. Postoperative complications were equivalent between the 2 groups and no patient died within 1 month post-LTG. Only 1 patient had recurrence and died for carcinomatosa peritonitis 50 months after LTG (median follow-up period: 44 mo). CONCLUSIONS Our experience revealed that LTG with intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil system could be performed safely and with acceptable oncological outcome for patients with gastric cancer.

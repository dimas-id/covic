Abstract As the world struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers are on the front lines. Although hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons are not at the center of the epidemic and it may seem our role is limited, there are and will be many opportunities to contribute. During international crises such as these, the less fortunate are the most significantly affected. We highlight the value of humanitarian medical work, contributions of the hip and knee arthroplasty community to date, and future needs following the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. We polled members of medical mission group lead by arthroplasty surgeons to understand their efforts and benefits they have received doing humanitarian work. Google Search and PubMed were used to find articles relevant to the current environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to understand how the arthroplasty community can contribute, based on historical lessons from prior pandemics and recessions, current needs and projections of the COVID-19 impact. We conclude that there will be a great need for humanitarian work, and as in the current time, the immediate need globally may not be in our subspecialty.

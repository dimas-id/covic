The Pastoral Care profession in public hospitals in the United States has been largely populated and led by Protestant Christians. Buddhist practitioners have entered the field creating opportunities for Christian-Buddhist dialogue. Transgender US citizens are especially vulnerable to medical, social, and spiritual neglect in health care settings due to policy changes in the Department of Health and Human Services. Christians are also vulnerable to the manipulation of basic Christian principles by Trump and Pence. Buddhist-Christian dialogue can strengthen compassionate care and promote public practical theology for transgender hospital patients.

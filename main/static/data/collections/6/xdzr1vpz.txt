Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a form of atypical pneumonia that apparently originated in Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China in late 2002. This first came to the world's attention in late February 2003, and has since spread worldwide. As of June 23rd 2003, the disease had been reported from 32 countries or regions globally, affecting 8459 people; 805 individuals (9.5 % of the total affected) have died of the disease. A novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS- CoV) has been found in various specimens taken from patients with SARS. Although there has been rapid development of tests to detect SARS Co-V, these tests presently have certain limitations. Definitions of suspected, confirmed and probable cases have been formulated. Measures currently used for the management of patients with SARS include isolation, ribavirin, corticosteroid therapy and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, almost 10 % of affected patients succumb to their illness, underlying the need for developing more effective therapy. It remains to be seen how long it will take to bring this epidemic under control.

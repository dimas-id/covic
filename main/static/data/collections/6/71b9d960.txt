INTRODUCTION Total gastrectomy (TG) is commonly performed for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer. However, reconstruction of the esophagojejunal (EJ) anastomosis can be technically demanding, with reported anastomotic leak rates in the Western world still approaching 10-15%. We report our experience using the transoral anvil delivery system (OrVil™) for creation of the EJ anastomosis after TG. METHODS From 2007 to 2011, 48 consecutive patients with gastric cancer underwent open (n=31) or laparoscopic (n=17) TG. EJ reconstruction was performed with the transoral anvil deliver system (OrVil™) in an end-to-side fashion. Demographic, clinic, and perioperative data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS Of the 48 patients, 83% were male. Median age at resection was 64 years. Median body mass index was 27.1 kg/m2. Seventy-nine percent (n=38) of patients had at least one comorbidity. Fifteen patients (31%) had at least one perioperative complication. There was one perioperative death (2%) following a duodenal stump leak. There were four EJ leaks (8%) and two EJ stenoses (independent of leak; 4%). There was one EJ leak (6%) and one EJ stenosis (6%) following a case that was first attempted laparoscopically. There were no deaths as a consequence of an EJ leak. CONCLUSIONS The use of the transoral anvil delivery system during EJ reconstruction is a safe and effective option for reconstruction after open or laparoscopic TG with acceptable mortality and morbidity. The anastomotic leak rate appears to be comparable to that of other techniques.

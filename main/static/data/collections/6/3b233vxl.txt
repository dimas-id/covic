Due to proven risks of hospital-acquired transmission and contamination of healthcare personnel, the COVID-19 outbreak significantly disrupts lung function and exercise testing facilities. This document reports proposals made by the "Respiratory Function" and "Alv√©ole" working groups of the French language respiratory society with regard to the completion of lung function testing at rest, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the 6-minute walking test, in the current period of activity resumption following the lifting of the strict lockdown in force from March 17 to May 11, 2020.

The loci of cDNA sequences for valid diagnosis have been identified through the selection of the genome of SARS coronaries. The gene chips for diagnosing such virus have been developed, based on our own-developed technology for manufacturing and application of gene chips. The diagnoses given by such gene chips were consistent well with the reports of clinical laboratories (94.29%) and the sensitivity reached 10(-2)/ml virus molecules. This method is well suited for the clinical use in SARS coronaries diagnosis.

A number of viral diseases have emerged and re-emerged in India and globally, in the last few years. Effective prevention and control of these diseases require, in addition to a functioning disease surveillance system, interventions both before and after disease occurrence, and a combination of personal and population services. However, the current efforts to control emerging viral diseases in India has major therapeutic focus (and attention on diagnostic and curative services) and there is limited attention on preventive and promotive components. It is proposed that for an effective and successful control, a systematic approach is adopted with an appropriate selection of personal and population health services, delivered by government through participation of private sector. This is possible through commitment and leadership of Government and other public health agencies, supplemented by multi agency coordination, sufficient funding and an accountability mechanism.

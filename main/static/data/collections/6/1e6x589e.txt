Erythrocytes from twelve mammalian and avian sources in ten different buffers at three incubation temperatures could not be hemagglutinated with murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strains 3, A59, or S grown on DBT cells. Viral antigen preparation in the absence of fetal calf serum, partial virus purification, or various concentrations of red blood cells still failed to yield detectable hemagglutinating activity. Thus, the newly described MHV-DVIM remains the only hemagglutinating strain of murine coronavirus.

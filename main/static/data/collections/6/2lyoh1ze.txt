Proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are properly folded with the assistance of ER chaperones. Accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER triggers an adaptive ER stress (ERS) response termed the unfolded protein response. Recent interest has focused on the possibility that the accumulation of misfolded proteins can also contribute to reproductive response, including preimplantation embryos, testicular germ cell, placenta, and unexplained intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The major ERS pathway constituents are present at all stages of preimplantation development and that the activation of ERS pathways can be induced at the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stage. This review mainly introduced the research progress of ERS induced apoptosis of reproductive cells, providing a new direction for the research of reproductive disease therapy.

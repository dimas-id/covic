In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were utilized to identify tissues infected in ovo with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Chicken embryos were inoculated in ovo (chorioallantoic sac) with the Arkansas (Ark) serotype of IBV at 18 days of age. At 24, 48, 72, and 120 hr postinfection (HPI), bursa, lung, spleen, heart, and thymus were collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and paraffin embedded. The digoxigenin-labeled antisense S1 riboprobe detected viral mRNA in the cytoplasm of respiratory epithelial cells in the primary bronchus at 24, 48, and 72 HPI. Viral mRNA was detected in bursa samples collected at 48 hr. Immunohistochemistry detected viral antigens in epithelial cells of the parabronchi and bursal tissues at 24 and 48 hr, respectively. No viral mRNA or antigen was detected by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, respectively, in heart, thymus, or spleen at any time after inoculation. On the basis of these data, IBV apparently initially infects lung tissue, then migrates to and infects cells of the bursa. These results indicate that in situ hybridization can be useful in detection of IBV-infected chickens and in understanding the pathogenesis and virulence of IBV infection.

Adenoviral vectors are promising vectors for somatic gene therapy in a number of inherited and acquired disorders. In this contribution, the current scientific knowledge as it relates to production and function of adenoviral vectors is summarized. The different types of adenoviral vectors are described and their respective advantages and disadvantages are delineated. Current problems with adenoviral vectors, and implications as they derive from the fatality observed in the Philadelphia gene therapy trial are discussed.

Respiratory viruses are common in children, including pediatric recipients of both solid organ transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The prevalence and risk factors in each of these groups are reviewed. Furthermore, associated morbidity and mortality in pediatric transplant recipients with respiratory viral infections are addressed. The literature on specific prevention and treatment options for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza, and other respiratory viruses in pediatric solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients is reported.

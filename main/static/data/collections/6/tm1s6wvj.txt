Pneumonia is very common and continues to exact a high burden on health. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 found lower respiratory infections (LRIs) were the leading infectious cause of death and the fifth leading cause of death overall. Pneumococcal pneumonia caused 55% of LRI deaths in all ages (1.5 million deaths). Novel pathogens, particularly viruses, continue to emerge as causes of pneumonia. The rise of drug-resistance among common respiratory pathogens is a further challenge. Pneumonia is commonly classified according to patient location at the time of infection, leading to the categories of community-acquired, hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired pneumonia.

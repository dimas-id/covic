Of 20 adults with acute community-acquired sinusitis (ACAS), rhinovirus was detected in specimens from 10 (50%) patients, including maxillary aspirates from 8 (40%) patients and nasal swabs from 9 (45%) patients, by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Human coronavirus was detected by RT-PCR in nasal swabs from 3 of 20 patients but in no sinus secretions. These findings suggest that rhinovirus is an important cause of ACAS and that viral invasion of the sinus cavity itself may be a common event during the disease.

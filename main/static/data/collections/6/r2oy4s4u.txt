The paper introduces a new randomized sampling-based method of motion planning suitable for the problem of narrow passages. The proposed method was inspired by the method of exit points for cavities in protein models and is based on the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT). Unlike other methods, it can also provide locations of the exact positions of narrow passages. This information is extremely important as it helps to solve this part of space in more detail and even to decide whether a path through this bottleneck exists or not. For data with narrow passages, the proposed method finds more paths in a shorter time, for data without narrow passages, the proposed method is slower but still provides correct paths.

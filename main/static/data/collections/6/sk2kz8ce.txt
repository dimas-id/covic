The chapter will begin with an overview of pathological-clinical correlates in pneumonia, and of the principles of diagnosis and treatment that can be broadly applied to all pneumonias. Thereafter, community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia will be considered separately, considering aspects of management specifically relevant to each. The chapter will end by discussing preventive strategies, and with a brief outline of future challenges for the management of pneumonia.

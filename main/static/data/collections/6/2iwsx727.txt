Acute lung injury is characterized by intense neutrophilic lung inflammation and increased alveolar-capillary barrier permeability leading to severe hypoxemia, and is associated with high mortality despite improvements in supportive care. There is an urgent need for effective therapies for acute lung injury. Zhang and colleagues tested the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells in acute lung injury in mice. When adipose-derived stem cells were delivered to mice that had been challenged with lipopolysaccharide, they potently limited acute lung inflammation and injury in the mice, indicating that adipose-derived stem cells have therapeutic potential in acute lung injury in humans. Herein, we discuss the advantages and potential limitations of using adipose-derived stem cells as therapeutics for human acute lung injury.

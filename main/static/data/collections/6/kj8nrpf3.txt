The literature consistently shows that medical-surgical nurses frequently lack the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to render holistic nursing care to patients with severe mental illness (SMI). The negative perceptions often portrayed by medical-surgical nurses towards SMI patients with comorbid medical-surgical disorders must be addressed in order to ameliorate treatment gaps. Current concepts, issues, and challenges associated with the perceptions of nurses who care for patients with (SMI) in medical-surgical settings can prove overwhelming to both nurses and patients, and can result in concerning practice gaps. In accordance with a contemporary model of patient-centered care, it is imperative that medical-surgical nurses acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to work with this high-risk population. Cultivating an environment that promotes apposite attitudes along with effective training programs for medical-surgical nurses, may shift negative perceptions and ultimately meet best practice standards and improve outcomes for patients with SMI.

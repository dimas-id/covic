The basic principle of graph rewriting is the stepwise replacement of subgraphs inside a host graph. A challenge in such replacement steps is the treatment of the patch graph, consisting of those edges of the host graph that touch the subgraph, but are not part of it. We introduce patch graph rewriting, a visual graph rewriting language with precise formal semantics. The language has rich expressive power in two ways. First, rewrite rules can flexibly constrain the permitted shapes of patches touching matching subgraphs. Second, rules can freely transform patches. We highlight the frameworkâ€™s distinguishing features by comparing it against existing approaches.

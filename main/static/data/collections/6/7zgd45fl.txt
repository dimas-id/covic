Current platforms for molecular analysis of DNA markers are either limited in multiplexing (qPCR, isothermal amplification), turnaround time (microarrays, NGS), quantitation accuracy (isothermal amplification, microarray, nanopore sequencing), or specificity against single-nucleotide differences (microarrays, nanopore sequencing). Here, we present the Donut PCR platform that features high multiplexing, rapid turnaround times, single nucleotide discrimination, and precise quantitation of DNA targets in a portable, affordable, and battery-powered instrument using closed consumables that minimize contamination. We built a bread-board instrument prototype and three assays/chips to demonstrate the capabilities of Donut PCR: (1) a 9-plex mammal identification panel, (2) a 15-plex bacterial identification panel, and (3) a 30-plex human SNP genotyping assay. The limit of detection of the platform is under 10 genomic copies in under 30 minutes, and the quantitative dynamic range is at least 4 logs. We envision that this platform would be useful for a variety of applications where rapid and highly multiplexed nucleic acid detection is needed at the point of care.

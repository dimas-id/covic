We were interested to read the review paper on COVID‐19 by Ludvigsson in Acta Paediatrica (1). The author mentioned that COVID‐19 appeared to be milder in children than in adults but said there was a knowledge gap about antiviral treatment in severely ill patients. We would like to provide some comments about the experimental drugs that are being considered to treat children with the disease.

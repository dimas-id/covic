The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of serological total antibody tests combined with RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a retrospective study in which 375 patients were enrolled during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 from 25th January to 16th March 2020. Patients were divided into a COVID-19 group (n = 141) and a control group (n = 234). Serum samples and throat swabs were collected from 375 patients for total antibody testing against SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. The results indicated that diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 95.7% and 98.7%, 92.2% and 100% by total antibody tests and RT-PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of total antibody tests combined with RT-PCR were 98.6% and 98.7%. The sensitivity of the combined method was significantly higher than RT-PCR (X(2) = 5.16, P < 0.05), and similar to that of total antibody tests (X(2) = 1.15, P > 0.05). This study supported the advantage of the combined method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, as a useful tool for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of suspected patients, epidemiological investigation, as well as monitoring ongoing outbreaks of infections with SARS-CoV-2.

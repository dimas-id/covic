A patient (in their late 20s) was admitted with a right frontal stroke, left hemiparesis and hemianopsia, and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 11. CT perfusion imaging revealed an ischemic penumbra. A CT angiogram showed a Spetzler-Martin grade V arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right frontal lobe and a second, smaller AVM in the medial occipital region. Successful mechanical thrombectomy for middle cerebral artery thrombi improved flow from a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 0 to 2b. Following endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, the NIHSS dramatically improved from 11 to 2 and the patient was discharged home in 7 days. Evaluation 1 month after treatment disclosed a nearly complete recovery, with mild residual arm weakness (NIHSS 1). This case illustrates acute stroke intervention in the setting of an ipsilateral, large, high flow AVM in a young adult and is the first such reported case to our knowledge.

The paper highlights a lifetime experience of knowledge gained through interactions with Professor Hung T. Nguyen and the profound impact he has made in advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling, simulating, and understanding the dynamics of uncertain systems. His seminal works on Random Fuzzy Sets have (a) significantly impacted our perceptions of seeking methods and approaches to acquire and assimilate data or information from uncertain sources, (b) enhanced our understanding to develop strategies for deep learning the interconnections, implications, and consequences, thereby allowing the processing of data to its logical conclusions and (c) has infinitely broadened the horizon towards conceiving machine-based decision-making architectures that optimize our perceived understanding to build systems that can mimic human decision-making capabilities. These three universal attributes fit the breadth and scope of Soft Computing. The paper focuses on three distinct topics wherein we explore human perceptions that merge the conscious attributes combining facts, myths, traditions, culture, beliefs, and a sense of reasoning towards a higher level of consciousness, and provides avenues for their adoption and physical realizations. The first topic discusses the possibilities of harvesting vast amounts of hydrokinetic energy from low-head flows in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The Mekong River has a perceived power potential of between 50 and 70 Gigawatts (GW). The reality is only one-quarter of the perceived power is plausible for harvesting. We discuss the possibility of transforming existing concrete structures across the arteries and tributaries of the Mekong River in the Delta Region to mini-hydropower plants. One example shows the possibilities of harvesting up to 250 KW at an existing structure that can serve the energy needs of local businesses involved in aquaculture, local commerce, and residential needs. Since recognizing conventional hydropower is ecologically damaging, Vietnam has focused its energy policy solely on Solar and Wind, which are 3–4 times higher in cost than Water. Low-head energy, which is currently unused, could be perceived as a significant contributor to the renewable energy portfolio for Vietnam. The second topic discusses the possibility for Ayurvedic medicine, an ancient Indian practice of herbal medicine, as a complementary form of medication compared to modern medicine. The Tulsi plant is recognized for its life-saving properties that make Hindus believe it is a Holy plant. Scientific observations have shown the plant can produce substantial amounts of pure Oxygen by absorbing carbon dioxide from the ambient. Research has also shown that Tulsi can absorb fluorides from water. The discussions highlight the adoption of Ayurvedic medicine based on historical and traditional beliefs that Nature grown ingredients can induce natural body responses that aid in recovery from illnesses. Ayurvedic medicine exploits the power of the mind based on beliefs and traditions as a means for healing from illnesses. Finally, the third topic is a search for the meaning to the phrase “Pointing the finger at the Moon,” and leading to the discovery of a three-dimensional holographic image on the Moon. The discovery sheds light on a long-standing question of what The Buddha was pointing to on the Moon. Historical background based on art is combined with basic Moon facts and a sense of geometry to uncover a three-dimensional holographic image that symbolizes Gautama Buddha’s path to enlightenment. The form is identified as Abhaya Mudra, the Fearless Form. Among the many forms displayed in Buddhist sculptures of the meditation posture, the Abhaya Mudra is significant as it is a gesture for tolerance, fearlessness, and compassion. In Buddhist philosophy, the attributes of intolerance, fearfulness, and hatred are erased from the human mind through detachment.

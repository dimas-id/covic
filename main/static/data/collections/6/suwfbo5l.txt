BACKGROUND Carotid artery stenting (CAS) requires follow-up imaging to assess in-stent restenosis (ISR). This study aimed to determine whether non-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (NE-MRA) is useful for evaluating ISR. METHOD Between 2009 and 2013, we performed 118 consecutive CAS procedures using the Precise stent (n = 78) and the Carotid Wallstent (n = 40). We reviewed 1.5 T NE-MRA and examined visualization of the stent lumen and the degree of ISR if present. Other imaging modalities were used as references. RESULTS NE-MRA performed just after CAS was not able to visualize the stent lumen in all patients because of metal artifacts. In the Carotid Wallstent group, follow-up NE-MRA was available in 22 patients. The stent lumen was visible more than three months after CAS in all patients. Among them, >40 % ISR was observed by other modalities in eight lesions. The degree of restenosis measured by NE-MRA (y%) had a linear relationship with that measured by conventional angiography (x%) (y = 0.97x-0.4, r = 0.79, P = 0.021). In one case among 17 without ISR (6 %), NE-MRA showed false ISR. In the Precise stent group, NE-MRA did not visualize the stent lumen in the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS NE-MRA can visualize the stent lumen in the Carotid Wallstent more than three months after CAS, but not in the Precise stent at follow-up. This delayed visualization might depend on endothelialization of the stent lumen. The degree of ISR measured by NE-MRA is comparable to that by conventional angiography. NE-MRA can evaluate ISR after CAS with the Carotid Wallstent (100 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity).

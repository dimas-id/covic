Distal radius fractures (DRF) are a common injury, especially in the elderly.Displaced fractures can be reduced by closed reduction through several techniques, two of which are compared in this systematic review and meta-analysis.Closed reduction by finger-trap traction (FTT) seems to offer better correction of radial shortening. Additionally, there may be less pain and fewer complications associated with this technique.Closed reduction by manual traction seems to offer better correction of the dorsal tilt.Further research is needed to fully determine the optimal method of closed reduction.

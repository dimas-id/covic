Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by an acute event, typically with encephalopathy, in which diffuse CNS involvement occurs. It may follow an infectious event and occurs more commonly in young children. Pulse steroid treatment is frequently used to treat ADEM. Although ADEM is typically described as a benign condition, with children generally recovering motor function and resolution of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), residual cognitive deficits may occur. This chapter aims to review the clinical features, typical presentation, differential diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of ADEM.

INTRODUCTION Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Turkish Republic, had guarded many German scientists of a Jewish descent before the Second World War. Dr. Rudolf Nissen was one of the outstanding surgeons who had served in the Turkish university hospitals. He had created an antireflux procedure which is named after his own name while he was working in our clinic, the Cerrahpaşa Hospital. From a laparoscopic approach, the Nissen fundoplication was the gold standard intervention for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Currently, video laparoscopic surgery is evolving quickly with the guidance of new technology. Single-port (SP) laparoscopic transumbilical surgery is one of the newest branches of advanced laparoscopy. DISCUSSION Simple or complex manipulations may be performed with SP laparoscopic transumbilical surgery. The advantages, which are gained from conventional laparoscopy, can be invigorated by an SP laparoscopic approach. The retraction technique of the liver and the optical system were the most important factors, which made the Nissen fundoplication possible via single port. Here, we report that totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP Nissen fundoplication procedure was performed in three patients for sliding hiatal hernia with GERD. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP Nissen fundoplication is a safe and feasible technique for the surgical treatment of GERD.

INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to present a preliminary series of six children affected by an anterior mediastinal mass, resulting in a thymoma. We treated this pediatric population by a video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study from January 2000 to January 2012 of all children affected by an anterior mediastinal mass, resulting in a thymoma. Data included sex, age at surgery, clinical and radiological features, surgical procedure, follow-up, and complications. RESULTS Video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy was performed in six children (five boys and one girl). Four patients presented with dyspnea and/or thoracic pain treated with analgesic and corticosteroid therapy without any benefits. Two patients were asymptomatic. Preoperatively, exams included radiological imaging, blood, and immunological test. All 6 patients were treated with a thoracoscopic approach; of these patients, 5 were treated with a thoracoscopic right-side thymectomy and 1 with a left-side approach. Patients were treated by a three-trocar technique, and thymectomy was performed using Valleylab (now Covidien) (Boulder, CO) LigaSureâ„¢. The mean operative time was 120 minutes. The mean hospital stay was 5 days. In all cases histological findings revealed no malignancy. The mean follow-up was 38 months. DISCUSSION Thoracoscopic thymectomy facilitated the goal of early thymectomy. The right-side approach is preferred because it gains a good visualization of the venous anatomy for dissection. The left side allows a good extended resection of both the thymus and perithymic fat. Thoracoscopic thymectomy should be consider a valid, less invasive alternative to the most radical open approach.

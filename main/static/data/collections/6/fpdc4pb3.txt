System safety analysis is a creative process that can often be undertaken by people who are not experts in the system under analysis whilst also learning the analysis methodology. With the increase of system complexity, the high demand for analyses conducted at a scale and the potentially catastrophic consequences of inadequate analysis, there is an urgent need for supporting the development of system analysis skills. Technological solutions can effectively scaffold this ill-defined domain. We propose a generic framework for Contingent Scaffolding capable of providing flexible learning support while conducting system safety analysis. This has been implemented into an intelligent agent, Oswin, which offers Ontology-driven scaffolding with interactive nudges.

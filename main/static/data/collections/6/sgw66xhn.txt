Sequence comparison is an essential part of modern molecular biology research. In this study, we estimated the parameters of Markov chain by considering the frequencies of occurrence of the all possible amino acid pairs from each alignment-free protein sequence. These estimated Markov chain parameters were used to calculate similarity between two protein sequences based on a fuzzy integral algorithm. For validation, our result was compared with both alignment-based (ClustalW) and alignment-free methods on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that our developed algorithm has a better clustering performance for protein sequence comparison.

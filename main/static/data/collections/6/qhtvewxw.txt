The epidemic of novel coronavirus diseases was first reported in China in late December 2019 and has been brought under control after some two months in China. However, it has become a global pandemic and the number of cases and deaths continues to increase outside of China. We describe the emergence of the pandemic, detail the first 100 days of Chinaâ€™s response as a Phase 1 Containment followed by Phase 2 Containment strategy, and briefly highlight areas of focus for the future. Specific, simple, and pragmatic strategies used in China for risk assessment, prioritization, and deployment of resources are described. Details of implementation, at different risk levels, of the traditional public health interventions are shared. Involvement of society in mounting a whole country response and challenges experienced with logistics and supply chains are described. Finally, the methods China is employing to cautiously re-start social life and economic activity are outlined.

With the increased reliance on the Pipeline embolization device (PED) for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms, our experience in managing intraoperative complications and challenges continues to accumulate amid a scarcity of reports on rescue strategies and innovative techniques. We describe the case of a 50-year-old woman who presented for elective repeat embolization of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm with some residual aneurysmal filling. During the procedure the patient developed severe vasospasm due to vessel irritation and this led us to proceed to deploy the PED through a biaxial construct composed of the 6 French Envoy MPD DA XB, and the Marksman catheters. The biaxial construct in select patients may provide the required stability while eliminating the need for an intermediate catheter, minimizing embolic risk, and allowing for less irritation to the vessel. Larger studies are required for further validation.

Abstract Graphical representation and numerical characterization (GRANCH) of nucleotide and protein sequences is a new field that is showing a lot of promise in analysis of such sequences. While formulation and applications of GRANCH techniques for DNA/RNA sequences started just over a decade ago, analyses of protein sequences by these techniques are of more recent origin. The emphasis is still on developing the underlying technique, but significant results have been achieved in using these methods for protein phylogeny, mass spectral data of proteins and protein serum profiles in parasites, toxicoproteomics, determination of different indices for use in QSAR studies, among others. We briefly mention these in this chapter, with some details on protein phylogeny and viral diseases. In particular, we cover a systematic method developed in GRANCH to determine conserved surface exposed peptide segments in selected viral proteins that can be used for drug and vaccine targeting. The new GRANCH techniques and applications for DNAs and proteins are covered briefly to provide an overview to this nascent field.

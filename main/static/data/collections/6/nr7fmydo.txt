Abstract Iraq is one of seven Arabic countries (Lebanon, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) that acquired novel coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) via people who have visited Iran recently. Iraqi outdated public healthcare settings are already overwhelmed with many acute injuries from ongoing unrest. Iraq faces six challenges in controlling COVID-19 [1]: A shortage in number of quarantine facilities [2], the availability of the testing which is limited to one governmental lab only in Baghdad [3], a shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE) and ambulances [4], a low level of public awareness [5], a shortage in hygiene preparations and [6] a high rate of antibiotic resistance in case of secondary bacterial infection. Thus, Iraq alone cannot control such a rapidly emerging outbreak and needs help from the international community and the World Health Organization (WHO) to prepare additional medical labs, establish high standard quarantine facilities and provide medical equipment for healthcare professionals. On its side, Iraq needs to impose more restrictions on travel from countries with a COVID-19 outbreak as other countries have done.

When performing laparoscopic gastrectomy, suturing the intestinal anastomosis presents one of the greatest challenges. The V-Loc unidirectional barbed suture has been introduced to eliminate the need to tie knots during closure. This device offers a fast, secure, and effective alternative to conventional suture repair during laparoscopic surgery. However, there have been reported cases of surgical complications associated with the use of barbed suture devices. We describe here a case of small bowel obstruction resulting from improper use of barbed suture during total laparoscopic distal gastrectomy performed for gastric cancer. Following diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, the patient underwent immediate laparoscopic repair that identified the cause and relieved the small bowel obstruction. This case highlights the need for surgeons to carefully perform proper suturing technique in order to prevent complications. Surgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion for diagnosing and treating potentially severe complications when using barbed sutures.

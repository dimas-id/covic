BACKGROUND Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique that allows continuous monitoring of the regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) index. We evaluated its application to survey perioperative lower limb perfusion. METHODS A total of 10 patients (7 men, aged 71) were monitored during abdominal surgery for aortic aneurysms. The rSO(2) index was measured at the M gastrocnemius (optode 1) and at the dorsum of the foot (optode 2). RESULTS Mean baseline rSO(2) values for optodes 1 and 2 were 67 and 66, respectively. After clamping the aorta or iliacofemoral arteries, rSO(2) dropped to 32 for optode 1 (P<.0001) and to 27 for optode 2 (P<.0001). After declamping, rSO(2) increased to 74 for optode 1 (P=.0012 vs baseline) and also to 74 for optode 2 (P=.0018 vs baseline). CONCLUSION Near-infrared spectroscopy is an easily applicable, noninvasive tool for continuous surveillance of lower extremity perfusion during aortic reconstruction.

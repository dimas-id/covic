In response to increased workforce demand on inpatient medicine floors during the COVID-19 pandemic, trainees have been redeployed to practice medicine outside of their current subspecialty.

We created Medicine Basecamp, a 10-week online internal medicine curriculum, to address the knowledge-gap anxieties of redeployed trainees.

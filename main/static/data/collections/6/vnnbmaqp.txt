With the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, Beijing You&apos;an Hospital has become one of the three infectious disease specialist hospitals designated to treat patients of such pneumonia. Under the premise of comprehensively implementing various emergency treatment tasks and ensuring the normal operation of other wards, the Nursing Department has put in place emergency plans and deployed due manpower for rapid response, timely personnel deployment, and reasonable reserve echelon structure. These measures have been taken as required by the patientsâ€™ numbers, critical conditions, disease diagnosis, and the guidelines of treatment and protection. While ensuring the completion of treatment work, we manage to leverage nursing human resources in a scientific, standardized and maximized efficiency manner, to ensure the quality of nursing, and the physical and mental health of nursing staff.

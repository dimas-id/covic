The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, poses serious threats to public health and social stability, calling for urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to SARS-CoV, thus it is important to define the between antigenic cross-reactivity and neutralization. In this study, we firstly analyzed 20 convalescent serum samples collected from SARS-CoV infected individuals during the 2003 SARS outbreak. All patient sera reacted strongly with the S1 subunit and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, cross-reacted with the S ectodomain, S1, RBD, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven infections. Multiple panels of antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with a full-length S and RBD immunogens of SARS-CoV were also characterized, verifying the cross-reactive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that a palm civet SARS-CoV-derived RBD elicited more potent cross-neutralizing responses in immunized animals than the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, informing a strategy to develop a universe vaccine against emerging CoVs. Summary Serum antibodies from SARS-CoV infected patients and immunized animals cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 suggests strategies for universe vaccines against emerging CoVs.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have focused on repurposing of existing antibiotics, antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs to find an effective therapy. Fluoroquinolones are broad spectrum synthetic antimicrobial agents, being chemical derivatives of quinoline, the prodrome of chloroquine. Interestingly, fluoroquinolones may exert antiviral actions against vaccinia virus, papovavirus, CMV, VZV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCV and HIV. A recent in silico study has shown that the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by exhibiting stronger capacity for binding to its main protease than chloroquine and nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor antiretroviral drug. Remarkably, fluoroquinolones have shown multiple immunomodulatory actions leading to an attenuation of the inflammatory response through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Noteworthy, respiratory fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, constitute fist line therapeutic agents for the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia. They are characterized by advantageous pharmacokinetic properties; higher concentrations in the lungs; and an excellent safety profile comparable to other antibiotics used to treat respiratory infections, such as macrolides and b-lactams. Based on their potential antiviral activity and immunomodulatory properties, the favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile, we propose the use of respiratory fluoroquinolones as adjuncts in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia.

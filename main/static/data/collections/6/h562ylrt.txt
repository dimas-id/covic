We investigated bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as an etiological agent in cattle with clinical respiratory and digestive signs using 147 feces and 199 nasal swab samples. A total of 18 test samples (16 feces and 2 nasal swap samples) were detected positive by ELISA and/or RT‐PCR targeting the BCoV N gene. The partial S1 gene regions of BCoVs (An‐4 and An‐11) detected in feces samples from two herd‐mate dairy calves were compared. Virological and serological results indicated that BCoVs are widespread in Turkey and are likely etiological agents in diarrhea cases in calves.

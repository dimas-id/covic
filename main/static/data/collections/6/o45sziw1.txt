Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has become a global pandemic. Therefore, convenient, timely and accurate detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 is urgently needed. Here, we review the types, characteristics and shortcomings of various detection methods, as well as perspectives for the SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis. Clinically, nucleic acid‐based methods are sensitive but prone to false‐positive. The antibody‐based method has slightly lower sensitivity but higher accuracy. Therefore, it is suggested to combine the two methods to improve the detection accuracy of COVID‐19.

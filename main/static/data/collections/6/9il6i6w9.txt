PURPOSE To assess the feasibility of fusion of pre- and post-ablation gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI) to evaluate the effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared with similarly fused CT images PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 67 patients with 92 HCCs treated with RFA. Fusion images of pre- and post-RFA dynamic CT, and pre- and post-RFA Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI were created, using a rigid registration method. The minimal ablative margin measured on fusion imaging was categorized into three groups: (1) tumor protruding outside the ablation zone boundary, (2) ablative margin 0-<5.0 mm beyond the tumor boundary, and (3) ablative margin ≥5.0 mm beyond the tumor boundary. The categorization of minimal ablative margins was compared between CT and MR fusion images. RESULTS In 57 (62.0%) HCCs, treatment evaluation was possible both on CT and MR fusion images, and the overall agreement between them for the categorization of minimal ablative margin was good (κ coefficient = 0.676, P < 0.01). MR fusion imaging enabled treatment evaluation in a significantly larger number of HCCs than CT fusion imaging (86/92 [93.5%] vs. 62/92 [67.4%], P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Fusion of pre- and post-ablation Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI is feasible for treatment evaluation after RFA. It may enable accurate treatment evaluation in cases where CT fusion imaging is not helpful.

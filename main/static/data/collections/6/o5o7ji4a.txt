Echinococcal cyst of the spleen is usually a result of infection with the parasite Echinococcus granulosus. The spleen is the third most frequent localization of echinococcus after liver and lungs. Partial laparoscopic pericystectomy can be done without the loss of blood and scattering of scolexes with spleen preservation and conservation of its immune function. We present the patient with a large (1 8 x 16 x 12 cm) echinococcal cyst of the spleen that compressed the surrounding organs (stomach, transverse colon, pancreas and left kidney), and prevented normal passage causing vomiting after every meal. In this patient, PAIR procedure (puncture, aspiration, injection, reaspiration) and conservative treatment was attempted on several occasions without success. Finally, laparoscopic partial pericystectomy was performed, evacuating the contents of the cyst. The surgery lasted 120 minutes. Postoperatively the patient was without complications. Hospitalization lasted five days. Six months later, the patient is without problems. These echinococcus cysts of the spleen cannot be solved using PAIR technique and conservative treatment. Laparoscopic partial pericystectomy is a better solution than open surgery due to less trauma to the patient, especially in elderly people.

Coronavirus titers in small intestine, degree of villous atrophy and apparent rates of regeneration of intestinal villi were compared in newborn, 3-week-old and adult pigs for 1 week after they were exposed to the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine. The response within the newborn group was homogeneous, resulting in high virus titers, maximal villous atrophy and comparatively slow regeneration. In general, virus titers were lower, villous atrophy was less severe and regeneration more rapid in both older groups than in the newborn pigs. However, the response varied greatly in the older groups. The 3-week-old group was divided into two populations. The major population had low virus titers and developed partial villous atrophy, whereas the minor population had marked villous atrophy and virus titers comparable to those of the newborn pigs. These observations support the hyposthesis that the accelerated replacement of villous epithelium in the small intestine of pigs during the first 3 weeks contributes to the innate age-dependent resistance to transmissible gastroenteritis. The accelerated replacement of villous epithelial cells in older pigs contributes to resistance in two ways. The increased proliferative capacity of crypt epithelium results in a more rapid regeneration of atrophic villi; and the comparatively young villous absorptive cells resulting from accelerated replacement produce less virus per cell than the older ones of the newborn pig.

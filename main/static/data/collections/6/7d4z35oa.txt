The UK has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and London in particular has experienced a large number of cases. The London Underground is a key part of the transport for London. The UK Government has implemented social distancing rules meaning that people should be 2 metres from each other. The current paper models the impact of the social distancing on the carrying capacity of 10 different underground and overground carriages. The model determines the optimal standing and seating capacity for the different carriages and identifies logistical approaches to the seating and standing arrangements.

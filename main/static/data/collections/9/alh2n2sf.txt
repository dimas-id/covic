BACKGROUND Iodine-based contrast medium used in diagnostic and therapeutic cerebrovascular imaging may cause renal toxicity, especially in patients with underlying renal impairment. Contrast dilution may impede efforts of the neurointerventionalist to treat intracranial vascular pathology. METHODS A 36-year-old man with renal impairment presented with an unruptured A1 segment anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Previously obtained magnetic resonance angiography was fused with intraoperative noncontrast computed tomography and live 2-dimensional fluoroscopic images. The aneurysm was successfully treated with stent-assisted coil embolization without the use of contrast. RESULTS Neurointervention without contrast was feasible, and although the presented case is one example, the imaging fusion techniques used in this case can substantially decrease the exposure to contrast and subsequent risk of renal injury during intracranial procedures. CONCLUSIONS Further development of and experience with this technique is needed to improve its safety and efficacy.

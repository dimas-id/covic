Dealing with the COVID-19 coronavirus requires a coordinated transnational effort. We propose a 2-stage state-led effort that utilizes community health workers (CHWs). We spell out what is beginning to occur in states to control and suppress COVID-19. In the second stage, we suggest working with these CHWs as a key element in the next evolution of our health care system: community-centered population health.

In this article, a qualitative analysis of the mathematical model of novel corona virus named COVID-19 under nonsingular derivative of fractional order is considered. The concerned model is composed of two compartments, namely, healthy and infected. Under the new nonsingular derivative, we, first of all, establish some sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solution to the model under consideration. Because of the dynamics of the phenomenon when described by a mathematical model, its existence must be guaranteed. Therefore, via using the classical fixed point theory, we establish the required results. Also, we present the results of stability of Ulam's type by using the tools of nonlinear analysis. For the semianalytical results, we extend the usual Laplace transform coupled with Adomian decomposition method to obtain the approximate solutions for the corresponding compartments of the considered model. Finally, in order to support our study, graphical interpretations are provided to illustrate the results by using some numerical values for the corresponding parameters of the model.

The measurement of biochemical parameters such as blood glucose, blood gases, electrolytes and cardiac markers have particularly benefited from recent advances in POCT. More and more, this form of analysis is now positively impacting the field of infectious diseases. Many microbiological POCT systems tend to be designed as rapid tests. In general, such tests can be carried out in a few simple steps by medical assistants or physicians without laboratory equipment or laboratory experience. It is even possible for the patients themselves to perform a series of such tests.

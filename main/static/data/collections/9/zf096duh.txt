The sudden global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 urgently requires an in-depth understanding of molecular functions of viral proteins and their interactions with the host proteome. Several omics studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology, including some focused on proteomic aspects1â€“3. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses manipulate the host we here characterized interactome, proteome and signaling processes in a systems-wide manner. This identified connections between the corresponding cellular events, revealed functional effects of the individual viral proteins and put these findings into the context of host signaling pathways. We investigated the closely related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses as well as the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed relationships between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of SARS coronaviruses. The results highlight the functionality of individual proteins as well as vulnerability hotspots of SARS-CoV-2, which we targeted with clinically approved drugs. We exemplify this by identification of kinase inhibitors as well as MMPase inhibitors with significant antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.

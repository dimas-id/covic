Objective: To summarize the clinical and high resolution CT(HRCT) characteristics of 141 patients with COVID-19. Methods: From January 20 to 28, 2020, 141 COVID-19 patients, 77 males and 64 females, with a median age of 49 (9, 87), were enrolled in the study. The clinical features, laboratory test results and HRCT findings of all patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results: In all of the patients, the decreasing leukocyte countin 38 (26.95%) and lymphocyte ratio in 71 (50.35%), a fever over 37.5 â„ƒ in 139 (98.58%), coughing in 106 (75.18%), headache in 11 (7.80%), expectoration in 41 (29.08%), chest distress in 93 (65.96%), and diarrhea in 4 (2.84%) were found. The HRCT of all patients were abnormal, including ground glass opacity (GGO) with patchy opacity in 52 (36.88%) mainly distributed along subpleural area, GGO with focal consolidation in 23 (16.31%),small patchy opacity in 27 (19.15%),large patchy consolidation in 20 (14.18%),thickened bronchovascular bundleing and blood vessel crossing the lesion in 48 (34.04%), air bronchus sign in 5 (3.55%), small nodule in 7 (4.96%),fibrous stripes and reticular opacities in 5 (3.55%), bilateral pleural effusion in 7 (4.96%), and mediastinal or bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy in 4 (2.84%). Conclusions: The clinical and HRCT manifestations of COVID-19 are various. Under the specific epidemiological background of COVID-19, chest HRCT scan should be carried out as soon as possible for early warning of this disease.

Abstract China is severely exposed to natural hazards. Currently, there are more than 5.5 million contingency plans for handling various incidents. Similar to those produced in other counties, the paper-based plans in China are limited in that emergency responders cannot easily extract helpful information for them. In this paper, a knowledge-based system will be proposed for providing different stakeholders with helpful information in the emergency response. The conceptual model is the core for the whole system, which can link plans in the physical world and the ontology in the cyber world.

We report here that fusions of single-chain antibodies (scFvs) to the autotransporter beta domain of the IgA protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are instrumental in locating virus-neutralizing activity on the cell surface of Escherichia coli. E. coli cells displaying scFvs against the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus on their surface blocked in vivo the access of the infectious agent to cultured epithelial cells. This result raises prospects for antiviral strategies aimed at hindering the entry into target cells by bacteria that naturally colonize the same intestinal niches.

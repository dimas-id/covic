Acute inflammation and the innate immune response to severe tissue trauma continue to pose a critical pathophysiological challenge in the intensive care regimen. Advances in the development of improved gene therapeutics and their application in diverse animal models of acute inflammation have shown promising results in reducing both morbidity and mortality. The introduction of inflammatory antagonists, by either viral or non-viral vectors, has thereby proven to play a significant role in determining the overall outcome. Recent findings of utilizing the functional characteristics of immunocompetent cells (e.g. dendritic cells) in combination with the gene therapy-induced overexpression of anti-inflammatory target proteins have significantly expanded this gene therapeutic spectrum. The results from diverse experiments in our own murine model of sepsis, in connection with findings from various other analogous international studies, have demonstrated great potential to revolutionize the clinical treatment concept and prevention of acute inflammatory diseases.

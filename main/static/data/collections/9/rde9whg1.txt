OBJECTIVE To survey medical graduates from the University of Hong Kong on how well they perceived their learning needs had been fulfilled by the old (before 1997) and the new (after 1997) curricula. DESIGN Retrospective questionnaire survey. SETTING The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS Medical graduates from the University of Hong Kong who graduated between 1997 and 2006 were invited to complete a questionnaire online or in paper form; 1997-2001 graduates were trained under the old curriculum, and 2002-2006 graduates under the new curriculum. RESULTS The response rate was 23%. The survey showed that the graduates of both curricula felt that research skills, population health, and ophthalmology were not emphasised enough in the medical programme. In addition, some graduates of the old curriculum mentioned interpersonal skills, ethics and professionalism, and language skills, which were pinpointed in the curriculum reform in 1997. Some graduates of the new curriculum mentioned anatomy, microbiology, and diagnostic radiology. Graduates of both the old and the new curricula perceived the same top five areas as being lacking in their respective curricula, in relationship to their clinical career and personal growth, namely: business administration, law, professional English, life coaching, and humanities. A small percentage of graduates also took courses in these areas after graduation. CONCLUSIONS The survey showed that the curriculum reform in 1997 at the University of Hong Kong had correctly pinpointed some of the learning needs. The survey also identified educational needs in the existing curriculum that need to be dealt with in the forthcoming curriculum reform in 2012.

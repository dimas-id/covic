Abstract Monoclonal antibodies raised against a strain of Leishmania infantum isolated in Greece were produced and tested for their protective effect in an in vivo system (in BALB/C mice). A single monoclonal antibody, IgG2b isotype, can prevent the development of two Leishmania strains in vivo: one of L. major and one of L. mexicana amazonensis. This antibody-mediated protection may be dependent on complement.

The aim is to study the serum protein fingerprint of patients with laryngeal carcinoma (LC) and to screen for protein molecules closely related to LC during the onset and progression of the disease with surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). Serum samples from 68 patients with LC and 117 non-cancer control samples (75 healthy volunteers and 42 Vocal fold polyps). Q10 protein chips and PBSII-C protein chips reader (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc.) were used. The protein fingerprint expression of all the Serum samples and the resulting profiles between cancer and non-cancer groups were analyzed with Biomarker Wizard system. A group of proteomic peaks were detected. Three differently expressed potential biomarkers were identified with the relative molecular weights of 5,915, 6,440 and 9,190 Da. Among the three peaks, the one with m/z 6,440 was down-regulated, and the other two peaks with m/z 5,915 and 9,190 were up-regulated in LC. This diagnostic model could distinguish LC patients from controls with a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 91.9%. Moreover, blind test data showed a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 89.1%. The data suggested that SELDI technology could be used to screen proteins with altered expression levels in the serum of LC patients. These protein peaks were considered as specific serum biomarkers of LC and have the potential value for further investigation.

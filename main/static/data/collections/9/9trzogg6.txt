BACKGROUND Recurrent prolapse after stapled haemorrhoidopexy is a late complication of the procedure which can present with accompanying symptoms and may require surgery. We describe a technique for treating symptomatic patients, aimed at obtaining remission of symptoms and avoiding recurrences. METHODS After excisional haemorrhoidectomy, a transverse incision is performed on the proximal part of the mucocutaneous bridge, above the plane of the internal sphincter. A flap of anal mucosa is gently raised. Haemorrhoidal tissue is not removed. LigaSure™ may be useful in focussing coagulation and reducing heat diffusion. Denudation of the internal sphincter allows the removal of potential retained staples. Then, stitches are placed between the proximal part of the flap and the proximal divided edge of the rectal mucosa. Excessive devascularisation of the flap must be avoided. RESULTS From January 2007 to January 2011, we treated 11 patients. The procedures lasted a mean of 38.2 ± 11.1 min. One patient (9 %) suffered from bleeding during the night before being discharged, but this did not require surgery, and another (9 %) had urinary retention. No other perioperative complications were observed. The mean visual analogue scale score 1 day and 1 week after surgery was 4.7 ± 1.3 and 2.3 ± 0.5, respectively. At mean follow-up of 4 ± 1.8 years, neither symptomatic nor asymptomatic recurrences have been observed. Two out of three patients presenting with urgency reported regression of symptoms (66.7 %). In all patients suffering from pain after stapled haemorrhoidopexy, the procedure achieved pain relief (2/2, 100 %). No stenoses occurred. CONCLUSIONS This technique is a promising alternative after failed stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Morbidity is low. The procedure may effectively treat associated symptoms.

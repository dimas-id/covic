Abstract The goal of the study was to adapt our Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) lab-developed test (LDT) to 3 “Sample to Result” (S2R) systems: BD MAX (BD), ELITe InGenius (ELITechGroup), and ARIES (Luminex). The BD MAX and InGenius system allowed use of lab-developed primers and TaqMan probes, while ARIES required conversion to MultiCode primers for melting curve analysis. Each device required ≤1 day of training and assay optimization. No discordant results were noted after analysis of 32 External Quality Control (EQC) samples. On a 10-fold dilution series of a MERS-CoV–positive EQC sample, InGenius obtained the highest detection rate. Laboratory technicians rated the ARIES as the user-friendliest. It also required the least hands-on time. BD MAX had the lowest turnaround time and highest throughput. While each device had distinguishing system properties with associated (dis)advantages, the 3 S2R systems were comparable in terms of assay development and validation.

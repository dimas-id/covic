ABSTRACT Introduction: Due to the mandatory use of a mask, and the authorization to do outdoor sports in Catalonia, we try to assess the physiological impact of the hypercapnia hypoxia generated by the masks during aerobic sports practice. Methods: Eight subjects (2 women) were assessed at baseline with and without a mask, and then a 21-flex test was performed following the Ruffier protocol with a mask. Control of HR (heart rate), concentration of O2 and CO2 inside the mask and SatO2. The test was carried out in ambient air in squares in the city of Barcelona. Results: A decrease in O2 was recorded comparing the three conditions, baseline 20.9%, baseline mask 18.3%, post-exercise 17.8% (p <0.001). An increase in CO2 in the three preconditions (464, 14162, 17000 ppm; p <0.001). Basal saturation O2 was 97.6 ± 1.5% and post exercise 92.1 ± 4.12% (p 0.02). Conclusions: The use of masks in athletes causes hypoxic and hypercapnic breathing, being more evident in effort. The use of masks during a short exercise with an intensity around 6-8 METS, decreases O2 by 3.7% and increases the CO2 concentration by 20%.

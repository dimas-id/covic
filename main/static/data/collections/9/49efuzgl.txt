INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of osteoid osteoma with Soloist monopolar electrode using tissue impedance, rather than temperature, as an indicator of osteonecrosis. METHODS The medical records and imaging studies of 30 patients (males 18, females 12) who underwent RFA of osteoid osteoma at our institution were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 15.3 years (range 5-34 years) and the mean duration of follow up was 26.9 months (range 3-52 months). The lesions were located in the femur (n=6, 53%), tibia (n = 8, 27%), hand (n = 3, 10%), foot (n = 2, 6%) and humerus (n = 1, 3%). The procedure was performed with general anaesthesia under CT guidance. The nidus was accessed with 11-gauge bone biopsy needle and then the stylet was removed and replaced by monopolar 16.5G radiofrequency probe with a 9-mm active tip through the coaxial axis. Power delivery via the radiofrequency generator was started at 2 W and increased gradually until the end point of 450-500 Î© reached and 'Roll-Off' achieved indicating coagulation necrosis of the target lesion. RESULTS The procedure was technically successful in all patients. The mean procedure time was 72 min and the mean RFA time was 12.7 min. The clinical success rate was 93%. In one patient, the procedure was abandoned due to immature Roll-Off despite all measures. In one patient (3%), recurrence occurred 39 months after the procedure. No major complications were encountered. Two minor skin burns occurred that were resolved with conservative measures. CONCLUSION RFA of osteoid osteoma using Soloist monopolar electrode is a safe and effective treatment. Tissue impedance could be used as an alternative to temperature to indicate osteonecrosis of osteoid osteoma during RFA.

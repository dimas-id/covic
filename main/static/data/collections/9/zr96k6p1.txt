BACKGROUND: During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a link between acute cardiac injury and COVID-19 infection has been observed. There is currently no consensus on the incidence of cardiac injury, its relationship to prognosis, or its possible cause. This article provides a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the incidence, comorbidities, outcomes and possible mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies that evaluated cardiac injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Demographic information, co-morbidities, and relevant laboratory values were extracted and a meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Sixteen studies from China, Italy and the US with 2224 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The incidence of cardiac injury was 24.4% (542/2224 patients) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac injury was 72.6% (OR=17.32, 95% CI 9.21-32.57) compared to those without cardiac injury (14.5%). In subgroup analyses, factors associated with increased risk of developing cardiac injury were older age and history of hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD). CONCLUSION: Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is significantly associated with mortality. Patients who were older with HTN and COPD were prone to develop cardiac injury. Early screening, triage and cardiac monitoring are recommended for these patients.

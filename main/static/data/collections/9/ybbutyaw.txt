Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs most frequently in young animals from multicat households. Ocular manifestations of FIP are extremely common with the noneffusive form of the disease. All cats suspected of having FIP should undergo a thorough ophthalmic examination. Uveitis (inflarrunation of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid) is the primary clinical sign of ocular FIP. Treatment with anti-inflammatory medications is only supportive and aimed at disease palliation.

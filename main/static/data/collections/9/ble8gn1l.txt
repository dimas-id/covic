The infectivity of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) was optimally stable at pH 6.0 and was unaffected by ionic strength or at least 15 cycles of freezing and thawing. It was completely inactivated within 25 minutes at 56° C, but was protected by 1m magnesium chloride or magnesium sulphate. It was completely inactivated within 14 days at 37 and 22°C, but was relatively stable for as long as 72 days at 4°C and optimal pH.

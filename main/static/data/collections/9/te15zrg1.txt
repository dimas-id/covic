COVID-19 outbreak has quickly spread worldwide, causing a high pressure on the health-care system. In Italy, from March 8, 2020, all the deferrable clinical activities have been suspended to increase the health care offer for COVID-19 patients. The hospital organization has been modified also in order to assure non-COVID-19 patients assistance. The Scleroderma Unit of ASST Pini-CTO Hospital, in Milan, in the region mostly hit by SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, follows more than 600 patients affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc). Patients with SSc need a close follow-up with a regular screening of organ involvement and frequent intravenous treatments. All SSc patients have been educated about ministerial directives to limit COVID-19 spread. The organization of our Scleroderma Unit has been quickly rethought to assure SSc patients assistance in safety for them and for health-care workers during urgent visits or infusion therapies. Using electronic way of communication with frequent virtual contact and guarantying home deliveries of some therapies, we allowed a continuity of care also outside the Hospital.

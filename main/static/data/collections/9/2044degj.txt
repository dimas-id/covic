PURPOSE To compare primary placement of a self-expanding nitinol stent to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with bailout stenting in infrapopliteal arteries of patients with severe intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia (CLI). METHODS In the EXPAND trial (ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier NCT00906022), 92 patients (mean age 72.9±9.5 years; 62 men) undergoing treatment for infrapopliteal stenosis in 11 European centers were randomized 1:1 to either self-expanding nitinol stenting with the Astron Pulsar/Pulsar-18 nitinol stent or PTA with bailout stenting. The primary endpoint was sustainable clinical improvement after 12 months, defined as a ≥1-category increase for Rutherford category 3 patients or a ≥2-category increase for CLI patients (Rutherford categories 4/5) compared with baseline. Furthermore, target lesion revascularization (TLR), mortality, and amputation were assessed after 12 months. RESULTS Sustained clinical improvement at 1 year was observed in 74.3% of the patients treated with primary stenting and in 68.6% of the patients treated with PTA and bailout stenting (p>0.05). Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from TLR (76.6% and 77.6%), mortality (7.4% vs 2.1%), and amputation [8.9% (major 6.7%) vs 13.2% (major 8.7%)] at 1 year were not significantly different. CONCLUSION Primary self-expanding nitinol stenting did not show statistically different clinical outcomes compared to angioplasty with bailout stenting for infrapopliteal lesions.

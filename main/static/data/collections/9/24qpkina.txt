Two border disease virus (BDV) pairs each consisting of cytopathogenic (cp) and non-cp viruses have been analyzed at the molecular level. Within the NS2-3 (p125) encoding region of both cp viruses, insertions of cellular sequences were identified which were absent in the corresponding non-cp isolates. A comparative sequence analysis revealed that within each pair the cp and non-cp viruses are almost identical. This strongly suggests that the cp BDV isolates developed from the non-cp viruses by RNA recombination between the viral genome and cellular sequences. Nonstructural protein NS3 (p80) was demonstrated after infection with both cp BDV strains. In addition, fusion proteins composed of cellular and viral sequences were identified. In contrast, expression of NS3 and the fusion proteins was not found after infection with the respective non-cp counterparts.

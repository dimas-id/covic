Lung infections (community- or hospital-acquired) represent the most common cause for sepsis. Diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role in the initial evaluation of patients with criteria for sepsis and suspected pulmonary infection. In patients with clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory infection, the chest X-ray allows confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia. On the other hand, the chest X-ray can be useful to assess response to treatment (in some patients), define a pattern suggesting specific germs (particularly TB), identify complications (empyema and ARDS), and propose a differential diagnosis.

Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are DNA viruses and are members of the Herpesviridae family. Morphologically, CMV resembles other herpes viruses, particularly herpes simplex viruses, with important cytopathic differences. CMVs are recognized pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in compromised hosts, such as, those who undergo transplants and those on immunosuppressive drugs or steroids. This article discusses the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapy for this viral CAP.

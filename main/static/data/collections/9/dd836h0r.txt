Knowledge about the pathobiology of SARS-COV-2 as it interacts with immune defenses is limited. SARS-COV-2 is spread by droplets that come into contact with mucous membranes. COVID-19 is characterized by 3 stages: asymptomatic-paucisymptomatic incubation, nonsevere symptomatic illness for 80% of those infected, and severe respiratory illness. A syndrome characterized by hypercytokinemic inflammation referred to as a "cytokine storm" can occur in patients with advanced disease. Effective antiviral agents that can prevent viral infection in exposed individuals are needed.

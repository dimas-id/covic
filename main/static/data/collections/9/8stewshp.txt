Abstract Peracetic acid was one of the most commonly used disinfectants on solid surfaces in hospitals or public places. However, peracetic acid is an environmental toxin. Therefore, safer, alternative disinfectants or disinfectant systems should be developed. Because photodynamic virus inactivation with methylene blue (MB)/light system has proven effective in blood banking, MB was selected as a photosensitizing agent, dengue virus as a model virus for enveloped RNA viruses, and an in-house fabricated narrow bandwidth light system overlapping the absorption spectrum of MB as the light source. Dengue virus was mixed with different concentrations of MB, and illuminated by the narrow bandwidth light system under different illumination distances and times. The amount of dengue virus remaining was evaluated by plaque forming assays. Results showed that the concentration of MB working solution, illumination intensity of light source, illumination distance and time were four key factors affecting efficiency of virus inactivation using the MB/narrow bandwidth light system. Dengue virus could be completely inactivated at 2.5 m in 5 min when MB⩾1.0 μg/ml. However, when the distance reached 3.0 m, only greater concentrations of MB (2.0 μg/ml) could completely inactivate virus in a reasonably short time (20 min), and smaller concentrations of MB (1.0 μg/ml) could only completely inactivate virus using longer times (25 min). The results of this virus inactivation model indicate that our MB/narrow bandwidth light system provides a powerful, easy way to inactivate dengue viruses.

There is a worldwide effort of the research community to explore the medical, economic and sociologic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many different disciplines try to find solutions and drive strategies to a great variety of different very crucial problems. The present study presents a novel analysis which results to clustering countries with respect to active cases, active cases per population and active cases per population and per area based on Johns Hopkins epidemiological data. The presented cluster results could be useful to a variety of different policy makers, such as physicians and managers of the health sector, economy/finance experts, politicians and even to sociologists. In addition, our work suggests a new specially designed clustering algorithm adapted to the request for comparison of the various COVID time-series of different countries.

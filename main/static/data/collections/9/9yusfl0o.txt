Those of us who can come to work every day and provide emotional and spiritual support to the patients, families, staff, and to each other despite all challenges. COVID-19 has not robbed us of our ability to care. COVID-19 has not robbed us of our voices in using kind words, thoughts, sentiments, and prayers to comfort others and each other. Most importantly, COVID-19 has not broken us.

Rhinovirus (RV) is an important virus in children with chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma; however, little is known about its role in CF. Our aim was to examine the prevalence and clinical impact of different RV species in young children with CF. We collected clinical data and nasal swabs on patients at home and in the hospital setting. Parents filled out symptom diaries and collected nasal swabs when their children were symptomatic and asymptomatic. A novel RV typing PCR assay was used to determine the RV species present. We collected 55 nasal swab samples from ten preschool CF patients over a six month period. The quality of parent collected samples at home was sufficient for PCR analysis. RV was the most common virus detected in young children with CF. There was no difference in the frequency of RV species between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. However, parental home-sampling is an acceptable and feasible approach to monitoring young children with CF.

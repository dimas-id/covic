We report here a case of esophageal perforation made by an endoscope while treating cicatrical stenosis that developed after wide circumferential dissection of superficial esophageal carcinoma. Perforation closure with a conventional endoclip was difficult as the perforation was large and the surrounding tissue was fragile as a result of steroids administration for stenosis prevention. To avoid surgical intervention, we employed the over-the-scope-clip system and successfully closed the perforation. The favorable outcome suggests the utility of the over-the-scope-clip system for closing perforations when conventional methods are ineffective.

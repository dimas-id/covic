OBJECTIVE: To explore both clinical and genetic risk factors for Covid-19 in a cohort from the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 669 positive Covid-19 patients within a cohort of 502,536 UK Biobank participants, recruited between 2006 and 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. We also assessed risk factors for inpatient and outpatient status for Covid-19 positive individuals. RESULTS: We found that black participants were at over three times increased risk of testing positive for Covid-19, relative to white participants, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.28 to 4.31). Asian participants were also at higher risk of Covid-19 (ARR 2.03, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.95). Next, we analyzed the association of comorbidities with Covid-19. We found that participants were at increased risk of Covid-19 if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ARR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.31) or ischemic heart disease (ARR 1.56, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.07). However, there was no evidence that either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.84) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARR 1.37, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.98) increased the risk of Covid-19. We confirmed that blood type A was associated with Covid-19 relative to blood type O individuals, and we also found that the HLA variant DQA1_509 was enriched in Covid-19 positive cases, even after Bonferroni correction (P = 1.0 × 10(−5)). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that black and Asian participants were at increased risk of Covid-19, even after adjusting for confounders. We also identified a novel genetic association with the HLA variant DQA1_509. Further investigations of genetic associations with Covid-19 may lead to important discoveries of genetic drivers of severe disease.

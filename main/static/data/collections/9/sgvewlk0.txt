Many healthcare resources have been and continue to be allocated to the management of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, the ongoing care of patients receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin is likely to be compromised amid this unprecedented crisis. This article discusses a stepwise algorithm for the management of outpatient warfarin therapy. Alternative management strategies are presented and discussed, including alternative pharmacological therapy options and self-monitoring. Our algorithm aims to help clinicians safely optimize the treatment of patients requiring anticoagulation therapy in the context of the global response to the current pandemic.

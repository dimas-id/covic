The identification of novel cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes is important to analysis of the involvement of CD8(+) T cells in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection as well as to the development of peptide vaccines. In this study, a novel CTL epitope from region of difference 11 encoded antigen Rv3425 was identified. Epitopes were predicted by the reversal immunology approach. Rv3425‐p118 (LIASNVAGV) was identified as having relatively strong binding affinity and stability towards the HLA‐A*0201 molecule. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells pulsed by this peptide were able to release interferon‐γ in healthy donors (HLA‐A*02(+) purified protein derivative(+)). In cytotoxicity assays in vitro and in vivo, Rv3425‐p118 induced CTLs to specifically lyse the target cells. Therefore, this epitope could provide a subunit component for designing vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

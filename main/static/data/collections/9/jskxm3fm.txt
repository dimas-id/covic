BACKGROUND Total and differential white blood cell counts are important for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected diseases. To facilitate the interpretation of total and differential white blood cell counts in pediatric patients, the present study investigated age-dependent changes in total and differential white blood cell counts in healthy reference children. METHODS Data were obtained from the Pediatric Reference Intervals in China study (PRINCE), which aims to establish and verify pediatric reference intervals for Chinese children based on a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study from January 2017 to December 2018. Quantile curves were calculated using the generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale method. The 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quantile curves were calculated for both total and differential white blood counts. Percent of stacked area charts were used to demonstrate the proportions of differential white blood cells. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. RESULTS Both 50th and 97.5th quantiles of total white blood cell count and monocyte count were highest at birth, then rapidly decreased in the first 6 months of life; relatively slow reduction continued until 2 years of age. The lymphocyte count was low during infancy and increased to its highest level at 6 months of age; it then exhibited moderate and continuous reduction until approximately 9 years of age. The pattern of neutrophil count changed with age in a manner opposite to that of lymphocyte count. Besides, there were two inter-sections of lymphocyte count and neutrophil count during infancy and at approximately 5 years of age, based on locally weighted regression (LOESS) analysis. There were no apparent age-related changes in eosinophil or basophil counts. CONCLUSION These data regarding age-related changes in total and differential white blood cell counts can be used to assess the health of pediatric patients and guide clinical decisions.

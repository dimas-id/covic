Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a surprisingly novel field in mammalian transcriptome research. With the development of RNA sequencing technology and computational methods, lncRNAs have been demonstrated to have important roles in biological processes at the epigenetic, transcription and post‑transcriptional levels. In addition, the dysregulation of lncRNAs contributes to numerous diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The present review discusses the important functions of lncRNAs in respiratory diseases, highlights the mechanistic roles which underlie lncRNAs in lung cancer as well as considers the current and future potential use of lncRNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung cancer.

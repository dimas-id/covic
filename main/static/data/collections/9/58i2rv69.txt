Today, the entire world is facing incredible health and economic challenges due to the rapid spread of the life threatening novel Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19). In the prevailing situation when a vaccine is many months away, the way forward seems to be a controlled exit from the lockdown - where, infected/exposed people are strictly quarantined and recovered/unexposed people are allowed to carry on with their day to day business activities. However, appropriate physical distancing norms will have to be strictly followed for such relaxations. Therefore, mechanisms are required that will assist people in following the social and physical distancing norms in public places. In this paper, we propose an anonymity preserving blockchain based framework that allows people, through use of their smart phones and other communication devices, to protect themselves from infections as they conduct their daily business activities.

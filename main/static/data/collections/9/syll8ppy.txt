Plant proteins can be used for the production of a variety of bioproducts, including films and coatings, adhesives, fibres and pharmaceuticals. Proteins derived from plant production systems have many advantages: they are safe, low-cost and rapidly deployable, allow for simple product storage and result in proteins that are properly folded, assembled and post-translationally modified. While plant-derived protein-based products are natural, renewable, biodegradable and environmentally friendly, they tend to be lower in strength and elasticity than their corresponding synthetic products. Current research in this area is focused on overcoming challenges in plant production platforms related to yield, purification, regulatory approval and customer acceptance.

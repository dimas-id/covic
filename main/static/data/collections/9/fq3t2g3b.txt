ES-62 is a secreted protein of filarial nematodes that possesses multiple immunomodulatory activities. A full characterization of these activities awaits elucidation but to date it has been shown that ES-62 can inhibit pro-inflammatory/Th1 immune responses and in some studies, it has been found to actively support Th2 development. As an active filarial nematode infection is associated with a Th2-like immunological phenotype, this study investigated whether ES-62 was likely to be responsible for, or at least contribute to, this phenotype. Specifically, we determined ES-62's effect on the immune response to two other filarial nematode antigens, chosen for their ability to promote Th1 responses. The two antigens were recombinant Onchocerca volvulus-Fatty acid And Retinol-binding-1 (rOv-FAR-1) and recombinant Onchocerca volvulus-Activation associated Secreted Protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1). Overall the results show that in spite of its previously characterized immunomodulatory properties, ES-62 was unable to modulate/reverse the Th1 immune responses induced by the two Onchocerca antigens. Therefore, in this study no support is provided for the idea that ES-62 might be a major player in facilitating the overall immunological phenotype in filariasis and reasons for this somewhat surprising outcome are discussed.

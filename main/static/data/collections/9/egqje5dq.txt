OBJECTIVES First-line conservative treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) may be challenged by recurrence rates and complications associated with different treatment options. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a standardized surgical treatment as 'first-line' treatment. METHODS In a 10-year period, 185 patients with PSP were treated with a standardized video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) approach including wedge resection and parietal pleurectomy. Data were evaluated retrospectively. All patients with a first event of PSP were included in the study. In addition, follow-up was done by a questionnaire. RESULTS Mean follow-up period was 70.8 months (Â±33.5 months). Sub-pleural emphysematous changes were found in every histopathological specimen. In addition, 70.8% had fibrosis of visceral pleura. Recurrence occurred in 4 patients (2.2%). Ten-year freedom from recurrence was 96.2%. Procedure-related morbidity rate was 7.6%. Approximately 85.7% of patients were satisfied with the procedure and the cosmetic result. Three patients died during follow-up (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS Treatment of first episode of PSP by VATS is a safe procedure, with a very low rate of recurrence and a high patient satisfaction. This management of first episode of PSP is based on the underlying pathology. We recommend the use of VATS as the treatment of first choice for patients with PSP.

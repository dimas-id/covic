This report describes the occurrence of non‚Äêweightbearing lameness caused by Mycoplasma felis monoarthritis in two, immunocompetent, European, shorthair adult cats with a suspected history of trauma. Clinical signs recurred after conservative treatment. The joints were treated surgically and M felis was identified as the causative agent for the monoarthritis. Medication with 10 mg/kg doxycycline twice daily was initiated according to susceptibility testing. One cat underwent further joint flushing after two weeks; both the cats recovered completely after eight and nine weeks, respectively. The findings suggest that M felis, in addition to being an agent associated with conjunctivitis in cats, is able to act as a pathogen in other tissues and cause arthritis even in immunocompetent cats.

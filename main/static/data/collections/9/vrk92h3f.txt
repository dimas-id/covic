Hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide, with a multi-billion dollar global market. Implant design remains a critical challenge for the successful repair and prevention of recurrent hernias, and despite significant progress, there is no ideal mesh for every surgery. This review summarizes the evolution of prostheses design toward successful hernia repair beginning with a description of the anatomy of the disease and the classifications of hernias. Next, the major milestones in implant design are discussed. Commonly encountered complications and strategies to minimize these adverse effects are described, followed by a thorough description of the implant characteristics necessary for successful repair. Finally, available implants are categorized and their advantages and limitations elucidated, including non-absorbable and absorbable (synthetic and biologically derived) prostheses, composite prostheses, and coated prostheses. This review not only summarizes the state of the art in hernia repair, but also suggests future research directions toward improved hernia repair utilizing novel materials and fabrication methods.

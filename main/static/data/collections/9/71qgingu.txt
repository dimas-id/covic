The novel coronavirus, otherwise known as COVID‐19 has fast become a major health concern.(1 2) It has been reported that in addition to the conventional respiratory symptoms, patients also display skin manifestations such as Urticaria and angioedema.(3) Here we present a case study of an elderly man who first presented with generalised pruritic hives ranging from 1.5 to 8.0 cm in diameter on the 5(th) of March 2020. The patient was investigated for another differential diagnosis of Urticaria such as parasitic and bacterial infection, for which negative results were found. On the 5th of March 2020 the patient‐reported these symptoms plus general malaise, fatigue, 37.9⁰C temperature and sore throat. Initial biochemical tests showed that the patient presented with low numbers of white blood cells (WBC) (WBC=2.75x10(3)).

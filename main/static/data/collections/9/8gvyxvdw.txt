OBJECTIVES In this retrospective study, we aimed to compare single-port (SP) and multiport (MP) video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the surgical resection of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Between October 2013 and October 2014, a total of 411 consecutive NSCLC patients who underwent VATS lobectomy in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, were enrolled. Propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative clinical features, was used to compare the perioperative outcomes and analyse the safety and efficacy between SP and MP VATS lobectomies for NSCLCs. RESULTS There were 115 patients in the SP group, and 296 patients in the MP group from October 2013 to October 2014. Propensity matching produced 100 pairs in this retrospective study. During the operation, the lobectomy took less time in the SP than in the MP (65.7 ± 14.8 vs 81.3 ± 13.6, P < 0.001) group, while the duration of lymphadenectomy was longer in the SP group (29.6 ± 16.7 vs 17.4 ± 13.3, P < 0.001). The total operation duration, the volume of estimated blood loss (55.1 ± 9.0 ml vs 58.7 ± 7.1 ml, P = 0.22) and the length of postoperative hospital stay (4.7 ± 1.2 days vs 5.3 ± 1.4 days, P = 0.05) were similar between the two groups. Postoperatively, SP and MP groups showed similar results in terms of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS In comparison with conventional VATS, SP VATS lobectomy showed better safety and efficacy in the surgical resection of NSCLCs. Further studies based on larger populations and better methodology are required to determine its further benefits towards patients.

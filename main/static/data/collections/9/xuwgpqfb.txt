BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy has become the standard procedure in elective surgery for recurrent diverticular disease. To realize further benefits of this minimal invasive procedure and to offer less postoperative pain, shorter recovery time, reduced complications, and improved cosmetic results, attempts are being made to minimize the number of necessary skin incisions for trocar positioning. One method is to use only one port for laparoscopic access to perform diverticular-related elective sigmoidectomies. METHODS Between 7 July and 4 August 2009, 10 consecutive patients were referred for partial left colon resection due to multiple episodes of diverticulitis. In all cases, access to the abdomen was achieved through a 2- to 2.5-cm single incision via the umbilicus followed by insertion of the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS™) port system. Outcomes such as change in the procedural method, operative time, postoperative complications, and length of stay were recorded. RESULTS Of the 10 consecutive sigmoidectomies, 9 were performed successfully with the SILS™ procedure using only one incision in the umbilicus. No mortalities or major complications were noted. The median operating time was 120 min, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. CONCLUSION As an alternative to the standard laparoscopic procedure, single-incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy via the umbilicus is technically feasible and effective. This attractive procedure aims to increase the patient's comfort further after abdominal surgery.

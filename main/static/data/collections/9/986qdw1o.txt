Cognitively impaired patients often pull at their dialysis catheters when the catheters are tunneled over the anterior chest. To potentially circumvent this, a technique was developed that tunnels the catheter posteriorly, over the patient's shoulder. A total of 32 posteriorly tunneled catheters were placed in 12 patients. The mean catheter use interval was 164 days, with a total of 5,248 catheter use days. Indications for nonelective catheter removals were catheter dysfunction (n = 7; 23.3%), removal by the patient (n = 7; 23.3%), infection (n = 5; 16.7%), and inadvertent dislodgment (n = 1; 3.3%). Only six of the 12 patients were able to dislodge their catheters. The procedure described here reduced catheter manipulation and extended catheter viability in these patients.

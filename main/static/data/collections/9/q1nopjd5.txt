The aim of this prospective randomized trial was to compare 2 main fixation devices in regard to pain and recurrence in laparoscopic ventral incisional hernia repair (LVIHR). A total of 51 patients were evaluated in this study (n = 25, nonabsorbable tack (NAT) and n = 26, absorbable tack (AT) groups). A visual analogue scale (VAS) was performed on both groups preoperatively and on the postoperative (PO) first day, second week, and sixth month. All patients were followed for recurrence by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and/or abdominal computed tomography. The median follow-up time was 31 months (15-45). The mean age and the mean body mass index (BMI) of the patients were 53.1 ± 11 years and 34 ± 5 kg/m(2), respectively. The median defect size was 60 cm(2) (35-150) and median operation time was 110 minutes (40-360). In 2 patients from AT group and 2 from NAT group (7.8%), recurrence occurred. The 2 groups had similar features regarding demographics, operation time, postoperative hospital stay, morbidity, and VAS scores. The 2 fixation methods were found similar for PO pain and recurrence. In our opinion, the choice of either of these fixation methods during surgery should not be based on the concerns of pain or recurrence. AT may be the preferable option in LVIHR due to the lower cost.

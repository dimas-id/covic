Risk factors (RFs) and mortality data of community‐acquired respiratory virus (CARVs) lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) with concurrent pulmonary co‐infections in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT) is scarce. From January 2011 to December 2017, we retrospectively compared the outcome of allo‐HSCT recipients diagnosed of CARVs LRTD mono‐infection (n = 52, group 1), to those with viral, bacterial, or fungal pulmonary CARVs LRTD co‐infections (n = 15, group 2; n = 20, group 3, and n = 11, group 4, respectively), and with those having bacterial pneumonia mono‐infection (n = 19, group 5). Overall survival (OS) at day 60 after bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was significantly higher in group 1, 2, and 4 compared to group 3 (77%, 67%, and 73% vs 35%, respectively, P = .012). Recipients of group 5 showed a trend to better OS compared to those of group 3 (62% vs 35%, P = .1). Multivariate analyses showed bacterial co‐infection as a RF for mortality (hazard ratio[HR] 2.65, 95% C.I. 1.2‐6.9, P = .017). We identified other 3 RFs for mortality: lymphocyte count <0.5 × 10(9)/L (HR 2.6, 95% 1.1‐6.2, P = .026), the occurrence of and CMV DNAemia requiring antiviral therapy (CMV‐DNAemia‐RAT) at the time of BAL (HR 2.32, 95% C.I. 1.1‐4.9, P = .03), and the need of oxygen support (HR 8.3, 95% C.I. 2.9‐35.3, P = .004). CARV LRTD co‐infections are frequent and may have a negative effect in the outcome, in particular in the context of bacterial co‐infections.

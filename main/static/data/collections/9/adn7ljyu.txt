Thirty five patients were transferred to Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) after the Bali bombings. The patients had severe burn injuries and were considered to be at high-risk of both the carriage and acquisition of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). Whilst seeking to protect the Bali patients with a comprehensive infection control response, we also sought to protect other high-risk patients from nosocomial acquisition of MROs. MROs were detected from 25 (82%) of the 29 Bali patients admitted to RPH. Bali patients were colonised, or infected, with one or more of the following MROs: multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) (19 patients), extended-spectrum ÃŸ-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria (15 patients), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (nine patients), multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA) (six patients), multi-resistant Chryseobacterium sp. (four patients), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (three patients). Five Bali patients developed a total of eight bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in two patients. Since the Bali bombings horizontal transmission of Bali MROs has occurred in 41 non-Bali patients in RPH. MRPA has had the greatest clinical impact. Eight non-Bali patients developed a total of 11 bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in four patients. However, apart from MRPA, we have now controlled transmission of the other MROs in RPH. The emergency response to the Bali disaster required strong leadership, good communication and multi-disciplinary teamwork. The infection control strategy contributed to good outcomes for most Bali bombing patients. However, many patients within the Bali cohort were heavily colonised with MROs, and some developed invasive infection. Subsequent nosocomial transmission of these MROs to non-Bali patients has been a legacy of the Bali tragedy.

Approximately 900 tick species exist worldwide, parasitizing a broad array of mammals, including humans, and thereby playing a significant role in the transmission of infectious diseases (1). In the United States, tick-borne diseases are generally seasonal and geographically distributed. They occur mostly during the spring and summer but can occur throughout the year.

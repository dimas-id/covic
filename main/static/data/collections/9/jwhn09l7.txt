A liquid chromatographic method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of four major active components in tobacco (Nicotiana tobaccum L.) wastes. Samples were extracted with 70% v/v aqueous methanol, four compounds including chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid and caffeic acid were identified and determined by using LC coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry and LC–UV method, respectively. Separation in LC–UV was on an Alltima C(18) column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 μm) with a mobile phase consisting acetonitrile: ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) (5:95 v/v), at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(−1), detected at 327 nm. Four regression equations showed good linear relationships (r (2) > 0.999) between the peak area of each marker and concentration. The method has good repeatability and precision, the intra-day and inter-day RSD for both retention time and peak area was less than 1.0%. The recoveries, measured at three concentration levels, varied from 96.33 to 101.10%. The LOD (S/N = 3) and LOQ (S/N = 6) were less than 0.010 and 0.795 μg·mL(−1), respectively. This assay was successfully applied to the determination of four active compounds in ten samples. The results indicated that the developed assay method was rapid, accurate, reliable and could be readily utilized as a quantitative analysis method for various of tobacco wastes.

Purpose We present surgical techniques and operative results of laparoscopic reconstruction for patients with retrocaval ureter (RCU) and review similar papers. Materials and Methods Ten patients with RCU were enrolled in this study from April 2005 to January 2017. The mean age of 7 males and 3 females was 40.5 years old. The chief complaint was flank pain in 6 patients; the remaining patients were detected incidentally. All patients showed hydronephrosis and typical S-shaped deformity of the ureter on imaging studies. Five patients showed obstructed patterns on the renal scans. Two surgeons performed laparoscopic ureteroureterostomies with transperitoneal approaches including excision of the compressed ureter. Double-J ureteral stents were inserted intraoperatively. The operative and follow-up results were checked and compared with published papers. Results All laparoscopic reconstructions were successfully completed without conversion to open surgery. The mean operative time was 199.6 minutes. The estimated blood loss was 154.4 mL. No operative complications were encountered. There were no obstruction and symptom after the mean follow-up of 40.7 months. We found 7 papers from PubMed, which had more than five cases of laparoscopic reconstruction of RCU. We reviewed and summarized the clinical and operative parameters. Conclusions Our results show that transperitoneal laparoscopic ureteroureterostomy with excision of the compressed ureter is a safe and effective treatment for RCU. Data from published papers and ours summarize clinical parameters of RCU, and suggest that the laparoscopic reconstruction can be considered as the standard treatment for it.

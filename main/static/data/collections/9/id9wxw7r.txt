INTRODUCTION: Musculoskeletal conditions are a leading cause of global morbidity. Access to traditional in-person healthcare can be difficult for some under usual conditions and has become a ubiquitous barrier throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth, defined as the ‘delivery of healthcare at a distance using information and communication technology’ is a solution to many access barriers and has been rapidly adopted by many healthcare professions throughout the crisis. While significant advancements in technology has made the widespread adoption of telehealth feasible, there are many factors to be considered when implementing a telehealth service. PURPOSE: The aims of this masterclass are to (i) introduce telehealth and outline the current research within the context of musculoskeletal physiotherapy; (ii) provide insights into some of the broader challenges in the wide-scale adoption of telehealth; and (iii) to describe a systematic approach to implementing telehealth into existing healthcare settings, along with some practical considerations. IMPLICATIONS: Telehealth is a broad concept and should be implemented to meet the specific needs of a healthcare service. This masterclass offers a structured approach to the implementation of a musculoskeletal physiotherapy telehealth service, and highlights practical considerations required by both clinicians and healthcare organisations throughout all stages of the implementation process.

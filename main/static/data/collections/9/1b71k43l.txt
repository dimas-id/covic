In Switzerland, the planning of security policy measures now increasingly factors in scenarios involving the use of CBRN weapons on Swiss soil. While there have been no terrorist “spectaculars” or dramatic news reports in recent years, this does not mean that the CBRN threat has diminished. In 2003 a project called National NBC Protection was started in order to guarantee efficient coordination of all partners involved in CBRN prevention and incident management at all levels with the aim of improving the NBC protection in Switzerland in the long term. The availability of outstanding expertise in terms of NBC protection therefore remains as important as ever for the Swiss population.

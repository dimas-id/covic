Welcome to the New Year and a new issue of the Biomedical Journal, where we learn that travelling with company boosts the metastatic potential of circulating tumour cells, as well as that a worm could be an excellent model to study antidiabetic drugs. In addition, we discover another pair of molecular scissors for genetic engineering, how exactly Leptospira wreaks havoc on its run through the host organism, and that hyperparathyroidism brings its own risks, but does not worsen the outcome of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the importance of taking into account differing beauty ideals for aesthetic surgery surveys is discussed, alongside the question how bad isolated local recurrence is in the case of HR + breast cancer. Finally, we find out that virtual colonoscopy deserves more credit, that the first medical experiment in space was all about the H-reflex, and that it is possible to survive advanced necrotising fasciitis of the face and neck.

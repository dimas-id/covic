BACKGROUND The role of laparoscopic resection in patients with pancreatic cancer remains to be clarified, because previous reports have not clearly defined oncologic outcomes. The objective of the present study was to investigate this question with the rate of R0 resection and long-term survival as endpoints. METHODS This retrospective observational study included prospectively collected data from 40 patients operated laparoscopically with curative intent for exocrine pancreatic malignancies identified among 250 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreatic operations since 1997. All 40 patients had histologically verified exocrine pancreatic carcinoma. RESULTS Ten patients (25%) with typical ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were deemed nonresectable by laparoscopic staging. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed in 29 patients; 8 resections were combined with resections of adjacent organs and 1 removal of a malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm what appeared to be ectopic pancreatic tissue. In 1 patient, the resection was completed by hand-assisted technique, and 1 procedure was converted to open resection. Postoperative morbidity was 23% (n = 7). The median hospital stay was 5 days (range, 1-30). The rate of R0 resections was 93%. Postoperative 3-year survivals rates were 36% for the entire cohort (n = 30) and 30% in typical ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 21). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for exocrine pancreatic carcinoma is comparable with outcomes after open surgery and supports the concept that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a safe, oncologic procedure.

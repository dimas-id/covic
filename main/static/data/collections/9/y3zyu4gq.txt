OBJECTIVE: To delineate the clinical profile, complications, intensive care needs, and predictors of mortality in children with critical pertussis. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of case records of children in the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care hospital, with a diagnosis of critical pertussis over 3 years. Diagnostic criteria included CDC case definition and confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), when available. Survivors and nonsurvivors were compared to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS: 36 records were analysed, most cases were infants (31, 86.1%). 10 (27.7%) were (below 6 weeks of age). In the rest, 16 (61.5%) were partially immunized or unimmunized against pertussis. Rapid breathing (88.9%), paroxysmal cough (86.1%) and apnea (41.7%) were common presenting complaints. Hypoxemia (97.2%), hyperleukocytosis (61.1%) and encephalopathy (52.8%) were common complications. Intensive care needs were mechanical ventilation in 11 (30.6%), vasoactive support in 7 (19.4%) and exchange transfusion in 3 (8.3%). Female gender, apnea, hyperleukocytosis, encephalopathy, need for vasoactive support, and mechanical ventilation predicted mortality. CONCLUSION: Pertussis demands attention due to its varied presentation, increased complications and higher mortality.

In this paper we investigated the mechanisms of Baihu Decoction ((白虎汤, BH) and Baihu with Radix Ginseng (BHG) in treating systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis in humans and animals. By reviewing published data on the effects of BH and BHG and the control of blood glucose in treating SIRS and sepsis, we found that (1) BH and BHG were beneficial in the treatment of SIRS and sepsis in humans and animals; (2) BH and BHG also had great effect in lowering blood glucose level; and (3) the tight control of blood glucose during critical illness substantially improved the outcome. Considering these data together, we hypothesize that one of the major mechanisms of BH and BHG in treating SIRS and sepsis is to lower the blood glucose level. The findings also suggest that the application of BH and BHG can extend to many acute illnesses and injuries, which commonly cause hyperglycemia.

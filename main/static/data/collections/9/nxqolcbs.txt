PURPOSE To evaluate the benefit of the intraoperative use of a cell salvage and autologous blood recovery system during laparoscopic myomectomy (LM). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 538 patients who underwent LM between January 2008 and December 2009 at our hospital. Patients undergoing LM were divided into two groups depending on whether the cell salvage and autologous blood recovery system was used; the use of the system was at the discretion of the surgeon. The system for intraoperative hemorrhage was employed based on the surgeon's decision. RESULTS Of the 583 patients, 23 patients (4.3%) underwent LM using the system. No patient required an allogeneic blood transfusion during or after the surgery. The median surgical time (183 vs. 100 m), total blood loss (520 vs. 100 mL), total weight of enucleated myomas (390 vs. 175 g), and postoperative calculated δ-Hemoglobin (δ-Hb) (2 vs. 1.6 g/dL) were significantly increased in the 23 patients in whom the system was used. The median autologous blood volume recovered by intraoperative use of the system and transferred to the 23 patients was 250 mL (range 125-800 mL). For patients in whom the system was not used, the total blood loss significantly correlated to δ-Hb (r = 0.29; P < 0.01). However, there was no such correlation in patients in whom the system was not used (r = 0.04; P = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS The adoption of a cell salvage and autologous blood recovery system during LM was useful for patients with severe hemorrhage.

A 72-year-old female presented with severe ischaemic mitral regurgitation following a recent myocardial infarction. She had no significant past medical history. Pre-operative echocardiogram assessment demonstrated preserved tendinous cords of the mitral leaflets, a mitral valve annulus measuring 3.2 cm with end systolic coaptation of 0.3 cm, impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 35% and significant ventricular dilatation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed delayed enhancement in the anterolateral, septal and lateral walls and confirmed the impairment of the left ventricle and a large aneurysmal deformation. On-table transoesophageal echo showed that the distance between the two papillary muscles was over 4 cm. We performed coronary artery bypass grafting combined with a Dor Procedure and papillary muscle approximation using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular graft as a sling, without the insertion of a mitral annuloplasty ring. Postoperative echo and cardiac MRI showed improved left ventricular systolic function and reduced left ventricle volume associated with mild mitral regurgitation. We conclude that papillary muscles approximation as a method of mitral valve repair is a very effective procedure for functional ischaemic mitral regurgitation.

The review is devoted to the problem of creating new antiviral drugs based on glycyrrhizic acid (GA), the major triterpene glycoside extracted from roots of common and Ural licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and G. uralensis Fisher, respectively). Published data on the natural GA sources, antiviral activity of GA and its derivatives, clinical applications of GA-based drugs, and the properties of GA-containing biologically active nutrient additives are summarized. Possible mechanisms of the antiviral activity of GA and its derivatives are examined. It is shown that chemical modification of GA is a promising way of designing new highly active antiviral drugs for the prophylaxis and treatment of HIV, hepatitis B and C, corona-virus, and herpes simplex virus infections.

Collapsing glomerulopathy is an aggressive form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with diverse etiologies The presence of APOL1 high risk genotype is a major risk factor for collapsing glomerulopathy in African Americans Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic with predominant respiratory manifestations However, kidney involvement is being frequently noted and is associated with higher mortality Currently kidney pathology data in COVID-19 are scant and mostly come from postmortem findings We report two African American patients who developed acute kidney injury and proteinuria in temporal association with COVID-19 Kidney biopsies showed collapsing glomerulopathy, endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions, and acute tubular injury, without evidence by electron microscopy or SARS-CoV-2 ISH of viral infection of kidney cells Both patients had APOL1 high risk genotype We propose that collapsing glomerulopathy represents a novel manifestation of COVID-19 especially in people of African descent with APOL1 risk alleles

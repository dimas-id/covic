We report the findings of high-resolution chest computed tomography of 6 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with parainfluenza virus type 3 pneumonia who were not infected with any other pathogens. All patients had multiple small nodules (diameter, <5 mm) without cavitation in a peribronchial distribution. Changes preceded microbiological diagnosis in 4 of 6 cases.

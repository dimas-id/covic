BACKGROUND A small percentage of patients fitted with a gastric band still experience "failure." Here, the authors demonstrate the safety and feasibility of band preserving-laparoscopic gastric plication (BP-LGP), which was designed to improve weight loss and decrease gastric band adjustment frequency and thereby improve patient quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS All 6 patients involved in this study had a gastric band in place for more than 1 year; the median interval from gastric banding to BP-LGP was 31.7 months (range, 19.7-49.9 months). Five (83.3%) patients were female. Preoperative median body mass index (BMI) at gastric banding was 35.4 kg/m(2) (range, 31.9-43.9 kg/m(2)), median nadir BMI with the gastric band was 25.7 kg/m(2) (range, 20.9-31.0 kg/m(2)), and percentage excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) ranged from 24.3% to 123.6%. Indications for BP-LGP were as follows: chronic gastric prolapse in 2 patients (33.3%), pouch-esophageal dilatation in 3 (50.0%), and insufficient weight loss in 4 (66.6%), which included 2 patients with weight loss failure (%EBMIL of <30%). RESULTS The 6 patients consecutively underwent surgery from May 2014 to January 2015. No conversion to open surgery was necessary, and no perioperative complication or mortality occurred. Mean operative time was 190 minutes. All patients showed weight loss after revision and showed resolution of troublesome signs and symptoms. Median follow-up after revision was 7.3 months (range, 5.7-10.1 months), median BMI at last follow-up was 27.6 kg/m(2) (range, 22.7-34.0 kg/m(2)), and median %EBMIL was 75.7% (range, 21.0%-103.6%). Median fill volume before revision was 6.1 mL (range, 2.7-11.0 mL), and median fill volume after revision was 0.3 mL (range, 0.0-5.3 mL). Three patients (50%) had an empty band at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This novel method of bariatric revision (modified BP-LGP) might have a role as a salvage procedure in patients with impending gastric band failure.

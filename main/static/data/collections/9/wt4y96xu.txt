The idiotypic network can be experimentally altered to induce protective immune responses against microbial pathogens. Both internal image and noninternal image anti‐idiotypic (anti‐Id) antibodies have been shown to trigger antigen (Ag)‐specific immune responses. Therefore, mechanisms of anti‐Id vaccination appear to go beyond structural mimicry of Ag, but remain undefined. Using the neurotropic murine coronavirus animal model, we have previously shown that a polyclonal noninternal image anti‐Id (Ab2) could vaccinate BALB/c mice. To characterize its mode of action, we have examined the immune modulating capability of this Ab2 in vivo in strains of mice with different H‐2 haplotypes. Even though only internal image anti‐Id are expected to induce non‐genetically restricted immunity, this noninternal image Ab2 induced protective immunity in four of eight genetically different strains of mice susceptible to coronavirus infection. These were BALB/c (H‐2(d)), DBA/1 (H‐2(d)), DBA/1 (H‐2(q)), and SWR (H‐2(q)) mice. Protection was generally correlated with the induction of specific antiviral Ab (Ab3) that showed biological properties, such as virus neutralization in vitro, similar to the initial Ab1. To evaluate the genetic implication of the H‐2 haplotypes in protection, congenic mice were also tested. Vaccination profiles suggest that cooperation between background gene(s) of the BALB/c mouse with H‐2(d) and H‐2(q) loci is necessary for an optimal protective immune response, although the main genetic element(s) regulating the antiviral response to Ab2 inoculation appeared to be located outside the major histocompatibility complex. These results are consistent with the ability of Ab2 to induce protective antiviral antibodies in genetically different animals by biological mimicry.

Azacitidine, a deoxyribonucleic acid hypomethylating agent, is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Common adverse effects of azacitidine include bone marrow suppression, injection site reactions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. This report focuses on pleuropericardial effusions, an infrequently reported and potentially reversible adverse effect of azacitidine. In this case report, pleuropericardial effusion manifested as the sole radiographic finding in the evaluation of cough occurring during the eighth cycle of treatment with azacitidine. Symptoms and radiographic abnormalities resolved with corticosteroids and diuretics, and the patient could continue with therapy.

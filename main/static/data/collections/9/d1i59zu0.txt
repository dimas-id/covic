One of the major challenges in medicine today is the development of new antibiotics as well as effective antiviral agents. The well-known aminoglycosides interact and interfere with the function of several noncoding RNAs, among which ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are the best studied. Aminoglycosides are also known to interact with proteins such as ribonucleases. Here we review our current understanding of the interaction between aminoglycosides and RNA. Moreover, we discuss briefly mechanisms behind the inactivation of aminoglycosides, a major concern due to the increasing appearance of multiresistant bacterial strains. Taken together, the general knowledge about aminoglycoside and RNA interaction is of utmost importance in the process of identifying/developing the next generation or new classes of antibiotics. In this perspective, previously unrecognized as well as known noncoding RNAs, apart from rRNA, are promising targets to explore.

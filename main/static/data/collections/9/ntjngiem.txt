Morpholino oligonucleotides are stable, uncharged, water‐soluble molecules used to block complementary sequences of RNA, preventing processing, read‐through, or protein binding at those sites. Morpholinos are typically used to block translation of mRNA and to block splicing of pre‐mRNA, though they can block other interactions between biological macromolecules and RNA. Morpholinos are effective, specific, and lack non‐antisense effects. They work in any cell that transcribes and translates RNA, but must be delivered into the nuclear/cytosolic compartment to be effective. Morpholinos form stable base pairs with complementary nucleic acid sequences but apparently do not bind to proteins to a significant extent. They are not recognized by any proteins and do not undergo protein‐mediated catalysis; nor do they mediate RNA cleavage by RNase H or the RISC complex. This work focuses on techniques and background for using Morpholinos.

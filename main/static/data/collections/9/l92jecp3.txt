INTRODUCTION No case of single-incision laparoscopic surgery in obese patients who had previously undergone multiple midline vertical laparotomies has been described in the literature to date. Hence we report the first case of single-port laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy in an obese patient who was affected by a left adnexal mass and who had previously undergone 3 midline vertical laparotomies. CASE DESCRIPTION A postmenopausal 57-year-old woman with a body mass index of 31.2 kg/m(2) and a history of 3 midline vertical cesarean deliveries and a right salpingooophorectomy was diagnosed with a left adnexal mass and underwent a single-incision laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy. DISCUSSION The patient was treated successfully. The operative blood loss was minimal. The postoperative hospital stay lasted 18 hours, and postoperative pain was short-lasting. No early or long-term postoperative complications were registered. On histopathologic examination, a diagnosis of ovarian serous cystadenoma was made. Even though this unique case is the first to be reported in the literature, its encouraging results suggest the use of this new surgical technique in similar clinical situations to verify whether the feasibility and safety reported in this article are confirmed.

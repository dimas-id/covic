Congenital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are an important but often neglected cause of lower extremity venous hypertension. A case of a chronic refractory venous stasis ulcer of the lower extremity exacerbated by a pelvic AVM is presented. Healing of the ulcer was achieved at 2 months without recurrence at 1 year after superselective ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx 34; ev3, Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) embolization of the AVM nidus. Chronic venous arterialization should be considered in cases of refractory, nonhealing venous ulcers. Embolotherapy in addition to standard of care therapy can be a therapeutic measure. Modification of the Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification to include AVMs as a contributing pathophysiologic process is suggested.

BACKGROUND: There is limited information describing the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) especially those in underserved urban area with minority population in the United States. METHODS: This is a retrospective single center study for patients who were admitted with COVID-19 infection. Data collection was from March 1 through April 24,2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were presented using descriptive statistics and frequencies. Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine association of risk factors and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 242 inpatients were included with a mean age of 66 ±14.75 (±SD). 50% were female and 70% were African American. Comorbidities included hypertension (74%), diabetes mellitus (49%), and 19% had either COPD or asthma. Older age was associated with higher risk of inpatient death OR 1.056 [95% CI 1.023 to 1.090; p=0.001]. Inpatient mortality occurred in 70% who needed mechanical ventilation (OR: 29.51; 95% CI: 13.28-65.60; p<0.0001), 58% who required continuous renal replacement therapy/hemodialysis (CRRT/HD) (OR: 6.63; 95% CI: 2.74-16.05; p<0.0001), and 69% who needed vasopressors (OR: 30.64; 95% CI: 13.56 to 69.20; p<0.0001). Amongst biomarkers of disease severity, only baseline CRP levels (145±116 mg/L) were associated with mortality OR 1.008 [95% CI 1.003 to 1.012; p=0.002]. CONCLUSION: Majority of hospitalized patients had hypertension and diabetes. Older age was an independent risk factor for inpatient mortality. Requirement of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and CRRT/HD were associated significantly with inpatient mortality. Higher baseline CRP was significantly associated with inpatient death.

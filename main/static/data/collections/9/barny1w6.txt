At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, there were higher mortality rates in patients requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) most likely due to acute respiratory failure. Whereas the use of prophylaxis and corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and highly active antiretroviral therapy has changed this outcome and has improved survival rate. However, respiratory failure has remained the most common indication for an ICU admission. When HIV-infected patients are admitted to the ICU, intensivists need to be knowledgeable about the manifestations of common diseases and the new manifestations related to antiretroviral therapy. Much HIV mortality has been linked directly to late diagnosis and late initiation of appropriate antiviral therapy. This l, the most important cause of ICU admission for AIDS patients. We analyzed the characteristics of P. jiroveci pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, pulmonary invasive fungal infections, Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, and the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.

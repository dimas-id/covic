The objective of this study was to explore the development of IgG and IgM against SARS CoV and characteristics of changes of antibody titers in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to search the opportunity for collecting specific anti-serum from convalescent patients with SARS. The anti-SARS-coronavirus specific antibody levels in 156 SARS patients were measured with ELISA. The results showed that the total positive rates of IgG and IgM were 75.6% and 41.7% respectively, and the negative rate of both IgG and IgM was 23.7%. The average titers of IgG and IgM antibody in positive samples were 18.23 +/- 24.72 and 2.18 +/- 1.13, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the titers of IgG/IgM and sex, age, course of diseases and duration of body temperature recovery. It was concluded that not all SARS patients could produce the anti-SARS-coronavirus specific antibody. The titers of the anti-body are diversified even if the antibodies have been emerged in them. In order to obtain effective anti-serum, the titers of antibody must be tested just before collection of convalescent serum, and it ensures the therapeutic effect and provides a measurable index for clinical transfusion.

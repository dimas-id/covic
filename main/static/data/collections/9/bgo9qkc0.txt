Macrophage are indispensable regulator cells in inflammatory response. Macrophage polarization and its secreted inflammatory factors have affinity with the outcomes of inflammation. Luteolin, a flavonoid abundant in plants has anti-inflammatory activity, but whether luteolin can manipulate M1/M2 polarization of BMDM to suppress inflammation is still veiled. The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of luterolin on the polarity of BMDM derived from C57BL/6 mice and the expression of inflammatory factors, to explore the mechanism of luteolin regulating the BMDM polarity. M1-polarized BMDM were induced by LPS+IFN-γ, M2-polarization were stimulated with IL-4. BMDM morphology was observed by laser confocal microscopy; levels of BMDM differentiation and CD11c or CD206 on membrane surface were assessed by FCM; mRNA and protein of M1/M2-type inflammatory factors were performed by qPCR and ELISA, respectively; the expression of p-STAT1 and p-STAT6 protein pathways was detected by Western-blotting. The isolated mouse bone marrow cells were successfully differentiated into BMDM, LPS+IFN-γ induced BMDM M1-phenotype polarization, and IL-4 induced its M2-phenotype polarization. After M1-polarized BMDM treated with luteolin, M1-type pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6, TNF-α□iNOS, CD86 were down-regulated while M2-type anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10, Arg1, CD206 were up-regulated; the expression of M1-type surface marker CD11c decreased, nevertheless, M2-type marker CD206 increased; levels of inflammatory signaling protein p-STAT1 and p-STAT6 were attenuated and enhanced respectively. Our study suggests luteolin may transform BMDM polarity through p-STAT1/6 to regulate the expression of inflammatory mediators, thereby inhibiting inflammation. Naturally occurring luteolin hold promise as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent.

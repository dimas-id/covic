In this study, 98 diarrhoeic and 70 non-diarrhoeic samples were collected from 13 dairy farms located across 5 provinces in China from April 2017 to May 2018. Approximately 41.8 % (41/98) of diarrhoeic samples and 5.7 % (4/70) of non-diarrhoeic samples were nebovirus-positive based on RT-PCR results, and some diarrhoeic samples were co-infected with bovine rotavirus (73.2 %), bovine coronavirus (36.6 %) and/or bovine viral diarrhoea virus (31.7 %). A phylogenetic analysis of 23 nebovirus RdRp fragments showed that these strains were closely related to Nebraska-like (NB-like) strains but were all located in a unique large branch. Moreover, a phylogenetic analysis of the 18 complete VP1 sequences from this study revealed that 14 strains belonged to lineage 1 and 4 strains belonged to lineage 3. Notably, all four lineage 3 strains shared the same recombination event, with a breakpoint located within the P1A domain. The complete genome of one nebovirus strain, Bo/YLA-2/17/CH, which had a recombination event within the P1A domain of its VP1, was successfully sequenced and was found to be 7453 nt in length, and this may represent a novel nebovirus strain based on the phylogenetic analysis of its complete genome sequence. In conclusion, this study reveals that neboviruses circulate widely in dairy cows in China and exhibit a unique evolution of RdRp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported recombination event located within the P1A domain of nebovirus VP1.

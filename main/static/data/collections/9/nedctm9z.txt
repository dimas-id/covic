Abstract Objective This study sought to evaluate the sustained value of an early pregnancy assessment clinic (EPAC) in the management of early pregnancy complications and its effect on the incidence emergency room (ER) visits. Methods A 10-year retrospective study (January 2006 to December 2015) was conducted. The number of patients assessed, sources and reasons for referral, and treatments provided were reviewed. The numbers of ER assessments and reassessments for abortion, hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy from January 2004 to December 2005 (pre-EPAC) and January 2006 to December 2015 (post-EPAC) were also reviewed. Results There were 11 349 new referrals and 10 764 follow-up visits. The reasons for referral were threatened miscarriage (n = 3568, 31.4%), missed miscarriage (n = 3056, 26.9%), incomplete miscarriage (n = 1064, 9.4%), complete miscarriage (n = 991, 8.7%), ectopic pregnancy (n = 857, 7.6%), hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 139, 1.2%), and others (n = 1674, 14.8%). There has been a significant decreasing trend (tau = âˆ’0.60, P = 0.0127) and a significant decrease in the post-EPAC rate of ER reassessments (P = 0.0396) for hemorrhage, with a concomitant decrease in EPAC visits for hemorrhage. In addition, there has been a significant increasing trend (tau = 0.64, P = 0.0081) and a significant increase in the post-EPAC rate of ER assessments (P = 0.00001) for ectopic pregnancies. Conclusion Over the 10-year period, the EPAC has remained a vital service for managing early pregnancy complications for women. However, the clinic has not yet had a sustained impact on ER visits for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage. It is possible that a reduction in ER assessments and reassessments for early pregnancy complications can be achieved through a clinic with daily access.

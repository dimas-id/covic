Monotone matrices play a key role in the convergence theory of regular splittings and different types of weak regular splittings. If monotonicity fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned classes of matrices. In such a case, $K$-monotonicity is sufficient for the convergence of $K$-regular and $K$-weak regular splittings, where $K$ is a proper cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage iteration scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature. Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in standard proper cone setting, i.e., $K=\mathbb{R}^n_+$), is open. To this end, we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for $K$-weak regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a two-stage iterative scheme is a $K$-regular splitting and then establish some comparison theorems. We also study $K$-monotone convergence theory of the stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a $K$-weak regular splitting of type II. The most interesting and important part of this work is on $M$-matrices appearing in the Covid-19 pandemic model. Finally, numerical computations are performed using the proposed technique to compute the next generation matrix involved in the pandemic model.

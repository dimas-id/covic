Ontology learning from a text written in natural language is a well-studied domain. However, the applicability of techniques for ontology learning from natural language texts is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the text corpus and the language used. In this paper, we present our work so far in entity linking and enhancing the ontology with extracted relations between concepts. We discuss the benefits of adequately designed lexico-semantic patterns in ontology learning. We propose a preliminary set of lexico-semantic patterns designed for the Czech language to learn new relations between concepts in the related domain ontology in a semi-supervised approach. We utilize data from the urban planning and development domain to evaluate the introduced technique. As a partial prototypical implementation of the stack, we present Annotace, a text annotation service that provides links between the ontology model and the textual documents in Czech.

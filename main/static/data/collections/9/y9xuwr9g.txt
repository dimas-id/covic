Global-warming alarmism can be viewed from the broader perspective of global scares as one in a series of panics that rise and often fall; global warming is still in the rise period. Booker and North (2007) documented the details of the rise and fall of various global scares ranging from a wide variety of food scares, to mad cow disease, to dioxins, to the millennium bug, to lead and asbestos, to passive smoking, and finally to global warming.

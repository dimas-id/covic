The human bocavirus (HBoV), virus of the Parvoviridae family, discovered by molecular methods in 2005, has been reported in respiratory samples, stool, urine and blood, both in children and adults. Prevalence rates range from 0.8% in fecal samples of individuals with acute diarrhea, up to 19% in respiratory samples and blood. HBoV has been detected in up to 43% of nasopharyngeal samples in asymptomatic children. In Chile, HBoV was detected in 24.2% of nasopharyngeal swabs in children under 5 years of age with respiratory symptoms of which 74% had coinfection with other viruses. In asymptomatic children under 5 years of age, 37.5% of NP samples were positive for HBoV. We discuss the role of HBoV as a causal agent of respiratory and/or enteric disease in light of the high rates of coinfection and asymptomatic infections.

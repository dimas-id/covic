The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) incidence in India is currently experiencing exponential rise but with apparent spatial variation in growth rate and doubling time rate. We classify the states into five clusters with low to the high-risk category and study how the different states moved from one cluster to the other since the onset of the first case on $30^{th}$ January 2020 till the end of unlock 1 that is $30^{th}$ June 2020. We have implemented a new clustering technique called the incrementalKMN (Prasad, R. K., Sarmah, R., Chakraborty, S.(2019))

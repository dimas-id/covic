In 2013, 40 years after the first case of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in Europe, PED has emerged in USA that was free of that disease before. The coronavirus, etiological agent of the disease and called PEDV, spread quickly within all the country and in America leading to a significant impact on the pig production. Two types of viral strains have been identified: highly virulent "non-InDel" strains and "InDel" strains because of insertion/deletion in the S gene and associated with less severe clinical cases. PEDV infection causes watery diarrhea and a mortality of up to 100 % in piglets. This review sums up the current knowledge on the virus, its transmission and its worldwide molecular epidemiology, on the physiopathology of the disease and the control measures.

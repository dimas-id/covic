Nosocomial infection represents an important indicator of healthcare quality and patient safety. Based on the experience gained during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan in 2003, we gained greater awareness of the potential threat from patient-hired attendants and outsourced workers as bacteria carriers and transmitters. This study built a training model and evaluated training effectiveness in terms of improved knowledge. The training model included nosocomial infection control guidelines, a training CD, training program, evaluation form, and descriptive procedures for conducting training and evaluation. The training course for this study was conducted in 17 hospitals in Taiwan, with a total of 1,467 participants attending 27 seminars and 1,265 effective samples (return rate = 86.2%). Results of the study showed a statistical difference of < .001 before and after the training course on participant understanding of nosocomial infection control. Advantages of applying this training model include knowledge enhancement and reduced implementation time, manpower input and budget outlay. In addition to greater flexibility, the model can also positively influence clinical practice, improve patient safety and reduce hospital nosocomial infection rates. This program is worth promoting in hospitals and other healthcare institutions.

Although initially considered relatively harmless pathogens, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are nowadays known to be associated with more severe clinical complications. Still, their precise pathogenic potential is largely unknown, particularly regarding the most recently identified species HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. HCoVs need host cell proteins to successively establish infections. Proteases of the reninâ€“angiotensin system serve as receptors needed for entry into target cells; this article describes the current knowledge on the involvement of this system in HCoV pathogenesis.

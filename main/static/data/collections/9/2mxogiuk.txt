A 65-year-old man with a left cavernous internal carotid artery cerebral aneurysm experienced a premature detachment of the first framing coil (10 mm Ã— 40 cm Penumbra Complex Standard) during a coil embolization procedure. The coil herniated into the anterior cerebral artery and pericallosal artery. Multiple attempts to retrieve the coil using both a 2 and 4 mm Microsnare (Amplatz GooseNeck) failed. A Trevo ProVue retrievable stent was then used to retrieve the coil without any adverse events. This case report highlights a novel use of a stent for the removal of a foreign body from the cerebrovascular system.

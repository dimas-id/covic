INTRODUCTION Laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition (LAPG-JI) is not yet widely used because the three anastomotic procedures involved in this operation are technically complicated. This study aimed to describe our surgical procedure for LAPG-JI and assess its feasibility and safety. METHODS This was a retrospective study of 70 patients who had undergone proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach between July 2007 and October 2016. Of these patients, 32 underwent LAPG-JI, and 38 underwent open proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition. Clinical characteristics and both surgical and postoperative outcomes were compared between LAPG-JI and open proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition. RESULTS The operation time was longer in the LAPG-JI group (189 vs 154 min, P < 0.001) and estimated blood loss was lower (30 vs 180 mL, P < 0.001). There were no differences in the rates of early (9.4% vs 13.2%) or late postoperative complications (12.5% vs 10.5%). No anastomotic leakage was observed in either group. In the LAPG-JI group, the time to first eating was shorter, and the white blood cell counts on postoperative days 1 and 7 and body temperature on postoperative day 3 were lower. The number of additional doses of postoperative analgesia was lower in the LAPG-JI group. Reflux esophagitis graded C according to the Los Angeles classification was observed in only one patient (3.1%) in the LAPG-JI group. CONCLUSION Although the operation time was longer in the LAPG-JI group, the procedure seemed to be feasible and safe. Also, it offered the advantages of laparoscopic surgery, including less invasiveness and quicker recovery.

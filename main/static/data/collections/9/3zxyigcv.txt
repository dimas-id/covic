This study investigates bubbles and crashes in the cryptocurrency market. In particular, using the log-periodic power law, we estimate the critical time of bubbles in the Bitcoin market. The results indicate that Bitcoin bubbles clearly exist, and our forecast of critical times can be verified with high accuracy. We further claim that bubbles could originate from the mining process, investor sentiment, global economic trend, and even regulation. For policy makers, the findings suggest the necessity of monitoring the signatures of bubbles and their progress in the market place.

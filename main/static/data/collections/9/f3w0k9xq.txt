Securing the pediatric airway in the emergency setting is an uncommon event that is complicated by anatomic, physiologic, and environmental factors. Even more uncommonly, practitioners are faced with the added complication of a difficult airway, and the question of what alternatives to traditional endotracheal intubation are available and most useful may arise. Timely and effective intervention determines the patient's clinical outcome. The purpose of this review was to detail specific alternative airway management strategies and tools for use in the pediatric emergency department.

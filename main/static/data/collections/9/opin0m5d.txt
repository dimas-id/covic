Mitochondria are unique dynamic organelles that evolved from free-living bacteria into endosymbionts of mammalian hosts (Sagan 1967; Hatefi 1985). They have a distinct ~16.6 kb closed circular DNA genome coding for 13 polypeptides (Taanman 1999). In addition, a majority of the ~1500 mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus and transported to the mitochondria (Bonawitz et al. 2006). Mitochondria have two membranes: an outer smooth membrane and a highly folded inner membrane called cristae, which encompasses the matrix that houses the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and lipid metabolism. The inner mitochondrial membrane houses the protein complexes comprising the electron transport chain (ETC) (Hatefi 1985).

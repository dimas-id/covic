Abstract Here, we describe two mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases. One was imported from Wuhan, and the other was locally transmitted in Japan without recent travel to China. In both cases, lower respiratory tract symptoms were observed first, and high fever progressed in about one week. The laboratory findings revealed normal WBC and CRP despite apparent lung infiltrations, and typical observations on CT imaging were important diagnostic clues. In the domestic endemic situation, a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical course, and laboratory and radiological findings was required for diagnosis.

Recently, there has been an increased attention towards innovating, enhancing, building, and deploying applications of speech signal processing for providing assistance and relief to human mankind from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Many AI with speech initiatives are taken to combat with the present situation and also to create a safe and secure environment for the future. This paper summarises all these efforts taken by the re-search community towards helping the individuals and the society in the fight against COVID-19 over the past 3-4 months using speech signal processing. We also summarise the deep techniques used in this direction to come up with capable solutions in a short span of time. This paper further gives an overview of the contributions from non-speech modalities that may complement or serve as inspiration for audio and speech analysis. In addition, we discuss our observations with respect to solution usability, challenges, and the significant technology achievements.

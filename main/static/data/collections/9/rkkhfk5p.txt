Canine vaccines can be divided into essential, core vaccines, and less essential noncore vaccines. The core vaccines are canine distemper, adenovirus-2, and parvovirus. Rabies vaccination is mandatory in many different jurisdictions. Canine respiratory disease vaccines include Parainfluenza 3, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Other important bacterial vaccines include those against Lyme disease and Leptospirosis. Vaccination schedules must be initiated in puppies no earlier than 6 weeks, and the core vaccines must be readministered at frequent intervals until 16 weeks as a result of the prolonged inhibitory effects of maternal immunity. Emerging diseases such as canine influenza may also be vaccinated against.

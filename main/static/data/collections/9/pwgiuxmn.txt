Unilateral lung agenesis is a relatively rare congenital anomaly with a reported incidence of 1 in 15 000 births. It is frequently associated with other congenital malformations. Some of the sequelae of lung agenesis are potentially life-threatening. Here, we report a case of left lung agenesis in association with hiatal hernia and atrioventricular septal defect, a rare combination of anomalies which have not been described previously in the literature.

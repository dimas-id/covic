With a recent focus on minimizing the visibility of scars, minilaparoscopy has reemerged as an attractive option for surgeons. Minilaparoscopy, or needlescopic surgery, ultimately limits tissue trauma and improves cosmesis. We describe the tools that are available for surgeons who are considering utilizing this approach. Included in this review are the instruments, trocars, trocar-less instruments, and optics available for needlescopic surgery. Because this is a rapidly growing area of surgery, needlescopic surgery will benefit from additional product development with a focus on improving instrument strength and optics.

A segment of genomic RNA extending from the 3'-end of the membrane (M) protein gene to the 5'-end of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene of Turkey coronavirus (TCV) was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primers were derived from the corresponding sequences of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced and their nucleic acid structure and similarity to the published sequences of IBV were analyzed. Gene 5 containing two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 5a and 5b, was localized between M and N genes of TCV. The overall nucleotide sequences of the amplified regions from TCV isolates shared 88.4% to 91.8% similarity to the corresponding region of IBV strains. The consensus transcription-associated sequence of IBV, CTTAACAA, was highly conserved in the TCV genome with regard to nucleotide sequence and location in terms of the initiation codons of the genes 5 and N. The similarities between the predicted amino acid sequences of ORFs 5a and 5b of TCV isolates and the homologous genes of IBV strains were 85.4% to 94.0%. The results indicate the existence of gene 5 in the genome of TCV and a close relatedness of the TCV gene 5 to the IBV gene 5 in location and nucleotide sequence.

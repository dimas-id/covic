Pneumonia is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. It is the most prevalent community-acquired infection and the second most common nosocomial infectious disorder. Infections may occur in healthy people or individuals with concomitant intrapulmonary or extrathoracic diseases. Pneumonia may develop into a life-threatening condition, especially in immunocompromised patients, in children, and in the elderly.

As the world tackles the largest public health event in more than a century, the COVID‐19 pandemic, the true value of nursing is being seen by politicians and the public. But while nurses are being praised for the vital work they do, many are being put into high‐risk situations, and some have died, because of a shortage of appropriate, high‐quality personal protective equipment.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Liquid embolic agents are increasingly used to treat vascular malformations. We sought to assess embolization with these agents by using a dual-lumen balloon catheter in an experimental setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighteen injections of liquid embolic agents were performed in the rete mirabile of swine. We used 3 methods to control liquid embolic agent reflux: 1) dual-lumen balloon-catheter (group A, n = 8); 2) injection of liquid embolic agent after proximal n-BCA plug formation through a second microcatheter (group B, n = 4); and 3) standard liquid embolic agent injection (group C, controls, n = 6). The following outcomes were graded by using ordinal scales by angiography, macrophotography, and radiography of retia after euthanasia: 1) angiographic and pathologic extent of liquid embolic agent embolization of the rete, 2) reflux of liquid embolic agents in the parent artery, and 3) density of liquid embolic agents in the proximal rete. Technical complications were also recorded. A successful injection was defined as an embolization that reached the contralateral rete without reflux into proximal external branches. Exact logistic regression analyses were performed to compare groups. RESULTS There were significant differences among groups for reflux (P = .029) and liquid embolic agent density in the proximal rete (P = .014), while extension to the contralateral rete did not reach statistical significance (P = .07). Injections differed among groups (P = .004), with dual-lumen balloon-catheter injections more frequently successful compared with control injections (P = .019). CONCLUSIONS Dual-lumen balloon catheters allowed better liquid embolic agent injections than standard injections.

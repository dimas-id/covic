Abstract The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis (in the XXIth Century). France has declared a “state of health emergency”. In order to tackle the spread of the virus and to prevent the risk of overwhelming the health care system, the French government has implemented extraordinary measures all over the country. In accordance with the public health code, the Minister of Health has implemented the provisions that are deemed necessary to avoid jeopardizing the therapeutic follow-up of patients. The mandatory medical prescriptions dispensing system is being transformed for a limited period. Therefore, the pharmacist’s liability is disrupted.

Temperature control during severe sepsis is currently used in intensive care and involves 66% and 70% of severe sepsis and septic shock, respectively. Nevertheless, the conclusive evidence of the benefit of such a strategy is still lacking.We might wonder, with regards to experimental works and recent noninterventional studies, about the risk of a control strategy on an ongoing infectious process, the patientâ€™s outcome, and the safety of the means implemented to obtain temperature control. On the other hand, it is also demonstrated that fever increases oxygen consumption, which may lead in some clinical situations to tissular ischemia and that fever may be associated with a deleterious focal inflammatory process. Methods to control the temperature include external and/or internal cooling and/or antipyretic medications such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. In septic patients, external cooling and paracetamol are the mains means used to control temperature. Despite the uncertainties about the benefit to control or not the temperature, it could be stated that extreme temperature (hypo- or hyperthermia) should be avoided and that the benefit/risk of temperature control must be individually weighted.

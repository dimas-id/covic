OBJECTIVE: Our institution performed an educational initiative targeting previously identified barriers to pediatric sepsis recognition and treatment. We hypothesized that provider knowledge, attitude, and behavior would be improved 1 year after implementation. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of a multi-faceted quality initiative introduced to providers in the Emergency Department, inpatient wards, and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care children’s hospital. Educational platforms consisted of quarterly electronic sepsis “newsletters,” brightly colored posters highlighting protocol and screening strategies displayed throughout the hospital, and low-fidelity simulation sessions (drills) led by trained staff and incorporated into daily workflows. The content was driven by feedback from a baseline needs assessment of sepsis education. One year after implementation, the needs assessment was repeated. RESULTS: Over 3 months, facilitators conducted 197 drills and captured a majority of nurses (89%), pediatrics residents (96%), and respiratory therapists (62%). By 6 months, 241 sessions had been completed. Approximately 55.4% of the 442 eligible staff participated in our post-intervention survey. Overall, knowledge of diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock increased from pre-intervention levels (P = 0.015). Among post-implementation respondents, drill participants outperformed their colleagues (P = 0.001). A greater percentage of post-intervention respondents indicated comfort with sepsis recognition (P < 0.001), and fewer reported hesitating to bring sepsis concerns to their care team (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary curriculum balancing active education—through brief, targeted simulation—and general awareness—through electronic resources and a poster campaign—can improve sepsis-related knowledge, attitude, and behavior among pediatric practitioners.

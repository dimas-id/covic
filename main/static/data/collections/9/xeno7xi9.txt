Over a five-year period (1981-1985) 346 faecal and intestinal samples of cats affected with diarrhoea were studied by electron microscopy. This method revealed the presence of virus in 144 out of 346 (41.6 per cent) samples studied. 117 (81.3 per cent) of these samples contained parvoviruses which were identified by using a specific immune serum (immuno electron microscopy). In addition, rotaviruses (two samples), coronaviruses (thirteen samples), coronavirus-like (ten samples) and picornavirus-like particles (two samples) were detected in the other specimens. The present study shows that electron microscopy is a useful and rapid procedure in the diagnosis of enteritis in cats as well as in other domestic animals.

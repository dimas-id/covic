There is a great clinical requirement to improve radiofrequency ablation (RFA) efficacy and create larger coagulation necrotic areas. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of a hypertonic-saline (HS)-enhanced multipolar RFA technique using a perfused electrode to increase RF-created coagulation necrosis, and to compare that technique with natural saline-augmented needle and conventional multipolar RFA. A total of 18 ablations were performed in explanted porcine livers. A total of 6 thermal ablation zones were created in each of 3 groups treated with the conventional multipolar mode, the multipolar mode with 0.9% NaCl and the multipolar mode with 6% NaCl, respectively. During RFA, the dimensions and volumes of the ablation zones were compared, and gross and microscopic pathological evaluations were performed. Multipolar RFA with 6% NaCl created the largest short-axis diameters and volumes of coagulation necrosis (3.89±0.09 mm and 40.01±2.86 mm3, respectively) among the three groups (conventional group: 2.31±0.04 mm and 8.99±0.52 mm3, respectively; 0.9% NaCl solution group: 3.17±0.05 mm and 21.79±1.05 mm3, respectively). Overall, multipolar RFA with the instillation of 6% NaCl solution through an open perfusion system created a larger ablation zone compared with the conventional and 0.9% NaCl modes. Therefore, HS-enhanced multipolar RFA may be a promising approach for treating large liver tumors.

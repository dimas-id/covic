Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been recognized to inhibit the response of type I interferon (IFN) both in vivo and in vitro. However, the post-transcriptional mechanism by which PRRSV suppresses type I IFN induction in virus-infected host cells remains unclear. The present study first demonstrated that PRRSV inhibited post-transcriptionally the protein induction of IFN-β in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) during early infection, and the inhibition effect mediated by the Chinese highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV was stronger. Next, we analyzed the cellular microRNA (miRNA)-modulated protein expression of porcine IFN-β by dual firefly/Renilla luciferase reporter assay, transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitor assay and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) treatment of PAMs, showing that porcine miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 are able to inhibit IFN-β protein expression in primary PAMs by directly targeting sequences within the porcine IFN-β 3′UTR locating at 160–181, 9–31, 27–47 and 12–32 bp, respectively. Finally, we confirmed that let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, were upregulated in PRRSV-infected PAMs early in vitro, and the expression level of these miRNAs in HP-PRRSV JXwn06-infected PAMs were higher than those in low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. The endogenous cellular miRNA-mediated inhibition of IFN-β induction in PRRSV-infected PAMs early could be relieved by miRNA antagonists. Taken together, our findings suggest for the first time that PRRSV can suppress post-transcriptionally protein expression of IFN-β by upregulating cellular miRNAs in PAMs in vitro, providing novel insight into mechanisms in relation to the PRRSV-mediated immunomodulation of porcine innate immunity.

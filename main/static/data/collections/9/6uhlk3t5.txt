Within the cytoplasm of NPC tumor cells Corona virus like particles have been described earlier. Controlling immunfluorescent studies using anti-Corona-rabbit serum revealed the antigen localization within the tumor cell cytoplasm. Vice versa the blood sera from NPC-patients reveal significatively higher Corona antibody titers than blood sera from other than NPC-patients. The results open the theory that next to the well known EBV-infection the Corona virus infection plays an important role in NPC tumor biology. The question remains open whether there is an interacting function between a RNA-virus infection (Corona) and a DNA-virus infection (EBV) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

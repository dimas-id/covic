The outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019 has aroused great concern worldwide. At present, the COVID-19 coronavirus pneumonia is highly contagious, rapid and widespread. It has been reported that COVID-19 virus is spread by respiratory droplets and direct contact transmission, and it has various clinical manifestations and recurrent is common. Some patients do not even appear obvious fever and have negative results for throat swab virus culture at the onset of the disease, but the rapid deterioration in their clinical condition usually occurred, which bring difficulties to scientific diagnosis and treatment. At present, western medicine treats most patients with anti-viral drugs, hormones and other drugs, or treats critically ill patients with ECMO oxygenation, important organ function support and other emergency treatments. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) based on syndrome differentiation and treatment has obtained curative effects in this outbreak. In order to improve the effects and safety of Chinese and western drug therapy, we applied literature-mining method and network pharmacology, summarized the potential liver injury during the application of western medicine and discussed hepatotoxicity networks and potential pathway targets of ingredients in Chinese patent medicine and Chinese herbal compound. This study not only summarizes essential information regarding potential drug-induced liver injury and biomarkers for pharmacovigilance, but also provides insights for liver protection by TCM or TCM in combination with western medicine in the treatment of novel coronavirus.

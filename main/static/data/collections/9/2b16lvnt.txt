A 5‐year‐old, neutered male Domestic Short‐haired cat was referred with a 5‐month history of anterior uveitis and cataract in the right eye. Clinical examination confirmed anterior uveitis and immature cataract in the right eye and chorioretinitis in the left eye. Ocular ultrasound showed a retinal detachment in the right eye. Diagnostic testing revealed elevated serum titers for Toxoplasma gondii. Anterior uveitis in the right eye and chorioretinitis in the left eye progressed, resulting in blindness despite a 21‐day course of clindamycin and aggressive topical medical management of uveitis. The right eye was enucleated and histopathologic evaluation of the globe revealed panuveitis and multiple organisms morphologically consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum. Systemic treatment with itraconazole was initiated. Vision returned after 3 months of treatment and complete resolution of the retinal hemorrhages with formation of a flat chorioretinal scar was noted after 6 months of therapy. Itraconazole was discontinued 7 months after starting therapy, at which time the funduscopic appearance of the chorioretinal scar had remained static for 1 month. The cat has remained visual without evidence of disease progression for 6 months following discontinuation of itraconazole.

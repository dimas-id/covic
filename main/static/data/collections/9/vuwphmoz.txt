The outbreak and pandemic of the COVID-19 has dramatically changed the world in almost every aspect. Its impact on the community of high energy physics is also apparent. In this analysis we show that social distancing has greatly changed the working style of the physics community. In the field of high energy physics the online communications and video conferences are becoming daily routine arrangements. However, such a change of working styles may need some time to get used to. The influence can be seen by scientific outcomes harvested from arXiv, INSPIRE databases and JHEP, PRD official websites.

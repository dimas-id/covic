BACKGROUND: Respiratory diseases in pigs are the main health concerns for swine producers. Similar to the diseases in human and other animals, respiratory diseases are primary related to morbidity and are the result of infection with bacteria, viruses, or both. B. bronchiseptica causes serious respiratory diseases in the swine airway track. However, the B. bronchiseptica-specific bacteriophage has diverse advantages such as decreasing antibiotic overuse and possible therapeutic potential against bacteria. OBJECTIVE: The objects of this study were to investigate the therapeutic effect of specific B. bronchiseptica bacteriophages and to identify genes related to bacteriophage signaling utilizing RNA microarrays in swine nasal turbinate cells. METHODS: Bor-BRP-1 phages were applied 24 h prior to B.bronchiseptica infection (1 × 10(7) cfu/ml) at several concentrations of bacterial infection. Cells were incubated to detect cytokines and 24 h to detect mucin production. And real-time quantitative PCR was performed to examine related genes expression. To determine the change of total gene expression based on B.bronchiseptica and Bor-BRP-1 treatment, we performed RNA sequencing experiments. RESULTS: The results showed that B. bronchiseptica induced increased expression of several inflammatory genes such as IL-1β, IL-6, and Muc1 in a dose-dependent manner. However, Bor-BRP-1 induced reduction of gene expression compared to the B. bronchiseptica induction group. In addition, microarrays detected Bor-BRP-1-altered inflammatory gene expression against B. bronchiseptica, reducing B. bronchiseptica-induced airway inflammation in swine epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the specific bacteriophage has a therapeutic potential to defend against B. bronchiseptica infection by altering inflammatory gene expression profiles.

Respiratory immunity is accomplished using multiple mechanisms including structure/anatomy of the respiratory tract, mucosal defense in the form of the mucociliary apparatus, innate immunity using cells and molecules and acquired immunity. There are species differences of the respiratory immune system that influence the response to environmental challenges and pharmaceutical, industrial and agricultural compounds assessed in nonclinical safety testing and hazard identification. These differences influence the interpretation of respiratory system changes after exposure to these challenges and compounds in nonclinical safety assessment and hazard identification and their relevance to humans.

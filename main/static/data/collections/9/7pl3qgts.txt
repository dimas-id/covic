We have expressed the murine coronavirus haemagglutinin-esterase protein in a vaccinia virus/T7 RNA polymerase system. The levels of expression observed are significantly higher than those found in virus-infected cells. The expressed protein has both receptor-destroying (esterase) and receptor-binding (haemadsorption) activities. The use of this system will greatly facilitate analysis of the structure-function relationships of this protein.

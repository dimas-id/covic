Biological membranes owe their strength and low permeability to the phospholipid bilayers at their core. Membrane strength is determined by the energetics and dynamics of membrane pores, whose tension-dependent nucleation and growth leads to rupture. Creation of nanoscale membrane pores is central to exocytosis, trafficking and other processes fundamental to life that require breaching of secure plasma or organelle membranes, and is the basis for biotechnologies using drug delivery, delivery of genetic material for gene editing and antimicrobial peptides. A prevailing view from seminal electroporation and membrane rupture studies is that pore growth and bilayer rupture are controlled by macroscopically long-lived metastable defect states that precede fully developed pores. It was argued that defect nucleation becomes rate-limiting at high tensions, explaining the exponential tension-dependence of rupture times [E. Evans et al., Biophys. J. 85, 2342-2350 (2003)]. Here we measured membrane pore free energies and bilayer rupture using highly coarse-grained simulations that probe very long time scales. We find no evidence of metastable pore states. At lower tensions, small hydrophobic pores mature into large hydrophilic pores on the pathway to rupture, with classical tension dependence of rupture times. Above a critical tension membranes rupture directly from a small hydrophobic pore, and rupture times depend exponentially on tension. Thus, we recover the experimentally reported regimes, but the origin of the high tension exponential regime is unrelated to macroscopically long-lived pre-pore defects. It arises because hydrophilic pores cannot exist above a critical tension, leading to radically altered pore dynamics and rupture kinetics.

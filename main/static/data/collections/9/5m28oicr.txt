Biolistic delivery of DNA initiated plastid transformation research and still is the most widelyused approach to generate transplastomic lines in both algae and higher plants. The principal designof transformation vectors is similar in both phylogenetic groups. Although important additions tothe list of species transformed in their plastomes have been made in algae and in higher plants, thekey organisms in the area are still the two species, in which stable plastid transformation was initiallysuccessful, i.e., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and tobacco. Basicresearch into organelle biology has substantially benefited from the homologous recombination-basedcapability to precisely insert at predetermined loci, delete, disrupt, or exchange plastid genomesequences. Successful expression of recombinant proteins, including pharmaceutical proteins, hasbeen demonstrated in Chlamydomonas as well as in higher plants,where some interesting agronomic traits were also engineered through plastid transformation.

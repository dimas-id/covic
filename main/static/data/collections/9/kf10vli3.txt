PURPOSE To describe a technique in which percutaneous orbital atherectomy is used to debulk heavily calcified superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusions as an adjunct in patients undergoing angioplasty and stenting. TECHNIQUE The technique is demonstrated in a 62-year-old woman with a replaced right hepatic artery originating from an SMA occluded by densely calcified lesions. Via a left transbrachial approach, a 7-F MPA guide catheter was used to engage the ostium of the SMA, which was crossed using a catheter and guidewire. The calcified lesion was debulked using the 2-mm Diamondback 360Â° orbital atherectomy system. The wire was exchanged for a 0.014-inch filter wire and 0.018-inch guidewire. Using a 2-guidewire technique, the SMA was stented with a self-expanding stent for the distal lesion that crossed side branches and a balloon-expandable stent at the ostium. A 0.014-inch guidewire was placed into the replaced hepatic artery through a cell of the self-expanding stent, followed by deployment of a small balloon-expandable stent to address the residual lesion. CONCLUSION The use of orbital atherectomy to debulk occluded and heavily calcified SMA lesions may optimize the technical results with angioplasty and stenting.

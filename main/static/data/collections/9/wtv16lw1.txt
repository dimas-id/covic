We report a case of a patient treated by retroperitoneoscopic partial nephrectomy who developed nitrogenous subcutaneous emphysema (SCE) as a complication. The use of a nitrogen gas-pressured fibrin tissue adhesive applied as a spray caused excessively increased pressure in the closed retroperitoneal space and resulted in widespread SCE with protracted clinical course. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of nitrogenous SCE associated with pneumoperitoneum. The clinical significance of nitrogenous SCE is emphasized, and the risks associated with the use of fibrin glue as a spray during laparoscopic surgery are discussed.

Although little is known about moral injury in nonmilitary populations, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that moral injury's relevance extends beyond the battlefield. Health care providers are experiencing potentially morally injurious events that may violate their moral code or values, yet almost no research has been conducted on moral injury among health care providers to date. The purpose of this commentary is to describe the relevance of moral injury to health care providers and to spark a dialogue that motivates future research, prevention, and intervention.

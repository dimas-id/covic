Human adenoviruses (HAdV), in particular types 4 and 7, frequently cause acute respiratory disease (ARD) during basic military training. HAdV4 and HAdV7 vaccines reduced the ARD risk in U.S. military. It is important to identify other respiratory pathogens and assess their potential impact on military readiness. In 2002, during a period when the HAdV vaccines were not available, throat swabs were taken from trainees (n = 184) with respiratory infections at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Viral etiology was investigated initially with viral culture and neutralization assay and recently in this study by sequencing the viral isolates. Viral culture and neutralization assays identified 90 HAdV4 isolates and 27 additional cultures that showed viral cytopathic effects (CPE), including some with picornavirus-like CPE. Next-generation sequencing confirmed these results and determined viral genotypes, including 77 HAdV4, 4 HAdV3, 1 HAdV2, 17 coxsackievirus A21 (CAV21), and 1 enterovirus D68. Two samples were positive for both HAdV4 and CAV21. The identified genotypes are phylogenetically close to but distinct from those found during other years or in other military/non-military sites. HAdV4 is the predominant respiratory pathogen in unvaccinated military trainee. HAdV4 has temporal and demographic variability. CAV21 is a significant respiratory pathogen and needs to be evaluated for its current significance in military basic trainees.

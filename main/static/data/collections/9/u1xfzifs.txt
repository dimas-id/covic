Although the incidence is uncertain, some case reports suggest that COVID 19 infection is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We suggest starting prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for all patients hospitalized with a symptomatic infection with COVID-19, unless contraindicated, with enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily if creatinine clearance is greater than 30 ml/min.

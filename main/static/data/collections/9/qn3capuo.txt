PURPOSE OF REVIEW Nonhealing wounds are a significant problem in the healthcare system all over the world. The present review focuses on some recent developments and promising clinical progresses in wound management. RECENT FINDINGS New findings have increased our knowledge in several wound areas. In the treatment of wounds, the new trend in the wound device marked is to produce dressings containing compounds or drugs. This could be local antiseptics (silver, other antiseptics, honey) and pain relieving drugs such as ibuprofen and morphine. New treatments such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alfa (anti-TNFalpha) and Lactobacillus plantarum cultures have also been successfully used in hard to heal, atypical wounds. Knowledge on influencing factors as smoking and biofilm on the healing process has also been improved. Smoking results in delayed healing and increased risk of postoperative infection, whereas the role of biofilm is still at an exploratory level. Organizing models for optimal wound management are constantly being developed and refined. SUMMARY Recent knowledge on the importance of new dressing materials containing active substances, new treatments for atypical wounds, influencing factors on the healing process and organization in the wound area are increasingly been launched. This may in the coming years significantly improve the treatment outcome of problem wounds.

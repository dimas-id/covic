2-Benzoylamino-N-phenyl-benzamide derivatives (5a–h) were prepared from 2-phenyl-3,1-(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one 3 and substituted anilines 4a–h in the presence of a Keggin-type heteropolyacids series (H(3)PW(12)O(40)·13H(2)O; H(4)SiW(12)O(40)·13H(2)O; H(4)SiMo(12)O(40)·13H(2)O; and H(3)PMo(12)O(40)·13H(2)O) as catalysts without solvent and under microwave irradiation. We found that the use of H(3)PW(12)O(40)·13H(2)O acid coupled to microwave irradiation allowed obtaining a high-yielding reaction with a short time. The compound structures were established by (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized compounds exhibited an inhibition of the growth of bacteria and fungi.

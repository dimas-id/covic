INTRODUCTION Despite several benefits, patients are concerned that transvaginal cholecystectomy has a negative impact on sexual health. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the impact of transvaginal cholecystectomy on postoperative dyspareunia and sexual function. METHOD A literature search was performed in the PubMed and EMBASE databases. Papers reporting on postoperative dyspareunia, vaginal pain or discomfort, and sexual function were included. RESULTS Seventeen papers reported on dyspareunia and vaginal pain or discomfort. Two papers reported a rate of de novo dyspareunia of 3.8% and 12.5%, respectively. One study reported a nonsignificant reduction in painful sexual intercourse and the remaining 14 reported no incidents of dyspareunia. Eight papers reported on sexual function. One paper using a nonvalidated questionnaire found impaired sexual function. The papers that used validated questionnaires found no impairment of sexual function. CONCLUSIONS The risk of sexual dysfunction and dyspareunia after transvaginal cholecystectomy seems minimal. Well-designed studies using validated questionnaires are necessary to fully assess these types of complications.

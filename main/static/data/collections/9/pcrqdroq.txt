This paper proposes an enhanced natural language generation system combining the merits of both rule-based approaches and modern deep learning algorithms, boosting its performance to the extent where the generated textual content is capable of exhibiting agile human-writing styles and the content logic of which is highly controllable. We also come up with a novel approach called HMCU to measure the performance of the natural language processing comprehensively and precisely.

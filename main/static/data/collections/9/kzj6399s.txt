BACKGROUND Stenosis of the gastrojejunostomy after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common occurrence. We have previously presented data demonstrating that the use of a 25-mm circular stapler results in a decreased incidence of stenosis compared to the results of a 21-mm circular stapler (6.2 vs. 15.9%, P=0.03). One potential drawback of the larger-diameter stapler is the possibility for impaired long-term weight loss due to decreased restriction. We sought to determine the impact of circular stapler diameter on excess weight loss up to 5 years after surgery. METHODS Our initial technique for creating the gastrojejunostomy after laparoscopic gastric bypass involved the transgastric passage of a 21-mm circular stapler anvil (group 1). After a large initial experience, we switched to a 25-mm circular stapler (group 2). Follow-up data were entered prospectively into a computer database. Weight loss was recorded as percent of excess weight lost. Only patients with follow-up beyond 3 years postoperatively were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS Group 1 consisted of 145 consecutive patients and group 2 consisted of 116 consecutive patients. There was no significant difference in weight loss between the groups at 3 (66.1 vs. 65.2%, P=0.76, n=134), 4 (66.4 vs. 58.6%, P=0.1, n=66), and 5 years after gastric bypass (62.7 vs. 57.5%, P=0.24, n=75). CONCLUSIONS The use of a 25-mm circular stapler in laparoscopic gastric bypass operations instead of a 21-mm stapler does not result in significantly different long-term weight loss. The 25-mm stapler is preferred with our technique.

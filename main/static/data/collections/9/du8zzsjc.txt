Bladder dysfunction is one of the most common diseases that occur for a number of reasons and the current treatment modalities do not improve much in its recovery process. Tissue engineering in the last two decades has given great hope for the treatment of these disorders. In this study, a composite nanofibrous scaffold was fabricated from chitosan, collagen, and polyvinyl-alcohol polymer blend while curcumin incorporated in scaffold fibers. The scaffold supportive functions from smooth muscle cell differentiation were studied when human-induced pluripotent stem cells were cultured on the scaffolds under differentiation medium. Biocompatibility of the fabricated scaffold increased significantly by incorporating curcumin in the scaffold fibers, where protein adsorption, cell attachment, and viability were increased in the nanofiber/curcumin group compared with the other groups. In addition, the expression level of smooth muscle cell-related genes, including alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM-22a), Caldesmon1, and Calponin1in the stem cells upregulated while cultured in the presence of curcumin, but this increase was significantly improved while cells cultured on the nanofibers/curcumin. In addition, αSMA protein in the cells cultured on the nanofibers/curcumin expressed significantly higher than those cells cultured on the nanofibers without curcumin. It can be concluded that smooth muscle cell differentiation of the induced pluripotent stem cells promoted by curcumin and this promotion was synergistically improved while curcumin incorporated in the nanofibers.

BACKGROUND Older adults are more likely to access the emergency department, which suffers from overcrowding and congestion, for conditions that could potentially be treated in other settings. Older adults living in long-term care centers have access to healthcare resources in their residence, and several programs have been created with the intent of treating medical conditions on-site. The aim of this study is to identify and systematically review programs and interventions at long-term care centers that aim to treat patients on-site, avoiding unscheduled transportation to the emergency department. METHODS We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will perform a comprehensive search of Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov , PROSPERO, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials using a broad search strategy. Two independent reviewers will assess titles and abstracts against inclusion criteria, and we will further evaluate relevant full-text articles for inclusion. We will assess the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for included non-randomized studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials. We will present a narrative synthesis of results and complete a meta-analysis only if enough homogeneity is found. We will create funnel plots to evaluate possible reporting bias and use The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to assess the confidence in cumulative evidence. DISCUSSION As pressure on the healthcare system continues to rise, many areas are looking for alternative models of care. Several programs have been put in place in long-term care centers that seek to avoid transportation to the emergency department by providing enhanced care on-site. These programs are quite variable, and, to date, there is no standardized program or model of care. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION PROSPERO ( CRD42018091636 ).

Data on the structure, functions, regulation of activity, and expression of cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitate hydratase isoenzymes of mammals are reviewed. The role of aconitate hydratase and structurally similar iron-regulatory protein in maintenance of homeostasis of cell iron is described. Information on modifications of the aconitate hydratase molecule and changes in expression under oxidative stress is generalized. The role of aconitate hydratase in the pathogenesis of some diseases is considered.

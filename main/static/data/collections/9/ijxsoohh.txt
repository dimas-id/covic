The contribution of neurological symptomatology to morbidity and mortality after infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus (SARS CoV II), is ill-defined. We hereby present a case of a 57-year old male patient, in excellent physical condition, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), with respiratory distress duo to SARS CoV II-induced bilateral pneumonia. After two weeks at the ICU, with respiratory conditions improving, the patient developed lethal cerebral edema. This case advocates regular wake-up calls in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients for neurological (radiological) evaluation, to provide rapid diagnosis and a therapeutic window for fulminant central nervous system complications.

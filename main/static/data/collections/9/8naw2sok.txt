Two methods of immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence (ifa) and immunoperoxidase (pap) were used to demonstrate canine parvovirus (cpv) antigens in sections of canine tissue. Specific staining using ifa and pap was successful only in sections of fresh frozen tissue and formalin fixed/formol sublimate postfixed tissues respectively. A range of tissues was then taken at post mortem examination from a puppy which had been experimentally infected with cpv. Upon comparison, pap staining gave high resolution, a permanent preparation and clear intracellular localisation of antigen. ifa resulted in less defined localisation of antigen but the technique was simpler and more easily controlled.

After the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first reported case in Nigeria, the virus has spread to all sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Through different initiatives, SSA countries came together to create goal-driven taskforces to improve their responses against the virus. As COVID-19 raises major concerns over the scarcity of medical supplies, numbers of SSA countries adopted innovative solutions to fill in their shortage. This health crisis may come as an opportunity for SSA to demonstrate its pandemic readiness, responses, and reveal unknown potential.

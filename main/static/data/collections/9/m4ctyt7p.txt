BACKGROUND: COVID-19 in China was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31st 2019. The first cases were officially identified around December 8th 2019. The origin of COVID-19 is not confirmed, but half the early cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. The first two documented cases did not attend the seafood market. News reports, social media and informal sources may contain information about outbreaks prior to formal notification. OBJECTIVE: To identify early signals of pneumonia and/or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in China, prior to official recognition of the COVID 19 outbreak in December 2019, using open source data. METHODS: In order to capture early reports we searched an open source epidemic observatory, Epiwatch from 1st October2019 in China, for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or pneumonia related illnesses. Google and Chinese search engine Baidu were used. RESULTS: There was an increase in reports following the official notification of COVID 19 to WHO on December 31 2019, and a retracted report on December 26th 2019. A report of severe pneumonia was identified on November 22 2019 in Xiangyang, Index patient was retrospectively identified on 17 November. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of reports of a SARI outbreaks prior to December 31st, with a retracted report on December 26th suggests media censorship, given formal reports that cases began on December 8th. However, the findings also support relatively recent origin of COVID-19 in November 2019. The case reported on November 22nd was transferred to Wuhan approximately 1 incubation period before the first reported cases on December 8th, and should be further investigated, as only half of the early cases had exposure to the seafood market. It has since been reported that another case of COVID 19 has been retrospectively identified in Hubei on November 17th, confirming that the infection was present prior to December.

This chapter reviews common diseases of pinnipeds, including species in the Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), Phocidae (true seals), and Odobenidae (walrus) families. Much of the knowledge on pathologic conditions of pinnipeds comes from necropsies of stranded animals and those housed in captivity. As such, disease knowledge is biased toward species frequently housed in zoos and aquaria, those that strand more commonly, or those in which free-ranging populations are more easily accessible. Though historically systematic evaluations of wild populations have rarely been accomplished, in the past 10 years, with advances in marine mammal medicine and anesthesia, biologists and veterinarians more frequently completed live animal health field investigations to evaluate health and disease in free-ranging pinniped populations.

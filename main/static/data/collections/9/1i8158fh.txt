The nature of antigens in enteropathogenic animal viruses--coronavirus--an agent of transmissive gastroenteritis of pigs (TGE) and pig enterovirus of serotype VI was studied. Basing on the results of the histomorphometric study of the white spleen pulp under the individual introduction of viruses and in combination with the lymphoid chalone it was established that the developing immune response has a thymus-dependent induction mechanism. The pharmacological stimulation of the T-system of animals suffering from virus gastroenteritis provides a positive therapeutic effect. The selective stimulation of the animal T-system may be considered as a promising trend in therapy of intestinal infections and as one of the possible ways to increase the immune response to the antigens of viral vaccines.

The antiviral lectins griffithsin (GRFT), cyanovirin-N (CV-N), and scytovirin (SVN), which inhibit several enveloped viruses, including lentiviruses, were examined for their ability to inhibit entry mediated by Env proteins of delta- and gammaretroviruses. The glycoproteins from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) were resistant to the antiviral effects of all three lectins. For gammaretroviruses, CV-N inhibited entry mediated by some but not all of the envelopes examined, whereas GRFT and SVN displayed only little or no effect.

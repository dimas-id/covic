BACKGROUND Patients are at increased risk of disease recurrence after surgical treatment of Crohn's disease. Endoscopic detection of postoperative, ileo-colonic inflammation is well established, but the potential of pan-intestinal endoscopy is yet unknown. METHODS This prospective multicenter pilot study assessed the value of pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy using a colon capsule endoscope for the detection of inflammatory recurrence of Crohn´s disease. Patients who had been operatively treated for Crohn´s disease were included. Colon capsule endoscopy was performed 4-8 weeks (d1) and 4-8 months (d2) postoperatively together with ileo-colonoscopy at d2 using a modified Ruttgeerts index for evaluating disease activity. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were included into this study. At d1, significant disease activity (Ruttgeerts index ≥2) was detected in 3/16 (19%) of the patients. At d2, half of the patients (6/12) showed active disease, whereas ileo-colonoscopy revealed significant inflammation in 5/15 (33%). All patients rated as having active disease by ileo-colonoscopy had been revealed by PICE as well. These findings influenced the medical treatment in every case. CONCLUSION Pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy seems to be feasible in the postoperative surveillance of Crohn's disease. Disease activity is reliably detected. Especially, the findings in the small bowl might be a significant advantage in comparison to ileo-colonoscopy, as they can have significant impact on clinical management. Further studies with a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings and might lead to a replacement of the flexible ileo-colonoscopy with pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy in this indication in the future.

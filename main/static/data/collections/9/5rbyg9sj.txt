A 43-yr-old man with left lumbar pain was diagnosed as having a growing renal angiomyolipoma at imaging. TriPort laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) without ischemia was performed. The TriPort was inserted through a 4-cm pararectal incision, and with the use of 5-mm instruments, left-unclamped NSS was performed and completed in 165 min (blood loss: 180 ml). Postoperative treatment was uneventful with favorable short-term outcomes and high patient satisfaction at 12-mo follow-up. This technique should be attempted in highly selected patients with favorable tumor anatomic features and performed by an experienced laparoscopic team.

Ribosomal frameshifting, a translational mechanism used during retroviral replication, involves a directed change in reading frame at a specific site at a defined frequency. Such programmed frameshifting at the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) gag-pro shift site requires two mRNA signals: a heptanucleotide shifty sequence and a pseudoknot structure positioned downstream. Using in vitro translation assays and enzymatic and chemical probes for RNA structure, we have defined features of the pseudoknot that promote efficient frameshifting. Heterologous RNA structures, e.g. a hairpin, a tRNA or a synthetic pseudoknot, substituted downstream of the shifty site fail to promote frameshifting, suggesting that specific features of the MMTV pseudoknot are important for function. Site-directed mutations of the MMTV pseudoknot indicate that the pseudoknot junction, including an unpaired adenine nucleotide between the two stems, provides a specific structural determinant for efficient frameshifting. Pseudoknots derived from other retroviruses (i.e. the feline immunodeficiency virus and the simian retrovirus type 1) also promote frameshifting at the MMTV gag-pro shift site, dependent on the same structure at the junction of the two stems.

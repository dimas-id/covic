In October 1995, after realising that the strategy of immunising only individuals at high risk for hepatitis B infections did not influence the incidence, the STIKO (permanent Committee on Vaccination at the Robert Koch-Institute) recommended the general immunisation of all infants and children. The number of paediatric doses of recombinant vaccine sold between1995 and 2000 shows that HBV vaccination is widely accepted by paediatricians. The cases of suspected adverse reactions reported from the German spontaneous pharmacovigilance system are summarised and discussed.

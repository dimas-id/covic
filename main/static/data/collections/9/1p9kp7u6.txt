An 83-year-old woman who complained of right lower limb discomfort was diagnosed with a right obturator hernia by CT scan. On examination, she had a soft and flat abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation. The Howship-Romberg sign was present. She had a history of vasospastic angina and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and took aspirin and dipyridamole until she was admitted to the hospital. Exploratory laparoscopy identified a spontaneously reduced small bowel from the right obturator canal, but there were no signs of ischemic and necrotic bowel. The patient underwent SILS for totally extraperitoneal obturator hernia repair without a dissection balloon. The patient recovered without perioperative complications such as hemorrhage and thrombotic episodes. She remains well, and CT scans showed no signs of obturator hernia recurrence at the 7-month follow-up.

INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is a common, well-established procedure, but no consensus regarding selection of the gastrojejunostomy (GJ) technique has been reached, and standardization of this precise technique is far from being achieved. AIM To compare circular-stapled and linear-stapled GJ in LRYGB in terms of operative time and postoperative complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective case-control study compared the perioperative and postoperative outcomes of LRYGB with a circular-stapled (LRYGB-CS) versus linear-stapled (LRYGB-LS) gastrojejunostomy. All patients, operated on in two academic referral care centers for bariatric surgery, were enrolled from April 2013 to June 2016. 457 patients were included (255 and 202 respectively in the LRYGB-CS and LRYGB-LS groups). After matching the groups for age, sex, body mass index, arterial hypertension, and presence of type 2 diabetes in a 1 : 1 ratio, 99 patients were enrolled in each. RESULTS The total operative time was longer in the LRYGB-LS group (140 vs. 85 min, p < 0.001). The postoperative hemorrhage and wound infection rates were lower in the LRYGB-LS group (2.1% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.021, and 1.0% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.011). The readmission rates were comparable (8.2% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.593). There was no significant difference in the incidence of gastrojejunostomy leakage, stricture, port-site hernia, or marginal ulcer. CONCLUSIONS Both anastomosis types for LRYGB are safe and have low and comparable risks of postoperative complications. After LRYGB-CS, postoperative bleeding and wound infections are slightly more frequent; however, the operative time is shorter.

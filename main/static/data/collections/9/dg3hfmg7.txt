OBJECTIVES To report the short- and long-term outcomes and recurrence rate in dogs treated for apparently unilateral perineal hernia with bilateral herniorrhaphy, castration, colopexy, vas deferens pexy with or without cystopexy in single-stage procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-one client-owned dogs with apparently unilateral perineal hernia were included. Perineal hernias were repaired bilaterally, incorporating internal obturator muscle transposition and the sacro-tuberal ligament, combined with colopexy, vas deferens pexy with or without cystopexy. Preoperative pattern of defaecation, pattern of micturition and rectal alignment were recorded. Surgical time, bilateral surgical perineal findings, postoperative complications, short-, middle- and long-term (>24 months) scores and recurrence rate were documented. RESULTS A hernia with ectopic tissue and weakness of the pelvic diaphragm was identified bilaterally in all dogs despite the unilateral clinical presentation. The procedure combination was achieved uneventfully in all dogs in 56 to 113 minutes (mean 73 minutes). Complication rate was low, consisting mostly of urinary disorders, most of which resolved within a few days. In all, 93% of dogs were free of clinical signs related to perineal hernia at long-term follow-up (mean 27 months). Recurrence rate was 0%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Our surgical findings suggest that perineal hernia in dogs might be considered a bilateral disease, even when the presentation is of apparently unilateral signs. Recurrence is rare following bilateral herniorrhaphy combined with colopexy and deferens pexy with or without cystopexy.

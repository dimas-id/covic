BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the gold standard bariatric procedure. Typically, the procedure necessitates five to seven small skin incisions for trocar placement. The senior author (AA Saber) has developed a three-trocar approach for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS Sixteen patients underwent triple-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between May 2009 and August 2009. The same surgeon performed all surgical interventions. The umbilicus was the main point of entry for all patients and the same operative technique and perioperative protocol were used in all patients. RESULTS A total of sixteen triple-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses were performed. The procedures were successfully performed in all patients. Mean operating time was 145.4 min. None of the patients required conversion to an open procedure. There were no mortalities or post-operative technical complications noted during the immediate post-operative period. CONCLUSION Three trocar laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is safe, technically feasible and reproducible. This technique may be considered a "precursor" to single-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

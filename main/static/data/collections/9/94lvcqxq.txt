We present the case of a 71-year-old man who, despite becoming asymptomatic after having some mild symptoms of COVID-19, had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected for 37 days after onset, from his concentrated and purified saliva specimens using sugar chain-immobilized gold nanoparticles. It was suggested that the early morning saliva specimens were more likely to show positive results than those obtained later in the day.

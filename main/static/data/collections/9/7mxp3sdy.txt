COVID-19 can severely affect pregnant women Furthermore, issues regarding vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are emerging In patients and neonates who are showing symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, real-time polymerase chain reaction of nasal and throat swabs, sputum, and feces is performed to detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction of vaginal swabs, amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, neonatal blood, or breast milk for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 did not show substantial results Viremia was present in 1% of adult patients who were showing symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 Here, we reviewed 12 articles published between Feb 10, 2020, and April 4, 2020, that reported on 68 deliveries and 71 neonates with maternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy To determine whether infection occurred congenitally or perinatally, perinatal exposure, mode of delivery, and time interval from delivery to the diagnosis of neonatal infection were considered Neonates with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are usually asymptomatic In 4 cases, a diagnostic test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was performed within 48 hours of life Furthermore, detection rates of real-time polymerase chain reaction and the interpretation of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies levels in cord and neonatal blood were discussed in relation with the immaturity of the fetal and neonatal immune system Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc

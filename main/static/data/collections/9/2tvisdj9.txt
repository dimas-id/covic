We studied the efficacy of umbilical cord blood cells in the therapy of treatment-resistant depressive states in women. Concentrated umbilical cord blood cells were administered in a dose of 250 millions cells (4 injections at 1-week intervals). The control group received placebo. In both groups, reduction of depressive disorders and the decrease in hypothymia severity were observed. Infusions of cell concentrate contributed to delayed correction of treatment resistance and reduced the severity of depression to moderate. In the main group, significant, persistent, and long-term positive dynamics was observed in the cognitive sphere. The therapeutic potential of umbilical cord blood cell concentrate can be used to overcome treatment resistance formed in depressive patients.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been an attractive treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Long-term exposure to the PD solution creates functional and morphological alterations, and these alterations diminish the efficacy of PD. It is important to establish an evaluation of the changes in PD patients and strategies for the prevention of PD damage and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). We determined the relationship between clinical findings and macroscopic morphological findings by laparoscopy in patients receiving PD. Macroscopic intraperitoneal findings were recorded at the PD catheter removal in 23 PD patients. We examined macroscopic morphological findings such as fibrin deposition, peritoneal turbidity, vasculopathy, adhesion and calcification in both parietal and visceral peritoneum of upper and lower peritoneal cavities, and assessed the score semi-quantitatively. We then evaluated the relationship between the morphological score and clinical findings, especially observational parts and findings in EPS patients. The total macroscopic score increased with PD duration. Peritoneal turbidity, fibrin deposition, and calcification were observed in the whole peritoneal cavity. Scores of fibrin deposition, turbidity, and calcification increased with PD duration. Vasculopathy in the parietal peritoneum was more serious compared with that in the visceral peritoneum, but there was no difference in the vasculopathy between the upper and lower areas. A characteristic of the macroscopic findings in EPS patients was peritoneal calcification in this study. It appears that macroscopic findings using laparoscopy is significant in evaluating the degree of the peritoneum damage and predicting EPS development.

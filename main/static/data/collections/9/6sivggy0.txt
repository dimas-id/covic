Ammonia has been considered the contaminant primarily responsible for respiratory disease in poultry. Even though it can cause tracheal lesions, its adverse effects on the trachea have not been sufficiently studied. The present study investigated tracheal changes in Arbor Acres broilers (Gallus gallus) induced by high concentration of ammonia using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteome analysis. In total, 3,706 proteins within false discovery rate of 1% were identified, including 119 significantly differentially expressed proteins. Functional analysis revealed that proteins related to immune response and muscle contraction were significantly enriched. With respect to the immune response, up-regulated proteins (like FGA) were pro-inflammatory, while down-regulated proteins participated in antigen processing and antigen presenting (like MYO1G), immunoglobulin and cathelicidin production (like fowlicidin-2), and immunodeficiency (like PTPRC). Regarding muscle contraction, all differentially expressed proteins (like TPM1) were up-regulated. An over-expression of mucin, which is a common feature of airway disease, was also observed. Additionally, the transcriptional alterations of 6 selected proteins were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Overall, proteomic changes suggested the onset of airway obstruction and diminished host defense in trachea after ammonia exposure. These results may serve as a valuable reference for future interventions against ammonia toxicity.

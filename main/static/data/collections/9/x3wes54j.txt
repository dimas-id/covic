Abstract In the past decade, studies into the way in which intracellular bacterial pathogens hijack and subvert their hosts have provided many important insights into regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility, in addition to increasing our understanding of the infection process. Viral pathogens, however, may ultimately unlock more cellular secrets as they are even more dependent on their hosts during their life cycle.

The nine levels of Stepped Care 2.0 are designed to maximize choice. They also facilitate care adaptations as needs, motivation and readiness evolve. Their arrangement on dimensions of stakeholder engagement, and both treatment intensity and client autonomy, enables full transparency. Providers and help-seekers are able to see the forest and the trees. The steps support more meaningful organization of both new and existing resources. They can be tailored to the needs and unique circumstances of any jurisdiction. Each of the nine steps is defined to incorporate recovery values and principles in order to maximize efficiency and client empowerment.

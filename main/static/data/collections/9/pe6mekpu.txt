The Italian government, noted the seriousness of the pandemic in progress, is considering resorting to digital contact tracing, i.e. the use of citizens' mobile devices for the mapping and tracing of subjects who come into contact with infected people. The approach, successfully used in South Korea, is to provide the authorities with a tool to have access to the movements of infected people or those who may have been exposed to infection, to be able to intervene promptly, limiting the spread of the infection. However, this project must not become a gigantic identification tool, but must be inspired by general principles of transparency, proportionality and consistency between the objective pursued and the tools used. In particular, the principle of safeguarding privacy must be respected, protecting personal data as much as possible, to defeat the pandemic with appropriate measures for a democratic society.

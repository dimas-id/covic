BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-Cov-2, resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome, with high potential of spreading and infecting humans worldwide. Since December 2019, when the virus was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially and extrarespiratory symptoms including neurologic symptoms are increasingly highlighted. METHODS: Given the high and increasing number of publications reporting neurologic involvements of SARS-Cov-2, we thought that providing an update for neurologic complications of COVID-19 would be useful for physicians and especially young trainees in neurology and neurosurgery. Indeed, in this review we discuss several neurologic aspects reported in the literature to date including the evidence and pathways of neuroinvasion in COVID-19 and the main neurologic disorders reported in the literature to date, as well as future perspectives and the potential long-term consequence of current neuroinfection in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Currently, there is convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, can affect the nervous system, with damage and neurologic alterations. These neurologic disorders are grouped into several categories, ranging from nonspecific and moderate symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections. Severe neurologic symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factors and are associated with poor outcome. However, most COVID-19 patients exhibit only minor or mild neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Management of COVID-19 patients should include early clinical, radiologic, and laboratory neurologic assessment, with a close follow-up, especially in severe forms. Future studies should assess late and long-term consequences of current COVID-19 patients with neurologic involvement.

To clarify the binding properties of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein and its viral RNA for the encapsidation, morphogenesis, and replication of HCV, the specific interaction of HCV core protein with its genomic RNA synthesized in vitro was examined in an in vivo system. The positive-sense RNA from the 5' end to nucleotide (nt) 2327, which covers the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and a part of the coding region of HCV structural proteins, interacted with HCV core protein, while no interaction was observed in the same region of negative-sense RNA and in other regions of viral and antiviral sense RNAs. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) exists around the 5'UTR of HCV; therefore, the interaction of the core protein with this region of HCV RNA suggests that there is some effect on its cap-independent translation. Cells expressing HCV core protein were transfected with reporter RNAs consisting of nt 1 to 709 of HCV RNA (the 5'UTR of HCV and about two-thirds of the core protein coding regions) followed by a firefly luciferase gene (HCV07Luc RNA). The translation of HCV07Luc RNA was suppressed in cells expressing the core protein, whereas no significant suppression was observed in the case of a reporter RNA possessing the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus followed by a firefly luciferase. This suppression by the core protein occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of the E1 envelope protein of HCV or beta-galactosidase did not suppress the translation of both HCV and EMCV reporter RNAs. We then examined the regions that are important for suppression of translation by the core protein and found that the region from nt 1 to 344 was enough to exert this suppression. These results suggest that the HCV core protein interacts with viral genomic RNA at a specific region to form nucleocapsids and regulates the expression of HCV by interacting with the 5'UTR.

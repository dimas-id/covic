Abstract This article reviews in a historical perspective and by means of documented examples the scientific principles relevant to the concept and effectiveness of quarantine, the logistic, economic, and political barriers to its correct implementation through time, and the health impact of local and large-scale quarantine. Quarantine is overall one of the oldest and most disseminated and, despite its limits, most effective health measures elaborated by mankind. The evidence-based history of medicine and evidence-based modern epidemiology indicate that the implementation of correct quarantine procedures is today still feasible and useful provided that a proactive collaboration is operative among those concerned and that the measures are tailored according to geographical, social, and health conditions.

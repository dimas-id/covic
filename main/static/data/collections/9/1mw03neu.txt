In late December 2019, China reported cases of respiratory illness in humans that involved a novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2. On March 20, 2020, the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in Brazil was diagnosed, and by now, we present the report on the first case of COVID among transplant recipients in our country. A liver and kidney transplant patient with SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia without respiratory failure was treated in a clinical multimodal strategy consisting of symptomatic support therapy, immunosuppression reduction, use of anti‐coronavirus drugs and heparin leading to a progressive improvement of patient symptoms till discharge. The authors also present a comprehensive review of published cases.

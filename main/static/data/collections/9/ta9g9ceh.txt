Considering the number of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. A number of publications regarding the course of COVID-19 infection and its relation to comorbidities have appeared since December 2019, when the first cases of atypical pneumonia were diagnosed in China. There is evidence of the higher susceptibility and higher risk of unfavourable outcomes in comorbid patients, including those with hypertension. We summarize the available data on the association with the COVID-19 infection and arterial hypertension, and discuss potential risks, e. g. the risks and benefits of antihypertensive therapy (in particular, related to the blockers of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) and the management approaches.

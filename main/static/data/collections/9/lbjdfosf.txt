The production process is often accompanied by a lot of disturbances, which make it difficult for flexible job shop to execute production according to the original job plan. It is necessary to dynamically adjust the production plan according to real-time conditions. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-objective dynamic scheduling model. In this model, scroll window technology and NSGAII algorithm is adopted to adapt the dynamic production evironment. A specific chromosome retention strategy and a variable objective selection mechanism are designed to ensure that the proposed model can select different objectives according to different disturbance events to solve the optimal solution. Finally, a case test is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.

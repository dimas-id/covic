Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic affecting more than 3 million people in over 170 countries, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths; 35-40% of patients and deaths are in the United States. The COVID-19 crisis is placing an enormous burden on healthcare in the United States, including residency and fellowship training programs. The balance between mitigation, training and education, and patient care are the ultimate determinants of the role of cardiology fellows-in-training (FIT) during the COVID-19 crisis. On March 24, 2020 the Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) issued a formal response to the pandemic crisis and described a framework for operation of GME programs. Guidance for deployment of cardiology FIT during the COVID-19 crisis is based on the principles of a medical mission, and adherence to preparation, protection, and support of our FIT. The purpose of this review is to describe our departmental strategic deployment of C-FIT using the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) framework for pandemic preparedness.

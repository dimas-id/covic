OBJECTIVE To evaluate the care status of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with long-term use of tracheostomy tube by caregivers of ALS patients. METHODS A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaires to ALS patients and their caregivers. All measurements were performed by two visiting nurses. For statistical analysis, SPSS ver. 22.0 and Mann-Whitney U test on non-normal distribution were used. RESULTS In total, 19 patients (15 males and 4 females) and their caregivers participated in the survey. In the case of patients, the average duration of care was 5.9±3.7 years, and the mean periods of illness and tracheostomy were 5.3±3.2 years and 3.0±2.6 years, respectively. Replacement intervals were 14 days in 11 patients, 7 days in 4 patients, 28 days in 2 patients, and 21 days in 1 patient. One patient was unable to provide an accurate replacement interval. Eighteen (99%) caregivers had experience of adding volume to a cuff without pressure measure in the following instances: due to patients' needs in 7 cases, air leakage in 7 cases, and no reason in 4 cases. Mean pressure of tracheostomy cuff was 40±9.4 cmH2O, and air volume of tracheostomy cuff was 6.7±3.2 mL, but real mean volume was 7.0±2.9 mL. The number of suctioning for airway clearance was a mean 27.5±18.2 times a day. CONCLUSION According to this survey, we notice that almost all the patients and caregivers had an erroneous idea about cuff volume and pressure. Moreover, education and long-term professional care of tracheostomy cannot be overemphasized in this manner.

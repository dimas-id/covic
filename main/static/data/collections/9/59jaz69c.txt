OBJECTIVE To get the cDNA clones which cover the whole genome of SARS-CoV PUMC2 strain. METHODS Using the SARS-CoV PUMC2 strain genomic RNA as the template, the cDNA fragments were amplified by RT-PCR, the PCR products were further purified and ligated into the pGEM-T vector, and all the clones obtained were sequenced. RESULTS The cDNA clones which cover the whole genome of SARS-CoV PUMC2 strain were obtained. CONCLUSIONS These cDNAs can be provided for the function study of SARS-CoV proteins and the construction of full-length infectious cDNA clone of SARS-CoV.

Methanobrevibacter smithii is the main human methanogen almost always found in the digestive tract of adults. Yet, the age at which M. smithii establishes itself as part of the developing intestinal microflora remains unknown. In order to gain insight into this, we developed a polyphasic approach, including microscopic observation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing detection, identification and culture, to isolate and genotype M. smithii in one-day-old newborns' gastric juice specimens. In the presence of negative controls, 50/50 (100%) prospectively analysed newborn gastric juice specimens were PCR-positive for methanogens, all identified as M. smithii by sequencing. We succeeded in cultivating M. smithii in 35/50 (70%) newborn gastric juice specimens, while 15/50 specimens remained sterile. Further, M. smithii was observed by direct microscopic investigation using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Multispacer sequence typing found one of seven different genotypes per specimen, these genotypes having all been previously described in adult human stools. Methanobrevibacter smithii is an early inhabitant of the human stomach, colonising the gastric mucosa just after birth, and the mother's gut microbiota is a probable source of colonisation.

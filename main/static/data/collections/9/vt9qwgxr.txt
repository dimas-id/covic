Infectious respiratory diseases in man and in domestic animals are characterized by the presence of a large number of different microorganisms: viruses, bacterias, mycoplasmas. It is therefore necessary to stimulate non-specific defense mechanisms in the lung and especially alveolar macrophages (AM). These cells, located in the alveolar air-spaces, play a major role in the lung clearance mechanisms and exert antibacterial, antiviral and antitumoral activities. Activation of alveolar macrophages was studied in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lymphokines or mycobacterial derivatives (MDP). Rodent alveolar macrophages were rendered cytotoxic by in vitro exposure to LPS, free MDP or liposome-encapsulated MDP derivatives. In vivo, intravenously administered liposomes containing lipophilic MDP derivatives induced cytotoxic alveolar macrophages and protected mice against the development of pulmonary metastases.

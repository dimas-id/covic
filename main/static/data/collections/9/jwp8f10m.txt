The first wave of the coronavirus pandemic is waning in many countries. Some of them are starting to lift the confinement measures adopted to control it, but there is considerable uncertainty about if it is too soon and it may cause a second wave of the epidemic. To explore this issue, I fitted a SEIR model with time-dependent transmission and mortality rates to data from Spain and Germany as contrasting case studies. The model reached an excellent fit to the data. I then simulated the post-confinement epidemic under several scenarios. The model shows that (in the absence of a vaccine) a second wave is likely inevitable and will arrive soon, and that a strategy of adaptive confinement may be effective to control it. The model also shows that just a few days delay in starting the confinement may have caused and excess of thousands of deaths in Spain.

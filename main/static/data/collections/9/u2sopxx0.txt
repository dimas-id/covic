Air filtration in various implementations has become a critical intervention in managing the spread of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). However, proper deployment of air filtration has been hampered by insufficient understanding of its principles. These misconceptions led to uncertainty about the effectiveness of air filtration at arresting potentially infectious aerosol particles. A correct understanding of how air filtration works is critical to further decision-making regarding its use in the management of the COVID-19 spread. The issue is significant because recent research evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 can remain airborne longer and travel farther than anticipated earlier in the COVID-19 spread, albeit with dropping concentrations and viability. While SARS-CoV-2 virions are around 60 - 140 nm in diameter, larger respiratory droplets and air pollution particles (> 1 Âµm) have been found to harbor the virions. Taking particles that could carry SARS-CoV-2 out of the air is possible using air filtration, reliant on natural or mechanized movement of air. Among various types of air filters, high efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) filters have been recommended, other types being less or more effective and, correspondingly, easier or harder to move air through. Masks, respirators, air filtration modules and other dedicated equipment can serve as an essential intervention in the management of the COVID-19 spread. It is critical to consider the mechanisms of air filtration and understand how aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 virions interact with filter media to determine the best practices for the use of air filtration in the management of the spread of COVID-19.

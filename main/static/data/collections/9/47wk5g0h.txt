We developed an alternative steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) rabbit model using a combination of a single injection of low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and three subsequent injections of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone (MPS).The usefulness of this experimental ON model was evaluated using both conventional and advanced bio-imaging techniques, including contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI and a high-resolution micro-CT. Details on establishment of methodology are described, which were adopted into an efficacy study on a herbal Epimedium-derived phytoestrogenic extract (HEPE) developed for prevention of steroid-associated ON using an established rabbit model. The underlying mechanisms of HEPE for prevention of steroid-associated ON were found to be associated with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular bone marrow lipid deposition, the two known mechanistic pathways in pathogenesis of ON. Our experimental results provide for potential clinical trials or applications of HEPE in the prevention of ON among hig-hrisk patients undergoing steroid treatment.

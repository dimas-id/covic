Wastes generated in healthcare facilities have been discussed and the World Health Organization has proposed a guideline for controlling the spread of the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, waste management outside the generating facility should be discussed in more detail, taking into account factors such as virus resistance, differences in waste management systems and the climatic conditions in each affected region. Patients infected by human coronavirus being treated at home are generating infected waste possibly discarded as domestic waste, which can pose risks to workers and the environment, depending on the conditions of transport and disposal. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus may be increased by inadequate waste management, highlighting poor handling conditions associated with inappropriate use of personal protective equipment and other unfavourable conditions presented mainly in developing countries.

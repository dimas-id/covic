The conscious promotion of health by an appropriate, balanced diet has become an important social request. Vegetable thereby possesses a special importance due to its high vitamin, mineral and dietary fibre content. Major progress has been made over the past few years in the transformation of vegetables. The expression of several genes has been inhibited by sense gene suppression, and new traits caused by new gene constructs are stably inherited. This chapter reviews advances in various traits such as disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, quality improvement, pharmaceutical and industrial application. Results are presented from most important vegetable families, like Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Chenopodiaceae and Liliaceae. Although many research trends in this report are positive, only a few transgenic vegetables have been released from confined into precommercial testing or into use.

Human bocavirus (HBoV), a newly cloned human virus of the genus Bocavirus, was detected by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab samples (8 of 318; 5.7%) collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections. HBoV may be one of the causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections in young children.

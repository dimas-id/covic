Abstract The rapid spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically impacted financial markets all over the world. It has created an unprecedented level of risk, causing investors to suffer significant loses in a very short period of time. This paper aims to map the general patterns of country-specific risks and systemic risks in the global financial markets. It also analyses the potential consequence of policy interventions, such as the USâ€™ decision to implement a zero-percent interest rate and unlimited quantitative easing (QE), and how these policies may introduce further uncertainties into global financial markets.

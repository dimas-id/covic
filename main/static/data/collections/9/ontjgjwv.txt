Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) is an effective strategy to inactivate pathogenic and resistant microbes. However, pan-microbial photoinactivation has hardly achieved. In this manuscript, we built anti-microbial PSs based on 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl BODIPY (2I-BDP) using anchoring strategy through modifications on boron atom with bis-cationic moieties. With appropriate bis-cationic anchoring, we could achieve effective PACT for pan-microbial photoinactivation via straight forward modifications. Our studies suggested that integration of an efficient photosensitizer, good amphiphilicity, as well as tight interaction with microbial membrane could be essential for effective PACT.

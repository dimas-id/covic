BACKGROUND After thoracic surgery, adhesions between the pleura can cause substantial complications. This study investigated the effectiveness of a novel membrane utilizing surface water induction technology to prevent adhesions. METHODS Eight beagles were divided into an experimental group (five males) and a control group (three females). The experimental group underwent thoracotomy on both the left and right sides of the chest. Both sides received the membrane, and the membrane on one side was glued to the pleura using tissue adhesive. The control group underwent thoracotomy only on the left side. Two weeks postoperatively, all dogs were sacrificed and adhesions were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS Severe adhesion was seen between the parietal and visceral pleura in all control dogs, whereas the experimental group showed minor adhesion in only one dog on one side. CONCLUSIONS Our novel anti-adhesive membrane appeared highly effective in preventing postthoracotomy pleural adhesions.

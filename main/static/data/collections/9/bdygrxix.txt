INTRODUCTION Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetic autoimmune disorder characterised by a permanent sensitivity to the gluten contained in some grains. Certain patient groups are considered high risk for the development of CD, including, but not limited to, those with chromosomal disorders such as Turner syndrome (TS). Here, we present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to comprehensively summarise the literature, and quantitatively estimate the weighted strength of the association between TS and CD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Our protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 guidelines. We will search PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase databases for relevant articles. Variant and broad search terms will be selected for identifying epidemiological studies reporting on the crude and/or adjusted association between TS and CD. Retrieved citations will be screened, and data from the eligible research reports against specific eligibility criteria will be extracted. We will then assess the risk of bias associated with the eligible studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The overall weighted strength of the pooled association will be quantified using the random-effects model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will use data from published literature; hence, ethical approval will not be needed. The resulting review will be the first to produce a comprehensive synthesis of the strength of the association between TS and CD. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal as well as in local and international conferences and symposiums. Results dissemination would help healthcare providers and policy-makers to make informed decisions regarding the diagnosis and management of CD in high-risk individuals.

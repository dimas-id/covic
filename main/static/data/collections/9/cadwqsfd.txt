Abstract Severe pneumonia and ARDS caused by human adenovirus B21 infections (HAdV-B21) is a rare, but a devastating disease with rapid progression to multiorgan failure and death. However, only a few cases were reported so far. Infections appear associated with increased disease severity and higher mortality in infected critically ill patients. Possible factors contributing to infection are underlying psychiatric disease resulting in institutionalization of respective patients, and polytoxicomania. Controlled data on the therapy of severe adenovirus infections are lacking and remains experimental. In conclusion, data on HAdV-B21 infections causing severe pneumonia or ARDS are scarce. Controlled clinical trials on the therapy of adenovirus pneumonia are non existent and thus there is no established therapy so far. ICU physicians should be aware of this potentially devastating disease and further studies are needed.

Globally, the COVID‐19 pandemic has already led to major increases in unemployment and is expected to lead to unprecedented increases in poverty and food insecurity, as well as poor health and nutrition outcomes. Families where young children, pregnant and lactating women live need to be protected against the ongoing protracted pandemic and the aftershocks that are very likely to follow for years to come. The future wellbeing of the vast majority of the world now depends on reconfiguringthe current ineffective food, nutrition, health and social protection systems to ensure food security for all. Because food, nutrition and social protection are intimately linked with health in a multidirectional way, it is essential that that we fully address global and local food, health care, and social protection systems and the inter‐relationship among them. Implementation science research will be needed to fill in the current major gaps. Not doing so will not only put the development of individuals at further risk, but also negatively impact on the development potential of entire nations and ultimately our Planet.

Recent studies suggest that infectious viruses and particularly persisting viral RNAs often exist as diverse populations or "quasispecies". We have developed an approach to characterize populations of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) generated during persistent infection which has allowed us to begin to address the role of the viral quasispecies in MHV pathogenesis. We analyzed the population of persisting viral RNAs using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) of the S1 "hypervariable" region of the spike gene followed by differential colony hybridization to identify spike deletion variants (SDVs) from acute and persistently infected mice. Sequence analysis revealed that mice with the most severe chronic paralysis harbored the most complex quasispecies. Mapping of the SDVs to the predicted RNA secondary structure of the spike RNA revealed that an isolated stem loop structure is frequently deleted. Overall, these results are consistent with high frequency recombination at sites of RNA secondary structure contributing to expansion of the viral quasispecies and persisting viral pathogenesis.

Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on infections caused by rubella, reoviridae, retro, Norwalk and coronaviruses. High incidence of acute gastroenteritis caused by rotaviruses calls for prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Although no vaccine is presently available, it seems likely that vaccines will be developed in the next few years. There are also several rotavirus enzymes useful as targets for antiviral drugs. However, no antiviral drugs have shown therapeutic effects against rotavirus infections. The newly discovered human retrovirus (HTLV) has not yet been investigated in such detail as to predict the usefulness of vaccine or antiviral drugs. Several compounds are known to inhibit other retrovirus enzymes but the implication of this for chemotherapy of HTLV infection is unknown at present. The possibility and need for vaccination or chemotherapy against Norwalk virus and related agents is unclear. Very little work has been carried out to date with human coronaviruses, either from the point of view of vaccine development or specific antivirals. Both approaches may be usefully investigated in the future. Genetic cloning may be particularly useful for development of inactivated vaccines because the virus itself would be difficult to replicate and purify in large quantities for conventional vaccines.

Abstract Experimental and clinical evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that CD8+ T lymphocytes aimed at suppressing HIV replication in infected CD4+ T cells may have an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS by directly causing a decrease in CD4+ T lymphocyte numbers. Possible models to test this hypothesis are discussed.

To warrant potential clinical testing, the equine anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) F(ab')(2) requires evaluation in as many animal models as possible. In this study, we established a new animal model, the Chinese hamster, susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV could propagate effectively and sustain high levels for 1 wk in animal lungs. All animals were protected from SARS-CoV infection in preventive settings. Further, when used therapeutically this antibody led to an approximately 4-log(10) decrease in viral burden in infected animal lungs. The pathological changes in lungs correlated closely with the dose of antibody administered. The excellent preventive and therapeutic roles of equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')(2) in several animal models, including the novel Chinese hamster model described in this study, have provided exciting data concerning its potential clinical study.

Between 1986 and 1991, 251 fecal samples were examined. Viruses were found in 48% of stools, namely adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, rotaviruses, and particles reassembling the Norwalk agent (74% of positive cases). All morphological types of viruses normally associated with human gastroenteritis are present in Quebec, its vicinity, and in the east of the Province. The interpretation of specimens is complicated by the presence of a wide variety of biological structures including bacteriophages. Electron microscopy is the method of choice for identification of the whole range of gastroenteritis viruses.

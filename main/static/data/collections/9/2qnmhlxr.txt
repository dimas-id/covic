BACKGROUND Bile leakage is a serious complication of liver resection, and its treatment is very time-consuming. In open liver resection, Glisson's sheaths are usually disconnected by ligation to the extent possible during the parenchyma dissection. However, in laparoscopic surgery, the ligation, suture, and hemostasis are more difficult than in open surgery. For this reason, in laparoscopic liver resection, liver parenchyma dissection is generally accomplished using electrosurgical or stapling devices. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to verify the authenticity of electrosurgical devices attached an automatic irrigation function (AI) and stapling devices for laparoscopic liver parenchymal dissection. METHODS Four devices were used for liver parenchymal dissection in laparoscopic hepatic wedge resection, in pigs: monopolar high-frequency electric cautery attached AI (MCI) (n = 6), bipolar high-frequency electric cautery attached AI (BCI) (n = 6), bipolar tissue sealing system (LigaSure) attached AI (BSI) and an endoscopic stapling device (ECHELON FLEX ENDOPATH) (ES). In each group, burst pressures were tested using an electronic manometer, paying special attention to the location (s) of the first disruption (s). The dissected tissues were examined histologically. RESULTS Pressures used in electrosurgical devices attach AI were significantly higher compared to pressures used in a ES (P < 0.001). While thermal denaturation of the liver parenchyma occurred at approximately 2-3 mm of depth when bipolar high-frequency electric cautery was used for dissection, it reached up to more than 10 mm with monopolar high-frequency electric cautery. All of the first disruption points of stapling were at stapling line. CONCLUSIONS Electrosurgical devices with an automatic irrigation function are useful devices to dissect the liver parenchyma.

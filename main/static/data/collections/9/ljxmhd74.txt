Abstract More airborne-infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) are needed in centers that treat severely affected COVID-19 patients. Wards and rooms must be carefully checked to ensure an ample supply of medical air and oxygen. Anterooms adjacent to AIIRS are required to maintain pressure differentials and provide an area for donning/doffing or disinfecting medical equipment.

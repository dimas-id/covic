OBJECTIVE To obtain monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein to develop diagnostic test for SARS and study the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS BALB/c mice were immunized with purified N protein of SARS-CoV. Hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus nucleocapsid were established after cell fusion with mouse splenic cells and SP2/0 cells. The specificity of the McAbs obtained was examined by Western blot and indirect fluorescence assay. Epitopes reacted with the McAbs were preliminarily located through Western blot by expressing truncated N proteins. RESULTS After cell fusion and three rounds of cell cloning, six hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies specifically against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid were obtained. Western blot and indirect fluorescence assay showed that the McAbs reacted specifically with nucleocapsid protein and SARS-CoV. Among the six McAbs, three recognize the epitopes located in the N-terminus of the protein, whereas the others reacted with those located in the C-terminus. CONCLUSION The anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid McAbs were developed and these McAbs may be useful in the development of diagnosis assays and basic research of SARS.

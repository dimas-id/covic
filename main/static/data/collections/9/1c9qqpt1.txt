Currently, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is considered as a gastrointestinal disease. Numerous studies have demonstrated that bariatric operations ameliorate T2DM significantly. The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (L-RYGB) is considered as the gold standard procedure. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and impact of L-RYGB with ileal transposition (or interposition) on diabetes resolution in a patient who has not benefited from any medical therapy, with its additional effect on the amelioration of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient was a 38-year-old diabetic woman with uncontrolled blood glucose despite medical treatment, with additional gastroesophageal reflux disease. Following the procedure, her biochemical parameters and reflux symptoms improved significantly within 10 months. We think that L-RYGB with ileal transposition may be easily employed to gain a maximum effect in diabetics with adverse prognosis. This technique may be an alternative in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with gastroesophageal reflux.

BACKGROUND In order to reduce clashing between the instruments during single-incision endoscopic surgery or reduced port surgery we have developed a new multichannel port with wider distance between the channels. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used the newly developed multichannel port (x-Gate速) in 34 patients undergoing a variety of reduced port surgery procedures. The operation records of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS Overall performance of x-Gate速 was sufficient in the clinical experience. There have been no complications attributed to x-Gate速. We found that with the x-Gate速 the conflicts among the forceps have been drastically improved compared with other multi-channel ports we had used before, which had a shorter distance between the channels.

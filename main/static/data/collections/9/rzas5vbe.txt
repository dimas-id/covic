Abstract There is a desperate search to discover effective therapies against COVID-19. Patients with HIV/AIDS comprise a unique population whose clinical course may provide insights into the effects of ART on COVID-19. We describe the case of a patient with HIV/AIDS on LVAD support who was hospitalized and recovered from COVID-19.

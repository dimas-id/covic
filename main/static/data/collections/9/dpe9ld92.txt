According to the Situation Report 65 of the World Health Organization of March 25, 2020, the COVID-19 incidence rate indicates 413 467 confirmed cases and 18 433 deaths. Genetic diversification of the Corona virus has resulted in strains that cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans via drip and animal mediation. S-proteins covering its surface, which bind to the cell receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important in shaping virus activity. The course of infection varies from mild to severe. The ability to control infection is limited because there are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV. Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment. The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs (tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand and all available services and resources on the other. Precise analysis and separation of individual tasks can enable the creation of a real crisis management plan.

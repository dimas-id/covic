Abstract The World Health Organization (WHO) upgraded the status of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak from epidemic to global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Various mathematical and statistical models have been proposed to predict the spread of COVID-2019[1]. We collated data on daily new confirmed cases of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan and South Korea from January 20, 2020 to April 26, 2020. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model were introduced to analyze two data sets and predict the daily new confirmed cases for the 7-day period from April 27, 2020 to May 3, 2020. Also, the forecasting results and both data sets are provided.

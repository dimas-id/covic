This article is a comprehensive description of diagnostic methods for detection of RNA respiratory viruses - respiratory syncytial virus RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 viruses, coronaviruses and rhinoviruses--from cell culture to molecular biology methods. Both patients and medical personnel appear to be at risk of viral infection, specially during the winter season. Moreover, many health care units lack viral diagnostic facilities; therefore, it is essential for medical personnel to have an understanding of the etiology, mechanisms of transmission and of all disposable today diagnostic methods of RNA respiratory viruses. Patients at greatest risk of acquiring nosocomial viral respiratory disease are children, patients with immunodeficiency and patients treated in intensive care.

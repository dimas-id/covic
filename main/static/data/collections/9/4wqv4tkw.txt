This article describes contemporary methods of diagnosis and current treatment regimens for most pulmonary infections. Modern techniques used to improve diagnostic yield in pulmonary infection include bronchoscopy, ultrasound- and electromagnetic-guided endoscopy, transthoracic needle biopsy, and samples obtained with thoracoscopy. The spectrum of bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens implicated in pulmonary disease is discussed. Treatment strategies and guideline recommendations for antimicrobial selection are described for community-acquired, health careâ€“associated, hospital-acquired, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, and for the most common fungal, mycobacterial, and viral infections. The state-of-the art in topical and aerosolized anti-infective therapy and an algorithm for managing hemoptysis are also presented.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an ongoing pandemic; however, the socioeconomic burden of COVID-19 treatment in the pediatric population remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the hospitalization periods and medical costs among children with COVID-19. In total, 145 billing statements for pediatric patients receiving healthcare services because of COVID-19 from February 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were used. The study showed that individual treatment costs for children with COVID-19 are approximately USD 2,192 under the Korean National Health Insurance Service System. This study revealed the differences in cost among age groups, determined by the type of hospital wherein admission occurred, as a trend of increasing age, increasing hospitalization time, and increasing cost was observed. Tailored COVID-19 treatment strategies by age group may lower costs and increase the effectiveness of resource allocation.

Techniques in liver surgery have improved considerably during the last decades, allowing for liver resections with low morbidity and mortality. Preoperative patient selection, perioperative management, and intraoperative blood-sparing techniques are the cornerstones of modern liver surgery. Multimodal treatment of colorectal liver metastases has expanded the group of patients who are potential candidates for liver resection. Adjunctive techniques, including preoperative portal vein embolization and staged hepatectomy, have facilitated the safe performance of extensive liver resection. This article provides an overview of indications for liver resection and a systematic description of the technical approach to the most commonly performed resections.

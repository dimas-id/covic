As part of the British Columbia government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, an online self-assessment tool was launched to help with symptom assessment and to provide necessary health information for people. The tool was developed by Thrive Health, a company which has been working to improve the delivery of e-health in Canada since 2016, with an emphasis on well-being. This review captures this company’s purpose and role in addressing the needs of patients and healthcare providers in the community, to change the definition of healthcare. In pursuing this goal, Thrive Health is innovating to make the long lost connection between physical and mental health through an online app with design features supported by research around subjective well-being, as a measurement of effective community development and human progress. This very characteristic is what establishes the company’s uniqueness among other similar patient advocacy groups, and connects patient advocacy to happiness and well-being.

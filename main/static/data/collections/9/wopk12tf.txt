The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic with rapid community spread. Patients with multi-morbidities are particularly vulnerable during this time. The number of cases soared in early February 2020, and Singapore declared escalation of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange. Multiple measures have been taken to combat the spread of this highly contagious infection. Despite our medical manpower being diverted to the wards, our hospital aims to maintain nearly full operations at the clinic, balancing against concern about the spread of the virus and exposing healthcare workers to potential risks. We describe the measures taken in a tertiary hospital in Singapore to mitigate the risk of infection in the outpatient setting while ensuring that continuing clinical care of patients with chronic diseases is not compromised.

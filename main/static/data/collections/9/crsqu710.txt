Reliability analysis is one of the crucial issues for any scalable optical interconnection network. Torus is a highly scalable optical interconnect for data centre networks. The traditional torus network has XY routing algorithm. We have proposed a novel optimised routing algorithm. This paper focuses on the time-dependent and time-independent analysis for both terminal and broadcast reliabilities of the torus network using XY and optimised routing algorithm under various network sizes ([Formula: see text] where [Formula: see text] ). The results are evaluated and compared considering nodes failures in MATLAB.

Late complications after a laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair are extremely rare and have only recently entered into the literature. One such late complication is mesh infection, of which there have been a handful of cases reported in the literature. Mesh infections occurring many years after inguinal hernia repairs are not only of significance because they are not well documented in the literature, and the pathogenesis and risk factors contributing to their development are not well understood. This report details a rare case of mesh infection 3 years after a laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair, describes our management of the condition, highlights the current options for management, and attempts to define its pathophysiology.

Mechanism of HAb18G/CD147 underlying the metastasis process of human hepatoma cells has not been determined. In the present study, we found that integrin α3β1 colocalizes with HAb18G/CD147 in human 7721 hepatoma cells. The enhancing effect of HAb18G/CD147 on adhesion, invasion capacities and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secretion was decreased by integrin α3β1 antibodies (p<0.01). The expressions of integrin downstream molecules including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phospho-FAK (p-FAK), paxillin, and phospho-paxillin (p-paxillin) were increased in human hepatoma cells overexpressing HAb18G/CD147. Deletion of HAb18G/CD147 reduces the quantity of focal adhesions and rearranges cytoskeleton. Wortmannin and LY294002, specific phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, reversed the effect of HAb18G/CD147 on the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, significantly reducing cell adhesion, invasion and MMPs secretion potential (p<0.01). Together, these results suggest that HAb18G/CD147 enhances the invasion and metastatic potentials of human hepatoma cells via integrin α3β1-mediated FAK-paxillin and FAKPI3K-Ca(2+) signal pathways.

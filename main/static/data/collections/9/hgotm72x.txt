A markedly increased demand for vascular ultrasound laboratory and other imaging studies in COVID-19-positive patients has occurred, due to most of these patients having a markedly elevated D-dimer and a presumed prothrombotic state in many of the very ill patients. In the present report, we have summarized a broad institutional consensus focusing on evaluation and recommended empirical therapy for COVID-19-positive patients. We recommend following the algorithms with the idea that as more data becomes available these algorithms may well change.

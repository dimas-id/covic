Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemic prevention strategies have been implemented worldwide. For the sake of controlling the infectious coronavirus pneumonia, early diagnosis and quarantine play an imperative role. Currently, the mainstream diagnostic methods are imaging and laboratory diagnosis, which differ in their efficacy of diagnosis. To compare the detection rate, we reviewed numerous literature on pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) and analyzed two different ways of diagnosis. The results showed that the detection rate of computed tomography (CT) diagnosis was significantly higher than that of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (P = 0.00697). Still, clinicians should combine radiology and laboratory methods to achieve a higher detection rate, so that instant isolation and treatment could be effectively conducted to curb the rampant spread of the epidemic.

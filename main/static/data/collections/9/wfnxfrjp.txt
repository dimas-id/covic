Abstract The field of global health law and the contribution of international organizations to its development are described. The growth and elaboration of the field of global health law in the last two decades is one of the most notable developments in global health policy. In this new era of global health governance, international law has an important, albeit limited, role to play in promoting and coordinating international cooperation and national action to protect and promote global health. Particular attention is paid to the global impact of binding international agreements and other international legal instruments developed under the auspices of the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization.

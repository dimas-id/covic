There is increasing concern that insurmountable differences between humans and laboratory animals limit the relevance and reliability for hazard identification and risk assessment purposes of animal data produced by traditional toxicity test procedures. A way forward is offered by the emerging new technologies, which can be directly applied to human material or even to human beings themselves. This promises to revolutionise the evaluation of the safety of chemicals and chemical products of various kinds and, in particular, pharmaceuticals. The available and developing technologies are summarised and it is emphasised that they will need to be used selectively, in integrated and intelligent testing strategies, which, in addition to being scientifically sound, must be manageable and affordable. Examples are given of proposed testing strategies for general chemicals, cosmetic ingredients, candidate pharmaceuticals, inhaled substances, nanoparticles and neurotoxicity.

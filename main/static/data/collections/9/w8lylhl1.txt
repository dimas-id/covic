Background Bariatric surgery has been shown to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission in severely obese patients. After laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), diabetes remission occurs early and independently of weight loss. Previous research has identified preoperative factors for remission, such as duration of diabetes and HbA1c. Understanding factors that predict diabetes remission can help to select patients who will benefit most from bariatric surgery. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all T2DM patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or LRYGB between January 2008 and July 2014. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as the absence of hypoglycemic medications, fasting blood glucose < 7.0 mmol/L and HbA1c < 6.5%. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify predictive factors of diabetes remission. Results We included 207 patients in this analysis; 84 (40.6%) had LSG and 123 (59.4%) had LRYGB. Half of the patients (49.8%) achieved diabetes remission at 1 year. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that LRYGB had higher odds of diabetes remission than LSG (odds ratio [OR] 6.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.79–15.50, p < 0.001). Shorter duration of diabetes (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–0.99, p = 0.032) and the absence of long-acting insulin (OR 0.0011, 95% CI < 0.000–0.236, p = 0.013) predicted remission. Conclusion Type of bariatric procedure (LRYGB v. LSG), shorter duration of diabetes and the absence of long-acting insulin were independent predictors of diabetes remission after bariatric surgery.

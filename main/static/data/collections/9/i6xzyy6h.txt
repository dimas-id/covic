Objective@#Understand the clinical characteristics of confirmed pneumonia patients infected with new corona virus in secondary epidemic areas and guide the diagnosis and treatment of novel pneumonia in secondary epidemic areas and provide a reference for clinical prevention and control of the epidemic situation.@*Methods@#The clinical data of 33 patients admitted with pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 15 to February 1, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. At the onset of the disease, we analyzed the primary symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, chest pain and also a significant blood test results of the patients. According to the patient&apos;s contact history, it was divided into the direct infection group of the main epidemic area and the indirect contact infection group of the main epidemic areas. The difference between clinical manifestations among the two groups was analyzed.@*Results@#The main clinical symptoms of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract and systemic symptoms. After grouping according to the presence and absence of direct contact in the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference in baseline data between the two groups, and there was no significant difference in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). Some patients had serum amyloid protein (SAP) increased abnormall.@*Conclusions@#The respiratory tract and systemic symptoms are the primary symptoms of the patients with the new type of coronavirus pneumonia in the secondary epidemic area, which are not typical. The abnormal increase of serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment.

We present an interactive proof system dedicated to program extraction from proofs. In a previous paper [5] the underlying theory IFP (Intuitionistic Fixed Point Logic) was presented and its soundness proven. The present contribution describes a prototype implementation and explains its use through several case studies. The system benefits from an improvement of the theory which makes it possible to extract programs from proofs using unrestricted strictly positive inductive and coinductive definitions, thus removing the previous admissibility restrictions.

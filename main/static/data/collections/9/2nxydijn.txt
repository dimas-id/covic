Forty-four Dutch dog owners were interviewed by telephone about their experiences with their dog after it had had a limb amputated. Most of the dogs adapted to walking on three legs within a month, sooner than most of the owners had expected. There were few complications after the amputation, although changes in behaviour were observed in approximately one-third of the dogs.

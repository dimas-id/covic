For particles diffusing in a potential, detailed balance guarantees the absence of net fluxes at equilibrium. Here, we show that the conventional detailed balance condition is a special case of a more general relation that works when the diffusion occurs in the presence of a distributed sink that eventually traps the particle. We use this relation to study the lifetime distribution of particles that start and are trapped at specified initial and final points. It turns out that when the sink strength at the initial point is nonzero, the initial and final points are interchangeable, i.e., the distribution is independent of which of the two points is initial and which is final. In other words, this conditional trapping time distribution possesses forwardâ€“backward symmetry.

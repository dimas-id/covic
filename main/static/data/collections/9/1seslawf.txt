One-hundred and thirty confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were recruited to evaluate their anti-SARS-coronavirus (CoV) antibody status and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types in September 2006, 3 y after the SARS outbreaks in Taiwan. Western blot assay showed that 6.9% of participants still had anti-spike and anti-nucleocapside antibodies. A case-control study of the association of HLA with SARS revealed that the HLA-Cw1502 and DR0301 alleles conferred resistance against SARS infection (p<0.05).

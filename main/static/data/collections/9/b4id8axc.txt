We verify two related divide-and-conquer algorithms solving one of the fundamental problems in Computational Geometry, the Closest Pair of Points problem. Using the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL, we prove functional correctness and the optimal running time of [Formula: see text] of the algorithms. We generate executable code which is empirically competitive with handwritten reference implementations.

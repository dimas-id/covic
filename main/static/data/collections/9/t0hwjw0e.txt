We consider a new model which consists of a DNA together with a RNA. Here we assume that DNA is from a mammal or bird but RNA comes from a virus. To study thermodynamic properties of this model we use methods of statistical mechanics, namely, the theory of Gibbs measures. We use these measures to describe phases (states) of the DNA-RNA system. Using a Markov chain (corresponding to Gibbs measure) we give conditions (on temperature) of DNA-RNA renaturation.

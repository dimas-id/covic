Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a global pandemic that is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Data from several countries have demonstrated higher morbidity and mortality among individuals with chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM). In this review, we explore the contributing factors for poorer prognosis in these individuals. As a significant proportion of patients with COVID‐19 also have DM, this adds another layer of complexity to their management. We explore potential interactions between anti‐diabetic medications and renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone‐system inhibitors with COVID‐19. Suggested recommendations for the use of anti‐diabetic medications in COVID‐19 patients with DM are provided. We also review pertinent clinical considerations in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in the COVID‐19 patient. In addition, we aim to increase the awareness of clinicians to the metabolic effects of promising drug therapies for COVID‐19. Finally, we highlight the importance of timely vaccinations for patients with DM.

The 26S proteasome is a large (~2.5 MDa) protein complex consisting of at least 33 different subunits and many other components, which form the ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS), an ATP-dependent protein degradation system in the cell. UPS serves as an essential component of the cellular protein surveillance machinery, and its dysfunction leads to cancer, neurodegenerative and immunological disorders. Importantly, the functions and regulations of proteins are governed by the combination of ordered regions, intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) and molecular recognition features (MoRFs). The structureâ€“function relationships of UPS components have not been identified completely; therefore, in this study, we have carried out the functional intrinsic disorder and MoRF analysis for potential neurodegenerative disease and anti-cancer targets of this pathway. Our report represents the presence of significant intrinsic disorder and disorder-based binding regions in several UPS proteins, such as extraproteasomal polyubiquitin receptors (UBQLN1 and UBQLN2), proteasome-associated polyubiquitin receptors (ADRM1 and PSMD4), deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (ATXN3 and USP14), and ubiquitinating enzymes (E2 (UBE2R2) and E3 (STUB1) enzyme). We believe this study will have implications for the conformation-specific roles of different regions of these proteins. This will lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of UPS-associated diseases.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of histone acetylation in regulating influenza virus replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in A549 cells. METHODS A549 cells were treated with influenza virus replicative intermediate dsRNA, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), or HADC small interfering RNA (siRNA). The changes in the cellular IL-6 promoter activities were detected by dual-luciferase assay, and IL-6 mRNA and protein expressions in the cells were determined using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS Influenza virus replicative intermediate dsRNA obviously up-regulated IL-6 expression in the cells. HDAC inhibitor TSA significantly enhanced the activity of IL-6 promoter and increased IL-6 mRNA expression in A549 cells, and HDAC3 may play an important role in this process. HDAC inhibitor TSA and DNMT inhibitor DAC showed no synergic effect in regulating IL-6 expression. CONCLUSIONS Influenza virus replicative intermediate dsRNA-induced IL-6 expression in A549 cells is regulated by histone acetylation.

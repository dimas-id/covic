Introduction: Docking and structure-based virtual screening (VS) have been standard approaches in structure-based design for over two decades. However, our understanding of the limitations, potential, and strength of these techniques has enhanced, raising expectations. Areas covered: Based on a survey of reports in the past five years, we assess whether VS: (1) predicts binding poses in agreement with crystallographic data (when available); (2) is a superior screening tool, as often claimed; (3) is successful in identifying chemical scaffolds that can be starting points for subsequent lead optimization cycles. Data shows that knowledge of the target and its chemotypes in postprocessing lead to viable hits in early drug discovery endeavors. Expert opinion: VS is capable of accurate placements in the pocket for the most part, but does not consistently score screening collections accurately. What matters is capitalization on available resources to get closer to a viable lead or optimizable series. Integration of approaches, subjective hit selection guided by knowledge of the receptor or endogenous ligand, libraries driven by experimental guides, validation studies to identify the best docking/scoring that reproduces experimental findings, constraints regarding receptor-ligand interactions, thoroughly designed methodologies, and predefined cutoff scoring criteria strengthen VS's position in pharmaceutical research.

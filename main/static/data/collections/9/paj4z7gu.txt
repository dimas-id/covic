Intestinal transplantation has become a well-accepted and successful procedure to save the lives of patients suffering from intestinal failure and who have developed life-threatening complications of parenteral nutrition. Advances in all aspects of care, from the role of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation services prior to transplant to the development strategies for early recognition of infectious sequelae and even the increasing availability of preventive strategies, have led to improved outcomes and a dramatic decline in infection-associated morbidity and mortality in children undergoing intestinal transplantation. Improvements in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimens have been essential components in these improvements, reducing risk of infection through reduction of technical complications and more optimal immunosuppression regimens. In addition, the development of molecular tools for early recognition of viral pathogens and an understanding of the timing and risks for infection have allowed for earlier and more successful treatments. Despite these improvements, infectious sequelae remain an important problem in this population, and additional efforts are needed to further minimize the risk of infectious sequelae in those children requiring this procedure.

An analogy relaxation model, able to describe the dynamics of Covid-19 pandemics, in terms of daily presented new cases, is obtained. The main objective here is the prediction of pandemic dynamics, as the forecast of herd immunity time, and provide quantitative criteria for some predictions. We propose an analogy based on the concept of fractal derivative and justify the appearance of fractal time. A Burr XII-shaped solution of a fractal-like equation was obtained. The data fitting shows that the obtained function is useful to describe the behavior of the pandemic in the studied countries. The temporal evolution of contagion over different countries and worldwide are presented and discussed. We also show that a deformed derivative model leads to the same analytical results.

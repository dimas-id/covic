Since the new fatal pneumonia was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the WHO declared the infection a health emergency of international concern. The novel ss‐RNA ß‐coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) spreads through airborne and direct contagion; virulence is high in the elderly and in patients with diabetes, chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases. SARS‐CoV‐2 ssRNA is recognized by intracellular Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which trigger NF‐kB – the master regulator of inflammation – and Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs)(1).

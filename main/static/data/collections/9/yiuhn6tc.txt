Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)—pneumonia occurring within 48 h after hospital admission or more than 2 weeks after discharge—leads to hospitalization rates of 20–35 % in Europe, with figures in Spain being even higher at 22–61 %. A substantial proportion of these cases (10 %) are defined as severe. These patients must be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of the possible need for ventilatory or hemodynamic support. Their mortality rate can be as high as 40 % [1]. In the rest of Europe the incidence of CAP is 5–11 cases per 1,000 person-years, and in Spain it drops to 1.6–1.8 cases per 1,000 person-years, with men and the elderly most often affected and mostly in winter [1].

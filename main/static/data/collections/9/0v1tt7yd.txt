Following research obtained from the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, weâ€™ve gained knowledge about the mechanisms of bioactive plant ingredients against the attachment and replication of COVID-19 as well as overshooting immune responses. This could be used for designing COVID-19 trials utilizing bioactive compounds. The receptors for SARS, ACE-2, and CD26 show associations with mechanisms that regulate human senescence. Several functional foods interact with the epigenetic regulation of viral infection and mechanisms of senescence. This review concentrates on the link between bioactive plant ingredients and their activities against mechanisms of viral infections.

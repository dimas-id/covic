A young adult Balinese cat developed complete hindlimb paralysis which persisted for six weeks. Clinical findings suggested a lesion compressing the spinal cord and this was confirmed at necropsy. A dermoid cyst was present at the level of the third thoracic vertebra. The cyst was lined by stratified squamous epithelium and contained desquamated keratinised material and hair fragments. Sebaceous glands and hair follicles were present in the connective tissue wall. This is the first report of a dermoid cyst in the spinal cord of a cat. The lesion is considered to be a congenital anomaly.

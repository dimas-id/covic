Virology, as a branch of the life sciences, discovered mass spectrometry (MS) to be the pivotal tool around two decades ago. The technique unveiled the complex network of interactions between the living world of pro‐ and eukaryotes and viruses, which delivered “a piece of bad news wrapped in protein” as defined by Peter Medawar, Nobel Prize Laureate, in 1960. However, MS is constantly evolving, and novel approaches allow for a better understanding of interactions in this micro‐ and nanoworld. Currently, we can investigate the interplay between the virus and the cell by analyzing proteomes, interactomes, virus‐cell interactions, and search for the compounds that build viral structures. In addition, by using MS, it is possible to look at the cell from the broader perspective and determine the role of viral infection on the scale of the organism, for example, monitoring the crosstalk between infected tissues and the immune system. In such a way, MS became one of the major tools for the modern virology, allowing us to see the infection in the context of the whole cell or the organism. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Mass Spec Rev

The COVID‐19 crisis has fundamentally disrupted teaching and learning practices at many post‐secondary institutions with a highly residential population. The present article outlines the situation at Harvard University and details the steps taken by the Language Center to mitigate the effects of the transition to remote teaching and learning. These include changes in communication strategies, support mechanisms for faculty and students, and modifications to the Center's operational policies. The authors provide a number of concrete recommendations for academic support units in transitions of this type.

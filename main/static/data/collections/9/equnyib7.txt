The detection of pathogen-specific antibodies remains a cornerstone of clinical diagnostics. Yet, many test exhibit undesirable performance or are completely lacking. Given this, we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis (SERA), a method to rapidly discover conserved, pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes, and applied it to develop an assay for Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 Chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate Chagas antigens. In a blinded validation set (n = 72), 30/30 Chagas were positive, 30/30 non-Chagas were negative, and 1/12 Leishmania sp. was positive. After unblinding, a Leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel. The Chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity (30/30) and specificity (90/90) in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections. Amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown Chagas serostatus, assay specificity was 99.8% (998/1000). Thus, the Chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity. NGS-based serology via SERA provides an effective approach to discover antigenic epitopes and develop high performance multiplex serological assays.

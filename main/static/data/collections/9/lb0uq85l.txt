Adsorbed lubricious films composed of biomacromolecules are natively present at all articulating interfaces in the human body where they provide ultralow friction and maintain normal physiological function. Biolubrication gets impaired due to diseases such as osteoarthritis, in which cartilage damage results from alterations in synovial fluid and lamina splendens composition. Osteoarthritis is treated with hyaluronic acid (HA) orally or via intra-articular injection, but due to the poor adsorption of HA on the cartilage surface in the absence of adhesive molecules, pain relief is temporary. Here, we describe how natural lubrication on degraded cartilage surface can be restored with the help of a bioinspired mucoadhesive biopolymer chitosan catechol (Chi-C). Quartz crystal microbalance was used to mimic the formation of lamina splendens in vitro, known as synovial fluid conditioning films (SyCF), and colloidal probe atomic force microscopy was used to measure their nanoscale frictional properties. Clear evidence of glycoprotein (PRG4) recruitment by Chi-C increased the softness of SyCF, which also improved nanoscale lubrication in vitro, decreasing the friction coefficient from 0.06 to 0.03. At the macroscale, cartilage damage induced by Chondroitinase ABC increased the coefficient of friction (COF) from 0.07 ± 0.04 (healthy tissue) to 0.15 ± 0.03 (after tissue damage) in the presence of synovial fluid after sliding for 50 min. After Chi-C treatment of damaged cartilage, the COF fell to 0.06 ± 0.03, which is comparable to healthy cartilage. Chi-C did not adversely affect the metabolic activity of human chondrocytes. This study provides new key insight into the potential for restoring biolubrication through the use of muco-adhesive molecules.

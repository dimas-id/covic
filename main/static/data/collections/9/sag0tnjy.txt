Background: Some patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the recent pandemic have required critical care, becoming one of the main limitations of the health systems. Our objective has been to identify potential markers at admission predicting the need for critical care in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from electronic medical records of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection by real-time RT-PCR. A comparison was made between patients staying in the hospitalization ward with those who required critical care. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to identify risk factors predicting critical care need Findings: Between March 15 and April 15, 2020, 150 patients under the age of 75 were selected (all with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection), 75 patients requiring intensive care assistance and 75 remaining the regular hospitalization ward. Most patients requiring critical care were males, 76% compared with 60% in the non-critical care group (p<0,05). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1,052 (1,009-1,101); p=0,0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1,968 (1,389-2,590) p<0,0001) both at the time of hospital admission. The AUC-ROC for the combined model was 0,83 (0,76-0,90) (vs AUC-ROC SOFA p<0,05) Interpretation: Patients COVID-19 positive presenting at admission with high SOFA score [≥]2 combined with CRP [≥] 9,1 mg/mL could help clinicians to identify them as a group that will more likely require critical care so further actions might be implemented to improve their prognosis

The relatively low economic value of small ruminants places constraints upon vaccination in these species. In general, vaccination against clostridial diseases such as enterotoxemia and tetanus are most important. Enzootic pneumonia is a major cause of losses in intensively housed sheep. Footrot is a difficult disease to control because of the extreme antigenic diversity of its causal agent. In some areas soremouth vaccination is important. Bluetongue vaccination, even though complex, is also essential in some areas. Peste de petits ruminants is a growing cause for concern over much of Africa. Goats and llamas generally require the same vaccines as sheep.

Pharma innovation is becoming increasingly global, partly due to the lure of serving new markets, partly because of the need to access early new technology and talent wherever it emerges. Apart from the established centers of innovation in the United States, Europe and Japan, India, China and Singapore are rising attractors for global life science R&D. China as a pharma market and host of pharma R&D is highlighted as a case study, both from the angle of foreign R&D investors and from the perspective of indigenous Chinese players. Given the significant cost pressures in mature markets, reverse innovation in healthcare has drawn considerable attention by local governments.

BACKGROUND The sleeve gastrectomy procedure has been gaining popularity because of its simplicity and favorable outcomes. This study reports the experience with a single-access approach to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in super-super obese patients. METHODS Four super-super obese patients having a mean body mass index of 62.7 kg/m(2) underwent single-access laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The same perioperative protocol and operative techniques were implemented for all 4 patients. RESULTS A total of 4 single-access laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies in super-super obese patients were successfully performed using this technique. Mean operating time was 126 minutes. One patient required the insertion of an additional trocar. There were no mortalities or postoperative complications noted. Most comorbidities either improved or resolved during a mean follow-up of 5.3 months. CONCLUSION Single-access laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in the super-super obese is safe, feasible, and reproducible.

Abstract Flavonoids are dietary components and the most ubiquitous phenolic compounds found in nature, showing a range of pharmacological activities including antiviral action. This study describes the antiviral screening of 60 different flavones and flavonols against human rotavirus (Wa-1 strain) as well as their cytotoxicity in MA104 cells. Cytotoxicity was investigated by cell morphology assessment and antirotavirus activity by cytopathic effect inhibition. Results were expressed as CC50 and IC50, respectively, in order to calculate the selectivity index (SI=CC50/IC50) of each compound. Structureâ€“activity relationships (SAR) were proposed based on antirotavirus activity.

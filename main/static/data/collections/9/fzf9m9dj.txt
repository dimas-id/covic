Thirty-six measles cases with diarrhea were studied with two age and sex matched control groups, measles without diarrhea (75 cases) and acute diarrhea (70 cases). Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 5 out of 36 (13.9%) in measles with diarrhea but rotavirus, coronavirus and parasites were not detected in any case. The bacterial and viral etiology of measles with diarrhea were statistically significant different from the acute diarrhea group (p less than 0.005) and p less than 0.01 respectively) but not from the measles without diarrhea group (p greater than 0.05). 83.3 per cent of cases had diarrhea during 4 days before and after the appearance of rash. Watery diarrhea was frequently observed in this study (63.9%). Although measles virus was not identified in stools, data from this study suggested that measles may be the viral agent causing diarrhea. Watery stools are often observed and the presence of faecal white blood cell may be seen.

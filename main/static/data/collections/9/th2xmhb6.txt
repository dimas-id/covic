The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has spread to various regions worldwide. As of 27 April 2020, according to real‐time statistics released by the World Health Organization, there have been 84,341 confirmed cases and 4,643 deaths in China, with more than 2,979,484 confirmed cases and 206,450 deaths outside China. The detection of antibodies produced during the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection has become an important laboratory method for the diagnosis of COVID‐19. However, at present, little research on these specific antibodies has been conducted. In this study, retrospective analysis was used to explore the dynamic changes of serum IgM and IgG antibody and factors affecting diagnostic efficacy, so as to provide a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

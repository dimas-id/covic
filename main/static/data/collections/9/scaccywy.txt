This chapter focuses on health and how it can be reimagined through the lens of human security. It builds on Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-72068-5_5â€™s exploration of human security, including of health, beyond borders. It delves more deeply into the nuts and bolts of delivering the right to health by reallocating the responsibility for it across State border as well as between States and NSAs. Antecedent to its analysis is the acknowledgment of the tension between the morality of a universal human right to health and the claim to health care conferred by citizenship, focusing on the continued (r)evolution of the human right to health as part and parcel of human security, and of its practical feasibility beyond State borders.

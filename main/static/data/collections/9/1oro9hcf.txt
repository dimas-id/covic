BACKGROUND: A review of infectious disease research activity and capacity was performed in British Columbia and linked to a process for identifying needs, gaps and opportunities from a public health perspective. METHODS: The study was organized in three phases: an environmental scan to describe current research activity in BC; a consultation to identify needs, gaps and opportunities with those conducting research (key informants) and the end users of research results (stakeholders); and a prioritization of the research needs emerging from the consultation. RESULTS: Analysis and synthesis of the consultation data resulted in the identification of nine research themes, which were prioritized in the following order: efficacy and cost-benefit, disease patterns, emerging infectious disease, immunology and vaccines, disease-specific research, health promotion and communications, safe food and water, knowledge translation research and genomics. Six capacity-building themes were also identified: attraction and retention, education and training, collaboration and networks, funding, dissemination of findings, and public health input, surveillance, informatics and databases. INTERPRETATION: The findings were helpful in developing a multi-disciplinary, multi-level infectious disease research agenda linking researchers in universities, hospitals and public health institutions with practitioners and policy-makers in British Columbiaâ€™s public health system. The approach is both feasible and important to undertake at the national level.

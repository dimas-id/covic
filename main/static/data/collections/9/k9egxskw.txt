Abstract The new variants of the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produce a range of symptoms and cause global economic losses to the poultry industry. We investigated the S1 glycoprotein of 24 recent IBV isolates from chickens and demonstrated that two predominant genetic groups were circulating in southern Thailand between 2008 and 2013. Seven IBV variants, isolated from 2008 to 2009, were clustered in the Thailand THA001 group I while 15 IBV variants, isolated from 2009 to 2013, were classified into the QX-like group II. Moreover, a single isolate from a broiler was categorized into the Massachusetts-type, and an isolate from a layer belonged to the 4/91 type virus. Interestingly, both the IBV groups I and II were isolated from native chickens (62.5%) and caused a range of symptoms. Our results indicate that the QX-like viruses were predominant after 2009, replacing the THA001 type viruses. Furthermore, native chickens may contribute to the epidemiology of IB.

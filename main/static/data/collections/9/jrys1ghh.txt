Endovascular treatments of ophthalmic segment aneurysms are commonly used but visual outcomes remain a concern. We performed a retrospective review of patients with carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms treated with flow diversion from June 2009 to June 2015. The following outcomes were studied through chart review: visual outcomes, complications, postoperative stroke and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and clinical outcomes. Angiographic outcomes were studied with angiography and MRA at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years. We evaluated 50 carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms in 48 patients, among whom 44 patients with 46 aneurysms underwent treatment. The mean clinical follow-up was 29 Â± 22 months (range, 0-65 months). There were no permanent adverse visual outcomes. There was 1 death because of late intraparenchymal hemorrhage (2.2%). Six-month angiography showed complete occlusion in 24 of 37 patients (64.9%), and 3-year angiography results showed occlusion in 24 of 25 patients (96%). In conclusion, flow diversion is a safe and effective treatment for carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms in carefully selected patients. The risk of adverse visual outcomes is low, and most aneurysms progress to complete occlusion.

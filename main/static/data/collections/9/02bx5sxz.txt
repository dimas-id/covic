PURPOSE To document the efficacy of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (ONYX; ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA) in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the mandible. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective consecutive series of patients with facial AVMs isolated to the mandible and immediate perimandibular tissue was identified at 2 institutions. The primary treatment modality of transarterial embolization using ONYX was performed by way of the external carotid artery branches. Staged procedures were accomplished until no arteriovenous shunt remained. A 1-year follow-up angiogram was obtained for each patient. RESULTS Three patients, aged 8 (patient 1), 16 (patient 2), and 17 (patient 3) years presented with bleeding from facial AVMs isolated to the mandible. Patient 1 was female and patients 2 and 3 were male. The 2 older patients had loose molar or canine dentition. Transarterial embolization with ONYX achieved complete angiographic closure of the arteriovenous shunt in each patient. A total of 1, 6, and 3 staged embolization procedures were performed in the 3 patients. Patient 2 had mild transient facial numbness after embolization that completely resolved. Patient 3 had loose molars associated with the AVM that were extracted for treatment of intraprocedural bleeding. The 1-year angiographic follow-up data demonstrated durable closure of all 3 lesions. CONCLUSIONS Transarterial embolization of high-flow intraosseus mandibular AVMs was safely accomplished with ONYX in our small retrospective cohort. Complete, durable occlusion was found on the angiogram at 1 year, with clinical stability extending to an average of 3 years. Surgical resection of the AVM was avoided in all 3 patients.

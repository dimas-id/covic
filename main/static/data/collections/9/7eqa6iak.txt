Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the causative agent for a global health emergency and is predominantly associated with respiratory symptoms. In this case, a patient presented to the emergency department with gastrointestinal symptomatology without associated respiratory findings and was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 based on incidental findings from an abdominal computed tomography (CT) study. Given the patientâ€™s lack of respiratory symptoms, diagnosis and treatment were ultimately delayed. During this global health crisis, an improved understanding of the various presentations of COVID-19 is paramount in an effort to initiate immediate treatment and prevent further transmission.

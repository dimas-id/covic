OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical and health status outcomes of patients undergoing superficial femoral artery (SFA) revascularization using the Shape Memory Alloy Recoverable Technology (S.M.A.R.T.®) nitinol self-expanding stent through 3 years of follow-up. BACKGROUND Limited long-term data are available describing the durability of benefits after femoropopliteal revascularization. METHODS In a multicenter, prospective, core-lab adjudicated study, 250 subjects with de novo or restenotic femoropopliteal arterial lesions were treated with the S.M.A.R.T.® stent. The primary endpoint of target vessel patency, a composite of ultrasound-assessed patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), was evaluated through 3 years. Secondary endpoints included stent fracture and health status. Health status was measured using generic and disease-specific instruments, including the Peripheral Artery Questionnaire (PAQ). RESULTS At 3-year follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimated target vessel patency was 72.7%, freedom from clinically driven TLR was 78.5%, and the incidence of stent fracture was 3.6%. The PAQ summary score was markedly impaired at baseline (mean 37.3 ± 19.6 points) and improved substantially at 1 month (mean change from baseline of 31.4 points, 95% CI: 28.5-34.3; P < 0.001). Disease-specific health status benefits assessed by the PAQ were largely preserved through 3 years of follow-up (mean change from baseline, 28.0 points, 95% CI: 24.3-31.7; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing revascularization for moderately complex SFA disease, use of the self-expanding S.M.A.R.T® stent was associated with a high rate of target vessel patency through 3 years and led to substantial and sustained health status benefits.

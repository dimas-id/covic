OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of dysmenorrhea in university students, review some associated factors and evaluate the relationship between dysmenorrhea and sleep quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group included 520 students. Survey forms prepared previously in line with the study objective were completed by the students under supervision. The severity of dysmenorrhea was rated with Visual Analogue Scale. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to evaluate the sleep quality. The χ(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for the analyses. Statistical significance level was accepted at p < 0.05. RESULTS Mean age of the students was 20.23 ± 1.59 years (range 17-25). Frequency of dysmenorrhea was determined to be 69.0% (n = 359). Frequency of dysmenorrhea was higher in smokers, those with menstrual irregularity, those who use drugs for menstrual regulation and those having a family history (p < 0.05 for each). The most frequent symptoms in those having dysmenorrhea history were weakness (59.6%), fatigue (58.5%) and breast tenderness (45.4%), respectively. Sleep quality was found to be poorer in the students having a history of dysmenorrhea (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Dysmenorrhea is an important health problem in young women. Dysmenorrhea affects the sleep quality negatively.

TaqMan and SYBR Green quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were developed as DNA-based approaches to reproducibly enumerate M13 and T7 phages from phage display selection experiments individually and simultaneously. The genome copies of M13 and T7 phages were quantified by TaqMan or SYBR Green qPCR referenced against M13 and T7 DNA standard curves of known concentrations. TaqMan qPCR was capable of quantifying M13 and T7 phage DNA simultaneously with a detection range of 2.75*101-2.75*108genome copies(gc)/μL and 2.66*101-2.66*108 genome copies(gc)/μL respectively. TaqMan qPCR demonstrated an efficient amplification efficiency (Es) of 0.97 and 0.90 for M13 and T7 phage DNA, respectively. SYBR Green qPCR was ten-fold more sensitive than TaqMan qPCR, able to quantify 2.75-2.75*107gc/μL and 2.66*101-2.66*107gc/μL of M13 and T7 phage DNA, with an amplification efficiency Es of 1.06 and 0.78, respectively. Due to its superior sensitivity, SYBR Green qPCR was used to enumerate M13 and T7 phage display clones selected against a cell line, and quantified titers demonstrated accuracy comparable to titers from traditional double-layer plaque assay. Compared to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, both qPCR methods exhibited increased detection sensitivity and reproducibility. These qPCR methods are reproducible, sensitive, and time-saving to determine their titers and to quantify a large number of phage samples individually or simultaneously, thus avoiding the need for time-intensive double-layer plaque assay. These findings highlight the attractiveness of qPCR for phage enumeration for applications ranging from selection to next-generation sequencing (NGS).

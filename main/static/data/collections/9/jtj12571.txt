BACKGROUND: Analysis of workers’ compensation data and occupational health and safety trends in healthcare across Canada was conducted to provide insight concerning workplace injuries and prevention measures undertaken in the healthcare sector. METHODS: Timeloss claims data were collected for 1992–2002 from the Association of Workers’ Compensation Boards of Canada. Labour Force data from Statistics Canada were used to calculate injury rates. The Occupational Health and Safety Agency for Healthcare in British Columbia coordinated with provincial occupational health and safety agencies in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia to analyze injury data and collate prevention measures in their regions. RESULTS: The national timeloss injury rate declined from 4.3 to 3.7 injuries per 100 personyears since 1998. Musculoskeletal injuries consistently comprised the majority of timeloss claims. Needlestick injuries, infectious diseases and stress-related claims infrequently resulted in timeloss claims although they are known to cause great concern in the workplace. Prevention measures taken in the various provinces related to safer equipment (lifts and electric beds), return-to-work programs, and violence prevention initiatives. Different eligibility criteria as well as adjudication policies confounded the comparison of injury rates across provinces. DISCUSSION: Since 2000, all provinces experienced healthcare restructuring and increased workload in an aging workforce. Despite these increased risks, injury rates have decreased. Attribution for these trends is complex, but there is reason to believe that focus on prevention can further decrease injuries. While occupational health is a provincial jurisdiction, harmonizing data in addition to sharing data on successful prevention measures and best practices may improve workplace conditions and thereby further reduce injury rates for higher risk healthcare sector occupations.

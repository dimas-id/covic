The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) pandemic has necessitated changes in health care delivery, including increases in delivery of care through asynchronous or virtual means, and deployment of clinicians in different teams and settings.

Health care delivery and CPD is unlikely to fully return (in the near term, if at all) to prepandemic status. The authors raise questions and opportunities for development and provision of CPD during and after the pandemic.

The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is the most threatened wild feline in the world. Little is known about the diseases and pathology that affect this animal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathological status of the peripheral lymphoid tissues and thymus of Iberian lynxes necropsied between 1998 and 2003. Seventeen animals including females (n=8) and males (n=9), age range of 10 months to 16 years, with different causes of death were histopathologically and immunohistochemically (anti-CD3, CD79, MAC387, CD68) studied. Feline immunosuppressive virus laboratorial tests were negative. Five individuals presented neoplasia and/or tuberculosis. All animals presented some degree of both B and T cells depletion in peripheral lymphoid tissues and follicular hyalinosis in the center of depleted follicles. A viral origin of the lymphoid depletion is postulated although other causes (inbreeding, stress, toxic) are not ruled out. The loss of the effectiveness of the immune system increases the vulnerability of the critically endangered Iberian lynx to pathogens.

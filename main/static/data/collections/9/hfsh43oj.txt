INTRODUCTION Plant-made virus-like particles (VLP) bearing influenza virus hemagglutinins (HA) are novel vaccine candidates that induce cross-reactive humoral and poly-functional T cell responses. To better understand the mechanisms that underlie this broad immunogenicity we studied early interactions of VLPs bearing either H1 (A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)) or H5 (A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1)) with a human monocytoid cell line (U-937 cells) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) as model antigen-presenting cells (APC). METHODS AND RESULTS Using Vibrio cholerae sialidase and lectins that target α2,6- (Sambucus nigra lectin) or α2,3-linked sialic acids (Maackia amurensis lectin I), we demonstrated that VLPs bind to these APCs in a sialic acid-dependent manner. Using lysosomal markers and DiD-labelled VLPs, we found that attachment to the cell surface leads to internalization, trafficking to acidic cell compartments and fusion of the VLP lipid envelope with endosomal membranes. Incubation of MDMs with H1- but not H5-VLPs induced proliferation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggesting antigen processing and stimulation of a memory T cell response. CONCLUSIONS Plant-made VLPs bearing influenza HA not only mimic the structure of influenza virions to some degree but also recapitulate key features of the initial virus-APC interaction. These observations may help to explain the balanced humoral and cellular responses to plant-made VLP vaccines.

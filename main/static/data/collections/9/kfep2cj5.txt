The COVID‐19 pandemic affects most countries of the world resulting in significant morbidity and mortality from this infection with SARS‐CoV2 (1). It was reported that among others specifically patients with cancer (including patients with hematological malignancies) are at a higher risk for severe and fatal infection (2). Here, we report three consecutive patients with underlying hematologic malignancies and co‐morbidities who were admitted to the infectious diseases ward at our department because of SARS‐CoV2 infection.

The neurotropic behavior of Chandipura virus (CHPV) is partly understood in experimental animals. Under in vitro conditions, neuronal cells could be a useful tool to study the CHPV interaction with neuronal proteins. The information gathered from such studies will help to design the new therapeutics for CHPV infection. This study identified the surface vimentin protein involved in adsorption of CHPV on Neuro-2a cell line (mouse neuroblastoma cells). The decrease in CHPV infectivity to Neuro-2a cells was observed in the presence of recombinant vimentin or anti-vimentin antibody. Vimentin mRNA expression remains unaltered in CHPV infected Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted the residues in vimentin and CHPV glycoprotein (G); probably involved in cell-virus interactions. Overall, we conclude that surface vimentin in Neuro-2a cells interact with CHPV and facilitate the binding of CHPV to the cells; it could be acting as a co-receptor for the CHPV. Further investigation is necessary to confirm the exact role of vimentin in CHPV infection in neuronal cells.

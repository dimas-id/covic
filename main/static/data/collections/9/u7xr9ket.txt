Goldfish brain somatostatin-28 (gbSS-28) is present in brain and pituitary tissues of goldfish. We assessed whether gbSS-28 targets Ca(2+) and/or protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling cascades in inhibiting growth hormone (GH) release. gbSS-28 decreased basal GH release from primary cultures of dispersed goldfish pituitary cells and intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in goldfish somatotropes. gbSS-28 partially reduced [Ca(2+)](i) and GH responses induced by two endogeneous gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs), salmon (s)GnRH and chicken (c)GnRH-II. Furthermore, gbSS-28 reduced GH increases and abolished [Ca(2+)](i) elevations elicited by two PKC activators, tetradecanoyl 4beta-phorbol-13-acetate and dioctanyl glycerol. The PKC inhibitors GÃ¶6976 and Bis II abolished [Ca(2+)](i) responses to PKC activators, but only attenuated GnRH-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and did not alter basal [Ca(2+)](i). In cells pretreated with Bis II, gbSS-28 further reduced basal [Ca(2+)](i). Our results suggest that gbSS-28 inhibits GnRH-induced GH release in part by attenuating PKC-mediated GnRH [Ca(2+)](i) signals. gbSS-28 reduces basal GH release also via reduction in [Ca(2+)](i) but PKC is not involved in this regard.

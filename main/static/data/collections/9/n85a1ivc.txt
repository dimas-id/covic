Dengue virus NS1 is a glycoprotein of 46-50 kDa that is conserved among flaviviruses, associates as a dimer to cell membranes and is secreted as a hexamer to the extracellular milieu. Recent evidence showed that NS1 is secreted efficiently from infected mosquito cells. To explore the secretory route of NS1 in mosquito cells, infected cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD). The results showed that MβCD, but not BFA, significantly reduced the release of NS1. Moreover, silencing the expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1; a key component of the caveolar system that transports cholesterol inside the cell), but not SAR1 (a GTPase that participates in the classical secretory pathway), also results in a significant reduction of the secretion of NS1. These results indicate that NS1 is released from mosquito cells via an unconventional secretory route that bypasses the Golgi complex, with the participation of CAV1. In agreement with this notion, differences were observed in the glycosylation status between secreted NS1 and E proteins. Classical mechanics and docking simulations suggested highly favoured interactions between the caveolin-binding domain present in NS1 and the scaffolding domain of CAV1. Finally, proximity ligation assays showed direct interaction between NS1 and CAV1 in infected mosquito cells. These findings are in line with the lipoprotein nature of secreted NS1 and provide new insights into the biology of NS1.

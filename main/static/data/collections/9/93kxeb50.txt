Abstract COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to manifest with severe acute respiratory syndrome among the adults, however, it offers a convincing indication of less severity and fatality in pediatric age group (0-18 years). The current trend suggests that children may get infected but are less symptomatic with less fatality, which is concordant to earlier epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in 2002 and 2012, respectively. According to the available data, children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19, as adults constitute for maximum number of the confirmed cases (308,592) and deaths (13,069) as on 22nd March ( https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus ). However, rapid publications and information of the adult patients with COVID-19 is in progress and published, on the contrary, almost no comprehensive data or discussion about the COVID-19 in children is available. Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.

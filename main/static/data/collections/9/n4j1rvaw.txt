BACKGROUND Biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases are essential to facilitate disease diagnosis. Application of proteomics has greatly hastened the search for novel biomarkers. In this study, new potential biomarkers were discovered, and a diagnostic pattern was established for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) by using proteomic technology. METHODS Serum proteins from PD patients and controls were captured by magnetic bead-based weak cation exchange. The molecular weight of the proteins in bead-binding fraction was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Biomarker Wizard 3.1 and Biomarker Patterns Software were used for data analysis and constructing a model of biomarkers. A blinded testing set was used to validate the model. RESULTS A total of 17 discriminating m/z peaks related to PD were identified. The model based on the 5 biomarkers generated an excellent separation between PD and healthy controls with 98.36% for the sensitivity and 83.05% for the specificity. Blind test data demonstrated the model could recognize patients with PD with a sensitivity of 85.0% and a specificity of 70.0%. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary data suggested a potential application of MALDI-TOF-MS combined with magnetic beads. The model comprising 5 promising biomarkers can differentiate individuals with PD and the healthy subjects precisely.

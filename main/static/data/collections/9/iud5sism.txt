BACKGROUND The effect of closure of mesenteric defects to prevent complications, such as internal hernia, during laparoscopic colectomy remains controversial and is a subject of debate. PURPOSE This retrospective single-institution study aimed to clarify the clinical significance of mesenteric defect closure during a laparoscopic colectomy. METHODS We evaluated 58 patients who underwent laparoscopic right-side colectomy or transverse colectomy. The statistical relevance of complications, surgical maneuvers, and clinical factors was examined. RESULTS The mesenteric defects were closed in 30 patients and not closed in 28 patients. Two patients with ileus and 1 with a deep incisional surgical site infection required a second surgery. The reoperation rate was significantly higher in the nonclosure group than in the closure group (11% vs. 0%, respectively; P=0.033). CONSIDERATION Serious complications requiring reoperation occurred only in the nonclosure group. The procedure for closing the defect did not extend the operation time or increase the bleeding.

Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with a variety of presentations and unclear pathogenesis. Multiple sclerosis has been associated with the term autoimmunity as a surrogate for pathogenesis. Multiple sclerosis is an organ-specific disease with immune-mediated myelin destruction. Understanding the complex etiology of multiple sclerosis and the importance of axon integrity is critical for clinicians who treat the disease. This review discusses the immune and autoimmune aspects of multiple sclerosis based on the current published data and novel evidence of strategies that promote remyelination and protect axons.

On April 1, 2020, the confirmed global burden of COVID-19 was more than 900,000 with 46,413 deaths. Despite worldwide calls for social distancing and containment, the incidence of the disease continues to increase. COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). Preliminary analyses from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicated an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.3%; however the CFR was higher in older adults (14.8% in those 80Â± years) and 49% of all critical cases. Those with preexisting conditions (cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer) also had higher CRFs. In the United States, 116 million adults have hypertension, 26 million US adults have diabetes mellitus, 9% have preexisting CVD and may therefore be at greater risk of complications or adverse health outcomes from COVID-19 infection.

Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic significantly altered our daily life as well as our professional practice. COVID‐19 has disrupted our lives both professionally and personally. We know the urological management in a neurogenic patient needs to be tailored to the individual circumstances, this is even more pertinent during these uncertain times. International Continence Society is the premier international organization in functional urology. Lately, it has established an institute to facilitate teaching and training opportunities all over the world. The School of Neurourology teamed with the School of Modern Technology and set up a Webinar—“How to manage the neuro‐urological patients in the current pandemic.” This was set up as a case‐based discussion to deliberate the management of our patients in the present climate and examine the role of modern technology in overcoming the current barriers.

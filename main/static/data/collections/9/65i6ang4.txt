Recombinant proteins rN (nucleocapsid) and rH/Nh (hemagglutinin) of the measles virus strain NovO/96 of genotype A were obtained. The immunobiological properties of the proteins were studied in the reaction with a panel of positive and negative sera. BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant proteins and native antigen of the measles virus strain NovO/96 in order to obtain hyperimmune serum and its analysis using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and PRN (plaque reduction neutralization). The hyperimmune sera against recombinant proteins and native antigen of the measles virus strain NovO/96 were found to be highly active in ELISA. The antibodies against the proteins rN and rH/Nh were found to be capable of neutralizing the virus in titer 1 : 13.5 and 1 : 22.9, respectively. The neutralization titer of the antibodies generated against native antigen of the measles virus strain NovO/96 was 1 : 25.7.

As of April 17th, 2020, more than 2,190,010 COVID-19 cases with 147,010 deaths have been recorded worldwide. It has been suggested that a high mortality rate occurs in patients with severe disease and is associated with advanced age and underlying comorbidities, such as malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate chest CT features in patients with malignancy and concomitant COVID-19 infection. In fact, the imaging findings can be challenging and have not yet been fully understood in this setting. In this manuscript, we go over imaging findings in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 and known cancer. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and exponentially increasing incidence throughout the world, in at-risk and vulnerable populations such as patients with known malignancies, infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be included in the differential considerations even with atypical image pictures. Detection of superimposed infection in patients with cancers who present with pulmonary infiltrations warrant correlation with clinical picture, contact history, and RT-PCR confirmatory testing.

Abstract The recently emerged pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly, leading to a global pandemic. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with clinically significant lower level of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), which can be used as indicators of disease severity and poor prognosis. Importantly, we found the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2-S) bound to HDL. Antagonists of HDL receptor-Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1), strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the lipids transfer function of SR-B1 was indispensable for this inhibition, offering explanations for the reduced serum HDL level observed in COVID-19 patients. Basing on findings here, we speculate that SR-B1-mediated pulmonary HDL-vitamin E uptake could participate in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells, and the unique expression profile of SR-B1 may also affect SARS-CoV-2 cell and tissue tropism. These findings might help to provide further insights into viral transmission, pathological characteristics and reveal therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND The time-benefit relationship of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) according to the size of the core infarct has been incompletely explored in prior studies. We investigated whether established infarct core size on baseline imaging modifies the relationship between onset-to-reperfusion time (OTR) and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with EVT. METHODS We analyzed a database containing individual patient data pooled from three prospective Solitaire stent retriever studies. The inclusion criteria were treatment with a Solitaire device and achievement of substantial reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3). Main analyses were performed in patients with baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores (ASPECTSs) of 7-10. RESULTS Among the 305 patients (mean age 67±13 years, 58% women), the proportions of patients in different categories of pretreatment infarct extent were: small (ASPECTS 9-10) 52.0%, moderate (ASPECTS 7-8) 37.1%, and large (ASPECTS 0-6) 7.6%. The mean OTR was 297±95 min. At 3 months, 60.1% of the patients achieved a good outcome. For OTRs of 2-8 hours, the rates of good outcomes at all time points were higher with higher baseline ASPECTS but declined with similar steepness. Both baseline ASPECTS (OR 1.23 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.45)) and OTR (every 30 min delay, OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88)) were independently associated with a good 3-month outcome. No interaction between OTR and baseline ASPECTS was observed. CONCLUSIONS Although patients with higher baseline ASPECTS are more likely to have good clinical outcomes at all OTR intervals after 2 hours, this benefit consistently declines with time, even in patients with a small infarct core, reinforcing the need to treat all patients as quickly as possible.

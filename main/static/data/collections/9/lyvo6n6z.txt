Groundbreaking results concerning ischemic stroke (IS) hyperacute treatment worldwide were published in 2014 and 2015. We aimed to compare functional status after 3 months in patients treated with intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) and those treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone in Joinville, Brazil. From the Joinville Stroke Registry, we extracted and compared all consecutive IVT patients treated with r-tPA within 4.5 h in the period 2009-2011 versus all consecutive IAT treated within 6 h with the Solitaire FR device plus IVT in the period 2012-2014. We registered 82 patients in the IVT group and 31 patients in the IAT group. At hospital admission, patients in the IAT group were significantly younger (p < 0.001), had a higher educational level (p = 0.001), had a slightly higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.057) and had more severe strokes measured by the NIH stroke scale (p = 0.011). After 90 days, 45% of patients in the IAT group and 27% in the IVT group were independent (0-1 points) according to the modified Rankin scale (adjusted odds ratio: 4.53; 95% CI: 1.22 to 16.75). Symptomatic hemorrhage was diagnosed in 10% of patients in both groups (p = 1.0). The 90-day case-fatality was 39% (32/82) in the IVT group and 26% (8/31) in the IAT group (p = 0.27). In this small cohort, a greater rate of functional independence was achieved in patients treated with IAT plus IVT, compared with patients treated with IVT lysis alone. Our "real-world" findings are consistent with results of controlled, randomized clinical trials.

This paper introduces the tool Cycl[Formula: see text]n . The core functionality of Cycl[Formula: see text]n is to determine for a transition t of an unbounded Petri net whether or not t stops the net. A transition t stops the net (and is called a stop-transition) if each reachable marking of the net enables only finite occurrence sequences without occurrences of t. Cycl[Formula: see text]n provides a graphical user interface which also illustrates the graph structures leading to the computed result. This way, results are explained in a comprehensible manner, and the user gets a visual explanation of the cyclic behavior of the net causing these results.

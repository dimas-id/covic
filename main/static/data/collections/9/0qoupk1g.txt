Because salinity of coastal soils is drastically increasing, the application of biochars to saline-alkali soil amendments has attracted considerable attention. Various Solidago-canadensis-L.-derived biochars prepared through pyrolysis from 400 to 600 °C were applied to coastal saline-alkali soil samples to optimise the biochar pyrolysis temperature and investigate its actual ecological responses. All biochars reduced the soil bulk density and exchangeable sodium stress and increased soil water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, and organic matter content. Principal-component-analysis results showed that pyrolysis temperature played an important role in the potential application of biochars to improve the coastal saline-alkali soil, mainly contributed to ameliorating exchangeable sodium stress and decreasing biochar-soluble toxic compounds. Furthermore, soil bulk density and organic matter, as well as carboxylic acids, phenolic acids and amines of biochar were major driving factors for bacterial community composition. Compared to low-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed below 550 °C), which showed higher toxicity for Brassica chinensis L. growth due to the higher content of carboxylic acids, phenols and amines, high-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed at or above 550 °C) possessed less amounts of these toxic functional groups, more beneficial soil bacteria and healthier for plant growth. Therefore, high-temperature biochar could be applied as an effective soil amendment to ameliorate the coastal saline-alkali soil with acceptable environmental risk.

AIM This study reports a case undergoing laparoendoscopic totally extraperitoneal herniorrhpahy and transperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy through transumbilical single-site incisions. METHOD A 56-year-old man presented with incidental left renal tumor and bilateral inguinal hernia. Accordingly, a homemade single-port in subumbilicus was applied for totally extraperitoneal herniorrhpahy, following which the incisional wound was extended upward for transperitoneal radical nephrectomy as well. RESULTS No extraumbilical port was required. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. The peri- and postoperative course was quite smooth with rapid recovery, and the patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day. DISCUSSION The laparoendoscopic single-site surgery with homemade single-port allowed extraperitoneal and transperitoneal procedures to be carried out at the same time, which was feasible and safe with negligible complications. CONCLUSIONS Performing 2 procedures with single-site incision greatly diminished the number of port site incisions and offered obvious cosmetic advantage.

We aimed to describe typical radiological features and progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We reviewed the chest CT scans, laboratory findings, and clinical records of 66 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to affiliated hospitals of Nanchang university, Nanchang, China, from Jan 21 to Feb 2, 2020. CT was used to evaluate the radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Only 4 patients (4/66, 6%) claimed their exposure to COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The major symptoms were fever (60/66, 91%) and cough (37/66, 56%). The predominant features of lesion were scattered (43/66, 65%), bilateral (50/66, 76%), ground-glass opacity (64/66, 97%), and air bronchogram sign (47/66, 71%). Forty-eight patients (48/66, 73%) had more than two lobes involved. Right lower lobe (58/66, 88%) and left lower lobe (49/66, 74%) were most likely invaded. Twelve patients (12/66, 18%) had at least one comorbid condition. Pleural traction (29/66, 44%), crazy paving (15/66, 23%), interlobular septal thickening (11/66, 17%), and consolidation (7/66, 11%) were also observed. The typical radiology features of COVID-19 patients are scattered ground-glass opacity in the bilateral lobes. Fever and cough are the major symptoms. Evaluating chest CT, clinical symptoms, and laboratory results could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19, and judge disease progression.

BACKGROUND Tumor size is a criterion of staging in nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors as well as a predictor of outcome after curative resection. This study analyzes the correlation between tumor size and malignancy in patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors. METHODS All patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors who underwent curative resection (R0) at our institution between 1990 and 2008 were considered. Their clinicopathologic characteristics were compared among 3 different groups according to tumor size. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS Over the study period, 177 patients were identified. Overall, 90 patients (51%) had a tumor size ≤2 cm (group 1), 46 (26%) had tumor size between >2 cm and ≤4 cm (group 2), and 41 (23%) had tumor size >4 cm (group 3). Tumors ≤2 cm were more frequently incidentally discovered (group 1, 57% vs group 2, 51% vs group 3, 32%; P = .014) and benign (group 1, 81% vs group 2, 65% vs group 3, 5%; P < .0001). The presence of a nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor >2 cm and a nonincidental diagnosis of the tumor were independent predictors of malignancy at multivariable analysis. None of the 51 patients (29%) with a pancreatic endocrine tumor ≤2 cm that was incidentally diagnosed died of disease. CONCLUSION A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy in nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors was demonstrated. A nonoperative management could be advocated for tumors ≤2 cm when discovered incidentally.

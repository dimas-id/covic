Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly discovered parvovirus associated with respiratory disease in children. There are many reports worldwide on the endemicity of this virus. Since it is relatively new, detection in clinical laboratories is not routinely performed. We describe the first detection of HBoV in Malaysia in a 13-month-old boy with pneumonia and underlying asthma. The infective agent was confirmed by molecular methods.

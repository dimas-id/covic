Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been used in various unusual settings to assist breathing. NIV is now frequently used to treat exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disease. This paper discusses CPAP and NIV for postoperative hypoxemia, preventing intubation in high-risk bronchoscopy, respiratory failure in pandemics, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and respiratory support during percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.

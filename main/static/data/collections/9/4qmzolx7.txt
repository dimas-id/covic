OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence of respiratory viral infections in patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS 108 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected from 22 PID patients before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from July 2016 to July 2018 in the Department of Hematology. The TR-PCR was used to detect for respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus(RSV)，human metapneumoviros(hMPV)，coronavirus(CoV) and parainfluenza 1-3 (PIV1-3). And the clinical characteristics and co-infection were analyzed. RESULTS Among the total 108 specimens, viral pathogens were identified in 41 (37.96%) specimens. Among which the pathogens of highest detection rate was RSV (25.9%). Different types of PID showed different virus infection rates, among which the highest infection rate was severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients, with the virus detection rate was 57.9%. The incidence of co-infection with two or more than two viruses was 19.5%. CONCLUSION Patients with PID who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are more susceptible to respiratory viruses. RSV is an important respiratory tract virus pathogen after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

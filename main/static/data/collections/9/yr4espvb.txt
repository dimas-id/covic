Pneumonia represents a disease with significant epidemiological, clinical and also economical relevance. Diagnostic imaging is important for detection, differentiation and follow up of pneumonic infiltration. However morphology of pulmonary infiltration is unspecific, even with computed tomography (CT). Therefore determination of the underlying agent with imaging is generally limited and non infectious differential diagnosis has to be considered. Knowledge of special manifestations, distribution patterns and differential diagnoses of pneumonic infiltrations and consideration of clinical aspects is essential to narrow differential diagnosis and spectrum of infectious agents. CT of the chest is particularly important in opportunistic infections and in patients under intensive medical treatment.

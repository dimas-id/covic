Abstract The frequency of PRRSV corresponding to live vaccines and wild-type was determined in 902 pigs from North-Western Germany submitted for post-mortem examination. Overall, 18.5% of the samples were positive for the EU wild-type virus. EU genotype vaccine virus was detected in 1.3% and the NA genotype vaccine virus in 8.9% of all samples. The detection of the EU vaccine was significantly higher in pigs vaccinated with the corresponding vaccine (OR=9.4). Pigs vaccinated with NA genotype had significantly higher detection chances for the corresponding vaccine virus when compared to non-vaccinated animals (OR=3.34) animals, however, NA vaccine was also frequently detected in non-vaccinated pigs. Concluding, the dynamics of NA genotype vaccine and EU wild-type virus corresponds with studies on PRRSV spread in endemically infected herds. The potential of spontaneous spread of the NA genotype vaccine should be considered in the planning of eradication programs.

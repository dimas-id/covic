Abstract A comprehensive overview on methods applied for syntheses of β-amino-α-trifluoromethyl alcohols, including stereocontrolled variants, is presented. In addition, reported cases of the exploration of β-amino-α-trifluoromethyl alcohols for the preparation of trifluoromethylated peptidomimetics and other biologically active, fluorinated compounds are discussed. Attractive opportunities for their applications as organocatalysts are also presented.

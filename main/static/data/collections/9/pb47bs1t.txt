Abstract A coronavirus (Kakegawa isolate) isolated from a cow with epizootic diarrhea was grown in BEK-1 cells and examined for biophysical and biochemical properties. The Kakegawa isolate was able to replicate in the presence or absence of 5-iodo-2′-deoxy-uridine, indicating that its viral nucleic acid was RNA. It was highly sensitive to ether and chloroform, and moderately sensitive to trypsin and heat. It was, however, readily stabilized by treatment with cation at 50°C for 1 h. Its infectivity was slightly reduced at pH 3.0. The virus passed through a membrane filter of 200 nm pore size, but not through one of 100 nm pore size. The buoyant density of the virus was determined in a sucrose density gradient. The peak of infectivity and hemagglutinin activity was found at a density of 1.182. Neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests showed a close serological relationship between the Kakegawa isolate and the American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus.

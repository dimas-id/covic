New glycyrrhizic acid (GA) conjugates were synthesized with the use of tert-butyl esters of amino acids or benzyl esters of dipeptides; they contained two residues of L-amino acids (Met, Phe, Pro, and Ile or dipeptides Gly-Leu and Gly-Phe). Activation of GA carboxy groups was carried out with the help of N-hydroxysuccinimide, N,Nâ€²-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or N-hydroxybenzotriazole with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. A proline-containing GA derivative is a low-toxic substance; it raises the level of agglutinins by 3.7 times in the blood of mice and 3 times that of hemolysins compared with the control. Dipeptide GA derivatives possess an expressed anti-HIV-1 activity in cultures of MT-4 cells and are 90-70 times less cytotoxic than azidothymidine. The selectivity index of the compounds exceeds those of GA by 110 and 34 times, respectively.

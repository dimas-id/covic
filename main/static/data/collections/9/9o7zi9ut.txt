This review presents the applications of intestinal cell models of human and pig origin in food and nutritional sciences and highlights their potential as in vitro platforms for preclinical research. Intestinal cell models are used in studies of bioavailability, adsorption and transport in nutritional or toxicological settings, allergic effects of food components, as well as probiotics and/or hostâ€“pathogen gut interactions. In addition, this review discusses the advantages of using specialized and functional cell models over generic cancer-derived cell lines.

There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure development is contingent on the availability of robust, scalable, and readily deployable surrogate viral assays to screen antiviral humoral responses, and define correlates of immune protection, and to down-select candidate antivirals. Here, we describe a highly infectious recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S as its sole entry glycoprotein that closely resembles the authentic agent in its entry-related properties. We show that the neutralizing activities of a large panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera can be assessed in high-throughput fluorescent reporter assay with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S and that neutralization of the rVSV and authentic SARS-CoV-2 by spike-specific antibodies in these antisera is highly correlated. Our findings underscore the utility of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S for the development of spike-specific vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of viral entry and its inhibition.

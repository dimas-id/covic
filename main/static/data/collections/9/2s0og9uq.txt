BACKGROUND: This study will explore the effect of advanced nursing care (ANC) on psychological disorder (PD) in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study will search the following electronic databases up to June 30, 2020: Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, OpenGrey, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, CNKI, and WANGFANG. We will not impose any language limitations. Two authors will independently identify titles/abstracts and full-text of all potential studies, and will collect data from eligible studies. Additionally, study quality will be assessed by Cochrane risk of bias. If necessary, we will conduct meta-analysis if sufficient trials are included. RESULTS: This study will explore the effect of ANC on PD in patients with COVID-19 through outcome indicators. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study may supply summarized evidence of ANC for the management of PD in COVID-19. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42020187610.

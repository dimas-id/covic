Consider (2,1) and (1,2) random walks with asymptotically zero drifts. Let $M$ be the maximum of an excursion starting from $2$ and ending at some point below $2.$ We study the distribution of $M$ and characterize its asymptotics, which are quite different from the ones of simple random walks. Our methods are based on the asymptotics of product of 2-by-2 nonnegative matrices and continued fractions. So, we also get a limit theorem of the product of nonnegative 2-by-2 matrices which has its own interest. Let $A_kA_{k-1}\cdots A_1$ be the product of some nonnegative 2-by-2 matrices. Under certain conditions, we show that $\forall i,j= 1,2,$ $(A_kA_{k-1}\cdots A_1)_{i,j}\sim c\varrho(A_k)\varrho(A_{k-1})\cdots \varrho(A_1)$ as $k\rightarrow\infty,$ where $\varrho(A_n)$ is the spectral radius of $A_n$ and $c\in(0,\infty)$ is some constant.

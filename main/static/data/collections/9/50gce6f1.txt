Abstract The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein binds viral RNA to form the ribonucleocapsid and regulate RNA synthesis. The interaction of N protein with viral RNA was investigated using circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance. N protein underwent a conformational change upon binding viral RNA and the data indicated electrostatic interactions were involved in the binding of the protein to RNA. Kinetic analysis suggested the amino-terminal region facilitates long-range non-specific interactions between N protein and viral RNA, thus bringing the RNA into close proximity to N protein allowing specific contacts to form via a ‘lure’ and ‘lock’ mechanism.

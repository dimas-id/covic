Acute infectious gastroenteritis cases in Shanghai, reported over three years, were analyzed. Pathogens were identified in 1031 patients; of these, 725 and 306 were bacterial and viral cases, respectively. Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella were the dominant bacteria, and Caliciviridae and Reoviridae were the dominant viral families in the local area. The acute gastroenteritis epidemic peaks appeared in August and January, which represented the active peak periods of bacteria and viruses, respectively. Logistic regression analyses with sex stratification showed that abdominal pain, fever and ingestion of unsafe food at restaurants were independent factors more frequently associated with bacterial gastroenteritis irrespective of sex; red cell-positive fecal matter was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.28 only in males; and white blood cell count was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an OR of 1.02 only in females. Pathogen stratification showed that age, vomiting and red cell-positive fecal matter were associated with males with ORs of 0.99, 0.61 and 1.71, respectively, in bacterial gastroenteritis; and the migrant ratio was higher in males with an OR of 2.29 only in viral gastroenteritis. In conclusion, although bacterial and viral gastroenteritis shared many features, epidemiological and clinical factors differed between sexes and pathogens.

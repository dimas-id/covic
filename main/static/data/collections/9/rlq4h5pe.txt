OBJECTIVE To report on the impact of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak on the attendances of a major teaching hospital ED. METHODS Two periods were studied. The first was prior to the closure of the ED due to SARS and the second was after re-opening of the ED. Data on attendances, discharge against medical advice, triage categories, trauma and ambulance cases were retrieved from the computer and compared with the data in the same periods in 2002. RESULTS In the first period, when compared with 2002 there was a significant decrease in the mean daily attendance (397 vs 524), trauma cases (68 vs 111), minor cases (category 4: 283 vs 361, and category 5: 20 vs 43). In the second period, there was a significant decrease in the mean daily attendance (265 vs 545), trauma cases (40 vs 111), minor cases (category 4:181 vs 376, and category 5: 12 vs 45), discharge against medical advice (4 vs 6 daily) and ambulance cases (70 vs 86 daily). Patients requiring immediate care however, remained similar. CONCLUSION There was a significant drop in the overall ED attendance, trauma cases and minor cases after the outbreak of SARS. Possible causes include changes in community behaviour, resulting in a lower incidence of trauma and disease and fear of presenting to hospital and contracting SARS.

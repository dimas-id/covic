In the current trends, face recognition has a remarkable attraction towards favorable and inquiry of an image. Several algorithms are utilized for recognizing the facial expressions, but they lack in the issues like inaccurate recognition of facial expression. To overcome these issues, a Graph-based Feature Extraction and Hybrid Classification Approach (GFE-HCA) is proposed for recognizing the facial expressions. The main motive of this work is to recognize human emotions in an effective manner. Initially, the face image is identified using the Violaâ€“Jones algorithm. Subsequently, the facial parts such as right eye, left eye, nose and mouth are extracted from the detected facial image. The edge-based invariant transform feature is utilized to extract the features from the extracted facial parts. From this edge-based invariant features, the dimensions are optimized using Weighted Visibility Graph which produces the graph-based features. Also, the shape appearance-based features from the facial parts are extracted. From these extracted features, facial expressions are recognized and classified using a Self-Organizing Map based Neural Network Classifier. The performance of this GFE-HCA approach is evaluated and compared with the existing techniques, and the superiority of the proposed approach is proved with its increased recognition rate.

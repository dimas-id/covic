A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of April 7, 2020, the new coronavirus has spread quickly to 184 countries and aroused the attention of the entire world. No targeted drugs have yet been available for intervention and treatment of this virus. The sharing of academic information is crucial to risk assessment and control activities in outbreak countries. In this review, we summarize the epidemiological, genetic and clinical characteristics of the virus as well as laboratory testing and treatments to understand the nature of the virus. We hope this review will be helpful to prevent viral infections in outbreak countries and regions.

OBJECTIVE: Linking electronic health records (EHR) of pediatric and adult patients living in the same household has the potential to improve chronic care management efficiencies by facilitating the delivery of services to multiple household members at once. However, little is known about relationship between the chronic medical (CM) and behavioral health (CBH) of adults and children living in common households. METHODS: EHR data for children were linked to the EHR data of adults living at the same address during the same time in a retrospective cohort study from 2006 to 2014 to evaluate associations between adult and child CM and CBH conditions within a Boston safety-net primary care patient sample. RESULTS: Of the 13,845 included children, 61.6% lived with at least one adult with &#8805; 1 CM or CBH condition. Compared to children living with an adult(s) without a chronic condition, children living with an adult with a CM or CBH condition had a respective 16.2% and 18.1% increased likelihood of having a chronic condition themselves, with multiple adult chronic conditions in adults increasing children's likelihood. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: We found a positive association between the chronic diseases of adult and child household members. Given the clustering of child and adult chronic disease within households, using EHR data to support the care management needs of multiple members of households may be a promising approach to improving child and adult health in safety-net settings.

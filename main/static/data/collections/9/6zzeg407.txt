The involvement of the greater omentum in reconstructive, abdominal and thoracic surgery is based on its manifold qualities, which include immunological support, lymphatic drainage, angiogenesis, adhesion, haemostasis and fat storage. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the greater omentum could be extended to the head. In addition, we evaluated the surgical procedures necessary for this extension. Our study reveals that specific surgical lengthening techniques of the greater omentum, such as dorsal extension and inverted L-shape elongation, are necessary to successfully transpose the omentum to the head in cats. As the survival of the omentum after transposition procedures is still unknown, its application in chronic non-healing wounds of the head in cats warrants further investigation.

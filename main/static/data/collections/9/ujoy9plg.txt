BACKGROUND This study evaluated the outcomes of laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) simultaneous bilateral hernia repair with regard to the effectiveness and the complications compared with those of unilateral laparoscopic TEP hernia repair. METHODS One hundred twelve patients underwent laparoscopic TEP for bilateral inguinal hernia and 767 patients underwent laparoscopic TEP for a unilateral hernia from March 2004 to January 2010. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was older in bilateral group than that in the unilateral group, and the proportion of female patients was lower in the bilateral group. The distribution of the types of hernia was different in both the groups (P<0.001). The mean operation time and the mean patient cost for TEP in the bilateral group were 1.5 times longer and more expensive than that in the unilateral group. However, there were no differences in the mean number of hospital days and postoperative complications. There was 1 recurrence in the bilateral group, but it had no statistical significance (P=0.127). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TEP repair is safe and feasible for treating bilateral inguinal hernia. Bilateral repair also has some advantages such as no additional admission, a decreased operation time, and cost-effectiveness.

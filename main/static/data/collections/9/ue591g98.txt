OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to describe and evaluate an experimental model of neonatal normocapnic hypoxia and resuscitation. METHODS Ten male Landrace/Large White neonatal piglets were studied. Following anaesthesia and intubation, the animals were mechanically ventilated. Surgical procedures included catheterization of the right internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. After stabilization with 21% O(2), normocapnic hypoxia was induced by decreasing the inspired O(2) to 6-8%. When piglets developed bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min), reoxygenation was initiated by administering 21% O(2). Arterial blood samples were taken during baseline, hypoxia and reoxygenation in order to measure interleukine-6 and interleukine-8. RESULTS Nine out of ten animals were successfully resuscitated (one of these required chest compressions and a dose of adrenaline) and one died despite resuscitation efforts. After returning to baseline haemodynamic values, euthanasia was performed using thiopental overdose. CONCLUSIONS Haemodynamic fluctuations at baseline, during normocapnic hypoxia and reoxygenation in Landrace/Large White piglets are comparable to that in human neonates, making the breed a favorable model of human neonatal hypoxia investigation.

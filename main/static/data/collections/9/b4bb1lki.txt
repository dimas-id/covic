This chapter could also be called eco-epidemiological basics or background information for zoonoses and sapronoses. Epidemiology is the study of the process of the origin and spread of transmissible (communicable) infectious diseases of man, and their control. The modern conception of epidemiology is broader in that it also includes non-infectious diseases (such as diabetes, heart attack, cardiovascular diseases and carcinomas) and variables that influence their distribution in the human population. In both the classical and modern conception of epidemiology, these factors include variables concerning the host (age, sex, nutrition, occupation), the agent (virulence, antigenic variability), and the environment (chemical factors, contamination, emissions, temperature, precipitation and humidity, illumination, ionising radiation, noise etc.). Epidemiological data are then analysed, and the results of these studies can then be used for the prevention and control of these human diseases.

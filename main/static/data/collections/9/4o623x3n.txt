HBoV is an emergent virus, which is frequently detected as a co‐infective agent. However, it can cause disease on its own. It is associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal illness in children and adults, whether immunocompetent or immunocompromised. We report HBoV infection in a child post‐liver transplantation, who presented with persistent fever and mild tachypnea, 3 weeks after a successful transplant. She recovered spontaneously with no graft dysfunction.

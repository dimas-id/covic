Robotic technology may be a promising tool in reduction of morbidity in radical anterior pelvic exenteration for invasive bladder cancer. We report our initial experience with robotic-assisted radical anterior pelvic exenteration in females in an attempt to evaluate the technique's feasibility and outcomes. A retrospective review of our bladder cancer database was performed. Twelve women that underwent robotic-assisted radical anterior pelvic exenteration, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and urinary diversion for clinically localized urothelial carcinoma of the bladder between 2004 and 2008 were included in this retrospective study. Median age was 73.0 +/- 9.6 years and median body mass index (BMI) was 23.5 +/- 5.0 kg/m2. Ten patients underwent ileal conduit diversion, one had an orthotopic neobladder and one an Indiana pouch. Median total operating time was 6.4 +/- 1.5 hours with median console and diversion times of 4.7 +/- 0.9 and 2.5 +/- 1.5 hours respectively. Median blood loss was 275.0 +/- 165.8 ml. Median length of stay was 8.0 +/- 1.6 days. Four patients were T2N0 or less, five T3N0, one T3N1 and two patients T4N0. There was one patient with positive surgical margins. Median number of lymph nodes removed was 23.0 +/- 11.4. Median follow-up of 9.0 +/- 6.0 months was available for ten patients. One had a recurrent ureteroenteric stricture, one had colpocleisis for vault prolapse, and three had metastatic disease. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic anterior pelvic exenteration appears to be a favorable surgical option with acceptable operative, pathological, and short-term clinical outcomes. According to the UCI experience, robotic anterior exenteration appears to achieve the clinical and oncologic goals for the surgical treatment of bladder cancer.

Background: The implementation of rescue efforts for delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remains largely empirical for a lack of supporting evidence, while the associated risk profile is also unclear. Objective: The present study evaluates the safety and efficacy of endovascular rescue treatment (ERT, continuous intraarterial nimodipine; IAN, transcutaneous balloon angioplasty, TBA). Methods: In this prospective observational study, we assessed periprocedural complications and side effects in context of ERT. We evaluated neurological status, multimodal neuromonitoring (ptiO2, lactate/pyruvate ratio, transcranial doppler), and cranial imaging (CTP, DSA). All parameters were included into multivariate analysis to determine predictors for the need of retreatment. Results: We included 33 consecutive patients with 54 ERT (IAN n = 35; TBA n = 13; TBA + IAN n = 6). We recorded no serious complications and initial improvement in all parameters (neurostatus 72.3% of patients; ptiO2 15.0 ± 11.7 to 25.8 ± 15.5 mmHg, p < 0.0001; lactate/pyruvate ratio 46.3 ± 27.5 to 31.0 ± 9.7, p <0.05; transcranial doppler 139.0 ± 46.3 to 98.9 ± 29.6 cm/s, p < 0.05; CTP 81.6% of patients; DSA 93.1% of patients). Retreatment (n = 16, 48.5%) was independently associated with preinterventional ptiO2 < 5 mmHg (p <0.01) and early (<72 h) discontinuation of IAN treatment (p = 0.08). DCI related cerebral infarction was noted in n = 8 patients (24.2%). At 3 months after discharge, favorable outcome was noted for n = 11 (35.5%) patients. Conclusion: Provided a detailed decision tree, timely ERT can provide a relatively safe and effective treatment option in those highly-selected patients undergoing multimodality monitoring where conservative treatment options are exhausted. Continuous treatment in particular may be suitable to surpass sustained DCI and was associated with a low rate of DCI related infarction and comparably high percentage of good outcome.

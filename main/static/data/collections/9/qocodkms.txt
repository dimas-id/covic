This study aimed to investigate viral infections and the prevalence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Shijiazhuang, China, in 2011 and to provide a scientific basis for the diagnosis and control of respiratory tract infections. Throat swab specimens were collected from 483 cases of ILI who were outpatients in the influenza surveillance sentinel hospitals in Shijiazhuang between January and December 2011. All specimens were examined by multiplex RT-PCR for the following 15 respiratory tract viruses: adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV types 1-4), influenza virus A (FluA), influenza virus B (FluB), human enterovirus (HEV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-A and -B), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV-229E/NL63 and -OC43/HKU1), and human bocavirus (HBoV). Among the 483 cases of ILI, 214 (44.31%) were positive for viruses, including ADV (8.7%), HEV (8.7%), RSV-A (8.07%), HRV (7.45%), FluA (5.38%), HCoV-OC43/ HKU1 (2.9%), PIV-3 (2.9%), HMPV (1.86%), PIV-1 (1.24%), HCoV-229E/NL63 (1.04%), PIV-2 (1.04%), HBoV (0.83%), and FluB (0.41%). Twenty-six (5.38%) of all cases were co-infected with two or more viruses, most commonly HEV/HRV with other viruses. Cases of viral infection were detected throughout the year, with peaks in January and February. ADV and HRV were detected throughout almost the whole year without obvious seasonality. HEV was detected between April and November, with a peak of prevalence in summer and autumn. FluA and FluB reached epidemic levels mainly in winter and spring. All cases of RSV were identified to be subtype A. PIV infection was mainly caused by PIV-3. The positive rate of HCoV-OC43/HKU1 infection was significantly higher than that of HCoV-229E/NL63. The leading five viruses that resulted in ILI Shijiazhuang in 2011 were HEV, ADV, RSV-A, HRV, and FluA, and these viruses have different epidemiological features.

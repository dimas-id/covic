There is arguably more evidence to support the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than any other practice related to the care of patients with acute respiratory failure. Despite this strong evidence base, NIV seems to be under-utilized and the failure rate (need for intubation) may be as high as 40%. Some of these failures potentially relate to asynchrony, although the relationship between asynchrony and NIV failure has not been well studied. Good NIV tolerance has been associated with success of NIV, and improved comfort has been associated with better synchrony. In one study a high rate of asynchrony occurred in 43% of patients during NIV. Asynchrony is commonly associated with leaks. Thus, reducing the leak related to the interface and using a ventilator with good leak compensation should reduce the rate of asynchrony. Asynchronies can also be related to the underlying disease process. This paper reviews issues related to asynchrony during NIV and suggests strategies that might be used to correct asynchrony when it occurs.

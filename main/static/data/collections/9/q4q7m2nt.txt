PURPOSE To compare the feasibilities and efficacies of the total extraperitoneal (TEP) technique and laparotomy for incarcerated obturator hernia repair. METHODS All study subjects were diagnosed with incarcerated obturator hernia, preoperatively and TEP was performed as for TEP groin hernia repair. The incarcerated intestine was retracted into the peritoneal cavity with the hernia sac. The obturator foramen was then covered with a rectangular mesh (9 Ã— 13 cm), which also covered the internal inguinal ring, Hesselbach's triangle, and the femoral ring. Non-ischemia of the incarcerated bowel was confirmed laparoscopically. In patients undergoing laparotomy, the obturator foramen was closed by continuous sutures, and no prosthesis was used. We recorded the length of hospital stay, operative time, amount of intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative complications. RESULTS Twenty-two patients underwent obturator hernia repair in our hospital between January 2000 and December 2012, of whom 10 were treated with laparotomy and the remaining 12 via TEP. Three patients undergoing TEP were converted to laparotomy. The operation time was significantly longer in the conversion group compared with either the laparotomy or the TEP groups. There was no difference between the laparotomy and TEP groups regarding intraoperative bleeding. Patients who underwent TEP without conversion had a significantly shorter hospital stay than those who underwent laparotomy or required conversion. CONCLUSIONS TEP provides a suitable approach for incarcerated obturator hernia repair, with favorable results regarding hospital stay. TEP is a feasible, minimally invasive technique for the repair of incarcerated obturator hernias.

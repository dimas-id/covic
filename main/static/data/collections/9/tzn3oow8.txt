Background: The study examined the difference in the expression of the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) between anaesthesia with propofol and isoflurane in rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with xylazine 20 µg/g by intraperitoneal injection and maintained with propofol or isoflurane. Myocardial IRI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 1 hour. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the expression of RACK1 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and the heart injury score were compared between the two groups. Results: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis with ROS was significantly lower in the propofol group than in the isoflurane group. The propofol group had significantly higher RACK1 expression and lower TLR4 expression, compared with the isoflurane group (RACK1, 1970.50 ± 120.50 vs. 1350.20 ± 250.30, p<0.05; TLR4, 980.50 ± 110.75 vs. 1275.50 ± 75.35, p<0.05). However, the heart injury scores in the two groups did not differ significantly (3.56 ± 0.29 vs. 4.33 ± 0.23 in the propofol and isoflurane groups, respectively, p=0.33). Conclusion: There were significant differences in inflammation and apoptosis, including the expression of RACK1 and TLR4, after myocardial IRI between the propofol and isoflurane groups. However, both groups had similar heart injury scores.

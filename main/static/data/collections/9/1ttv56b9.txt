BACKGROUND: The potential risks of increased alcohol use and of the development of alcohol dependence during COVID-19 pandemic were identified. So far there have been no studies concerning pandemic influence on alcohol consumption in medical professionals in quarantine or isolation. METHODS: The 12 point 'online' ALCOVID survey with a cover letter was designed and addressed to physicians, recruited online via accessible networks, who underwent isolation or quarantine during recent pandemic. The AUDIT-3 scale was included. RESULTS: A representative trial of 113 physicians participated in the study. Over 53% of screened doctors revealed that the amounts of the consumed alcohol have escalated; almost 20% of subjects binged over seven standard drinks for one occasion. Close to every second used six or more drinks on one occasion. Over 40% used alcohol more than four times per week. Female used alcohol more often and more standard drinks per occasion. Male binged more. Anxiety and hopelessness were the most common motives to drink. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption in physicians in quarantine has threateningly increased. It is important to identify the group of people at the risk of problem drinking and dependence development, especially when it concerns key professional branches in the fight against the current crisis.

Livestock vaccines aim to increase livestock product and improve the health and welfare of livestock animals in a cost-efficient manner and prevent disease transmission. Successful livestock vaccines have been generated for pathogens including bacterial, viral, protozoan, and multicellular pathogens. These livestock vaccines have a significant effect on animal health and products and on human health through growing safe food procurement and preventing zoonotic diseases. There are successful production of biotechnological-based animal vaccines licensed for use that include virus-like particle vaccines, gene-deleted marker vaccines, subunit vaccines, DIVA vaccines, and DNA vaccines.

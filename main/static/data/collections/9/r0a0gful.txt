OBJECTIVES The study investigated the efficacy and safety of a balloon expandable, sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) in patients with symptomatic infrapopliteal arterial disease. BACKGROUND Results of infrapopliteal interventions using balloon angioplasty and/or bare stents are limited by a relatively high restenosis rate, which could be potentially improved by stabilizing the lesion with a SES. METHODS Two hundred patients (total lesion length 27 Â± 21 mm) were randomized to infrapopliteal SES stenting or percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA). The primary endpoint was 1-year in-segment binary restenosis by quantitative angiography. RESULTS Ninety-nine and 101 patients (mean age 73.4 years; 64% diabetics) were randomized to SES and PTA, respectively (8 crossover bailout cases to SES). At 1 year, there were lower angiographic restenosis rates (22.4% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.019), greater vessel patency (75.0% vs. 57.1%, p =0.025), and similar death, repeat revascularization, index-limb amputation rates, and proportions of patients with improved Rutherford class for SES versus PTA. CONCLUSIONS SES implantation may offer a promising therapeutic alternative to PTA for treatment of infrapopliteal peripheral arterial disease.

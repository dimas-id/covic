OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to explore nursing methods as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients. It can be used for reference by nursing colleagues to improve the treatment success rate of critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with ECMO and reduce the mortality rate. METHODS: The clinical data of three critically ill COVID-19 patients who underwent ECMO therapy and their nursing measures were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Two patients were successfully removed from ECMO while one patient died. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease with a high case fatality rate. Strict prevention, timely observation, effective management of complications and smooth running of ECMO are key ways in successfully treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.

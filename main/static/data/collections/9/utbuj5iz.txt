Bacterial pneumonia is a common clinical diagnosis in dogs but seems to occur less commonly in cats. Underlying causes include viral infection, aspiration injury, and foreign body inhalation. Identification of the organisms involved in disease, appropriate use of antibiotics and adjunct therapy, and control of risk factors for pneumonia improve management.

The paper presents an ongoing research project aimed towards the development of an approach to modeling of information spreading in complex organizations during providing service to customers and performing domain-specific business processes (BP). The approach is based on the idea of information spreading modeling and includes the view of this process in three main levels (physical, informational, and technical). The multi-layer view enables the integration and automation of obtained models in order to resolve domain-specific tasks of BP understanding, optimization, and extension. Two domain-specific case studies from healthcare and HR-management were considered within the approach proposing a way to resolve existing problems.

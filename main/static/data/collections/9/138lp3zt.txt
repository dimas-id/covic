PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Younger generations of physicians are using technology more fluently than previous generations. This has significant implications for healthcare as these digital natives become a majority of the populationâ€™s patients, clinicians, and healthcare leaders. RECENT FINDINGS: Historically, healthcare has been slow to adopt new technology. Many physicians have attributed burnout symptoms to technology-related causes like the EMR. This is partly due to policies and practices led by those who were less familiar and comfortable with using new technologies. SUMMARY: Younger physicians will drive technological advancement and integration faster than previous generations, allowing technology to adapt more quickly to serve the needs of clinicians and patients. These changes will improve efficiency, allow more flexible working arrangements, and increase convenience for patients and physicians. The next generation of physicians will use technology to support their work and lifestyle preferences, making them more resilient to burnout than previous generations.

Taking responsibility for prescribing is one of newly qualified doctors' greatest stressors.1 Despite being a routine task, prescribing insulin is particularly stress-inducing. The global pandemic has made it more important to minimise transitioning students' stress; yet there are fewer clinicians to support their accelerated transitions. We had planned an intervention during 9-week 'Clinical Assistantships' immediately before qualifying. Students would write insulin 'pre-prescriptions', which supervisors would endorse as prescriptions that were appropriate to dispense. A trained healthcare professional or person with diabetes ('debriefer') would conduct one-to-one Case Based discussions (CBDs) to help students learn reflectively from experience.

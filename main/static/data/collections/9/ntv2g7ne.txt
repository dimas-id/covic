The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 2020. Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and hypertension. Patient-related outcomes are worse if there are associated comorbidities. We do not have enough evidence regarding the most appropriate management of patients with diabetes during COVID-19 infection. Insulin resistance and CVD together increase the inflammatory state of the body, which can contribute to and perhaps mediate the increase of COVID-19 severity. Hence, in addition to management of dysglycemia, other CVD risk factors should be targeted. We explore the possible pathophysiologic links between diabetes and COVID-19 and discuss various options to treat dysglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the era of COVID-19.

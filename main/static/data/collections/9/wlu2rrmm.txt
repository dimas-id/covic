An epidemiological survey of porcine diarrheal disease prevalence between September 2011 and January 2012 revealed that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) contributed to outbreaks of diarrhea in pig farms in Shanghai, China. The distribution profile of 10 PEDV strains revealed three distinct genotypes coexisting in the same pig farm. Two of the ten field strains that were isolated exhibited a distinct evolution from the others. In addition to PEDV, other enteric pathogens, including porcine kobuvirus, porcine teschovirus and Lawsonia intracellularis, were identified.

Abstract Hotels in China are attempting to adopt outsourcing. However, they are not always successful. This study investigated outsourcing strategy as perceived by hotel managers in Shanghai, and identified the relationship between the determinant factors in the adoption of outsourcing and types of hotel ownership and job levels of managers. In-depth interviews and self-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. The results show that in China the outsourcing market is still immature. The incompleteness of laws is a hindrance to the adoption of outsourcing and the compatibility between the corporate cultures of the hotels and the outsourcing vendors is critical.

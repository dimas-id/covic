Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is a well-established technique to treat apical vaginal prolapse. De novo micturition disorders, pelvic pain, and defecation disorders have been reported and may be due to intraoperative compromise of the superior hypogastric plexus. The video demonstrates our technique for nerve-sparing laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. The patient is a 62-year-old woman with symptomatic stage III posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse. Key steps of the procedure are opening the peritoneum at the level of the promontory, identification of the fibers of the superior hypogastric plexus, deep anterior and posterior dissection with attachment of the mesh to the vagina, displacement of the nerve fibers to the left side during suturing of the mesh to the longitudinal ligament, and complete peritonealization. This technique of the identification and protection of relevant nerve structures appears to be reproducible and can be considered by surgeons who perform laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy.

Abstract Herein we report a series of novel chloramphenicol amine derivatives as aminopeptidase N (APN)/CD13 inhibitors. All compounds were synthesized starting from commercially available (1S,2S)-2-amino-1-(4-nitrophenyl) propane-1,3-diol. The preliminary biological screening showed that some compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity against APN. It should be noted that one compound, 13b (IC50 =7.1μM), possess similar APN inhibitory activity compared with Bestatin (IC50 =3.0μM).

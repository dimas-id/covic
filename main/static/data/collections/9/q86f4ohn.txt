Operative approach for right colectomy has progressed substantially in last decades, by the application of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery. Single-port (SP) laparoscopic surgery is one of the newest branches of advanced laparoscopy. A 29-year-old woman with ileocecal Crohn's disease underwent a totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP right colectomy, assisted by vaginal access. The operation time was 140 minutes. The blood loss was 20 mL. The patient was allowed to drink fluids and a soft oral diet on the first day postoperatively. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications were observed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4. The wound size was 2.5 cm. The umbilical scar was almost invisible on postoperative day 7. Totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP right colectomy with vaginal access is a feasible procedure, providing a scarless surgery, ensuring the preservation of the body image.

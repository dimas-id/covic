PURPOSE: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may cure approximately 50% of patients, however, a significant part of the other half might benefit from a high-quality palliative care medicine at the end of life. Somatic, psychic and spiritual needs of these patients may differ from those of patients suffering from incurable solid tumours and are not comprehensively evaluated so far. METHODS: To address this question, data from charts of 123 patients who have died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were extracted. In detail, the time line of the clinical course, the symptoms, the administered drugs and other applied procedures were analysed. RESULTS: Approximately one half of the patients, who have died after stem cell transplantation, did not live more than 5 months. Two-thirds of patients died within 14 months after SCT. 28.5% of the patients could not be discharged after transplantation. However, a significant proportion had a low ECOG-score (0â€“1) prior to death, indicating a high degree of mobility. Major symptoms were weakness, fatigue and need for aid at daily activities. Severe pain, dyspnoea and obstipation, as known from patients suffering from advanced solid tumours, were rare. In consequence, use of opioids seemed to be less frequent than in patients with solid tumours. Measures of intensive care and i.v.-drug administration were applied to a significant proportion of patients. CONCLUSION: The present investigation indicates that the somatic, psychic and spiritual end-of-life-care after allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be optimised. A significant problem for the transplantation team seems to be the realisation of necessity to switch the curative concept into a palliative ambition. Requirements are a subsequent prospectively conducted investigation and an intensification of cooperation between transplant and palliative care teams.

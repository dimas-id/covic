INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Peritonization of mesh during sacrohysteropexy is generally advocated to prevent adhesions to the viscera; however, randomized clinical trials are lacking, and peritonization may not be completely possible in a laparoscopic hysteropexy procedure. Our main objective was to describe a basic experimental rat sacrohysteropexy model. We hypothesized that even when peritoneal closure was omitted, using composite mesh would result in less adhesions to the viscera. METHODS Twenty in-bred female virgin Wistar Hannover rats were used in this study. Standardized hysteropexy procedure and adhesion model is described step by step with two different mesh materials: polypropylene and a composite polyester. Mesh was anchored between the posterior cervix and anterior longitudinal ligament of the lumbar vertebrae. Macroscopic adhesion scores and histopathological tissue reaction was investigated. RESULTS Macroscopically, the surface area involved in adhesions was similar between groups. However, adhesions in the polypropylene group were more dense, required sharp dissection for lysis, and yielded higher total macroscopic adhesion scores (p < 0.001). Histologically, a more pronounced host inflammatory response was encountered in the polyester group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS We describe a rat hysteropexy model and a previously established uterine adhesion model. Adhesion scores in the composite mesh group were lower, and bowel involvement was not seen. Our findings are promising, and further research investigating antiadhesive composite mesh use for hysterosacropexy would be appropriate, especially when peritoneal closure is omitted.

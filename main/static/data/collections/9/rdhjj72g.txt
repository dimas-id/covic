The emergence and rapid dissemination worldwide of a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) results in decrease of swabs availability for clinical samples collection, as well as, reagents for RT-qPCR diagnostic kits considered a confirmatory test for COVID-19 infection. This scenario, showed the requirement of improve de diagnostic capacity, so the aim of this study were to verify the possibility of reducing the reaction volume of RT-qPCR and to test cotton swabs as alternative for sample collection. RT-qPCR volumes and RNA sample concentration were optimized without affecting the sensitivity of assays, using both probe-based and intercalation dyes methods. Although rayon swabs showed better performance, cotton swabs could be used as alternative type for clinical sample collection. COVID-19 laboratory diagnosis is important to isolate and restrict the dissemination of virus, so seek for alternatives to decrease the coast of assays improve the control of disease.

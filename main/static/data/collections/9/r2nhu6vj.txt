The magnetic resonance imaging appearance of the feline middle ear is described in three healthy cats and in five cats with middle ear disease. Owing to the good spatial resolution, multiplanar slice orientation as well as display high contrast resolution of soft tissue, in particular fluids, MR imaging was helpful prior to surgery. It is superior to radiography which failed to allow identification of the abnormality in two of our five cats. MR imaging for middle ear disease should include dorsal and transverse plane images using T1‐ and T2‐ weighted sequences. In the presence of a mass within the bulla or the external ear canal application of contrast medium is helpful.

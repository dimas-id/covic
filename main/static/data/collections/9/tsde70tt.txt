Abstract Cardiovascular diseases are scarcely reported in donkeys, probably linked to their limited athletic attitude and low frequency of poor performance-related examinations. Reports on treatments for cardiovascular pathologies are anecdotal in donkeys. Respiratory tract anatomy shows important differences between horses and donkeys. Donkeys and mules can act as reservoirs spreading many viral, bacterial, and parasitic infectious respiratory diseases. Mosquito and tick-borne encephalitis have been reported in these species in the later years, and even donkeys are being used as sentinels in some areas to detect these emerging diseases. Management and treatment of lithiases can be transferable from horses; however, the same assumption must still be demonstrated for acute and chronic renal diseases. Ocular pathologies are similar to horses, with corneal ulcers frequently observed. Lameness is a common problem in donkeys, with laminitis as the most reported cause followed by pedal abscess.

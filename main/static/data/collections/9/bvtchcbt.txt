The development of genetic engineering techniques has speeded up the growth of the biotechnological industry, resulting in a significant increase in the number of recombinant protein products on the market. The deep knowledge of protein function, structure, biological interactions, and the possibility to design new polypeptides with desired biological activities have been the main factors involved in the increase of intensive research and preclinical and clinical approaches. Consequently, new biological entities with added value for innovative medicines such as increased stability, improved targeting, and reduced toxicity, among others have been obtained. Proteins are complex nanoparticles with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers when complex supramolecular interactions occur, as for example, in viral capsids. However, even though protein production is a delicate process that imposes the use of sophisticated analytical methods and negative secondary effects have been detected in some cases as immune and inflammatory reactions, the great potential of biodegradable and tunable protein nanoparticles indicates that protein-based biotechnological products are expected to increase in the years to come.

Infarct growth from the early ischemic core to the total infarct lesion volume (LV) is often used as an outcome variable of treatment effects, but can be overestimated due to vasogenic edema. The purpose of this study was (1) to assess two components of early lesion growth by distinguishing between water uptake and true net infarct growth and (2) to investigate potential treatment effects on edema-corrected net lesion growth. Sixty-two M1-MCA-stroke patients with acute multimodal and follow-up CT (FCT) were included. Ischemic lesion growth was calculated by subtracting the initial CTP-derived ischemic core volume from the LV in the FCT. To determine edema-corrected net lesion growth, net water uptake of the ischemic lesion on FCT was quantified and subtracted from the volume of uncorrected lesion growth. The mean lesion growth without edema correction was 20.4 mL (95% CI: 8.2-32.5 mL). The mean net lesion growth after edema correction was 7.3 mL (95% CI: -2.1-16.7 mL; p < 0.0001). Lesion growth was significantly overestimated due to ischemic edema when determined in early-FCT imaging. In 18 patients, LV was lower than the initial ischemic core volume by CTP. These apparently "reversible" core lesions were more likely in patients with shorter times from symptom onset to imaging and higher recanalization rates.

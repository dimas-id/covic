The five anthrax letters put in the US mail in 2001 greatly raised concerns about BW and CW. In general, chemical weapons are considered about as lethal per unit mass as conventional explosives and much less lethal than either nuclear or biological weapons (dirty bombs are much less lethal, Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-25367-1_13). Biological weapons can be as lethal as nuclear weapons if dispersed effectively, but that is not easy to do. For BW to be effective, the bio-materials must be chemically robust, remaining stable, not decaying in sunlight, moisture and rain. This can be accomplished with spores and aerosols. BW material must be dispersed widely, not clumping in few locations. BW can be delivered by cluster bomblets from small missiles. BW can be delivered by helicopter or low-flying crop-duster, or BW can be released in many locations in many small spray cans.

Abstract Fecal testing is a common component of most gastrointestinal work-ups. A multitude of diagnostic techniques are available for identifying parasites and pathogens, or showing abnormalities of flora. Optimal fecal assessment involves careful formulation of a differential list based on signalment, history, and clinical signs. Tests should be selected and interpreted based on their relative sensitivity and specificity for specific conditions. It is essential to use effective testing methods for the etiologies of concern. This article reviews the plethora of diagnostic techniques available for fecal assessment. Indications, limitations, and issues of specimen handling for each technique are discussed. The optimal approach to the diagnosis of some common parasites, pathogens, abnormalities of flora, and metabolic conditions are covered.

An 11‐year‐old male castrated Persian cat with spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism was presented. Both adrenals were grossly enlarged and calcified. A diagnosis of pituitary‐dependent hyperadrenocorticism was made. Signs of hyperadrenocorticism resolved with long‐term mitotane treatment. Concurrent diabetes mellitus resolved after 220 days of therapy. No severe adverse drug reactions were noted.

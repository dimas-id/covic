OBJECTIVE To describe the initial experience of a group of emergency department (ED) physicians, utilizing a Glidescope videolaryngoscope (GVL) for orotracheal intubations in the ED. METHODOLOGY A 6-month, single center, prospective observational study from 19 Feb 2007 to 18 Aug 2007 was conducted on all orotracheal intubations, which involved utilization of the original GVL in different emergency airway management scenarios. RESULTS Overall success of GVL intubation was 15 out of 21 (71.4%) cases. The GVL was able to provide at least Cormack-Lehane grade I or II laryngoscopy views in all cases. All the operators highlighted difficulty in angulating and maneuvering the endotracheal tube for insertion through the glottis as the primary difficulty encountered. CONCLUSION We found the GVL to be an effective device in our ED's emergency airway control repertoire. Its role in the anticipated difficult airway in the ED will need further studies.

Currently, there is a new transanal approach to be used for the excision of selected low-risk rectal cancers and broad-based polyps, the transanal endoscopic surgery using a single-port device. We transferred the single port access surgery (SPA) well-established from laparoscopic surgery as an improvement of the transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). The aim of this article is to give an overview about the technical options and our experiences with different devices. Thirteen patients with selected low-risk rectal cancers or broad-based polyps with dysplasia underwent the SPA modified TEM using the SILS Port (Covidien Norwalk, CT), the TriPort (Olympus KeyMed, Southend, UK) or TriPort+ (Olympus KeyMed, Southend, UK), and laparoscopic instruments. The transanal single port procedure was in all cases completely successful without major complications. The transanal placement of SILS Port (Covidien) and TriPort/TriPort+ (Olympus) was easy to perform; a prior dilatation of the anal sphincter was not necessary. With an excellent view, accurate dissection was possible, all of them are appropriate for transanal single-port device. The postoperative follow-up showed an unremarkable examination. The transanal single port surgery with its benefits is a modified way to replace the TEM procedure. Our first experiences showed comfortable feasibility, less postoperative discomfort, and a reduced risk of damage to the anal sphincter.

INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion is important for epidemiological studies as well as contact tracing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined in 111 patients with a positive qRT-PCR. Seroconversion was assessed using the Elecsys from Roche, the Liaison S1/S2 IgG from Diasorin, the IgG and IgA from Euroimmun as well as the VIDAS IgG and IgM. Specificity was estimated based on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 96 residual samples collected during a non-pandemic period. RESULTS: The highest overall sensitivity for detecting seroconversion was obtained using the Elecsys (81.1%), the Euroimmun with a combined detection of IgG/IgA (86.5%) and the VIDAS with a simultaneous measurement of IgG/IgM (78.4%).The Elecsys and the VIDAS IgG/IgM demonstrated a specificity as well as a positive predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The Elecsys and the VIDAS methods with a combination of IgG/IgM measurement demonstrated a high sensitivity with no false positive results.

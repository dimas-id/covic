Among the various nano/biomaterials used in cancer treatment, the beauty and benefits of DNA nanocomposites are outstanding. The specificity and programmability of the base pairing of DNA strands, together with their ability to conjugate with different types of functionalities have realized unsurpassed potential for the production of two- and three-dimensional nano-sized structures in any shape, size, surface chemistry and functionality. This review aims to provide an insight into the diversity of static DNA nanodevices, including DNA origami, DNA polyhedra, DNA origami arrays and bioreactors, DNA nanoswitch, DNA nanoflower, hydrogel and dendrimer as young but promising platforms for cancer theranostics. The utility and potential of the individual formats in biomedical science and especially in cancer therapy will be discussed.

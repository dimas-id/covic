BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The p64 is a flow modulation device designed to be used in endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. There is limited data on the long-term effectiveness of the device. This study sought to determine the safety and long-term efficacy of this device. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify all patients treated with a p64 between March 2015 and November 2018 at University Hospital St. Ivan Rilski. Anatomical features, intraprocedural complications, clinical, and angiographic outcomes were also taken into account and reviewed. RESULTS A total of 72 patients with 72 aneurysms who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Device placement was successful in all patients. Follow-up angiographic imaging at 6 months showed complete occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta scale [OKM] D) in 55 (76.3%) patients, subtotal aneurysmal filling (OKM B) in 10 (13.8%) patients, and neck remnant (OKM C) in 7 (9.7%) patients. Catheter angiography at 12 months was available for 70 patients (97.2%) and of these patients 91.4% of the aneurysms were completely occluded (OKM D) (64/72). Delayed angiography at 24 months was available for 68 patients (94.4%) and of these 98.5% (67/68) had completely occluded aneurysms. A 36-month angiography was available for 61 patients (84.4%) by which point all aneurysms had been completely occluded (100%). Permanent morbidity due to delayed aneurysmal rupture occurred in one patient (1.38%). The mortality rate was 0%. Self-limiting mild intimal hyperplasia was seen in 2 patients (2.72%). CONCLUSION Treatment of intracranial aneurysms with a p64 flow modulation device is safe and effective with a high success rate and only infrequent complications.

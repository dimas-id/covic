Abstract During the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak, we experienced atypical presentations of MERS-CoV infections in three immunocompromised hosts that warranted exceptional management. Case 1 showed delayed symptom development after a four-day asymptomatic period, Case 2 experienced a 20-day incubation period, and Case 3 exhibited persistent viral shedding without clinical deterioration. Recognizing these exceptions is extremely important in the management of MERS-CoV-exposed or -infected patients and for control of potential MERS outbreaks.

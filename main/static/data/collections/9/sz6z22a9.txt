Italy is one of the most affected countries by the new coronavirus (CoViD-19) pandemic. In the country, there are an estimated 49,000-52,000 homeless people. People experiencing homelessness are among the potentially most vulnerable groups to the CoViD-19. Despite this, in Italy there is a worrying delay in implementation of a national coordinated strategy to protect homeless people from the potentially devastating effects caused by CoViD-19. In order to contain the epidemic among the most vulnerable people, we propose a short operational agenda based on the field experience of the medical-humanitarian organization Medici per i Diritti Umani (Doctors for Human Rights, Italy - MEDU) as well as on the example of initiatives taken by other countries.

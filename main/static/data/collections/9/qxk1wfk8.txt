Twenty first century has witnessed emergence of some ground breaking information technologies that have revolutionised our way of life. The revolution began late in 20th century with the arrival of internet in 1995, which has given rise to methods, tools and gadgets having astonishing applications in all academic disciplines and business sectors. In this article we shall provide a design of a ‘spider robot’ which may be used for efficient cleaning of deadly viruses. In addition, we shall examine some of the emerging technologies which are causing remarkable breakthroughs and improvements which were inconceivable earlier. In particular we shall look at the technologies and tools associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Sensor Networks and Social Media. We shall analyse capabilities and business value of these technologies and tools. As we recognise, most technologies, after completing their commercial journey, are utilised by the business world in physical as well as in the virtual marketing environments. We shall also look at the social impact of some of these technologies and tools.

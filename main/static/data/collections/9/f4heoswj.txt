Background and Aims A risk of tracheal mucosa injury induced by subglottic suctioning has been raised. Therefore, this prospective randomized study aims to compare the effect of continuous suctioning of subglottic secretions versus intermittent suctioning of subglottic secretions (CSSS vs. ISSS) secretions on tracheal mucosa in front of the suctioning port of the endotracheal tube. Patients and Methods Patients requiring intubation or reintubation in Intensive Care Unit with an expected ventilation duration > 24 h were eligible. Participants received CSSS at -20 mmHg or ISSS at -100 mmHg during 15 s and no suction during 8 s. The effect on tracheal mucosa in front of the suction port was assessed after intubation (T0) and before extubation (T1) using bronchoscopy. Tracheal mucosa damages were graded into five categories (no injury, erythema, edema, ulceration, or necrosis). The occurrence (no injury observed at T0 but present at T1) or the worsening (injury observed at T0 exacerbating at T1) was studied. Results Seventy-three patients were included and 53 patients (CSSS, n = 26 and ISSS, n = 27) were evaluable on the primary endpoint. The occurrence or worsening of tracheal mucosal damages did not differ between the two groups (CSSS, n = 7 [27%] vs. ISSS, n = 5 [17%], P = 0.465). Daily average volume of suctioned secretion was higher with ISSS (74 ± 100 ml vs. 20 ± 25 ml, P < 0.001). Impossibility to aspirate was higher with CSSS (0.14 ± 0.16 per day vs. 0.03 ± 0.07 per day, P < 0.001). Conclusions Our results suggest that tracheal mucosal damages did not differ between CSSS and ISSS. The aspirated volume was higher and impossibility to aspirate was lower with ISSS.

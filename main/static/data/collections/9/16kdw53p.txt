The Golgi apparatus response to pathological disorders is predominantly as an intermediary component of membrane biogenesis where it is involved in processing, sorting and secretion of materials via secretory granules, and in the formation of lysosomes. A common initial response of the Golgi apparatus to any stress is an alteration or cessation of secretory activity. In the transformed cell, the Golgi apparatus is altered both morphologically and biochemically, suggesting a shift from a secretory to a membrane‐generating mode of functioning. However, since fewer or less well‐developed Golgi apparatus are frequently found in transformed cells, analytical methods of membrane isolation developed for normal tissues may not always yield equivalent results when applied to tumors. Cell surface alterations characteristic of malignant cells may result from modifications occurring at the level of the Golgi apparatus. Some lysosomal dysfunctions may result from underglycosylation of acid hydrolases by the Golgi apparatus. The use of cell‐free systems between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus or within Golgi apparatus cisterane is providing a new approach to the elucidation of the role of the Golgi apparatus in normal as well as pathological states.

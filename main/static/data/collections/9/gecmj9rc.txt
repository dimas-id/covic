Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6A.C3 neutralizes transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and is specific for a conserved epitope within subsite Ac of the spike (S) glycoprotein of TGEV. Six hybridomas secreting anti-idiotypic (Ab2) MAbs specific for MAb 6A.C3 (Ab1) have been selected. All six MAbs inhibited the binding of Ab1 to TGEV and specifically cross-linked MAb1-6A.C3. Four of these hybridomas secreted gamma-type anti-idiotypic MAbs. The other two Ab2s (MAbs 9A.G3 and 9C.E11) were recognized by TGEV-specific antiserum induced in two species. This binding was inhibited by viruses of the TGEV group but not by serologically unrelated coronaviruses. These results indicate that MAb2-9A.G3 and MAb2-9C.E11 mimic an antigenic determinant present on the TGEV surface, and they were classified as beta-type ("internal-image") MAbs. TGEV-binding Ab3 antiserum was induced in 100% of mice immunized with the two beta-type MAb2s and in 25 to 50% of mice immunized with gamma-type MAb2. Both beta- and gamma-type Ab2s induced neutralizing Ab3 antibodies in mice that were mainly directed to antigenic subsite Ac of the S protein.

Perineal hernia is a rare but known complication following major pelvic surgery. It may occur spontaneously or following abdominoperineal resection, sacrectomy, or pelvic exenteration. Very little is known about spontaneous perineal hernia. Surgical repair via open transabdominal and transperineal approaches has been previously described. We report laparoscopic repair of spontaneous and postoperative perineal hernia in 2 patients.

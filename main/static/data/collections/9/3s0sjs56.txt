Rotavirus detection by direct electron microscopy was compared with direct and indirect immune electron microscopy techniques. The latter two approaches permitted the enumeration of 25 and 103 times more rotaviruses respectively, than direct electron microscopy. Also, 70% and 90% of the virus particles were aggregated by direct and indirect immune electron microscopy techniques respectively, thus facilitating their detection.

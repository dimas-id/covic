Being able to recognize human activities is essential for several applications such as health monitoring, fall detection, context-aware mobile applications. In this work, we perform the recognition of the human activity based on the combined Weighted SVM and HMM by taking advantage of the relative strengths of these two classification paradigms. One significant advantage in WSVMs is that, they deal the problem of imbalanced data but his drawback is that, they are inherently static classifiers - they do not implicitly model temporal evolution of data. HMMs have the advantage of being able to handle dynamic data with certain assumptions about stationary and independence. The experiment results on real datasets show that the proposed method possess the better robustness and distinction.

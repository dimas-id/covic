BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Morgagni diaphragmatic hernia (MH) is rare. We report our experience based on routine patch use in MH repair to curb recurrence. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to study the recurrence and complications associated with minimally invasive surgery and the use of patch. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all cases of MH who underwent first-time repair in 2012-2017 in our institution to determine recurrence and complication rate. A MEDLINE search related to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and patch repair of MH was conducted for systematic review. Eligible articles published from 1997-2017 with follow-up data available were included. Primary outcomes measured were recurrence and complication. Meta-analysis to compare open versus MIS and primary versus patch repair in the MIS group were performed in comparative cohorts. Continuous data were presented as median (range), and statistical significance was P<0.05. RESULTS In our institution, 12 consecutive patients aged 17-month-old (22 days-7 years), underwent laparoscopic patch repair of MH, with one conversion to laparotomy. No recurrence or significant complication occurred over a follow-up period of 8 months (1-48 months). Thirty-six articles were included from literature review and were combined with the current series. All were retrospective case reports or series, of which 6 were comparative cohorts with both MIS and open repairs. A total of 296 patients from 37 series were ultimately used for analysis: 80 had open repair (4 patch) and 216 had MIS repair (32 patch), with a patch rate of 12%. There were 13 recurrences (4%): no difference between open and MIS repairs (4/80 vs 9/216, p=0.75); recurrence rate following primary repair was 13/260 (5%), but no recurrence occurred with 36 patch repairs. Meta-analysis showed no difference in recurrence between open and MIS repair (p=0.83), whereas patch repair was associated with 14% less recurrence compared with primary repair, although it did not reach statistical significance (p=0.12). There were 13 complications (5%): no difference between open and MIS repairs (5/80 vs 8/216, p=0.35). One small bowel obstruction occurred in a patient who had laparoscopic patch repair. CONCLUSION In MH, recurrence and complication rates are comparable between MIS and open repairs. Use of patch appeared to confer additional benefit in reducing recurrence.

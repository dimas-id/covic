Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a new local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the risk factors associated with local recurrence of HCC after single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion. From April 2003 to December 2007, we treated 138 HCC lesions by single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion using the Cool-tip RFA, RTC 2000 and RTC 3000 Systems. Risk factors for the local recurrence of these lesions and complications after RFA were analyzed. The mean size of the 138 lesions was 16.9±5.4 mm in diameter (range 7-33 mm). Local recurrence rates were 6.6 and 22.0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, during the mean follow-up period of 16.4 months. Univariate analysis showed that tumor diameter (≥20 mm), tumor location, pre-treatment AFP-L3 fraction level and ablation pattern were significant variables. Multivariate analysis of these four variables identified only the tumor diameter as an independent risk factor for local recurrence. Complications occurred in 2.2% of the lesions (3/138). Single-session RFA is an effective treatment for HCC in that it reduces serious complications. This study demonstrated that a tumor size ≥20 mm influenced the local recurrence of single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion.

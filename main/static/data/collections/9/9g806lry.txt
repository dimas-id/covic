Vaccines have been recognized as one of the most successful public health measures. In this chapter, we provide a historical overview of immunization measures and discuss the basics of immunization and vaccination in the context of a pandemic outbreak. We will also discuss vaccine hesitancy, the factors that lead to vaccine acceptance and refusal, the determinants of individual decision-making about vaccination, and strategies of how to approach it on an individual, community, and global level.

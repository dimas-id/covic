Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe economic consequences by local governmental measures to contain the outbreak1 We provide insight on the impact that healthcare restriction has made on neurosurgical activity in Latin Iberoamerica. METHODS: We performed an internet-based survey among Presidents and Members of the Societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information about local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS® software. Results Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen Society Presidents reported having suspended regular activities, and differing local scheduled congresses, fourteen reported mandatory isolation by government, and four instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons had savings to self-support for 3-6 months, if restrictions are long lasting. Conclusions Stopping activities among Societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider´s protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the healthcare systems; representing a huge financial risk for their sustainability. Neurosurgeons should involve in local policies to protect health and economy. Telemedicine represents an excellent solution, avoiding another pandemic of severe diseases across all-specialties as non-essential care can turn essential if left untreated. Financial support and ethics code review is needed to battle this new disease, designated the occupational disease of the decade, that continues to struggle the healthcare systems. Times of crisis are times of great opportunities for humanity to evolve.

Abstract Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are important gastroenteric pathogens that infect humans and animals. This study aimed to analyze the complete genome sequence, i.e., 11 genome segments of the lapine rotavirus (LRV) identified in the intestine of a dead rabbit in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and to describe the genetic relationships between this lapine isolate [RVA/Rabbit-wt/KOR/Rab1404/2014/G3P[22] (Rab1404)] and other lapine isolates/strains. Rab1404 possessed the following genotype constellation: G3-P[22]-I2-R3-C3-M3-A9-N2-T3-E3-H3. The P[22] genotype was found to originate from rabbits and was for the first time identified in the ROK. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Rab1404 possessed VP1-3 and VP7 genes, which were closely related to those of the bat strain LZHP2; NSP1-4 genes, which were closely related to those of the simian strain RRV; and VP4, VP6, and NSP5 genes, which were closely related to the genes obtained from other rabbits. Interestingly, a close relationship between Rab1404 and simian RVA strain RVA/Simian-tc/USA/RRV/1975/G3P[3] for 8 gene segments was observed. RRV is believed to be a reassortant between bovine-like RVA strain and canine/feline RVA strains. Rab1404 and canine/feline RVAs shared the genes encoding VP1, VP3, VP7, NSP3, and NSP4. Additionally, the genome segments VP6 (I2), NSP1 (N2), and NSP5 (H3) of Rab1404 were closely related to those of bovine RVAs. This is the first report describing the complete genome sequence of an LRV detected in the ROK. These results indicate that Rab1404 could be a result of interspecies transmission, possibly through multiple reassortment events in the strains of various animal species and the subsequent transmission of the virus to a rabbit. Additional studies are required to determine the evolutionary source and to identify possible reservoirs of RVAs in nature.

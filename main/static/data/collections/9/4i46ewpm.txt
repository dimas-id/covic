INTRODUCTION Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has the potential advantages of reduced postoperative pain and reduced port-site complications. Careful attention to closure can lead to virtually "scarless" surgery. In this article, we present our first experiences with SILS appendicectomy and cholecystectomy. METHOD SILS appendicectomy and cholecystectomy was performed in 12 and 14 patients, respectively. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively from case notes and the theater database. RESULTS The average operating times were 61.3 and 142.9 minutes for SILS appendicectomy and SILS cholecystectomy, respectively. There was a good correlation between increasing experience and a reduction in operative time with Pearson's coefficient being -1 for appendicectomy and -0.56 for cholecystectomy. There were no postoperative complications in the SILS appendicectomy group. One patient in the SILS cholecystectomy group suffered a postoperative biliary leak from an accessory duct of Lushka. CONCLUSIONS In our series, we have demonstrated SILS to be a safe and efficacious method for appendicectomy and cholecystectomy. Further studies are required to investigate any potential advantages of this method over standard laparoscopic techniques.

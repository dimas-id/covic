While brain dysfunction most commonly manifests as hepatic encephalopathy is chronic liver disease; devastating complications of cerebral edema and brain herniation syndromes may occur with acute liver failure.

In this chapter we outline the pathophysiology and clinical management of brain dysfunction in the critically ill patients with liver disease.

Abstract Aim To describe evolving practices in the provision of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) services across the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, the responses of and impact on MT teams, and the effects on training. Materials and methods The UK Neurointerventional Group (UKNG) and the British Society of Neuroradiologists (BSNR) sent out a national survey on 1 May 2020 to all 28 UK neuroscience centres that have the potential capability to perform MT. Results Responses were received from 27/28 MT-capable centres (96%). Three of the 27 centres do not currently provide MT services. There was a 27.7% reduction in MTs performed during April 2020 compared with the first 3 months of the year. All MT patients in 20/24 centres that responded were considered as COVID-19 suspicious/positive unless or until proven otherwise. Twenty-two of the 24 centres reported delays to the patient pathway. Seventeen of the 24 centres reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had reduced training opportunities for specialist registrars (SpR). Fourteen of the 24 centres reported that the pandemic had hampered their development plans for their local or regional MT service. Conclusion The present survey has highlighted a trend of decreasing cases and delays in the patient pathway during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across UK centres.

We report weaning from mechanical ventilation with no coughing in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Substituting the endotracheal tube for a supraglottic airway (SGA), which is less stimulating to the trachea, can reduce coughing with weaning from mechanical ventilation and extubation. Personal protective equipment is in short supply worldwide. Reducing spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is beneficial in terms of occupational health of health care workers.

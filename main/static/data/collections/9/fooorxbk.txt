Abstract Series of novel acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) with various nucleobases and 2-(2-phosphonoethoxy)ethyl (PEE) chain bearing various substituents in β-position to the phosphonate moiety were prepared. The influence of structural alternations on antiviral activity was studied. Several derivatives exhibit antiviral activity against HIV and vaccinia virus (middle micromolar range), HSV-1 and HSV-2 (lower micromolar range) and VZV and CMV (nanomolar range), although the parent unbranched PEE–ANPs are inactive. Adenine as a nucleobase and the methyl group attached to the PEE chain proved to be a prerequisite to afford pronounced antiviral activity.

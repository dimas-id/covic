• Of the 49 patients, 89.8% (44/49) patients had a typical transition from early stage to advanced stage, and then from advanced stage to dissipating stage. • With the evidence of fibrosis for progression of CT results, 42.9% (21/49) patients developed fibrosis whereas 57.1% (28/49) patients demonstrated no definite fibrosis. • Patients with fibrosis in follow CT were older (mean age, 45.4 vs. 33.8 years), with longer LOS (19.1 vs. 15.0 days), and higher rate of ICU admission (19.0% [4/21] vs. 3.6% [1/28]) than that of those without fibrosis.

The intracellular sites of biosynthesis of the structural proteins of murine hepatitis virus A59 have been analyzed using cell fractionation techniques. The nucleocapsid protein N is synthesized on free polysomes, whereas the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Glycoprotein E2 present in the RER contains N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides of the mannose-rich type, supporting the concept that glycosylation of this protein is initiated at the co-translational level. In contrast, O-glycosylation of E1 occurs after transfer of the protein to smooth intracellular membranes. Monensin does not interfere with virus budding from the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, but it inhibits virus release and fusion of infected cells. The oligosaccharide side chains of E2 obtained under these conditions are resistant to endoglycosidase H and lack fucose suggesting that transport of this glycoprotein is inhibited between the trans Golgi cisternae and the cell surface. Glycoprotein E1 synthesized in the presence of monensin is completely carbohydrate-free. This observation suggests that the intracellular transport of this glycoprotein is also blocked by monensin.

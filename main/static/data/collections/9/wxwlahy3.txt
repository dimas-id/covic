Vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)-driven proton pumping and organellar acidification is essential for vesicular trafficking along both the exocytotic and endocytotic pathways of eukaryotic cells. Deficient function of V-ATPase and defects of vesicular acidification have been recently recognized as important mechanisms in a variety of human diseases and are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. In the past few years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of function, regulation, and the cell biological role of V-ATPase. Here, we will review these studies with emphasis on novel direct roles of V-ATPase in the regulation of vesicular trafficking events.

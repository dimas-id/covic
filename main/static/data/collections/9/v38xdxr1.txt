Nucleic acid detection is of great significance in clinical diagnosis, environmental monitoring and food safety. Compared with the traditional nucleic acid amplification detection method, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing technology has the advantages of being label-free, having simple operation, and providing real-time detection. However, the angle scanning system in many SPR angle modulation detection applications usually requires a high-resolution stepper motor and complex mechanical structure to adjust the angle. In this paper, a portable multi-angle scanning SPR sensor was designed. The sensor only uses one stepping motor to rotate a belt, and the belt pulls the mechanical linkages of incident light and reflected light to move in opposite directions for achieving the SPR angle scanning mode that keeps the incident angle and reflected angle equal. The sensor has an angle scanning accuracy of 0.002°, response sensitivity of 3.72 × 10(−6) RIU (refractive index unit), and an angle scanning range of 30°–74°. The overall size of the system is only 480 mm × 150 mm × 180 mm. The portable SPR sensor was used to detect nucleic acid hybridization on a gold film chip modified with bovine serum albumin (BSA). The result revealed that the sensor had high sensitivity and fast response, and could successfully accomplish the hybridization detection of target DNA solution of 0.01 μmol/mL.

Predictions about the further development of the Corona pandemic are of great public interest but many approaches demand a large number of country specific parameters and are not easily transferable. A special interest of simulations on the pandemic is to trace the effect of politics for reducing the virus spread, since these measures have had an enormous impact on economy and daily life. Here a simple yet powerful algorithm is introduced for fitting the infection numbers by simple analytic functions. This way, the increase of the case numbers in periods with different regulations can be distinguished, and by extrapolating the fit functions, a forecast for the maximum numbers and time scales are possible. The effect of the restraints such as lock down are demonstrated by comparing the resulting infection history with the likely unconstrained virus spread, and it is shown that a delay of 1-4 weeks before imposing measures aiming at social distancing could have led to a complete infection of the respective populations. The approach is simply transferable to many different states. Here data from six E.U. countries, the UK, Russia, two Asian countries, the USA and ten states inside the USA with significant case numbers are analyzed, and striking qualitative similarities are found.

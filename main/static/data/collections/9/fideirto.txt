Hierarchical Genetic Strategy (HGS) is a general-purpose optimization metaheuristic based on multi-deme evolutionary-like optimization, while demes are parts of adaptive dynamically changing tree. The paper focuses on adaptation of the classic HGS algorithm for multi-criteria optimization problems, coupling the HGS with Particle Swarm Optimization demes. The main contribution of the paper is showing the efficacy and efficiency of the actor-based implementation of this metaheuristic algorithm.

Rapid development in genome-wide transcriptional analyses has led to the discovery of a large number of non-coding transcripts, also called long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNAs harbor biological activities including regulation of protein-coding gene expression at epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. They also take a part in various physiological and pathological processes, participating in cell development, immunity, disease processes and oncogenesis. Here I discuss and summarize, current knowledge about lncRNA origin, function and involvement in human disease.

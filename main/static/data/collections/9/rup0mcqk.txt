Severe cases of COVID‐19, caused by novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, have been associated with a hyperinflammatory state.(Huang, Wang et al. 2020) This has been described as a form of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)(Bergsten, Horne et al. 2017) that may contribute to increased mortality.(Ramos‐Casals, Brito‐Zeron et al. 2014) Screening with the HScore(Fardet, Galicier et al. 2014) to identify cases has been recommended to guide immunosuppressive therapy(Mehta, McAuley et al. 2020).

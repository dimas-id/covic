Short bowel syndrome is the most common cause of intestinal failure in children. The treatment is based on a multidisciplinary approach involving pediatricians, pediatric surgeons, and nutritionists. Surgical procedures for intestinal lengthening may be decisive, having been revalued after the recent description of serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP). We reviewed the patients who underwent the STEP operation for short bowel syndrome in our hospital in order to evaluate medium-term outcome. Between April 2006 and December 2008, three children were submitted to STEP without postoperative complications directly related to the procedure. In two cases the autonomy for oral/enteric feeding was obtained within 3 and 7 months after surgery with sustained growth, persisting at 5 years of follow-up after STEP. One child remained dependent of parenteral nutrition and was submitted to intestinal transplantation 30 months after STEP. However, since STEP until transplantation, it was possible to increase enteric volume and decrease intestinal dilation and the frequency of occlusive episodes. STEP is an effective and safe technique for intestinal lengthening that may allow increased tolerance to oral/enteric feeding or at least alleviate some complications of short bowel syndrome.

BACKGROUND Surgery for failed antireflux procedures is technically more demanding than primary fundoplication. The success rate does not equal that of the primary procedures. This retrospective analysis aimed to assess long-term subjective and objective outcomes in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for fundoplication failure. METHODS Objective and subjective outcomes were assessed by radiological and endoscopic methods, symptom questionnaire and quality-of-life index at a minimum follow-up of 12 (mean 75Â·8) months. RESULTS The study included 129 consecutive patients who had laparoscopic redo surgery after fundoplication had failed. The most frequent patterns of failure were hiatal herniation (50 patients) and slippage (45). Resolution of the symptoms that led to redo surgery was achieved in 27 of 37 and 11 of 16 patients operated for recurrence and for dysphagia respectively. Objective failure was demonstrated in 16 of 39 patients with herniation and six of 22 with slippage. Seven patients underwent an additional surgical procedure. CONCLUSION Long-term assessment of objective and subjective results after laparoscopic repair for failed fundoplication revealed a high failure rate that increased with the length of follow-up. Unexpected and untreated oesophageal shortening may be responsible for this failure rate.

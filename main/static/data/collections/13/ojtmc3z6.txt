BACKGROUND Early outcome predictors after delivery room cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of asphyxiated newborns are needed. OBJECTIVES To investigate if cerebral (rScO2) and renal (rSrO2) tissue oxygen saturation 30 min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are different between surviving versus nonsurviving piglets with asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest and CPR. Further, to investigate the relationship of rScO2 and rSrO2 to cardiac output (CO), blood pressure (BP), and biochemical variables 30 min and 4 h after ROSC. METHODS Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated piglets (1-3 days, 1.7-2.4 kg) were used. rScO2, rSrO2, SpO2, right common carotid artery flow, and arterial BP were measured continuously. CO was measured with echocardiography. The piglets were asphyxiated until cardiac arrest and resuscitated. Piglets that survived 4 h after ROSC (n = 12) were compared with piglets that died before planned euthanasia at 4 h (n = 13). Left ventricular, and kidney and brain tissue lactate were analyzed. Correlations between variables were assessed. RESULTS Thirty minutes after ROSC, median rSrO2 (43% [n = 10] vs. 25% [n = 2], p = 0.003) but not rScO2 (46% [41-55] [n = 10] vs. 40% [22-45] [n = 5], p = 0.08) was higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors. Arterial lactate was negatively correlated and pH positively correlated with rScO2 and rSrO2. Left ventricular, but not kidney or brain lactate was negatively correlated with rScO2 and rSrO2. There was no correlation between CO or BP and rScO2 or rSrO2. CONCLUSIONS Despite satisfactory CO and BP vital organ oxygenation can be poor. Tissue oxygen saturation, pH, and lactate, as measures of anaerobic metabolism, may reflect vital organ oxygenation and outcome.

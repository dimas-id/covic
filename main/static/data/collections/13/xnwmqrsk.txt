AIM: Very preterm birth is associated to a high risk of enteropathies. Diagnosis is challenging, especially in mild forms, leading to unnecessary periods of cessation of enteral feeding. This study aimed at establishing a prognosis score of enteropathy combining clinical parameters and faecal calprotectin concentration. METHODS: This prospective multicentric study included preterm neonates born at a gestational age of 33 weeks or less. Stools were collected weekly until hospital discharge, and daily in case of digestive events for calprotectin measurement (ELISA and immunochromatography) and microbiota analyses (16S rRNA gene sequencing). RESULTS: Among the 121 neonates included, 21 experienced at least one episode of enteropathy, mainly mild forms. By ELISA testing, median faecal calprotectin was 88 (8-798) Âµg/g faeces. No statistically significant association was found between the outset of enteropathy and maternal and neonatal characteristics, and calprotectin levels. The agreement between ELISA and immunochromatography assay was moderate (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.58, 95%CI [0.47-0.66]). Comparison of species diversity and relative bacterial abundance profiles between infants with or without enteropathy revealed no specific alterations associated with enteropathy. CONCLUSION: The study failed to propose a prognostic score of enteropathy, probably due the large inter- and intra-individual variability of faecal calprotectin in very preterm neonates.

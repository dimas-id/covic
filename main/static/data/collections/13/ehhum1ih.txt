We recently reported that synbiotic Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei together with specific substrate dextran elicited an enhancement in humoral immune response against bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model antigen in BALB/c mice. The present study was designed to evaluate the oral immunoadjuvant effects of the synbiotic in layer chickens. Using a PCR assay, L. casei subsp. casei was detected specifically in the intestinal chyme of chickens (10 d of age, Julia strain) fed ad libitum on a diet supplemented with 75 mg dextran/kg (dextran-supplemented diet, DSD) and administered orally with 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) L. casei subsp. casei in 0.1 ml PBS with the aid of an intubation needle at 1, 2 and 3 d of age. Furthermore, oral administration of 10(7) CFU L. casei subsp. casei at 1-3 d of age significantly enhanced the production of anti-BSA antibody in DSD-fed chickens (60 d of age) administered orally with 1 mg BSA at 32 and 33 d of age and subcutaneously with 5 microg BSA at 33 d of age. In addition, among bacterial numbers tested, 10(6) CFU L. casei subsp. casei together with dextran induced an effective increase in humoral immune response to mixed inactivated vaccines against Newcastle disease and avian infectious bronchitis, and the treatment may be advantageous in protecting against these infectious diseases in chickens in actual application. These results suggest that dietary supplementation of L. casei subsp. casei with dextran leads to immunomodulation of humoral immune responses.

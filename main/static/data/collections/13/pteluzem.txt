Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to the bone. When the sternum is involved, it usually presents as a solitary lesion. In such cases, resection is indicated, including with the intention to cure. This case report describes a technique for a complete exeresis of the sternum, ex vivo repair under hypothermia, and reimplantation. Cryosurgery is a well-known technique to resect bone metastases and was the procedure used in our patient.

Airway MΦ and DCs are important components of innate host defense and can play a critical role in limiting the severity of influenza virus infection. Although it has been well established that cell‐surface SA acts as a primary attachment receptor for IAV, the particular receptor(s) or coreceptor(s) that mediate IAV entry into any cell, including MΦ and DC, have not been clearly defined. Identifying which receptors are involved in attachment and entry of IAV into immune cells may have important implications in regard to understanding IAV tropism and pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that specialized receptors on MΦ and DCs, namely CLRs, can act as capture and/or entry receptors for many viral pathogens, including IAV. Herein, we review the early stages of infection of MΦ and DC by IAV. Specifically, we examine the potential role of CLRs expressed on MΦ and DC to act as attachment and/or entry receptors for IAV.

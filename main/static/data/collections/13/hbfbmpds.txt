Snakebite envenomings occur in complex ecological, social, economic, cultural, and political contexts. Hence, the understanding of this public health issue demands systemic and holistic approaches. Ecohealth constitutes a valuable paradigm to study snakebites, as it emphasizes on the close linkages between ecosystems, society, and health. This essay highlights some of the areas in the field of snakebite envenoming that could greatly benefit from an Ecohealth approach based on trans-disciplinary research, systems thinking, and the involvement of stakeholders at many levels. Ecohealth focuses not only on the generation of knowledge through research, but also in the translation of knowledge into actions.

We test the hypothesis of COVID-19 contagion being influenced by meteorological parameters such as temperature or humidity. We analysed data at high spatial resolution (regions in Italy and counties in the USA) and found that while at low resolution this might seem the case, at higher resolution no correlation is found. Our results are consistent with a poor outdoors transmission of the disease. However, a possible indirect correlation between good weather and a decrease in disease spread may occur, as people spend longer time outdoors.

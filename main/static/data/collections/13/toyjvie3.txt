Weight regain after bariatric surgery is common and can be managed with surgical interventions or less morbid endoscopic techniques. These endoscopic approaches target structural postoperative changes that are associated with weight regain, most notably dilation of the gastrojejunal anastomosis aperture. Purse string suture placement, as well as argon plasma coagulation application to the anastomosis, may result in significant and durable weight loss. Furthermore, various endoscopic approaches may be used to safely and effectively manage other complications of bariatric surgery that may result in poor weight loss or weight regain after surgery, including fistula formation.

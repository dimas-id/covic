BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors associated with and treatments for late‐onset severe pneumonia (LOSP) in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT). METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients who underwent non‐T‐cell‐depleted allo‐HSCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology and met the criterion of LOSP after allo‐HSCT were enrolled. RESULTS: The median time from allo‐HSCT to the occurrence of LOSP was 231 (90–1487) days. Twenty‐eight patients harbored 1 or more pathogens (infectious LOSP, I‐LOSP), whereas 22 did not harbor any pathogens (non‐infectious LOSP, NI‐LOSP). The 100‐day survival rate of LOSP patients was 31.1%. Patients smoking before allo‐HSCT (0% vs. 35.4%, P = 0.002) and male gender (20.0% vs. 61.9%, P = 0.026) had lower 100‐day survival rate. Patients with a lower bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophil percentage had higher 100‐day survival rate relative to those with higher BALF neutrophil percentage (45.5% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.012). The 100‐day survival rate of patients with I‐LOSP was lower than that of patients with NI‐LOSP (19.1% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.043). Patients given late (≥1 week after LOSP diagnosis) and low‐dose methylprednisolone (MP) therapy (≤2 mg/kg/day) had the best 100‐day survival rate. In the multivariate analysis, nonsmoking before allo‐HSCT and late and low‐dose MP therapy were significantly associated with a better survival after LOSP. CONCLUSION: LOSP is a severe complication after allo‐HSCT. The correct timing and corticosteroid dosage in the context of broad‐spectrum antimicrobial therapy might further improve the outcomes of patients with LOSP.

An analysis of a combined dataset of Wave 1 and 2 cases, aligned at approximately Local Time Zero + 2 months with unsupervised machine learning methods such as PCA and deep autoencoder dimensionality reduction allows to clearly separate milder background cases from those with more rapid and aggressive onset of the epidemics. The analysis and findings of the study can be used in evaluation of possible epidemiological scenarios and as an effective modeling tool to design corrective and preventative measures to avoid developments with potentially heavy impact.

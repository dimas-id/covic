Despite robust evidence in favour of maintaining optimal oxygen saturation targets in the preterm infants, the titration of oxygen is largely dependent on manual observations and transcription. Similarly, notwithstanding the gaining popularity of non-invasive modalities like high-flow nasal therapy, the practices of weaning and escalating support are largely individualized and based on point of care observations. These are often erroneous and lack objectivity. Histogram analysis from patient monitors is an easy and objective way of quantifying vital parameters and their trends. We review the technology and evidence available behind this practice. Conclusions: Though there are no randomized controlled trials on this practice solely, we identify several quality improvement studies implementing this into practice with benefit. We also cite studies which have implemented histogram analysis in methodology, thus concluding that this is a useful clinical tool worth incorporating into clinical practice to reduce manual errors and bring more objectivity into decisions.

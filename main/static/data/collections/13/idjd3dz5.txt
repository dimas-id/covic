OBJECTIVE To compare the mode of failure, load at yield, ultimate load to failure and stiffness of non-barbed polydioxanone, non-barbed polyglyconate and barbed glycolide-trimethylene carbonate (GTC) suture in canine cadaveric fascia. STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo biomechanical study. SAMPLE POPULATION 18 fascia lata specimens from 9 canine cadavers. METHODS 6 fascia lata specimens were sutured with polydioxanone, 6 with polyglyconate, and 6 with barbed GTC suture. Load at yield, stiffness, ultimate load to failure were measured using tensile strength testing. Statistical analysis was used to compare outcomes between suture materials. The mode of failure was recorded and described. RESULTS The load at yield and ultimate load to failure were significantly greater for polydioxanone than barbed GTC (P=.045 and P=.016, respectively). The load at yield and ultimate load to failure was not significantly different between polydioxanone and polyglyconate (P=.687 and P=.586, respectively). The load at yield and the ultimate load to failure was not significantly different between polyglyconate and barbed GTC (P=.194 and P=.109, respectively). Stiffness was not different between constructs (P=.103). Polydioxanone and polyglyconate failed by suture breakage and suture pullout. Barbed GTC failed by suture slippage and suture breakage. CONCLUSION Our results showed that under the conditions of this study, 4-0 monofilament polydioxanone had a greater load at yield and load to failure than similarly sized, barbed copolymer suture in the fascia lata. This finding may help direct suture choice for fascial closure.

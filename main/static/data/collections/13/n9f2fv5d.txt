BACKGROUND Infectious complications following mesh implantation for abdominal wall repair appear in 0.7 up to 26.6% of hernia repairs and can have a detrimental impact for the patient. To prevent or to treat mesh-related infection, the scientific community is currently developing a veritable arsenal of antibacterial meshes. The numerous and increasing reports published every year describing new technologies indicate a clear clinical need, and an academic interest in solving this problem. Nevertheless, to really appreciate, to challenge, to compare and to optimize the antibacterial properties of next generation meshes, it is important to know which models are available and to understand them. PURPOSE We proposed for the first time, a complete overview focusing only on the in vitro and in vivo models which have been employed specifically in the field of antibacterial meshes for hernia repair. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION From this investigation, it is clear that there has been vast progress and breadth in new technologies and models to test them. However, it also shows that standardization or adoption of a more restricted number of models would improve comparability and be a benefit to the field of study.

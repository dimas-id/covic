OBJECTIVE To study the situation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection in the hemodialysis units in Beijing. METHODS Eighty-one hemodialysis units were investigated on the incidence and preventive measures for SARS from March to July 2003 by a standardized investigation form. RESULTS (1) Seven hemodialysis patients were diagnosed as SARS clinically and account for 0.24% of total 2885 hemodialysis patients in these units in Beijing. Among the 7 SARS patients, 3 recovered from SARS and 4 died. No case was infected within the hemodialysis units. No SARS case or suspected case was found in the health care workers in hemodialysis units. (2) Additional disinfected measures were carried out in all the hemodialysis units. 98.8% (80/81) of them did not reuse the dialyzer. (3) 98.8% (80/81) of the hemodialysis units developed education about preventing SARS among hemodialysis patients. Before dialysis treatment patients must take temperature, change specific clothes and shoes in over 90% of the hemodialysis units. (4) All health care workers in the hemodialysis units wore hats and gauze masks and 93.7% (74/79) of them wore gloves. Eye shield was worn in 22.8% (18/79) of the dialysis units centers. CONCLUSIONS No ARS case was infected within the hemodialysis units in Beijing. Intensified disinfection of surroundings, self-protection for health care workers and education for patients in personal hygiene habit may be helpful to prevention of SARS in hemodialysis units.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a syndrome characterized by crepitant necrosis of the bowel, has emerged as the most common neonatal gastrointestinal emergency in many countries of the world. In the United States, NEC strikes 1 to 8% of patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units, almost all of whom are premature infants. The incidence is low in certain countries wity a low premature birth rate, e.g., Japan. Two theories of pathogenesis are: the Santulli theory, which implicates three factors: ischaemia, bacteria and substrate; and the Lawrence theory, which stresses the injurious role of bacterial toxins on the immature gut of the preterm infant. Clinical and experimental evidence support each of the theories, but neither theory can explain certain clinical phenomena, particularly the resistance to NEC manifested by more than 90% of preterm infants, who never develop the syndrome. A unifying hypothesis of pathogenesis and a mathematical model of NEC are outlined. Because clustering of cases may occur, the design of clinical trials of preventive measures for NEC must include simultaneous control infants.

The deformations of isotropic and anisotropic Ti-6Al-4 V columnar structures fabricated by additive manufacturing were extensively examined. The distinct texture and microstructure distributions were characterised. In situ X-ray diffraction measurements show different lattice activities resulting from the different microstructure distributions. Spatially resolved mapping revealed manufacturing-induced crystallite-orientation distributions that determine the deformation mechanisms. We propose a self-consistent model to correlate the multi-scale characteristics, from the anisotropic-texture-distribution microstructure to the bulk mechanical properties. We determined that basal and pyramidal slip activities were activated by tension deformation. The underlying additive-manufacturing-induced crystal plasticity plays a major role. We find that the texture development of the columnar structures and the distribution of crystallite orientation achieved by different processing conditions during additive manufacturing have important effects on the mechanical properties. The dominant deformation mode for the anisotropic Ti-6Al-4 V columnar structure is basal slip, and that for the isotropic Ti-6Al-4 V columnar structure is pyramidal slip. The difference may be important for determining the fatigue behaviour.

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal system with an estimated incidence of approximately 2% of the population. Although most cases are asymptomatic, it has the potential to create complications, such as hemorrhage, inflammation, intestinal obstruction, perforation, and intussusception. Meckel's diverticulum is generally diagnosed incidentally or upon investigation of unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, inflammation, or obstruction for both pediatric and adult patients. Complications are often present as surgical emergencies and require resection of the diseased intestinal segment. In doubtful cases, laparoscopy should be the surgical method for both diagnosing and treating MD. Here we present a case of MD causing intestinal obstruction and that was treated by laparoscopic resection.

The fatty acid acylation of the cell-associated virus-specific proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (A 59-strain) was studied.(3)H-palmitate label was associated with E 2, one of the two virion glycoproteins and its intracellular precursor gp 150. A 110 K protein, the unglycosylated apoprotein of gp 150, accumulated by tunicamycin treatment, also incorporated radiolabeled palmitic acid. The addition of fatty acid to the MHV-A 59 E 2 protein is therefore not dependent on glycosylation.

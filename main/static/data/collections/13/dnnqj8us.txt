BACKGROUND Gastric leak (GL) represents one of the main early-onset postoperative complication of sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Most studies of GL featured short series and no data on the time to reoperation for persistent GL. OBJECTIVES Characterize the time between discovery of persistent post-SG GL and the implementation of reoperation. SETTING University hospital, France, public practice. METHODS All patients treated for post-SG GL between November 2004 and December 2013 were included. The primary efficacy criterion was the time interval between discovery of a persistent GL and reoperation. The secondary efficacy criteria were demographic, surgical, and endoscopic data; mortality rate; time to GL healing; treatment success rate; and risk factors for failure treatment. RESULTS Eighty-six patients were treated for post-SG GL. Forty patients (46.5%) had early-onset GL (postoperative day ≤ 7). Two patients (2.3%) presented primary gastrobronchial fistula. Fifty-six patients (70%) underwent immediate reoperation. Endoscopic treatment was required to treat the GL in 92.7% of the cases (n = 77). The mortality rate was 1.2% (n = 1). The treatment success rate was 89.1%. The median time to healing GL was 84 days (14-423 d). Eighty percent of the GLs had healed 120 days after discovery. After 120 days, the incidence of complications related to GL increased and few additional GLs healed. The only identified risk factor for treatment failure was large retained gastric fundus (P ≤ .05). CONCLUSIONS Most cases of GL can be adequately treated by incorporating endoscopic stenting. Surgery for persistent GL should be performed within 120 days of discovery; after this cut-off, the incidence of GL-related complications increases. Large retained gastric fundus is a risk factor for treatment failure and may prompt the surgeon to consider earlier reoperation.

We are grateful for the comments of Marrietta et al, [1] and welcome the opportunity to provide further details on the coagulopathy observed in our patients with COVID-19 infection [2]. The weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis used in the study is that routinely used for hospital in-patients in our institution, consistent with national recommendations [3,4] With respect to the cohort of patients with COVID-19 enrolled in our study, it is important to highlight that 74% of patients received enoxaparin 40mg (4000 IU) subcutaneously once daily.

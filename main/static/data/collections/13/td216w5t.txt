Breast cancer patients presenting with symptomatic brain metastases have poor prognosis, and current chemotherapeutic agents are largely ineffective. In this study, we evaluated the hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) for its potential as a novel therapeutic in preclinical models of brain metastasis of breast cancer. We used the parental triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (231) cells and their brain colonizing counterpart (231Br) to ascertain phenotypic differences in response to AZA. We observed that 231Br cells have higher metastatic potential compared to 231 cells. With regard to therapeutic value, the AZA IC50 value in 231Br cells is significantly lower than that in parental cells (P < .01). AZA treatment increased apoptosis and inhibited the Wnt signaling transduction pathway, angiogenesis, and cell metastatic capacity to a significantly higher extent in the 231Br line. AZA treatment in mice with experimental brain metastases significantly reduced tumor burden (P = .0112) and increased survival (P = .0026) compared to vehicle. Lastly, we observed a decreased expression of keratin 18 (an epithelial maker) in 231Br cells due to hypermethylation, elucidating a potential mechanism of action of AZA in treating brain metastases from breast cancer.

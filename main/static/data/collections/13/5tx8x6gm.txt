The Cadi ThermoSENSOR skin-contact thermometer measures body temperature continuously and transmits readings wirelessly to a central server. This study evaluated the ThermoSENSOR against ear temperatures (ETs) measured by a Braun ThermoScan ear thermometer and axillary temperatures (ATs) measured by a Terumo digital clinical thermometer. The test participants consisted of 109 children aged 6 months to 16 years from a pediatric ward. The sensor was attached to the lower abdomen at least 15 minutes before the first measurement. ET, AT, and ThermoSENSOR temperatures (TTs) were recorded up to three times at the usual measurement times. The TTs differed from ETs by −0.23°C ± 0.47°C (mean ± standard deviation, n = 271) and from ATs by +0.21°C ± 0.46°C (n = 270). The ETs differed from ATs by +0.43°C ± 0.42°C (n = 315). These results suggest that the TTs were comparable to the ETs and ATs.

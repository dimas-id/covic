In October 2013, CNN reported that 400 civilians had been killed in Pakistan by unmanned aircraft (UA) since President Obama took office in 2009. Transnational legal theory suggests that such attacks are illegal and, in 2009, the United Nations special rapporteur on extra judicial killings suggested that the use of drones by the Obama administration in Afghanistan and Pakistan was untenable and contrary to international law.

BACKGROUND The acellular dermal matrix (Flex HD) (FHD) became available for use in Western Australia in 2014 to aid prosthetic breast reconstruction and this descriptive study aims to review and discuss a single institution's experience since its introduction. METHODS By retrospective case note, review data were collected for all patients who underwent prosthetic breast reconstruction with the aid of FHD between January 2014 and August 2015 in our institution. Data on basic demographic parameters, risk factors, surgery-related factors, post-operative factors and follow-up information were collected. All complications were recorded and described in detail. RESULTS FHD was used in 42 breast reconstructions in 26 patients. Procedure-related complications were seen in 26% (n = 11) of cases. A major complication requiring return to theatre was seen in 11% (n = 5) of cases. Cellulitis of the reconstructed breast (red breast syndrome) was seen in 16.67% (n = 7) cases. Overall implant loss was 2.4% (n = 1). Of the six possible risk factors for any complication, only current smoking was found to increase the risk of complications (odds ratio = 9.667, 95% confidence interval = 1.429-65.377). CONCLUSION FHD is associated with a relatively high overall complication rate. Use of this optional expensive material has to be carefully selected balancing its perceived advantages against this possible risk. The red breast syndrome merits further studies considering its frequent occurrence with FHD use.

Tsunami early detection systems are of great importance as they provide time to prepare for a tsunami and mitigate its impact. In this paper, we propose a method to determine the optimal location of a given number of sensors to report a tsunami as early as possible. The rainfall optimization algorithm, a population-based algorithm, was used to solve the resulting optimization problem. Computation of wave travel times was done by illustrating the kinematics of a wave front using a linear approximation of the shallow water equations.

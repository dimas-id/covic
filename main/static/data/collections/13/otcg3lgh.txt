The aim of this study was to characterize the echocardiographic phenotype of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia and its relation to biomarkers. Seventy-four patients (59Â±13 years, 78% male) admitted with Covid-19 were included after referral for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as part of routine care. A level 1 British Society of Echocardiography TTE assessed chamber size and function, valvular disease and likelihood of pulmonary hypertension. The chief abnormalities were right ventricular (RV) dilatation (41%) and RV dysfunction (27%). RV impairment was associated with increased D-dimer and CRP levels. In contrast, left ventricular (LV) function was hyper-dynamic or normal in most (89%) patients.

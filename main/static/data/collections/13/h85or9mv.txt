The COVID-19 pandemic has had major consequences for the organization of care. In France and around the world, centers practicing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have seen their activity decrease, or even stop for many reasons. In this context, maintaining or resuming this essential therapeutic activity for many patients suffering from psychiatric disorders requires material, human and logistical adaptations that should be supervised. The objective of this collective and national work is to offer simple recommendations that can be applied immediately by any healthcare establishment, public or private, practicing ECT. They are the result of feedback from multiprofessional and inter-establishment experiences. Declined in three stages, these recommendations are accompanied by a practical sheet which describes in detail the necessary conditions and prerequisites for any resumption of ECT activity.

INTRODUCTION The socioeconomic impact of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is considerable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating OSAHS with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the impact of CPAP compliance. METHODS This was a retrospective, case-crossover study of 373 patients with OSAHS receiving CPAP. We compared changes in costs, Epworth score and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D questionnaires) between the year before treatment and the year after treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the first year of treatment was estimated, and projections were made for the second year, using different effectiveness and cost scenarios. RESULTS The visual analog scale score for the EQ-5D questionnaire increased by 5 points and the Epworth score fell by 10 points during the year of CPAP treatment. Mean gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was 0.05 per patient per year (P<.001): 0.07 among compliers and -0.04 among non-compliers. ICER was €51,147/QALY during the first year of CPAP treatment and €1,544/QALY during the second year. CONCLUSION CPAP treatment in patients with moderate-severe OSAHS improves the quality of life of compliant patients, and is cost-effective as of the second year.

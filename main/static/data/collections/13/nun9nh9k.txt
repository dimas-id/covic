Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the care of patients with HF who contract COVID-19 as well as those without COVID-19 who have been impacted by the restructuring of health care delivery. Patients with HF and other cardiovascular comorbidities are at risk for severe disease and complications of infection. Similarly, COVID-19 has been demonstrated to cause myocarditis and may be implicated in new-onset cardiomyopathy. During this pandemic, special considerations are needed for patients with advanced HF, including those supported by durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and heart transplant recipients. The purpose of this review is to summarize emerging data regarding the development of HF secondary to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection in patients with advanced HF, and the implications of the pandemic on care for non-infected patients with HF.

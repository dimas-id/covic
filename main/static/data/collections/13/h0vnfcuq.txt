Abstract Desiccant cooling system for active humidity control and to conserve energy has been in commercial applications for over two decades. However, its use in humid wet markets has never been examined. A gas-fired desiccant cooling system has been installed in a wet market in Hong Kong. In this study, the annual energy saving in conjunction with the use of desiccant cooling system was investigated by in-situ measurements, site surveys and simulations. The verified computer model was used for further simulations. It was found that for the use of a minimum ventilation rate of 10.3 L/s/person, the use of desiccant cooling system as compared to conventional system saved 4% of the energy and could achieve the desired space conditions. A parametric study under various ventilation rates indicated that use of desiccant cooling system in wet markets in hot and humid Hong Kong would lead to energy and energy cost savings, as well as CO2 emission reduction amounting from 1% to 13%. The savings were more evident when wet markets were designed for a ventilation rate of 20 L/s/person. Furthermore, the actual occupancy profile, and lighting and small power densities determined in this study would be useful for future studies on wet market.

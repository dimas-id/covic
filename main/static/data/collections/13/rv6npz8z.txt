Abstract Bovine interferon-omega3 (BoIFN-ω3) gene was amplified from bovine liver genomic DNA, which encodes a 195-amino acid protein containing a 23-amino acid signal peptide. Analysis of the molecular characteristics revealed that BoIFN-ω3 evolving from IFN-ω, contained four cysteine residues and five alpha helices, showing that BoIFN-ω3 presented the typical molecular characteristics of type I interferon. BoIFN-ω3 exhibited antiviral and antiproliferative activities, which exerted a protective effect against VSV in several mammalian cell lines, as well as against BEV, IBRV, and BVDV in MDBK cell. Moreover, BoIFN-ω3 was shown to be highly sensitive to trypsin, but remaining stable despite changes in pH and temperature. Additionally, BoIFN-ω3 induced the transcription of Mx1, ISG15, and ISG56 genes, as well as the expression of Mx1 protein in a time-dependent manner. These findings will be useful to further study BoIFN-ω in host's defence against infectious diseases, particularly viral infections. Furthermore, results will facilitate further research on the bovine interferon family.

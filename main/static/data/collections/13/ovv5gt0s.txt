INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a risk factor for poor patient outcomes after organ transplantation (TXP). While metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is safe and effective in treating severe obesity, the role of MBS in transplant patients continues to evolve. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients in the 2017 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality and Improvement Project (MBSAQIP) database. Propensity and case-control matching, and multivariable logistic regression were performed for 30-day post-operative outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 336 transplant patients were compared with 157,413 patients without transplant. Propensity and case-control matching reveal no significant differences in mortality (p > 0.2). However, case-control matching revealed longer operative time (104 min versus 76 min, p < 0.001), increased length of stay (2 days versus 1 day, p < 0.05), perioperative transfusions (2% versus 0.22%, p = 0.009), and leak rates (2.2% versus 0.55%, p = 0.02) in the transplant cohort. On multivariable regression analysis, prior transplantation was associated with higher rates of overall (OR 1.6, p = 0.007) and bariatric-related morbidity (OR 1.78, p = 0.004), leak (OR 3.47, p = 0.0027), and surgical site infection (OR 3.32, p = 0.004). Prior transplantation did not predict overall (p = 0.55) nor bariatric-related mortality (p = 0.99). CONCLUSION: MBS in prior solid organ transplantation patients is overall safe, but is associated with increased operative time and length of stay, as well as higher rates of some post-operative morbidity.

Respiratory complaints in the gravid patient are often difficult to identify as a disease state, expected physiologic changes of pregnancy or both. Understanding the underlying pulmonary physiologic changes that come with pregnancy as well as those conditions which are unique to the pregnant patient will help arrive at the correct diagnosis and management. Recognizing that the gravid patient has other physiologic changes that contribute to decreased respiratory reserve, increased risk of aspiration, infection, and difficult airway can help in managing these patients acutely.

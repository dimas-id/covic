Wound-closing technology continues to evolve with the advent of barbed sutures, which appear to address some of the limitations of traditional sutures (numerous knots and time-consuming insertion, among other things). Advantages of knotless suture devices, specifically in body contouring, have been discussed in the literature over the past decade, with a recent increase over the past several years due to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of unidirectional V-Loc (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) and bidirectional Quill (Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) barbed sutures for soft tissue approximation. A thorough review of the existing literature and evaluation of the author's personal experience are presented in this article. As with any new surgical device, a learning curve is present that needs to be overcome to realize the full benefits of utilizing barbed sutures in body surgery while minimizing their complications.

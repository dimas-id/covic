Abstract A series of pyrazolone compounds as possible SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro protease assay using fluorogenic substrate peptide in which several showed potent inhibition against the 3CL protease. Interestingly, one of the inhibitors was also active against 3C protease from coxsackievirus B3. These inhibitors could be potentially developed into anti-coronaviral and anti-picornaviral agents.

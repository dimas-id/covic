This unit reviews the stages involved in protein production in mammalian cells using a stable‐expression approach. Choice of cell type is discussed, as is transfection of the host cells, methods for selection and amplification of transformants, and growth of cells at appropriate scale for protein production. Since post‐transcriptional modification and intracellular protein transportation are important features of recombinant‐protein production in mammalian cells, some description of these mechanisms is included.

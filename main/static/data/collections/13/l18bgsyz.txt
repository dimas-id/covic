Researchers have long examined grief-related reactions to the diagnosis of a loved one with a terminal illness, including preloss grief (PLG), which is the experience of grief symptoms prior to the loss of a loved one. Families face novel challenges when loved ones with COVID-19 become critically ill-most notably mandated physical separation-and may experience a wide range of PLG responses. This commentary examines the existing literature related to PLG as a means for understanding the psychological impact of COVID-19 deaths, identifies factors professionals can assess for and address when working with a family member of COVID-19 patients, and identifies areas for future research related to COVID-19 and PLG.

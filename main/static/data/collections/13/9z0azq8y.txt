OBJECTIVE: To investigate the psychological status and sleep quality of nursing interns in collective isolation during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide evidence for adequate interventions. METHODS: We surveyed a total of 95 nursing interns who were isolated collectively in a general teaching hospital in Guangzhou using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality. RESULTS: The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79±6.59, 43.98±9.74 and 5.20±3.14, respectively, which were significant higher than the national norms in China (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the sleep quality score (r=0.508 and 0.546, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that the major factors affecting the psychological status and sleep quality of the interns during collective isolation included recent contact with persons from the affected area before isolation and the onset of fever during the isolation. CONCLUSIONS: These interns showed relatively high levels of anxiety and depression during the collective isolation to affect their sleep quality, and interventions should be timely administered to improve their mental health and sleep quality.

Abstract A wide variety of insults can produce acute lung damage, inclusive of those that injure the lungs directly. The clinical syndrome of acute onset respiratory distress, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates is referred to as acute respiratory distress syndrome. The histologic counterpart of acute respiratory distress syndrome is diffuse alveolar damage, classically characterized by hyaline membranes. Other histologic features of acute lung injury include intraalveolar fibrin, organization, interstitial edema, and reactive pneumocytes. Diffuse alveolar damage and other histologic features of acute lung injury are nonspecific as to etiology, and once identified require the pathologist to search the biopsy for further features that may help identify a specific etiology. This chapter reviews the temporal sequence of acute lung injury and explores the large variety of specific etiologic causes with emphasis on helpful histologic features to identify.

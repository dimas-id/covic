The Editor in chief and Deputy Editors of the JAMA recently shared their concern regarding possible reporting of patients in more than one manuscript, while this has not been clearly indicated in the submission [1]. Although the unprecedented context of the COVID‐19 outbreak justifies efforts for rapid dissemination of knowledge, such practice may be responsible for inaccurate interpretation and overestimation of published data [1]. Similar concern applies to dermatology. In Spain, the national COVID Piel study have reported 372 patients with skin manifestations related with COVID‐19, including 71 patients with pseudo‐chilblains, from April 3(rd) to April 16(th) [2].

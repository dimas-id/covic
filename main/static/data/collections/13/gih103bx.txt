Transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 are through aerosol, droplet and touching infected material. Indoor locations are more likely environments for the diffusion of the virus contagion among people, but direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in air or on surfaces is quite sparse, especially regarding public transport. In fact, an important demand is to know how and if it is safe to use them. To understand the possible spreading of COVID-19 inside a city bus during normal operation and the effectiveness of the protective measures adopted for transportation, we analysed the air and the surfaces most usually touched by passengers. The measurements were carried out across the last week of the lockdown and the first week when gradually all the travel restrictions were removed.

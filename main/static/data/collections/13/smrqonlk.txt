The aim of this study was to analyze the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS 90 urologists aged 25 to 60 years (M=37.27, S.D.=9.53), 93% of them were men, participated in the online survey. They answered questions about their attitude to their job as doctors and the impact of COVID-19. They filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and answered questions assessing their sense of control. RESULTS The greatest concern among urologists is the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 (for 30% of the doctors). 43% of urologists state that their profession interesting. A positive attitude to work, as well as the Big Five traits (Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability and Agreeableness) are associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, stress and lack of control.

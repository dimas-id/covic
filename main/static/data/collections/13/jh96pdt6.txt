An 87-year-old man hospitalized for subarachnoid hemorrhage showed a ruptured aneurysm arising from fenestration of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Endovascular treatment was selected and the aneurysm and superior limb were embolized completely using three coils. Fenestration of the posterior cerebellar artery is exceedingly rare. In addition, we present a first case of aneurysm as fenestration of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery that was definitively identified as a cause of bleeding.

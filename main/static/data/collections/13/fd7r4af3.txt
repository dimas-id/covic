Hypertension remains one of the largest human health problems, because hypertensive patients carry increased risk for ischemic heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, and renal failure. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been intensively investigated for more than 100 years because it is a powerful regulator of blood pressure, and the antihypertensive benefits of RAS inhibitors are very clear. Despite a wealth of clinical and basic studies, the precise mechanisms by which the RAS regulates blood pressure remains incomplete. In this chapter, we review data demonstrating the existence and function of intrinsic tissue RAS, with a primary focus on the brain.

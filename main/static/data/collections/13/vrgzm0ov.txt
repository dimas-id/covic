The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an urgent need to contribute to the fight against an immense threat to the human population. Computer Vision, as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, has enjoyed recent success in solving various complex problems in health care and has the potential to contribute to the fight of controlling COVID-19. In response to this call, computer vision researchers are putting their knowledge base at work to devise effective ways to counter COVID-19 challenge and serve the global community. New contributions are being shared with every passing day. It motivated us to review the recent work, collect information about available research resources and an indication of future research directions. We want to make it available to computer vision researchers to save precious time. This survey paper is intended to provide a preliminary review of the available literature on the computer vision efforts against COVID-19 pandemic.

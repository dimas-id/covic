To investigate the adaptation of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in a human cell line may be beneficial to understanding the potential mechanisms of coronavirus interspecies infection. The current study addressed the poor replication of IBV in the HeLa human cell line demonstrated in previous reports. We showed that IBV strains M41, H52, H120 and Gray could be propagated in HeLa cells with distinct cytopathic effect. The virus titre in freshly dispersed HeLa cells was 1000-fold higher than in cell monolayers. Trypsin was not the determinant for the viral replication, suggesting that the restriction of IBV replication in HeLa cells is the result of intracellular events rather than the binding to or fusion with host cells. These IBV strains replicated to an average titre of 10(3.4+/-0.2)/0.1 ml median tissue culture infectious doses in freshly dispersed HeLa cells and maintained this titre for the first 12 passages. Then an approximately 10-fold increase (10(4.20+/-0.19)/0.1 ml) occurred in passage 13, which was maintained to passage 16, after which there was another, bigger rise to 10(6.6+/-0.3)/0.1 ml in passage 17. This titre was maintained until passage 24 when the experiment was terminated. The IBV M41 S1 gene was amplified and sequenced for passages 0, 5 and 21. There was only one amino acid replacement in the S1 protein, in passage 21. The presence of sialic acid on HeLa cells contributed to efficient virus replication, while human aminopeptidase N was not involved in the infection. Haemagglutinin activity gradually reduced with increased passages. These results indicated that the virus adaptation would probably be determined by host cell modification such as receptor glycosylation and different receptor utilization instead of viral gene mutation.

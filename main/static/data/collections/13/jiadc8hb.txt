In this short review, the current findings on coronoavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women are presented. Self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels is currently the gold standard in pregnant women. When using subcutaneous glucose sensors, the time in range (TIR) of 63–140 mg/dl (3.5–7.8 mmol/l) &gt;70% should be reached as early as possible. In pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes, there is a high risk for stillbirth in a fetus with growth restriction. In the absence of evidence for improvement of relevant endpoints, pharmacological therapies in pregnant women with early gestational diabetes at &lt;24 + 0 weeks of gestation should be considered critically. Women who are obese prior to conception should not gain more than 6 kg during pregnancy. In women who have undergone bariatric-metabolic surgery, there are advantages for the mothers and increased risks for newborns, e.g., an increased rate of newborns small for gestational age after Roux-en‑Y gastric bypass.

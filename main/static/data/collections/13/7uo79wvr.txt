The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing and impacting lives on a global scale. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field game model in controlling the propagation of epidemics on a spatial domain. The control variable, the spatial velocity, is first introduced for the classical disease models, such as the SIR model. For this proposed model, we provide fast numerical algorithms based on proximal primal-dual methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model illustrates how to separate infected patients in a spatial domain effectively.

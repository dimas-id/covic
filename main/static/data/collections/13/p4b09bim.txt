On the cover, a Shanghai commuter takes precautions during the 2003 avian influenza outbreak. It is nearly 40 years since the last worldwide influenza pandemic, and though these things don't run to an orderly timetable, many believe that it is only a matter of time — not much time at that — until the next one.

Computational social science and in particular agent-based social simulation continue to gain momentum in the academic community. Social network analysis enjoys even more popularity. They both have much in common. In agent-based models, individual interactions are simulated to generate social patterns of all kinds, including relationships that can then be analyzed by social network analysis. This chapter describes and discusses the role of agent-based modeling in the generative-analytical part of this symbiosis. More precisely, we look at what concepts are used, how they are used (implemented), and what kind of validation procedures can be applied.

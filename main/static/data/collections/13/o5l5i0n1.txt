Abstract Many viruses replicate and assemble in subcellular microenvironments called virus factories or ‘viroplasm.’ Virus factories increase the efficiency of replication and at the same time protect viruses from antiviral defenses. We describe how viruses reorganize cellular membrane compartments and cytoskeleton to generate these ‘mini-organelles’ and how these rearrangements parallel cellular responses to stress such as protein aggregation and DNA damage.

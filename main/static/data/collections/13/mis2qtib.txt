A new method for rapidly eliminating pathogenic microorganisms in large air space using spraying •OH radicals is presented in this paper. With a physical method of strong electric-field discharge, large numbers of •OH radicals were produced by the oxygen activated particles of O2+, O( 1D), O( 3P), etc., and the introducing reagent HO2-. The gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, the gram-negative bacteria Serratia marcescens, and Bacillus spores were used for the eliminating experiments. Results show that the different microorganisms were rapidly killed by •OH radicals with a concentration of 0.8 mg/L and spraying density of 21 μL/m2 within 4 sec. Cell morphological changes were also observed under microscope. The cells of B. subtilis and Bacillus spores in their cellular wall, cellular membrane, or cell protoplasm were greatly destroyed when being exposed to a killing dosage of •OH radicals.

Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a severe consequence of perinatal asphyxia (PA) that can result in life-long neurological disability. Disease mechanisms, including the role and interaction of individual metabolic pathways, remain unclear. As hypoxia is an acute condition, aerobic energy metabolism is central to global metabolic pathways, and these metabolites are detectable using 1H NMR spectroscopy, we hypothesized that characterizing the NMR-derived umbilical cord serum metabolome would offer insight into the consequences of PA that lead to HIE. Fifty-nine at-risk infants were enrolled, together with 1:1 matched healthy controls, and stratified by disease severity (n=25, HIE; n=34, non-HIE PA). Eighteen of 37 reproducibly detectable metabolites were significantly altered between study groups. Acetone, 3-hydroxybutyrate, succinate, and glycerol were significantly differentially altered in severe HIE. Multivariate data analysis revealed a metabolite profile associated with both asphyxia and HIE. Multiple-linear regression modeling using 4 metabolites (3-hydroxybutyrate, glycerol, O-phosphocholine, and succinate) predicted HIE severity with an adjusted R2 of 0.4. Altered ketones suggest that systemic metabolism may play a critical role in preventing neurological injury, while altered succinate provides a possible explanation for hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) stabilization in HI injury.

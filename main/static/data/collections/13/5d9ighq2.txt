INTRODUCTION Structural and physiologic differences between pediatric and adult patients make management of the pediatric airway a challenge. Many initial airway device designs were modeled for adult patients and simply downsized for the pediatric population. This paper reviews the last decade's design improvements in video laryngoscopes and supraglottic airway devices (SGAs), as well as advances in noninvasive oxygenation/ventilation techniques for pediatric airway management. Areas covered: Topic areas reviewed include basic principles of common and newer devices for video laryngoscopy, supraglottic airway management, and alternate ventilation techniques. A literature search was conducted in PubMed using device-specific keywords and limited to neonatal, infant, and pediatric populations. Articles were reviewed for evidence deemed high yield by the authors. Device specifications were obtained from manufacturer correspondences. Features, comparisons, advantages, and disadvantages are provided for each device class. We give expert commentary regarding the current state of clinical application, research considerations, as well as a 5-year outlook on potential areas of device design and development. Expert commentary: Video laryngoscopes and SGAs are safe and effective for use in children and improvements continue to be made for neonates and infants. The most significant area of new research is in the area of noninvasive airway devices for oxygenation and ventilation in difficult airways.

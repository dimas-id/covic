BACKGROUND Various strategies are emerging for dosing antiplatelet therapies in preparation for pipeline stent embolization in adults. Hyper-response is associated with hemorrhagic complications. Hypo-response is associated with thromboembolic events. Dosing of antiplatelet agents is highly variable, with little consensus among experts for adults-and even more so for children. To date, pipeline stents have been deployed in 11 pediatric patients, ages 4-15. A variety of clopidogrel and aspirin dosing regimens have been used, with response tested in only three patients, who were all therapeutic. Thrombotic events occurred in two patients, neither of whom were tested. CASE We describe here the first case of a hemorrhagic complication in a hyper-responsive pediatric patient undergoing placement of a pipeline stent. DISCUSSION As the use of endovascular therapies requiring dual anti-platelet agents becomes more established, there is an increasing need to develop titration protocols that minimizes the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events.

This is a report of an atypical presentation of COVID-19. The patient had sparse pulmonary symptoms despite characteristic COVID-19 lesions on CT-thorax and developed severe acral ischaemic change, after a few days of hospitalisation. The condition could not be explained by classical sepsis with hypotension and hypoperfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation, vasculitis, endocarditis or severe peripheral arteriosclerosis. A skin biopsy showed microthrombosis, interpreted as an activation of the coagulation system associated with COVID-19. Apparently, there are multiple COVID-19 phenotypes.

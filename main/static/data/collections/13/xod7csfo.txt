In this article we describe the organization of post mortem tissue donation in the Netherlands, the average number of tissue donors procured during the years 2015–2019 and the main challenges we face to improve this number. Licensed by the Dutch Ministry of Health, the Dutch Transplant Foundation (NTS) plays a central role in the organization of tissue donation. The NTS works closely with the Dutch hospitals, two tissue banks and a procurement organization. Potential tissue donors are reported to the NTS 24/7. After consulting the Donor Register and relatives give consent for donation, donors are subject to a thorough medical evaluation. If no medical contraindication is mentioned, the donor is approved for tissue donation. Each year, tissues of an average of 1918 donors (112.1 donors Per Million Population) are procured. After procurement of tissues, donor blood and tissues are tested on virology and quality respectively. Based on the test results and the assessment of potential disease transmission, tissues can either be released for transplantation or discarded. In conclusion, the Netherlands has developed a uniform, nationwide approach for safe and efficient post mortem tissue donation in which the NTS plays a central role. In the past 5 years, tissues from a considerable number of donors are procured. The NTS will continue to work together with their partners, by stimulating donor recognition, registration of the donor will, relatives’ informed consent and by extending donor selection criteria, for an even more efficient way to help patients on the waiting list for a transplantation.

Porcine deltacoronavirus has caused great economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. In this study, we carried out the first detection, sequencing and characterization of this virus in Mexico. We analysed 885 rectal samples by multiplex RT‚ÄêPCR to determine coinfections. In addition, the Spike gene was amplified, sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. We found 85 positive samples for porcine deltacoronavirus, representing 9.6% of the total samples, and we determined that the most frequent coinfection was with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (54.1%). Four sequences of Mexican isolates were most closely related to those of the United States. The antigenic regions and the glycosylation site of the strains obtained coincide with those previously reported. This relationship is probably related to the commercial exchange of pigs between the US and Mexico and the geographical proximity of these two countries.

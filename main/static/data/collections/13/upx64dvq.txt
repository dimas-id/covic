An increasing number of laparoscopic pancreatic procedures are currently carried out worldwide. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) appears to be technically and oncologically promising in selected patients with benign tumors and low-grade malignancies of the pancreatic body/tail, and is now widely adopted. Here, we described our standard procedures of LDP and some tips on LDP. Recent important insights into some variations/options of LDP including spleen preservation, hand-assisted procedure, and single-incision surgery are also reviewed in this article.

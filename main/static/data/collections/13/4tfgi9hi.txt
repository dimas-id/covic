Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 ligand, resiquimod, has been studied as an adjuvant and antiviral agent against several pathogens in chicken. Yet, the effectiveness of resiquimod against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection has not been evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of resiquimod delivered pre-hatch (in ovo) against IBV infection post-hatch identifying key mechanisms involved in resiquimod driven immune activation. First, we found an upregulation of interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA levels and considerable expansions of macrophage and cluster of differentiation (CD) 8α+ T cell populations in lungs of chicken as early as day one post-hatch, following pre-hatch delivery of resiquimod. Second, we observed that resiquimod was able to act as an adjuvant when resiquimod was delivered pre-hatch along with an inactivated IBV vaccine. Finally, when the resiquimod pretreated one-day-old chickens were infected with IBV, reduction in viral shedding via oral and fecal routes was observed at 3 days post- infection. Overall, this study shows that the pre-hatch delivered resiquimod increases cell-mediated immune responses in lungs with an advantage of reduction in IBV shedding.

The role of disease‐modifying therapies in patients with autoimmune disorders during SARS‐CoV2 infection is controversial. Immunocompromised patients could have a more severe COVID‐19 disease, due to the absence of an adequate immune response against the SARS‐CoV‐2. However, therapies that act on immune response could play a protective role by dampening the cytokine release syndrome. Fingolimod is a drug used for immune therapy in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) through the sequestration of activated lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. We report the case of a 57‐year‐old man with relapsing‐remitting MS treated with fingolimod that showed a reactivation of COVID‐19 with signs of hyperinflammation syndrome after fingolimod withdrawal. Our case suggests that discontinuation of fingolimod during COVID‐19 could imply a worsening of SARS‐CoV2 infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

@# Emergencies refer to those events that cause serious social harm, including natural disasters and public health events, and require emergency response. Medical rescue team is the main emergency rescue team. While carrying out the rescue mission, they are under great pressure both physically and mentally due to the unadaptability of the rescue environment, the lack of protective materials, overwork and other reasons, often resulting in fear, tension, anxiety, pessimism, self-blame and even acute stress disorder. Without timely and effective psychological support, long-term psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder will remain after the event. Comprehensive psychological support includes psychological measurement of the whole rescue process, team formation before rescue and detailed psychological support intervention training, self-relaxation during rescue, basic life and safety guarantee, drug treatment, online psychological assistance, withdrawal of stressors after rescue and lifestyle reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: Low-grade fever during convalescence is an atypical symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Reports of such cases are rare, and the mechanism and outcome of low-grade fever during COVID-19 convalescence are not completely clear. We report 3 cases with low-grade fever during COVID-19 convalescence and highlight the main clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics, thereby increasing the level of expertise in the clinical management of COVID-19 during convalescence and facilitating individualized decision-making. CASE SUMMARY: We describe 3 patients with COVID-19, two females aged 62 and 66 years and a male 55 years, who had low-grade fever during COVID-19 convalescence. All 3 patients had no other discomfort or comorbidities during low-grade process. Lesions on computed tomography in all 3 patients had resolved during this period. Two patients tested negative on two consecutive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 tests with an interval of at least 24 h between tests. Body temperature in all 3 patients returned to normal after several days without treatment, and fever recurrence was not observed. CONCLUSION: Enhancing the knowledge of low-grade fever during COVID-19 convalescence may increase the expertise in the delivery of optimal healthcare services.

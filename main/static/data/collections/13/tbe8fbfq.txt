Cells use sophisticated molecular circuits to interpret and respond to extracellular signal factors, such as hormones and cytokines, which are often released in a temporally varying fashion. In this study, we focus on type I interferon (IFN) signaling in human epithelial cells and combine microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and computational modeling to investigate how the IFN-responsive regulatory network operates in single cells to process repetitive IFN stimulation. We found that IFN-Î± pretreatments lead to opposite effects, priming versus desensitization, depending on the input durations. These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18 upregulation can only be initiated at the G1 and early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells. This cell cycle gating provides a temporal compartmentalization of feedback control processes, enabling duration-dependent desensitization to repetitive stimulations. Moreover, our results, highlighting the importance of IFN dynamics, may suggest time-based strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of IFN pretreatment in clinical applications against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.

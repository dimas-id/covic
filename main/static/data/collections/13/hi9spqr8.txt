Abstract Environment has complex and permanent relations with the biological warfare in comparison to other war types (conventional, nuclear, chemical). Changes of the environment interfere with many of the major determinants of biological warfare. The most probable type and the key issue of biological war is bioterrorism. Bioterrorism is defined as a release of biological agents or toxins that affect human beings, animals, or plants with the intent to harm or intimidate. The essence of bioterrorism is a biological attack. Four components are required for a biological attack: perpetrators, agents, mediums/means of delivery, and targets.

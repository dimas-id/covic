Along with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, viral RNA was detectable at high concentration for >3 weeks in fecal samples from 12 mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic children with COVID-19. Saliva also tested positive during the early phase of infection. If proven infectious, feces and saliva could serve as transmission sources.

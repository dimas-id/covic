STUDY OBJECTIVE To estimate the effectiveness of unidirectional knotless barbed suture and continuous suture with intracorporeal knots in the repair of uterine wall defects during laparoscopic myomectomy. DESIGN Randomized clinical study (Canadian Task Force Classification I). SETTING Single-center study in a university hospital. PATIENTS This study enrolled 44 women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. INTERVENTIONS In accord with to the randomization, the uterine wall defects were closed either with a continuous suture with intracorporeal knots (group V) or a unidirectional knotless barbed suture (group L). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The time required to suture the uterine wall defect was significantly lower in group L (11.5 ± 4.1 minutes) than in group V (17.4 ± 3.8 minutes; p <.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the operative time between the 2 study groups. The intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in group L than in group V (p =.004). The degree of surgical difficulty was significantly lower in group L (3.7 ± 1.1) than in group V (6.1 ± 2.1; p <.001). CONCLUSION The unidirectional knotless barbed suture may facilitate the suture of uterine wall defects during laparoscopic myomectomy. When compared with continuous suture and intracorporeal knots, the barbed suture reduces the time required to suture the uterine wall defect and the intraoperative blood loss.

Modern anesthesiology employs the combined administration of several drugs belonging to different pharmacological classes. Additionally, anesthesiologists are facing the challenge of polypharmacy regimens utilized by patients considered for surgical treatment. When drugs are combined, the pharmacological effect may considerably differ from the individually expected properties. This may be beneficial or potentially lead to adverse drug reactions harming the patient. The incidence of drug interaction increases exponentially with the number of drugs administered. Depending on the mechanism involved, drug interactions can be classified as pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamic, or pharmacokinetic. Although there are enormous possibilities for adverse drug reactions and the complexity is hard to identify, prediction of drug interaction is possible. Besides recognizing the general risk factors, fundamental knowledge of basic and clinical pharmacology is important to prevent serious or fatal drug interactions before they occur.

The Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) is a valid and reliable measure of basic, non-procedure-specific laparoscopic skills. GOALS-incisional hernia (GOALS-IH) was developed to evaluate performance of laparoscopic incisional hernia repair (LIHR). The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of GOALS-IH during LIHR simulation. GOALS-IH assesses 7 domains with a maximum score of 35. A total of 12 experienced surgeons and 10 novices performed LIHR on the Surgical Abdominal Wall simulator. Performance was assessed by a trained observer and by self-assessment using GOALS-IH, basic GOALS and a visual analog scale (VAS) for overall competence. Both interrater reliability and internal consistency were high (.76 and .95 respectively). Experienced surgeons had higher mean GOALS-IH scores than novices (32.3 ± 2 versus 22.7 ± 5). There was excellent correlation between GOALS-IH and other measures of performance (GOALS r = .93 and VAS r = .93). GOALS-IH is easy to use, valid and reliable for assessment of simulated LIHR.

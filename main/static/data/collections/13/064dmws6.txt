This compilation accounts the efforts made to characterize the proteomes of lung tissues in health and disease and to recognize proteomic patterns of diseased states in the patient's biological fluids/secretions and lavage fluids. A massive amount of primary data could not lead yet to the identification of diagnostic proteomic signatures. The variability of proteomic findings associated with lung diseases suggests that a useful diagnostic index may eventually result only from the composite predictive values of a large panel of protein markers.

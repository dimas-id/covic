This article reviews transmissible proventriculitis in poultry from 1971 to 2006. The disease is important in commercial broilers worldwide, resulting in reduced profits. The aetiology of this disease is unknown and different clinical presentations often result in a confused or complicated diagnosis. The lesion of enlarged proventriculus is often referred to as proventriculitis. However, the term proventriculitis can only be used correctly when there is microscopic evidence of inflammation of the proventriculus glands. Infectious and non-infectious causes of proventriculitis, with major emphasis on the infectious or transmissible causes, are reviewed.

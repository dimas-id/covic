PURPOSE Cerebral infarction is a rare complication of lung resection that can result in severe sequelae. Our aim was to investigate the characteristics of patients who suffer from cerebral infarction after surgery for lung cancer. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent resection of at least a single lobe for lung cancer at our institution between January 2008 and October 2013. We compared the patients who presented with cerebral infarction with those patients who did not within 30 days of surgery. RESULTS A total of 562 patients underwent surgery, with five males and one female subsequently experiencing cerebral infarction. Five patients underwent left upper lobectomy and one underwent left lower lobectomy. Patient age, sex, body mass index, smoking index, and operative time were not significantly different between the six patients with postoperative cerebral infarction and the other 556 patients; only the type of operative procedure was significantly different (p < 0.001). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed thrombosis in the stump of the left superior pulmonary vein in patients with postoperative cerebral infarction. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral infarction occurs at a high frequency in patients who undergo left upper lobectomy for lung cancer. Thrombosis in the left superior pulmonary-vein stump might cause cerebral infarction.

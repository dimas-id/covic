Electrophoretic drug delivery devices are able to deliver drugs with exceptional temporal and spatial precision. This technology has emerged as a promising platform for treating pathologies ranging from neuropathic pain to epilepsy. As the range of applications continues to expand, there is an urgent need to understand the underlying physics and estimate materials and device parameters for optimal performance. Here, computational modeling of the electrophoretic drug delivery device is carried out. Three critical performance indices, namely, the amount of drug transported, the pumping efficiency and the ON/OFF ratio are investigated as a function of initial drug concentration in the device and fixed charge concentration in the ion exchange membrane. The results provide guidelines for future materials and device design with an eye towards tailoring device performance to match disease-specific demands.

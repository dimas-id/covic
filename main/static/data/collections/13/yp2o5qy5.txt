Colorenal fistula as a result of percutaneous cryoablation has not been extensively reported. We report a gentleman who presented with urosepsis after percutaneous biopsy of a renal mass complicated by colorenal fistula. After failed attempts at conservative management, he underwent laparoscopic resection of his fistula with renal salvage and omentoplasty highlighting that nephrectomy is not always indicated.

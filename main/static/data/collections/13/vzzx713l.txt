BACKGROUND: Confronting a once-in-a-century pandemic with COVID-19, tremendous stress has been placed in all walks of life worldwide. AIMS: In order to enhance scientific information interflow in the arena of liver diseases in Asia–Pacific region during this difficult time, Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) has taken the initiative to form the APASL COVID-19 Taskforce to formulate a clinical practice guidance in Hepatology, liver-related oncology, transplantation and conduct of clinical trials. METHODS: A taskforce with 22 key opinion leaders in Hepatology from 16 countries or administration regions in Asia–Pacific regions was formed and through intense interaction via webinar, this guidance was formulated. Based on scientific data and experiences, recommendations were made in the management of liver injury, liver transplantation, autoimmune diseases, chronic liver diseases, delivery of elective and emergency services and conduct of clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first consensus clinical guidance synthesized by APASL for our hepatologist and their allied medical personal.

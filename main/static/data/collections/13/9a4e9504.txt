AIM To present our experience on transarterial treatment of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) with ONYX in adult patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between March 2008 and November 2012, 27 adult patients with DAVFs treated by transarterial ONYX embolization were included. Clinical data, including hospital records, operative reports, and angiograms, were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS Complete obliteration of the fistula was achieved in 16/27 (59.3%) patients after 32 intra-arterial embolizations. One complication (3.7%) was transient hemiparesis. Follow-up imaging, which was available for 16 fistulas with angiographic cures, showed no evidence of recurrence. At mean 14.5 months follow-up, 26 patients (96.3%) had GOS score of 5 and 1 patient (3.7%) had GOS score of 3. CONCLUSION Transarterial ONYX embolization has become the main treatment for adult intracranial DAVFs and is associated with high safety and efficacy.

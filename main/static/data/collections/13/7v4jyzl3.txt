Abstract The growth of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 on murine DBT cells adapted to dextran-made Cytodex 1 microcarriers was studied in comparison with cells grown on plastic dishes. With a microcarrier concentration of 5 g/l in spinner flasks, a density of 3 Ã— 106 cells/ml was reached in 7 days. Under these conditions, cells supported virus growth to the same extent as when they were grown on the plastic substratum. This was shown by a similar development of virus-induced syncytia, the release of an equivalent number of infectious progeny virions per cell, similar recoveries observed after concentration and purification and an identical appearance of the purified virus under the electron microscope. On the other hand, the technical convenience of microcarriers and the ease of scale-up emphasize their potential for the growth of coronaviruses.

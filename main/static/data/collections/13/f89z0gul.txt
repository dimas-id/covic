BACKGROUND: Person-to-person transmitted infectious diseases can cause occupational diseases (OD). These are subsumed as BK-No. 3101 in the German list of OD which applies for individuals with a considerably higher risk for infection as a consequence of their professional activity compared to the general population. OBJECTIVES: The special medical and insurance law aspects of a work-related MRSA colonization are presented using the example of an expert opinion case and an evaluation of the BK reports of suspected occupational disease (BK No. 3101) of the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The BK documentation of the DGUV from 2007–2012 and the patient cohort from the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Erlangen, presenting for expert assessment from 2007–2012 were retrospectively analysed for human-to-human transmitted infectious diseases of the skin (BK-No. 3101). RESULTS: Person-to-person transmission of infectious diseases of the skin is rare in the field of occupational dermatology. In the DGUV cohort, suspected BK-No. 3101cases amounted to 2.6% of all notified cases; recognized BK-No. 3101 cases accounted for 4.2% of all recognized cases, amongst which 9 were caused by MRSA. In contrast to a symptomatic infection, an asymptomatic MRSA colonization is not being recognized as BK-No. 3101. Bacterial superantigens can trigger atopic dermatitis (AD). In particular cases, occupationally acquired MRSA can elicit AD and may justify classification as an OD (BK-No. 3101). CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of MRSA colonization and eradication are necessary for rehabilitation. Management of skin diseases due to infectious diseases within the framework of OD is presented.

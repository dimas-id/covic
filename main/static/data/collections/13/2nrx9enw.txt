Duck plague virus (DPV) is a virus of the Herpesviridae family that leads to acute disease with a high mortality rate in ducks. Control of the disease contributes to the development of poultry breeding. Type III IFN family (IFN-λs) is a novel member of the IFN family, and goose IFN-λ (goIFN-λ) is a newly identified gene whose antiviral function has only been investigated to a limited extent. Here, the cross-species antiviral activity of goIFN-λ against DPV in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) was studied. We found that pre-treatment with goIFN-λ greatly increased the expression of IFN-λ in both heterologous DEFs and homologous goose embryo fibroblasts (GEFs), while differentially inducing IFNα- and IFN-stimulated genes. Additionally, a positive self-regulatory feedback loop of goIFN-λ was blocked by a mouse anti-goIFN-λ polyclonal antibody, which was confirmed in both homologous GEFs and goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The suppression of the BAC-DPV-EGFP by goIFN-λ in DEFs was confirmed by ﬂuorescence microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, viral copies and titre detection, which can be rescued by mouse anti-goIFN-λ polyclonal antibody incubation. Finally, reporter gene assays indicated that the cross-species antiviral activity of goIFN-λ against BAC-DPV-EGFP is related to its positive self-regulatory feedback loop and subsequent ISG induction. Our data shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of goIFN-λ antiviral function in vitro and extend the considerable range of therapeutic applications in multiple-poultry disease.

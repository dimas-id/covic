OBJECTIVE The objectives of this study were to compare the results of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stripping for large-diameter varicose target veins for the period of 1 year, based on a composite end point; to analyze the pain severity on a digital rating scale for 7 days after RFA and stripping; and to detect the factors affecting the level of postoperative pain using the cluster analysis. METHODS This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study. Two groups, stripping ≥14 mm and RFA ≥14 mm, of 129 varicose vein disease patients underwent surgical treatment in three specialized clinics. We eliminated symptomatic pathologic reflux with RFA in 64 patients and with stripping in 65 patients. In the postoperative phase, we evaluated the pain level, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and paresthesia. A composite end point with four components was used to analyze the results. These were three clinical adverse effects of the intervention (pain, hemorrhage, and paresthesia) and the technical outcome 1 year after the surgical intervention. RESULTS The frequency of favorable outcomes was 20 (30.8%) in the stripping ≥14 mm group and 61 (95.3%) in the RFA ≥14 mm group (P < .0001). The odds ratio for a favorable outcome between the RFA and the stripping groups was 45.8 (95% confidence interval, 44.5-47.0). The pain clusters that were moderate were created by patients after stripping. These clusters show a link between the pain level on the one hand and an increased body mass index and large vein diameter on the other hand. CONCLUSIONS For large-diameter veins, RFA is superior to stripping in terms of favorable outcomes according to the composite end point chosen. Significant pain after stripping was linked to a large vein diameter and excess weight or adiposis.

ABSTRACT Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an emerging threat worldwide. It is still unclear how comorbidities affect the risk of infection and severity of COVID-19. Methods: A nationwide retrospective case-control study of 65,149 individuals, aged 18 years or older, whose medical cost for COVID-19 testing were claimed until April 8, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 and severity of COVID-19 infection were identified from the reimbursement data using diagnosis codes and based on whether respiratory support was used, respectively. Odds ratios were estimated using multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, region, healthcare utilization, and insurance status. Results: The COVID-19 group (5,172 of 65,149) was younger and showed higher proportion of females. 5.6% (293 of 5,172) of COVID-19 cases were severe. The severe COVID-19 group had older patients and a higher male ratio than the non-severe group. Cushing syndrome (Odds ratio range (ORR) 2.059-2.358), chronic renal disease (ORR 1.292-1.604), anemia (OR 1.132), bone marrow dysfunction (ORR 1.471-1.645), and schizophrenia (ORR 1.287-1.556) showed significant association with infection of COVID-19. In terms of severity, diabetes (OR 1.417, 95% CI 1.047-1.917), hypertension (OR 1.378, 95% CI 1.008-1.883), heart failure (ORR 1.562-1.730), chronic lower respiratory disease (ORR 1.361-1.413), non-infectious lower digestive system disease (ORR 1.361-1.418), rheumatoid arthritis (ORR 1.865-1.908), substance use (ORR 2.790-2.848), and schizophrenia (ORR 3.434-3.833) were related with severe COVID-19. Conclusions: We identified several comorbidities associated with COVID-19. Health care workers should be more careful when diagnosing and treating COVID-19 when the patient has the above-mentioned comorbidities.

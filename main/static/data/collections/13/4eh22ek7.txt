[Image: see text] The life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has an absolute requirement for ribosomal frameshifting during protein translation in order to produce the polyprotein precursor of the viral enzymes. While an RNA stem-loop structure (the “HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Signal”, or HIV-1 FSS) controls the frameshift efficiency and has been hypothesized as an attractive therapeutic target, developing compounds that selectively bind this RNA and interfere with HIV-1 replication has proven challenging. Building on our prior discovery of a “hit” molecule able to bind this stem-loop, we now report the development of compounds displaying high affinity for the HIV-1 FSS. These compounds are able to enhance frameshifting more than 50% in a dual-luciferase assay in human embryonic kidney cells, and they strongly inhibit the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV-1 virions.

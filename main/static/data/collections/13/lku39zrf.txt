Here, we report the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum of 2-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methylphenyl)benzotriazole (Tinuvin P), a benzotriazole derivative that is the most widely used commercially available UV absorber or stabilizer and is used representatively for the research of photostability mechanism. A full assignment of the Raman spectrum has been made based on the scaled-DFT analysis of the normal vibrational modes. Through the comparative studies on the ordinary Raman spectrum and the SERS spectrum of Tinuvin P, we propose that this molecule binds the Au atom, via the O atom of the hydroxyl or the N1 atom of the benzotriazole moiety, with a perpendicular geometry.

Several problems associated with the available anti-measles vaccine emphasize the need for a single shot anti-measles vaccine which is efficacious by mucosal route of administration and functional in the presence of anti-measles neutralizing antibodies. To achieve these goals, we constructed two recombinant human adenoviruses (collectively designated Ad-F/H) carrying genes for measles virus (MV) fusion (F) and haemagglutinin (H) proteins. Single intranasal or intramuscular vaccination of mice and cotton rats with Ad-F/H elicited high MV-specific serum neutralizing-antibody titers. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage samples from mice vaccinated intranasally with Ad-F/H showed a 100-fold increase in MV-specific IgA titers compared with intramuscularly vaccinated mice. Moreover, Ad-F/H vaccine administered intranasally, but not intramuscularly, completely protected challenged cotton rats from MV replication in the lungs.

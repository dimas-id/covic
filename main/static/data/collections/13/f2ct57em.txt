Abstract Background Broad diagnostics of respiratory infection by molecular assays has not yet won acceptance due to technical difficulties and high costs. Objectives To evaluate clinical applicability of multiplex real-time PCR. Study design An assay targeting influenza virus A (IfA) and B (IfB), parainfluenza 1-3 (PIV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), enterovirus (EV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63), M. pneumoniae and Ch. pneumoniae was developed and run daily on consecutive clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. Results An etiology was identified in 48% of the 954 samples, with IfA in 25%, RV in 20%, MPV in 10% and M. pneumoniae in 10% of the positive. By a rational procedure costs could be reduced and the customer price set relatively low (â‚¬33 per sample). Conclusion Streamlined testing and cost limitation is achievable and probably critical for implementation of a broad molecular diagnostics of respiratory infections.

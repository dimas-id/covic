We describe a novel technique for the creation of a pleural tent and pleurectomy via the use of a laparoscopic hernia balloon. In this method a Spacemakerâ„¢ Structural Balloon Trocar (Covidien, USA) is tunnelled under the pleura at the site of thoracotomy or video assisted thoracoscopic surgery port and incrementally inflated under vision. This method is less traumatic than traditional methods, is more likely to provide an intact pleural tent, and allows the surgeon to operate in a near bloodless operative field.

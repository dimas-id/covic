OBJECTIVE To document laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy with a vessel-sealing device in dorsal recumbent horses. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Forty-three male horses. METHODS Food was withheld for 36 hours before horses were placed under general anesthesia and positioned in dorsal recumbency. One laparoscopic portal and 2 instrument portals were placed for the laparoscopic procedure. A third instrument portal was created in bilateral cryptorchid horses. A vessel-sealing device was used for hemostasis and transection of retained testes. Descended testes were removed via closed castration with primary closure of the scrotal incision. Time required for removal of the retained testis and perioperative complications were recorded. Short-term (14, 30, 60 days) and long-term follow-up (>1.5 years) consisted of telephone interview with owners and referring veterinarians. RESULTS Forty-three male horses underwent laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy. Thirteen horses were bilateral cryptorchids, 19 were unilateral cryptorchids with a descended testis, and 11 were unilateral cryptorchids with 1 testis previously removed. Inguinal testes, identified in 5 horses, were pulled into the abdomen prior to excision. The vaginal ring was apposed with endoscopic staples in 3 of 5 horses. Mean surgery time was 31.34 Â± 7.41 minutes. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications were encountered. No short-term or long-term complications were reported. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy can be safely performed with a vessel sealing-device in dorsal recumbent horses. This method was effective and did not result in any complication in our case series.

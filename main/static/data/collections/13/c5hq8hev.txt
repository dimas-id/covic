BACKGROUND The accuracy of end-expiratory lung volume measurement by the modified nitrogen wash-out/wash-in method (EELV-N(2)) depends on the precise determination of carbon dioxide elimination (V(CO(2))), which is affected by alveolar dead space (V(D-alv)). The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of V(D-alv) on EELV-N(2). METHODS Six piglets with lavage-induced acute lung injury were mechanically ventilated in a decremental PEEP trial that was reduced from 20 to 4 cm H(2)O in steps of 4 cm H(2)O every 10 min. EELV was measured by the modified EELV-N(2) method and computed tomography scan (EELV-CT), volumetric capnography, blood gas measurements, and hemodynamic data were recorded at each PEEP level. The data were divided into higher and lower PEEP groups. RESULTS During the decremental PEEP trial, EELV-N(2) exhibited a high correlation (r(2) = 0.86, P < .001) with EELV-CT, with a bias of -48.6 ± 150.7 mL (1 ± 18%). In the higher PEEP group, EELV-N(2) was not correlated with EELV-CT, with a bias of -168.1 ± 171.5 mL (-14 ± 14%). However, in the lower PEEP group, EELV-N(2) exhibited a high correlation (r(2) = 0.86, P < .001) with EELV-CT, with a bias of 11.2 ± 97.2 mL (6 ± 17%). The measurement bias was negatively correlated with V(D-alv) (r(2) = 0.44, P = .04) and V(CO(2)) (r(2) = 0.47, P = .03) in the higher PEEP group. CONCLUSIONS In this surfactant-depleted model, EELV measurement by the modified EELV-N(2) method reveals a systematic underestimation at high PEEP levels that is partly due to an increase in V(D-alv).

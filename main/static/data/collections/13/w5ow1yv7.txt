PURPOSE Flow diverters are increasingly used in the treatment of complex and giant intracranial aneurysms. However, they are associated with complications like late aneurysmal rupture. Additionally, flow diverters show focal structural decrease in luminal diameter without any intimal hyperplasia. This resembles a "fish mouth" when viewed en face. In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis of a possible association between flow diverter fish-mouthing and delayed-type hypersensitivity to its metal constituents. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patient records from our center between May 2010 and November 2015. A total of nine patients had flow diverter fish mouthing. A control group of 25 patients was selected. All study participants underwent prospective patch test to detect hypersensitivity to flow diverter metal constituents. Analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis and Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test variables to predict flow diverter fish mouthing. RESULTS The association between flow diverter fish mouthing and positive patch test was not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, history of allergy and maximum aneurysm size category was associated with flow diverter fish mouthing. This was further confirmed on Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. CONCLUSION The study showed statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and history of contact allergy and a small aneurysmal size. Further large-scale studies are needed to detect a statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and patch test. We recommend early and more frequent follow-up imaging in patients with contact allergy to detect flow diverter fish mouthing and its subsequent evolution.

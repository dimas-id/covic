While the WHO has already published its mental health and psychosocial considerations during the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been almost no discussion of the specific measures that healthcare institutions should take with regard to the mental health of healthcare practitioners. We would like to take this occasion to propose a perspective on this matter from research on social support. Social support can be classified in various ways such as informational, appraisal, instrumental, and emotional. When battling an unknown virus such as this one, having correct informational support is necessary above all else. It is also important that appropriate evaluation for the contribution of practitioners in the institutions as appraisal support. Instrumental support, meanwhile, refers to guaranteeing a system where practitioners can get adequate rest and not excessively strain themselves, and emotional support is when practitioners are shown adequate understanding and appreciation by those around them. There is another view that categorizes social support by how it is given and received: received support and perceived support. It is important for practitioners to receive perceived support, because perceived support is confirmed to have a positive effect on physical and mental health. For the sake of the physical and mental health of healthcare practitioners, it is important for healthcare sites and organizations to take social support into account and for healthcare institutions to adopt the perspective of social support in their day-to-day operations.

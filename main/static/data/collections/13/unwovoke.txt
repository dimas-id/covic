PURPOSE: To explore the role of vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy versus conventional dressings in the Fournier’s gangrene wound therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study. Data of 92 patients from nine centers between 2007 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. After surgery, patient having a local or a disseminated FG were managed with VAC therapy or with conventional dressings. The 10-weeks wound closure cumulative rate and OS were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 92 patients, 62 (67.4%) showed local and 30 (32.6%) a disseminated FG. After surgery, 19 patients (20.7%) with local and 14 (15.2%) with disseminated FG underwent to VAC therapy; 43 (46.7%) with local and 16 (17.4%) with disseminated FG were treated using conventional dressings. The multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the VAC in patients with disseminated FG led to a higher cumulative rate of wound closure than patients treated with no-VAC (OR = 6.5; 95% CI 1.1–37.4, p = 0.036). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the OS showed a significant difference between no-VAC patients with local and disseminated FG (OS rate at 90 days 0.90, 95% CI 0.71–0.97 vs 0.55, 95% CI 0.24–0.78, respectively; p = 0.039). Cox regression confirmed that no-VAC patients with disseminated FG showed the lowest OS (hazard ratio adjusted for sex and age HR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.1–10.4; p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study, VAC therapy in patients with disseminated FG may offer an advantage in terms of 10-weeks wound closure cumulative rate and OS at 90 days after initial surgery.

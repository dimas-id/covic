BACKGROUND Preterm infants may be born with deficits of both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA), but studies on supplementation of DHA and AA for preterm infants are limited. METHODS Preterm infants with a gestational age between 30 and 37 weeks who met all the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this double blind, randomized, comparative study. Infants over 2000 g body weight, over 32 weeks of gestation and in full feeding status would enter into the active intervention period of 6 months. Sixteen infants received Neoangelac Plus with AA and DHA supplementation. Eleven infants received Neoangelac without AA and DHA supplementation. The babies had scheduled physical examinations and their cognitive development, visual acuity, and vital signs to be checked. Adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS The mean Mental Development Index (MDI) scores for the supplementation and non-supplementation groups were 96.1 +/- 8.6 and 91.7 +/- 10.4 respectively at 6 months and 98.7 +/- 8.0 and 90.5 +/- 6.9 respectively at 1 year. The mean Physical Development Index (PDI) scores of these two groups were 102.2 +/- 10.5 and 95.4 +/- 13.2 respectively at 6 months and 98.0 +/- 5.8 and 86.7 +/- 11.1 respectively at 1 year. By repeated measures ANOVA, significant differences existed between groups for MDI and PDI (p = 0.020 and 0.008). However, there were no differences in visual acuity, physical examination variables or vital signs between these two groups. No obvious adverse effects were observed during the study period. CONCLUSION These results showed possible benefits in the neurodevelopment of larger preterm infants given formula supplemented with DHA and AA.

Eight iatrogenic thyroid pseudoaneurysms (ITPAs) after thyroid biopsy are reported. The mean ITPA diameter was 7.2 mm (range 4 to 12 mm). Ultrasound (US)-guided compression was initially performed at the neck of the ITPA in all cases. Among them, 4 ITPAs persisted (50%) in which radiofrequency (RF) ablation was performed. Mean RF ablation time and power were 13.5 seconds (range 5 to 24 seconds) and 20 W (range 10 to 50 W), respectively. All 4 cases were treated with RF ablation without any complications.

Single-domain antibody (sdAb) or nanobody possesses specific features non-accessible for conventional antibodies that make them suitable for research and biotechnological applications. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes lethal diarrhea in piglets, resulting in great economic losses all over the world. To detect and isolate PEDV rapidly and accurately is important for the control and further research of the clinical PEDV strains. In this study, four sdAb fragments (sdAb-Mc19/29/30/37) targeting the membrane (M) protein of PEDV were selected from sdAb library that was constructed through M protein-immunized Camelus bactrianus. The selected sdAb-Mcs were solubly expressed in Escherichia coli. The functional characteristics analysis revealed that the recombinant sdAb-Mcs have excellent binding activity and specificity to M protein but have no neutralizing activity to PEDV. For further application, sdAb-Mc37 was conjugated with quantum dots to synthesize a nanoprobe for imaging PEDV in vero cells. The observed fluorescence in vero cells clearly reflects that PEDV virions can be reliably recognized and labeled by the nanoprobe. Furthermore, the sdAb-Mc29 was conjugated with superparamagnetic nanobeads to construct immunomagnetic nanobeads (IMNBs) used to isolate PEDV. One PEDV strain was successfully isolated from clinical fecal sample, suggesting IMNBs as a novel and efficient tool suitable for PEDV isolation from clinical samples. This study provided a novel application and substantiated the suitability of sdAb as a specific binder for the isolation of viruses.

BACKGROUND Lower eyelid retraction can be the unfortunate result of aesthetic surgery, trauma, disease, or the aging processes. The purpose of this article is to assess whether midface lifting based on purely vertical repositioning constitutes an effective procedure for its correction. METHODS A retrospective study was carried out on 199 patients (311 eyelids) operated on between January of 2004 and January of 2014. The various causes of eyelid retraction in this population included cosmetic blepharoplasty (56.8 percent), involutional ectropion (23.1 percent), tumor resection (9.5 percent), facial nerve paralysis (8.5 percent), and trauma and related surgery (2 percent). The study was restricted exclusively to cases of moderate and severe lower eyelid retraction addressed by means of midface lifting. The mean follow-up time was 16.8 months. All of the patients were subjected to midface lifting with strengthening of the lateral canthus. A spacer graft was also used in 37.7 percent of the cases. RESULTS One hundred ninety-five patients (97.9 percent) displayed objective improvement of the eyelid retraction and a marked degree of improvement both in aesthetic terms and as regards the functional disorders reported. Only four patients (2 percent) presented complications such as needing another operation. CONCLUSION Midface lifting based on purely vertical repositioning makes it possible to recruit a considerable amount of "new" skin at the lower eyelid, thus ensuring a decrease in vertical distraction and correct recovery of the height of the external lamellar plane.

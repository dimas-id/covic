Waste nasopharyngeal swabs (N = 244) were evaluated by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry PLEX-ID Broad Respiratory Virus Surveillance Kit version 2.5 compared to direct fluorescent antibody and xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel for percent agreement, sensitivity, and specificity. Sensitivity and specificity were 91% (111/122) and 95.1% (116/122), respectively. Sensitivity by virus, except parainfluenza, was 92.9–100%, and specificity was 99–100%.

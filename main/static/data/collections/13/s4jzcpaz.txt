Abstract We present the first report of simultaneous laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) for bilateral primary aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas. A 40-year-old man with hypertension that was resistant to pharmacotherapy was shown to have bilateral aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas. A right partial and a left total adrenalectomy were performed at the same time via a single umbilical incision. The surgery and recovery were uncomplicated. This is the first report of synchronous bilateral LESS.

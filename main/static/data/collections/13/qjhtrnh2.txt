My shifts all start the same way these last few weeks with the collection of my allocated face shield and N95. The same shifts where it feels like the only patients I treat are those with COVID-19. Faces sometimes not much older than mine. Patients who are tachycardic, hypoxic, and ill. But these interactions are different; physical exams completed under the supervision of a colleague just outside the room, charged to watch my every movement. Vigilance not just for me but for everyone else I could and would come into contact with over the course of my shift. COVID19 lingers on carboard, steel, plastic, and other surfaces. Even the simplest of acts are dangerous without appropriate precautions.

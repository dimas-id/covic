ZeroNet is a new decentralized web-like network of peer-to-peer users created in 2015. ZeroNet, called an open, free and robust network, has attracted a rising number of users. Most of P2P networks are applied into file-sharing systems or data-storage system and the characteristics of these networks are widely investigated. However, there are obvious differences between ZeroNet and conventional P2P networks. Existing researches rarely involve ZeroNet and the characteristics and robustness of ZeroNet are unknown. To tackle the aforementioned problem, the present study measures the ZeroNet peer resources and site resources separately, and at the same time, proposes collection methods for both. No like other simulation experiments, the experiments of this paper are set on real-world environment. This is also the first measurement study about ZeroNet. Experimental results show that the topology of the peer network in ZeroNet has scarce edges, short distances and low clustering coefficients, and its degree distribution exhibits a special distribution. These indicate that the peer network of ZeroNet has poor robustness and the experimental results of the ZeroNet resilience verify this issue. In addition, this paper represents an improved peer exchange method to enhance the robustness of the ZeroNet. We also measure the topology characteristics, languages, sizes and versions of the sites in ZeroNet. We find that the size of the sites and the client version are also the reasons for the low robustness of the ZeroNet.

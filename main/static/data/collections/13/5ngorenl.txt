Hyperplane arrangements form the latest addition to the zoo of combinatorial objects dealt with by polymake. We report on their implementation and on a algorithm to compute the associated cell decomposition. The implemented algorithm performs significantly better than brute force alternatives, as it requires fewer convex hulls computations. The implementation is included in polymake since release 4.0.

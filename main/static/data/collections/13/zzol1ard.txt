Two experiments were done to compare growth performance of pigs weaned at 21 Â± 2 d of age that were housed in unsanitary pens and fed non-medicated diets containing alternative proteins versus spray-dried porcine (SDPP; Exp. 1) or bovine (SDBP; Exp. 2) plasma. Experiment 1 used 360 pigs fed 1 of 6 experimental diets from d 0 to 15, followed by a common diet fed to all pigs from d 15 to 28 post-weaning with 11 pens of 5 or 6 pigs/pen allotted per treatment. Experimental diets were based on 8.04% soy protein concentrate (SPC) as the control protein or a similar diet with either 2.50 or 5.00% SDPP or 0.17, 0.33, or 1.00% activated porcine plasma (APP) replacing SPC on an equal Lys basis. Experiment 2 used 300 pigs that were fed 1 of 6 experimental diets from d 0 to 14 post-weaning with 10 pens of 4 to 6 pigs/pen allotted per diet. Experiment 2 diets were based on 8.04% SPC as the control protein source or similar diets with the following specialty proteins replacing SPC on an equal Lys basis: 0.40% APP; 10.66% enzymatically hydrolyzed soy and yeast protein (EHSY); a combination (CB) of 6.36% EHSY, 0.40% APP, and 2.50% fish meal; 0.44% spray-dried whole egg from hyper-immunized hens (IEGG); or 5.00% SDBP. Results of Exp. 1 indicated pigs fed SDPP diets had greater (P < 0.05) ADG and ADFI at d 7 and 15 compared with pigs fed SPC or APP diets. Gain:feed at d 7 was higher (P < 0.05) for pigs fed diets with SDPP compared with other diets. Average BW at d 7 was greater (P < 0.05) for pigs fed diets with SDPP compared to other diets and pigs fed the 5.00% SDPP diet had greater BW at d 15 compared to diets without SDPP. At d 28 BW was greater (P < 0.05) for pigs fed the 2.50% SDPP diet compared with pigs fed diets with SPC, 0.33% APP, or 1.00% APP. Performance of pigs fed the SPC diet did not differ from APP diets at any period of the study. In Exp. 2, pigs fed the SDBP diet had greater (P < 0.05) BW, ADG, and ADFI at d 7 and 14 compared with pigs fed the other diets. Gain:feed did not differ significantly among diets. Average daily gain and ADFI of pigs did not differ among diets that did not contain SDBP. In conclusion, during the initial 2 wk post-weaning, pigs housed in unsanitary pens and fed non-medicated diets with APP in Exp. 1, or APP, EHSY, CB, or IEGG in Exp. 2 had equivalent performance to pigs fed SPC; however, performance of pigs fed diets with the alternatives was not equivalent to diets containing SDPP in Exp. 1 or SDBP in Exp. 2.

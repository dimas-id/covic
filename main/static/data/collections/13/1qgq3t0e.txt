During the last 2 decades, the continued development and the large-scale production of polyclonal immune serum globulin (ISG) preparations with improved safety and tolerability profiles have allowed treatment to focus on quality of life and long-term freedom from the complications of primary immune deficiency disease, rather than just on freedom from severe acute infections and survival. Available ISG preparations allow routine therapy by a variety of routes and regimens that can be tailored to suit individual patients. Continued vigilance is required, however, because problems with emerging diseases, and the costs and availability of ISG are likely to present continuing challenges.

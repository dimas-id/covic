BACKGROUND More than 80% COVID-19 cases are mild or moderate. In this study, a risk model was developed for predicting rehabilitation duration of the mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, thereby conducting refined risk management for different risk population. METHODS 90 consecutive mild-moderate COVID-19 cases were enrolled. Large-scale datasets were extracted from clinical practices. Through the multivariable linear regression analysis, the model was based on significant risk factors and was developed for predicting the rehabilitation duration of mild-moderate COVID-19. According to the local epidemic situation, risk management was conducted by weighing the risk assessment for different risk populations. RESULTS Ten risk factors from 44 high-dimensional clinical datasets were significantly correlated to rehabilitation duration (P < 0.05). Among these, five risk predictors were incorporated into a risk model. Individual rehabilitation durations were effectively calculated. Weighing the local epidemic situation, threshold probability was classified for low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. According to this classification, risk management was based on a treatment flowchart for tailored clinical decisions-making. CONCLUSIONS The proposed model is a useful tool for the individualized risk management of mild-moderate COVID-19 cases for the first time, and it may readily facilitate dynamic clinical decision-making for different risk populations.

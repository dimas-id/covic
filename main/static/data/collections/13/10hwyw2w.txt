Four thoracic evacuation techniques for pneumothorax elimination after diaphragmatic defect closure were compared in 40 canine cadavers. After creating a defect in the left side of the diaphragm, thoracic drainage was performed by thoracostomy tube insertion through the defect and a small (DD-SP) or large (DD-LP) puncture created in the caudal mediastinum, or through both the diaphragmatic defect and intact contralateral diaphragm with a small (DI-SP) or large (DI-LP) puncture in made in the caudal mediastinum. Differences in intrapleural pressure (IPP) between the right and left hemithoraxes after air evacuation along with differences in IPP before making a defect and after air evacuation in each hemithorax were calculated. A difference (p ≤ 0.0011) in IPP between the left and right hemithoraxes after air evacuation as well as before making a defect and after air evacuation in the right hemithorax was detected for the DD-SP group. No significant differences (p ≥ 0.0835) were observed for the DI-LP, DD-LP, or DI-SP groups. Creation of a large mediastinal puncture or thoracic evacuation through both a diaphragmatic defect and intact contralateral diaphragm can facilitate proper pneumothorax elimination bilaterally after diaphragmatic defect closure in dogs with a small puncture in the caudal mediastinum.

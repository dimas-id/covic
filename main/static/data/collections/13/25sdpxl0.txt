Recognized in 2019 in Wuhan, China, the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the occurrence of a global pandemic disease called COVID-19. So far, confirmation of infection is based on the detection of virus RNA in a sample taken from a person meeting the suspected case definition. However, in the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, in addition to genetic tests, serological methods can also be used to detect specific antibodies of the IgM, IgG and IgA class produced after contact with antigens or to detect viral antigen. Currently, a number of rapid immunochromatographic, chemiluminescent and ELISA immunoassay tests developed by different manufacturers for the diagnosis of COVID-19 are available on the market. Despite this fact, so far there is no WHO or ECDC recommendations or even reliable research regarding the usefulness of serological investigations in the laboratory diagnosis of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.

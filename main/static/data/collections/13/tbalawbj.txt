The percutaneous catheterization of central veins is increasingly used in nephrological practice as a temporary or permanent vascular access. The aim of our study was to present and to analyze episodes of catheter tip malposition during percutaneous tunneled hemodialysis catheter insertion in the large, unselected group of patients. All patients who underwent the procedure of catheter insertion in our department during year 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. One hundred four tunneled hemodialysis catheters were inserted in 101 patients. In 58 patients, the catheter was inserted at the initiation of hemodialysis therapy as the first access and in 46 the catheter was placed because of the failure of the existing one. In 68 patients, the catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein and in 20 patients into the left internal jugular vein (LIJV). Subclavian veins were used in five cases and femoral veins in 11 cases. Malposition of the catheter tips occurred in six patients. In all cases, the LIJV was cannulated. In two cases, the catheter tip malposition was in the right innominate vein and in four cases in the azygos vein. Our data demonstrate that with the blind insertion of tunneled hemodialysis catheters, the risk of catheter tip malposition is significantly higher with the left side insertion. As catheter insertion through the LIJV holds very high (30%) risk of the tip malposition, it should always be performed under the fluoroscopic control.

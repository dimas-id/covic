COVID-A9 is an infection disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), declared as a pandemic due to its rapid expansion worldwide. In this study we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using 22 virus genome sequences reported by three different laboratories in Morocco till the date 07/06/2020 as well as (40366) virus genomes from all around the world. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Moroccan patients revealed 62 mutations of which 30 were missense mutations. The mutations Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L were present in all the 22 analyzed sequences, followed by N_G204R and N_R203K which occurred in 9 among the 22 sequences. The mutations NSP10_R134S, NSP15_D335N, NSP16_I169L, NSP3_L431H, NSP3_P1292L and Spike_V6F occurred one time in our sequences with no record in other sequence worldwide. These mutations should be investigated to figure out their potential effects on all around the world virulence. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes included 9 viruses pertaining to clade 20A, 9 to clade 20B and 2 to clade 20C. This finding suggest that the epidemic spread in Morocco did not show a predominant SARS-CoV-2 route. For multiple and unrelated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Morocco via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus genomes in the country. Furthermore, very likely, the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulated in cryptic way in Morocco starting from the fifteen January before the discovering of the first case the second of March.

Objective Infrared Tympanic Thermometer (ITT) is one of the most useful instruments for accurately measuring temperature. The effects of ear pathologies on ITT measurement remain unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine if tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) affects ITT measurements in adult patients. Material and methods A total of 90 adult patients with monaural central TMP were enrolled in this study. Patients were categorized into three subgroups according to perforation size (1-3 mm, 4-7 mm, and 8-10 mm). The tympanic temperatures of the affected and unaffected sites, and subgroups were compared with each other. Results This study contained 54 (60%) males and 36 (40%) females ranging from 20 to 58 years of age (mean age: 30.74 ± 9.61 years). The mean tympanic temperature of the side affected with TMP was 36.34oC ± 0.61oC. The mean tympanic temperature of the unaffected side with healthy and intact tympanic membrane was 36.33oC ± 0.6oC. The Pearson correlation score for the tympanic temperatures and the size of TMP was 0.22 which was not significant (r=-0.12). Conclusion TMP and perforation size do not affect ITT measurements in adult patients.

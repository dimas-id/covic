Sterile Inflammation (SI), a condition where damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dying cells, leads to TLR (Toll-like receptor) activation and triggers hypoxemia in circulation leading to venous thrombosis (VT) through tissue factor (TF) activation, but its importance under acute hypoxia (AH) remains unexplored. Thus, we hypothesized that eRNA released from dying cells under AH activates TF via the TLR3-ERK1/2-AP1 pathway, leading to VT. Animals were exposed to stimulate hypoxia for 0–24 h at standard temperature and humidity. RNaseA and DNase1 were injected immediately before exposure. TLR3 gene silencing was performed through in vivo injection of TLR3 siRNA. 80 μg/kg BW of isolated eRNA and eDNA were injected 6 h prior to sacrifice. Antigens of TF pathway were determined by ELISA and TF activity by a chromogenic assay. AH exposure significantly induced release of SI markers i.e. eRNA, eDNA, HMGB1 and upregulated TLR3, ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), AP1 (Activator Protein-1) and TF, whereas RNaseA pre-treatment diminished the effect of AH, thus inhibiting TF expression as well as activity during AH. Hence, we propose a possible mechanism of AH-induced TF activation and thrombosis where RNaseA can become the novel focal point in ameliorating therapy for AH induced thrombosis.

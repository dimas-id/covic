Two young dogs underwent surgical management of a persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) and developed chylothorax postoperatively. In both cases, the surgical procedure and anesthetic recovery were uncomplicated and routine. Following surgery, both patients appeared bright, alert, responsive, and previous signs of regurgitation had resolved. Dyspnea and tachypnea developed 1-2 days postoperatively in each patient, and chylous effusion was detected on thoracocentesis. For each case, a diagnosis of chylothorax was based on cytology and triglyceride concentrations of the aspirated pleural fluid. Similar protocols for monitoring were used in the treatment of each patient's chylothorax. The duration and volume of chylous effusion production were closely monitored via routine thoracostomy tube aspiration. Both dogs rapidly progressed to recovery with no additional complications. With diligent monitoring, chylothorax secondary to surgical trauma can resolve in a rapid, uncomplicated manner.

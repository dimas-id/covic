BACKGROUND Donor site morbidity is an important consideration in the overall decision-making algorithm for fasciocutaneous free flap reconstruction of the head and neck. METHODS A retrospective case series was conducted of donor site complications occurring within 30 days of surgery among 226 consecutive anterolateral thigh (ALT) or radial forearm free flap (RFFF) microvascular free tissue transfers performed by multiple reconstructive surgeons between 2005 and 2010. RESULTS A greater number of donor site complications occurred among patients undergoing RFFF versus ALT free flaps (40; 35.4%; vs 14; 12.4%; p < .001). Wound dehiscence occurred significantly more frequently among patients undergoing RFFF versus ALT free flap reconstruction (34; 30%; vs 6; 5%; p < .001). Tendon exposure occurred in 16 of the 113 RFFFs (14.1%). Seromas occurred more commonly in the ALT group (6; 5%; vs 2; 1.7%; p = .280). CONCLUSION Although short-term donor site morbidity was low in both groups, the ALT was associated with a significantly lower incidence of wound dehiscence with or without tendon exposure.

All mammals are colonised by Escherichia coli generally at birth and these organisms become part of their intestinal flora for the rest of their lives. New types are acquired generally by an oral route. Some E coli are pathogenic and some may have a far more enhanced ability to colonise the human intestine than most others. Recently enterohaemorrhagic E coli have emerged. They can cause a number of intestinal illnesses in humans including bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. These organisms produce a number of virulence factors particularly the Shiga‐like toxins (verotoxins). The intestines of animals may be the reservoir of these organisms for human infection, and cattle particularly have been shown to harbour them. Food, especially undercooked meat products, have been associated with a number of outbreaks throughout the world. While a certain serotype O157.H7 has been associated with many outbreaks throughout the world, other serotypes, particularly 0111.H‐, have also been reported. This latter serotype appears to be more common in Australia.

Cardiomyopathy is suggested to be a relatively common disease condition in prairie dogs; however, there are no reports of normal cardiac echosonography and radiology in the prairie dog ( Cynomys spp.). The objective of this study was to report the ultrasonographic and radiographic measurements of the heart, and plasma troponin concentration in captive healthy anesthetized black-tailed prairie dogs ( Cynomys ludovicianus ). Zoo-kept prairie dogs with no signs of cardiac disease (n = 17) were evaluated. Each animal was anesthetized with isoflurane via face mask and a complete clinical assessment was performed, including complete blood cell count and plasma biochemistry, urinalysis, blood gasses, plasma troponin concentration, three-view whole body radiography, and echocardiogram. Standard measurements were taken. Few trivial findings were identified on echocardiographic evaluation. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to determine if these variations are normal, or represent early or mild cardiac disease. The data presented here can aid, with the necessary caution, in evaluating prairie dogs with possible cardiac disease, potentially resulting in earlier diagnosis and more successful treatment.

We performed single-incision laparoscopic surgery for totally extra-peritoneal (SILS-TEP) repair using a lightweight mesh fixed by absorbable tacks and without balloon dilation. Thirty-four patients (mean age, 66.5 years) underwent SILS-TEP repair in our hospital between September 2011 and April 2012; 30 patients had unilateral hernia and 4 had bilateral hernias. Mean operative time was 85.6 min for unilateral hernia and 137.7 min for bilateral hernias. All patients underwent successful SILS-TEP repair. Mean hospital stay was 3.4 days. Mean duration of follow-up was 7.1 months. Four seromas were observed, but no recurrences or major complications occurred. SILS-TEP is an economical and useful method for decreasing postoperative complications, such as neuralgia and recurrence, and it could be an attractive approach for inguinal hernia.

Viruses have long been studied not only for their pathology and associated disease but also as model systems for molecular processes and as tools for identifying important cellular regulatory proteins and pathways. Recent advances in mass spectrometry methods coupled with the development of proteomic approaches have greatly facilitated the detection of virion components, protein interactions in infected cells, and virally induced changes in the cellular proteome, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of viral infection. In addition, a rapidly increasing number of high-resolution structures for viral proteins have provided valuable information on the mechanism of action of these proteins as well as aided in the design and understanding of specific inhibitors that could be used in antiviral therapies. In this paper, we discuss proteomic studies conducted on all eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages, covering virion composition, viral protein structures, virus-virus and virus-host protein interactions, and changes in the cellular proteome upon viral infection.

Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) continues to be a major problem to the pork industry worldwide. Increasing data indicate that PRRSV strains differ in virulence in infected pigs and are biologically, antigenically, and genetically heterogeneous. It is evident that the current vaccines, based on a single PRRSV strain, are not effective in protecting against infections with the genetically diverse field strains of PRRSV. The recent outbreaks of atypical or acute PRRS in vaccinated pigs have raised a serious concern about the efficacy of the current vaccines and provided the impetus for developing more effective vaccines. Special attention in this review is given to published work on antigenic, pathogenic and genetic variations of PRRSV and its potential implications for vaccine efficacy and development. Although there are ample data documenting the heterogeneous nature of PRRSV strains, information regarding how the heterogeneity is generated and what clinical impact it may have is very scarce. The observed heterogeneity will likely pose a major obstacle for effective prevention and control of PRRS. There remains an urgent need for fundamental research on this virus to understand the basic biology and the mechanism of heterogeneity and pathogenesis of PRRSV.

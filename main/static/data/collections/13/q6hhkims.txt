A cluster of pneumonia cases caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout China, Europe and USA. The pneumonia might evolve in ARDS requiring assisted mechanical-ventilation. The prolonged immobilization combined with respiratory failure, sepsis and dehydration might expose SARS-CoV-2/patients to increased risk of complication including pulmonary embolism. We report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 complicated by massive pulmonary embolism underwent successfully surgical embolectomy. We believe that maintaining the same pro-active attitude suggested by current Guidelines might help in reducing morality and improving survival in SARS-COV-2/patients.

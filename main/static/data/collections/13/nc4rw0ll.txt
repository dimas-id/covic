The ability to predict protein–protein interactions is crucial to our understanding of a wide range of biological activities and functions in the human body, and for guiding drug discovery. Despite considerable efforts to develop suitable computational methods, predicting protein–protein interaction binding affinity changes following mutation (ΔΔG) remains a severe challenge. Algebraic topology, a champion in recent worldwide competitions for protein–ligand binding affinity predictions, is a promising approach to simplifying the complexity of biological structures. Here we introduce element- and site-specific persistent homology (a new branch of algebraic topology) to simplify the structural complexity of protein–protein complexes and embed crucial biological information into topological invariants. We also propose a new deep learning algorithm called NetTree to take advantage of convolutional neural networks and gradient-boosting trees. A topology-based network tree is constructed by integrating the topological representation and NetTree for predicting protein–protein interaction ΔΔG. Tests on major benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed topology-based network tree is an important improvement over the current state of the art in predicting ΔΔG.

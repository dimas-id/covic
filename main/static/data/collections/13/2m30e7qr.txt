Despite improvements over the past several decades, infection remains a significant risk to all haematological patients receiving therapy. Those requiring allogeneic transplant and especially those that have HLA disparity or T-cell-depleted grafts have an even higher risk of infective complications due to delayed recovery of T- and B-cell function. Early identification with prompt effective treatment is paramount to improve all patientsâ€™ survival. Patient safety through robust adherence to hand hygiene and maintenance of the environment with cleaning and disinfection are the backbone of an effective preventative program. Basic nursing care and a sound knowledge base of the risks, presentation, diagnosis and treatment will improve patient care.

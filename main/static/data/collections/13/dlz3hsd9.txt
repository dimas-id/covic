Primary pyomyositis in children is prevalent in the tropics and increasingly being recognised from temperate regions. Staphylococcus aureus remains the principle causative organism worldwide, while proportion of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is on rise. Commonly involved groups are around the pelvis and lower limbs. Clinical presentation depends on the stage of disease, most commonly a child presenting with limping with fever. Early diagnosis and management are crucial. The investigation of choice is MRI scan. Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be instituted at the earliest opportunity along with drainage. Majority of patients show excellent and complete recovery with no long-term complications once treatment is started early. A high level of awareness and suspicion of this condition is warranted from all paediatric clinicians.

Across Latin America, increasing access to mental health care has become a priority. Management of common mental disorders is shifting to primary care, and community mental health centers (CMHCs) are being established to treat severe needs. In urban migrant communities on the outskirts of Trujillo, Peru, five new CMHCs have been built to treat complex mental health concerns, partially in response to high rates of domestic violence and child maltreatment. However, psychologists have no training in the treatment of interpersonal trauma. This study sought to determine the utility of such a training and identify areas for cultural adaptation. Six focus groups were conducted with CMHC psychologists. Findings revealed that, while a culturally-adapted training in trauma-focused treatment is desired, sociocultural barriers to ensuring the physical and psychological safety of the service user must be considered, as well as provider barriers including short treatment packages, insufficient physical infrastructure, and unstable work conditions.

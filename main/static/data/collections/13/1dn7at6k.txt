Abstract Different aspects related to globalization together with the great capacity of the arthropod vectors to adapt to a changing world favour the emergence and reemergence of numerous infectious diseases transmitted by them. Diptera (mosquitoes and sandflies), ticks, fleas and lice, among others, cause a wide spectrum of diseases with relevance in public health. Herein, arthropod-borne disease are reviewed, with special emphasis on the existing risk to contract them in Spain according to different parameters, such as the presence of arthropod and the circulation or the possible circulation of the causative agents.

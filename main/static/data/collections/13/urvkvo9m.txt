When providing sleep medical services special aspects must be taken into account in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite all prevention, due to the high number of unrecognized cases, SARS-CoV2 contacts in the sleep laboratory must be expected and appropriate precautions are necessary. Nevertheless, the continuation or resumption of sleep medical services under the appropriate hygiene measures is strongly recommended to avoid medical and psychosocial complications. There is no evidence for a deterioration of COVID-19 through CPAP therapy. In principle, the application of positive pressure therapy via various mask systems can be accompanied by the formation of infectious aerosols. In the case of confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2, a pre-existing PAP therapy should be continued in an outpatient setting in accordance with the local guidelines for home isolation, since discontinuation of PAP therapy is associated with additional cardiopulmonary complications due to the untreated sleep-related breathing disorder. According to the current state of knowledge inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF), and PAP therapy can be carried out without increased risk of infection for health care workers (HCW) as long as appropriate personal protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) is being used. This position paper of the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP) and the German Society for Sleep Medicine (DGSM) offers detailed recommendations for the implementation of sleep medicine diagnostics and therapy in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.

PURPOSE: Our institution cancelled all in-person clerkships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, we designed a virtual radiation oncology medical student clerkship. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We convened an advisory panel to design a virtual clerkship curriculum. We implemented clerkship activities using a cloud-based learning management system, video web conferencing systems and a telemedicine portal. Students completed assessments pre- and post-clerkship to provide data to improve future versions of the clerkship. RESULTS: The virtual clerkship spans 2 weeks and is graded pass or fail. Students attend interactive didactic sessions during the first week and participate in virtual clinic and give talks to the department during the second week. Didactic sessions include lectures, case-based discussions, treatment planning seminars and material adapted from the Radiation Oncology Education Collaborative Study Group curriculum. Students also attend virtual departmental quality assurance rounds, cancer center seminars and multi-disciplinary tumor boards. The enrollment cap was met during the first virtual clerkship period (April 27 through May 8, 2020), with a total of 12 students enrolling. CONCLUSIONS: Our virtual clerkship can increase student exposure and engagement in radiation oncology. Data on clerkship outcomes are forthcoming.

The plan for the global eradication of dracunculiasis (i.e., Guinea worm disease) was developed in October 1980, when dracunculiasis was known to be endemic in 16 African countries, India, and Pakistan. In 1991, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution to eradicate dracunculiasis by the end of 1995. This report summarizes the substantial progress toward eradication of dracunculiasis since the beginning of this effort.

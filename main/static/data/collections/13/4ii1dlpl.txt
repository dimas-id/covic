Letter to the Editor Re: Coronavirus disease 2019: The harms of exaggerated information and non-evidence-based measures Prof. Ioannidis clearly and correctly identifies a real issue of the current emergency, namely that related to misinformation. This misinformation led to an erroneous perception of risk in some cases with the consequent lack of adoption of preventive interventions and in others to unmotivated and irrational behavior (e.g. panic shopping, shortage of supplies for personal protection such as face masks, etc).

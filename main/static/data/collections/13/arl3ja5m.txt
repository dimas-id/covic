Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a global public health emergency, recently taken on pandemic proportions, with over 2.7 million confirmed cases worldwide(1). Children/young adults seem to have a less severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 (2), but data on disease susceptibility in pediatric transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy are limited (3, 4). This poses major uncertainties regarding pediatric transplant activity and management of anti-rejection therapy.

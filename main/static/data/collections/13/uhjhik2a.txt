Abstract Pulmonary infections are the major global problem. According to the global burden of disease study, lower respiratory infections were ranked third among the leading causes of death after ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Despite the availability of treatment options and diagnostic methods, the severity of pulmonary infections is increasing due to the emergence of multiple drug resistance and lack of sensitivity in pathogenic microbes. In this context, nanotechnology based treatment therapies have emerged as a promising approach to circumvent the limitations of conventional therapies and also manage the problem of drug resistance in pulmonary infections. The present chapter is focused on the global status of existing management strategies of pulmonary infections and their limitations. Moreover, the role of nanotechnology for the management of pulmonary infections with a special reference to different type of nanomaterials has also been discussed.

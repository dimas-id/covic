Introduction: In the United States, access to home-based telemedicine is inequitably distributed due to the limited reach of fixed broadband in rural areas. Public libraries typically offer patrons free access to broadband. Libraries, particularly those in rural regions, need to be evaluated as a site for patients to connect to a health care provider over a video visit. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the technological readiness of public libraries to provide telemedicine support and to determine differences in readiness between rural and urban public libraries. Methods: We distributed a survey to members of the Virginia Library Association to evaluate technological readiness of Virginia public libraries to support telemedicine use in their facilities. The survey evaluated availability and speed of fixed broadband internet access, physical equipment, and private space for each library. Results: Respondents from 39 libraries completed the survey, approximately one-third of which were in rural or small urban areas. All respondents reported fixed broadband, at least four computers, and available staff to assist who technology in their libraries. Eighty-five percent of surveyed libraries reported sufficient broadband speed and a private room available to patrons. There were no significant differences between rural and urban status for any of the library characteristics. Discussion: Public libraries in Virginia are technologically ready to support patrons connecting to health care providers over telemedicine. Systematic guidelines for library-practice collaborations are needed to support implementation across geographic and socioeconomically diverse areas.

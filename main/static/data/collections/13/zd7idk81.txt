Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. The genetic variation of ACE2 function and expression across populations is still poorly understood. This study aims at better understanding the genetic basis of COVID-19 outcomes by studying association between genetic variation in ACE2 and disease severity in the Iranian population. Methods: We analyzed two large Iranian cohorts and several publicly available human population variant databases to identify novel and previously known ACE2 exonic variants present in the Iranian population and considered those as candidate variants for association between genetic variation and disease severity. We genotyped these variants across three groups of COVID-19 patients with different clinical outcomes (mild disease, severe disease, and death) and evaluated this genetic variation with regard to clinical outcomes. Results: We identified 32 exonic variants present in Iranian cohorts or other public variant databases. Among those, 11 variants are novel and have thus not been described in other populations previously. Following genotyping of these 32 candidate variants, only the synonymous polymorphism (c.2247G>A) was detected across the three groups of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Genetic variability of known and novel exonic variants was low among our COVID-19 patients. Our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that exonic variation in ACE2 has a sizeable impact on COVID-19 severity across the Iranian population.

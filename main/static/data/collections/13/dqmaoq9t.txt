The authors would like to introduce the invention, derived from the research on denture plaque, applied to a wide variety of items Firstly, we found L rhamnosus L8020, as one of the normal strains of bacteria in the oral cavity and have shown to have inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria causing dental caries and periodontal disease, in addition to oral Candida Based upon the patents on L rhamnosus L8020, several products incorporated with L8020, like mouthwash, dentifrice, tablets and chocolate, in addition to yoghurt, have been commercialized Secondly, we developed the organosilicon quaternary ammonium salts [3-(triethoxysilyl) - propyldimethyl- octadecyl ammonium chloride (Etak), a coupling agent with disinfectant It has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and â€“negative bacteria, fungi and yeasts, in addition to envelope virus, like influenza and corona virus This compound binds chemically to a variety substrates, making it a nonleachable antibacterial and antiviral agent Its bounded antimicrobial activity has had a variety of applications by binding to fibers, fabric, carpet, sock manufactures (to control odor-causing bacteria), and metal surfaces The effects will be contributed to the suppression of a variety of infectious diseases, including flu and covid-19 Mikihouse, Dinos, AOKI, Esai company has been commercialized a variety of items, based upon our patents This paper described the examples that intellectual property based upon innovations from prosthodontic research have been utilized by general companies, and yielded the living ware

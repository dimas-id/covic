Abstract The new coronavirus infection COVID-19 has quickly become a global health emergency. Mortality is principally due to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which relays only on supportive treatment. Numerous pathological, clinical and laboratory findings rise the similarity between moderate to severe COVID-19 and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Etoposide-based protocol including dexametasone is the standard of care for secondary HLH. The protocol has been successfully used in HLHs that are secondary to EBV and H1N1 infections by inducing complete response and pronged survival. These observations prompt to consider this cytotoxic therapy in HLH associated to moderately severe to severe forms of COVID-19.

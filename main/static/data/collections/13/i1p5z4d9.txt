Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of humans. Although causes of MS are enigmatic, underlying elements contributing to disease development include both genetic and environmental factors. Recent epidemiological evidence has pointed to viral infection as a trigger to initiating white matter damage in humans. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a positive strand RNA virus that, following intracranial infection of susceptible mice, induces an acute encephalomyelitis that later resolves into a chronic fulminating demyelinating disease. Immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system is critical both to quell viral replication and instigate demyelination. Recent efforts by our laboratory and others have focused upon strategies capable of enhancing remyelination in response to viral-induced demyelination, both by dampening chronic inflammation and by surgical engraftment of remyelination - competent neural precursor cells.

A cDNA copy of the HCV229E nucleocapsid protein gene was isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis predicts a nucleocapsid polypeptide of 389 amino acids with a molecular weight (mol. wt.) of 43,450. Single strand RNA probes derived from the cDNA copy hybridize specifically to HCV229E RNA and approximately 50 pg of intracellular viral RNA can be readily detected. The application of nucleic acid hybridization as a routine procedure for the diagnosis of HCV229E infection is discussed.

Recently, HRV-C was identified as a new species of HRV, but its spectrum of clinical disease is still not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of HRVs in children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). A total of 54 HRV-positive samples that were negative for other respiratory viruses were sequenced. HRV-A was detected in 33, HRV-B in 4, and HRV-C in 17 of these samples. All HRV-C-positive patients showed favorable clinical outcomes. We confirmed the presence of HRV-C in children with LRTIs, but its association with clinical severity is not clear.

Objective To date, no information on late-onset infection in newborns to mother with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contracted in pregnancy are available. This study aimed to evaluate postdischarge SARS-CoV-2 status of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy that, at birth, were negative to SARS-CoV-2. Study Design This is an observational study of neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results Seven pregnant women with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection have been evaluated in our institution. One woman had a spontaneous abortion at 8 weeks of gestational age, four women recovered and are still in follow-up, and two women delivered. Two newborns were enrolled in the study. At birth and 3 days of life, newborns were negative to SARS-CoV-2. At 2-week follow-up, one newborn tested positive although asymptomatic. Conclusion Our findings highlight the importance of follow-up of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy, since they remain at risk of contracting the infection in the early period of life and long-term consequences are still unknown. Key Points: Newborns to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy can acquire the infection later after birth. Newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy need a long-term follow-up, even if they tested negative at birth. Specific guidelines for the long-term follow-up of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy are needed.

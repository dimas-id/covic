OBJECTIVE To evaluate clinical and operative outcomes of transvaginal extraction (TVE) and contained power morcellation (CPM) for myoma retrieval after laparoscopic myomectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective data from 35 consecutive cases using CPM were compared with retrospective data of all cases using TVE from December 2014 to January 2017. Patients were matched 1:1 based on myoma diameter. A total of 62 women were included in the final analysis. Specimen retrieval was performed using the TVE or CPM within an insufflated isolation bag. RESULTS Age, body mass index, mode of prior obstetric delivery, history of previous abdominal surgery, indication for myomectomy, and the myoma(s) characteristics were similar between groups. Retrieval time was significantly shorter in the TVE group compared with the CPM group: 10 minutes (3-15 minutes) versus 17 minutes (14-42 minutes); P < .001. Time required for placement of the instruments was 9.7 minutes for the isolation bag and 0.5 minutes for the vaginal extractor. Additional analgesic administration for pain relief was necessary in 13 patients (42%) in the TVE group and 23 patients (72%) in the CPM group ( P = .01). Total cost of the hospital stay was significantly higher in the CPM group compared with the TVE group ( P < .001). Estimated blood loss and duration of hospital stay were similar between groups. CONCLUSION Both CPM and TVE can be used for safe retrieval of large myomas that are removed laparoscopically. Compared with CPM, TVE was associated with a shorter retrieval time, less postoperative pain, and less hospital costs.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major health problem in women. DNA vaccines are a perfect approach to immunization, but their potency in clinical trials has been insufficient for generating effective immunity, which may be related to the degradation of the DNA via nucleases, poor delivery to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and insufficient uptake of DNA plasmids by cells upon injection. Archaeosome is a nano-delivery systems based on liposomes with their immunological role have been developed for gene delivery. In this study, human papillomavirus type 16 genes, containing truncated L1, E6, and E7, were simultaneously used in combination therapy with archaeosome and assessed in vivo. Findings supported that archaeosomes promotes immune responses to DNA vaccines and a long-term CTL response was generated with a low antigen dose. Combination therapy with archaeosome/L1/E6/E7 vaccines exhibited a strong cytolytic activity against tumor cells and induced prophylactic and therapeutic effect against the development of tumor in the animal model.

In Japan, the first case of COVID-19 in dialysis patients was reported on March 1, 2020. A total of 31 cases were reported by April 10, and it increased to 95 by May 15. Thereafter, with the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the general population since late March, there was a not surprising increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in dialysis patients. The mortality rate is 16.2% (16/99 cases) in dialysis patients, which is higher than 5.3% (874/16532 cases) in the general population. This higher mortality rate in dialysis patients with COVID-19 might be related to their age; the majority of COVID-19 cases are aged between 70 and 90 years in dialysis patients, compared with between 20 and 60 years in the general population. As COVID-19 presents with severe symptoms and is associated with a high mortality rate in dialysis patients, dialysis patients who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are required to be hospitalized under Japanese government policy. In cases of COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is essential to prevent nosocomial infection. Therefore, patients must be sufficiently instructed in infection prevention and robust measures to prevent contraction and spread of the infection must be taken at dialysis facilities.

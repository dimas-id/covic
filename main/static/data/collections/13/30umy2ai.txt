The ability to rapidly and accurately identify a patient's COVID‐19 status has had significant impact on emergency departments (ED) and health systems globally. Since the identification of SARS‐CoV‐2 illness in the United States, there has been rapid development in patient testing capacity following initial challenges including sparse availability. This was made possible by increasing availability of diagnostic molecular tests in several formats, from laboratory based traditional, RT‐PCR methods to near patient testing rapid point of care PCR tests.

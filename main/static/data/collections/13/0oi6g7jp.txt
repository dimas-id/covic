The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires evidence to help mitigate its global harm. Generating accurate measurements of the appropriate clinical and epidemiological indicators associated with COVID-19 is a necessary step in reducing the current pandemic's burden on individuals and the population at large. These unprecedented times have presented a challenge to chronic disease epidemiologists and have required a practical approach "to do something to help during this disaster." Options include returning to clinical care or resorting to online textbooks and resources for crash courses on outbreak research. However, being aware of the magnitude of individual suffering endured by so many, including many esteemed, close colleagues, becomes a personal challenge of enormous proportions. It is envisaged that the arts and other humanities can help re-establish balance, both during the pandemic and especially after it.

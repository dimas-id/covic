Abstract Molecular diagnostic methods have evolved and matured considerably over the last several decades and are constantly being evaluated and adopted by clinical laboratories for the identification of infectious pathogens. Advancement in other technologies such as fluorescence, electronics, instrumentation, automation, and sensors have made the overall diagnostic process more accurate, sensitive, and rapid. Nucleic acid based detection procedures, which rely on the fundamental principles of DNA replication have emerged as a popular and standard diagnostic method, and several commercial assays are currently available based on different nucleic acid amplification techniques. This review focuses on the major amplification chemistries that are used for developing commercial assays and discusses their application in the clinical virology laboratory.

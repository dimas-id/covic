This paper focuses on how populations by the use of technology, more specifically an app, can comprehend the enactment of ordinances (local laws) in an urban area along with their public reactions expressed as tweets. Furthermore, they can understand how well the area is developing and enhancing as a Smart City. The main goal of this research is to develop an Ordinance-Tweet Mining App that disseminates the results of analyzing ordinances and tweets about them, especially related to Smart City Characteristics such as Smart Environment, Smart Mobility etc. This app would be beneficial to various users such as environmental scientists, policy makers, city committees as well as the common public in becoming more aware of legislative bodies, and possibly contributing in different aspects to make the urban area improve as a Smart City. This work fits the realm of Smart Governance due to transparency via public involvement.

COVID-19 pneumonia presented with certain characteristic chest CT imaging features, which are helpful to the radiologist in the early detection and diagnosis of this emerging global health emergency. In this report, we present chest CT findings from five patients with COVID-19. Except for one case with normal lung appearance, all the other four cases had certain characteristics, including ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and atoll sign. The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral portion of lung.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had an enormous effect on Taiwan's public health and the nation's economy. To prevent the spread of the epidemic, the government implemented strategies and measures for the control of the epidemic. The Ministry of National Defense also fully supported epidemic prevention by mobilizing all necessary human and material resources. Under the plan executed by the Ministry of National Defense, the SongShan Armed Forces Hospital became Taiwan's first hospital dedicated exclusively for the treatment of patients with SARS. Uniformed Service Nurses' devoted to caring for patients with SARS during the outbreak made significant contributions to the prevention and control of SARS.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with the largest known genomes among RNA viruses (27-34 kb). CoVs constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae. The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin word corona, meaning crown or halo, which can be seen under an electron microscope.

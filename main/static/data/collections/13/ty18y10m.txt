OBJECTIVE To investigate the changes of blood corpuscles of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing. METHODS Totally 43 patients (21 male and 22 female, 19-74 years old age range) diagnosed as of probable SARS were included in this study. Their corpuscles in the peripheral blood were tested every two days, and the results were analyzed. RESULTS Patients with SARS were more likely to develop leukocytopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in the early period of disease than those in control group. The situation, especially lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, could not be reversed in patients who died. Persistent low counts of lymphocytes and platelets at presentation might be associated with adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION Low counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes and platelets were common among patients in the early stage of SARS. Persistent Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia may be associated with the prognosis.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the use of a new tumor embolization agent, Onyx (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland), for the use of intraoperative embolization of a sinonasal unclassified spindle cell sarcoma. METHODS A 45-year-old female patient presented to the rhinology clinic with a nasal mass. A biopsy revealed a highly vascular mass consistent with a sinonasal unclassified spindle cell sarcoma. Secondary to its extensive vascularity, the patient underwent preoperative transarterial embolization (TAE) before definitive resection. Due to complex vascular anatomy including feeding vessels emanating from intracranial circulation, incomplete embolization was achieved. Subsequently, intraoperative embolization with Onyx at the time of resection was performed. RESULTS Intraoperative Onyx use resulted in almost complete devascularization of the tumor with decreased risk of intracranial embolization. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative embolization with Onyx after an incomplete TAE can be a safe and effective method of achieving near-total embolization of sinonasal tumors.

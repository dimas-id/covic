BACKGROUND The obstetrics and gynecology literature has expanded in recent years to include clinical trials assessing the use of barbed sutures. The difficulty of intracorporeal suturing continues to be a barrier to a wider use of laparoscopy. Although the use of barbed sutures has been shown to ease the process of laparoscopic suturing considerably, concerns have been raised regarding a potentially increased risk of adhesions or inflammation as a result of their use. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine whether differences in surface textures, resulting from the variations in the geometric configurations of barbs, lead to differences in intra-abdominal adhesion formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 27 non-pregnant female Wistar Hannover rats, weighing 200-250 g, with intact uteri were used as an adhesion formation model. The rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: barbed suture group 1, barbed suture group 2 and control group (no intracorporeal suture). A 2-centimeter vertical incision was performed on the anti-mesosalpingeal side of one of the uterine horns. The incision on the uterine horn was reapproximated with a running suture, entailing 3 needle punctures and left untied at one end. Six weeks after the operation, intra-abdominal adhesion formations were investigated both clinically and histopathologically. RESULTS Clinical adhesion scores and histopathological parameters in both the barbed suture groups were statistically significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the barbed suture groups regarding the adhesion scores. CONCLUSIONS The 2 types of barbed sutures with different surface textures, used for myometrial closure, form a similar profile with respect to postoperative adhesion formation.

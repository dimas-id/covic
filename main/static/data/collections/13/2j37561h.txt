Abstract Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is responsible for mild or moderate enteritis in puppies. The virus is highly contagious and avoiding contact with infected dogs and their excretions is the only way to ensure disease prevention. Since no studies have yet focused on the sensitivity of CCoV to chemical biocides the present investigation examined the efficiency of physical and chemical methods of viral inactivation. CCoV infectivity was stable at +56°C for up to 30min, but tended to decrease rapidly at +65°C and +75°C. Germicidal ultra-violet (UV–C) light exposure demonstrated no significant effects on virus inactivation for up to 3 days. CCoV was observed to be more stable at pH 6.0–6.5 while extreme acidic conditions inactivated the virus. Two tested aldehydes inactivated the virus but their action was temperature- and time-dependent. The methods for CCoV inactivation could be applied as animal models to study human coronavirus infection, reducing the risk of accidental exposure of researchers to pathogens during routine laboratory procedures.

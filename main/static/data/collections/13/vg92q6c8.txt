BACKGROUND: Higher requirement is put forward in the measurement of hand hygiene (HH) during a pandemic. This study aimed to describe HH compliance measurement and explore observed influencing factors with respect to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) guidelines in China. METHODS: Compliance was measured as the percentage of compliant opportunities based on criteria for 17 moments. The criteria for compliance included HH behavior, procedure, duration, hand drying method, and the overall that counts them all. The observed influencing factors included different departments and areas and protection motivation. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: The compliance of overall criteria, HH behavior, procedure, duration, and hand drying method were 79.44%, 96.71%, 95.74%, 88.93%, and 88.42%, respectively, which were significantly different from each other (P < .001). Meanwhile, the overall and hand drying method compliance in semi-contaminated areas (odds ratio [OR]â¯=â¯1.829, P < .001; ORâ¯=â¯2.149, Pâ¯=â¯.001) and hygienic areas (ORâ¯=â¯1.689, Pâ¯=â¯.004; ORâ¯=â¯1.959, Pâ¯=â¯.015) were significantly higher than those in contaminated area. The compliance with HH behavior for the motivation of patient-protection (ORâ¯=â¯0.362, P < .001) was lower than that for the motivation of self-protection. CONCLUSIONS: HH compliance was firstly measured using different criteria for 17 moments according to COVID-19 guidelines in China. The measurement of HH compliance needs clearer definition and comprehensive practice. Contaminated areas and motivation of patient-protection contribute to lower compliance, which may be addressed by allocating more human resources and increasing supervision and education.

Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection is one of the major viral respiratory diseases of chickens. Better understanding of the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis should contribute significantly towards the development of improved prophylactic, therapeutic and diagnostic reagents to control infections. In the present investigation, transcriptional profiles were analyzed by using RNA recovered from the lung tissue of IBV infected 18-day-old chicken embryos at 6, 24, 48 and 72h post IBV infection. This microarray analysis was completed using avian cDNA arrays comprised of fragments of 1191 unique chicken and turkey gene transcripts. These arrays were generated from normalized cDNA subtraction libraries that were derived from avian pneumovirus (APV) infected chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures and tissues obtained from APV infected turkeys subtracted with their respective uninfected cultures and tissues. Of the 1191 unique genes represented on the array, the expression of a total of 327 genes (27% of total) were altered by two-fold or more from 6 through 72h post-infection. A comparative analysis of IBV regulated genes with genes previously reported to change in expression following infection with other avian respiratory viruses revealed both conserved and unique changes. Real-time qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulated expression of genes related to several functional classes including kinases, interferon induced genes, chemokines and adhesion molecules, vesicular trafficking and fusion protein genes, extracellular matrix protein genes, cell cycle, metabolism, cell physiology and development, translation, RNA binding, lysosomal, protein degradation and ubiquitination related genes. Microarray analysis served as an efficient tool in facilitating a comparative analysis of avian respiratory viral infections and provided insight into host transcriptional changes that were conserved as well as those which were unique to individual pathogens.

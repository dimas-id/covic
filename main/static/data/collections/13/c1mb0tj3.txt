Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and thoracic radiography are routinely performed diagnostic procedures. We hypothesized that BAL increases the interstitial opacity of caudoventral and caudodorsal thoracic radiographs. Fifty-three horses, including 8 clinic owned and 45 from a referral hospital population, were classified as healthy controls (n = 12), severe equine asthma (recurrent airway obstruction, n = 12) or mild-to-moderate equine asthma (inflammatory airway disease, n = 21) based on the results of a clinical scoring system. Eight were excluded due to different diagnoses and poor image quality. Four randomized thoracic radiographs of each horse were scored by two blinded observers, who were also asked to identify the image as obtained before or after a BAL procedure. In severe equine asthma, the chance (adjusted odds) of misinterpretation of the correct imaging time was approximately 5 times higher than in controls (odds ratio [OR] = 5.373, p = 0.028). The chance of misinterpretation was approximately 4 times lower in caudodorsal images than in caudoventral projections (OR = 0.241, p = 0.004). Identification of the correct imaging time was highly correlated with an increase in interstitial opacity (OR = 9.976, p ï¼œ 0.0001). In conclusion, we recommend performing BAL after thoracic radiography to avoid possible misinterpretation.

Abstract Though direct cost-savings are attainable with powder reuse in additive manufacturing (AM), the use of non-virgin material has raised concerns over as-built properties. Considerable efforts to validate feedstock recycling have examined static material properties, but limited studies have assessed fatigue behavior with respect to powder reuse. Ti-6AlV-4VAl, 316L, and 17-4PH stainless-steel, and were processed using thermal and atmospheric conditions representative of industrial AM machines. Fatigue specimens were sintered with virgin or eighth reuse using a standard parameter set. Specimens were tested in rotating beam fatigue testing and the stair-case method applied. The fatigue limits of 316L, 17-4PH, and Ti-6AlV-4VAl exhibited no significant difference with respect to reuse. Density measurements confirmed no reuse-dependent behavior for the stainless steels, and Ti-6V6Al-4VAl demonstrated an improvement in bulk density. Quantification of fatigue properties as a function of reuse, supports powder reuse as a viable solution for improved metal powder-bed economics.

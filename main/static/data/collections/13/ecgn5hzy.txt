Business process management (BPM) aims to support changes and innovations in organizationsâ€™ processes. Process mining complements BPM with methods, techniques, and tools that provide insights based on observed executions of business processes recorded in event logs of information systems. State-of-the-art discovery and conformance techniques completely ignore or only implicitly consider the information about the likelihood of processes, which is readily available in event logs, even though such stochastic information is necessary for simulation, prediction and recommendation in models. Furthermore, stochastic information can provide business analysts with further actionable insights on frequent and rare conformance issues. In this paper, we propose precision and recall conformance measures based on the notion of entropy of stochastic automata that are capable of quantifying, and thus differentiating, frequent and rare deviations between an event log and a process model. The feasibility of using the proposed precision and recall measures in industrial settings is demonstrated by an evaluation over several real-world datasets supported by our open-source implementation.

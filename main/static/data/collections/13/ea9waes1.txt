Temporary portocaval shunt (TPCS) prolongs the duration of the anhepatic phase, during which anesthetic sensitivity is highest among the 3 phases of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Cognitive dysfunction has been associated with increased anesthetic sensitivity and poor hepatic function. Therefore, we assessed anesthetic sensitivity to desflurane and perioperative cognitive function in patients undergoing LDLT, in whom the duration of the anhepatic phase was extended by TPCS to test the hypothesis that the prolonged anhepatic phase increases anesthetic sensitivity and causes postoperative cognitive decline.This case-control study was conducted in 67 consecutive patients undergoing LDLT from February 2014 to January 2016. Anesthesia was maintained at a 0.6 end-tidal age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of desflurane. The bispectral index (BIS) was maintained at less than 60 and averaged at 1-minute intervals. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE-KC) was performed 1 day before and 7 days after the LDLT. All parameters were compared between the patients undergoing TPCS (TPCS group) and the remaining patients (non-TPCS group).TPCS was performed in 16 patients (24%). TPCS prolonged the duration of the anhepatic phase (125.9 ± 29.4 vs 54.9 ± 20.5 minutes [mean ± standard deviation], P < 0.0001). The averaged BIS values during the 3 phases were comparable between the 2 groups. No significant interval changes in the averaged BIS values were observed during the 3 consecutive phases. Similarly, there were no significant differences in MMSE-KC score assessed 1 day before and 7 days after LDLT between the 2 groups. The preoperative MMSE-KC scores were unchanged postoperatively in the 2 groups.The extension of the anhepatic phase did not affect anesthetic sensitivity and postoperative cognitive function.

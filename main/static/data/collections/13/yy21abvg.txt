Behavior in novel situations is guided by similarities to previous experiences, a phenomenon known as generalization. Despite the widespread influence of generalization on healthy and pathological behavior, insight into the underlying mechanisms is lacking. It remains unclear whether a failure to notice situational changes contributes to the generalization of learned behavior. We combined a fear conditioning and generalization procedure with a perceptual decision task in humans and found that a failure to perceive a novel stimulus as different from the initial fear-evoking stimulus was associated with increased conditioned responding. These findings demonstrate the potential of a perception-centered approach to better understand (pathological) behavior and its underlying mechanism and are a promising avenue for the development of refined generalization protocols.

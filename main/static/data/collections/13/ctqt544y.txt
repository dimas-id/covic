Abstract The replication cycle of the granulosis virus of Cydia pomonella, the codling moth, was studied at the cellular and tissue level. Membranelike complexes were observed forming within the remnants of the nucleolus in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Differences in cell polarity relative to the sites of virus entry assembly and budding as well as differences in the temporal aspects of replication were observed between midgut, fat body, and epidermal cells. The progressive spread of virus throughout larval tissues was studied at 24, 32, 48, 56, and 72 hr postinfection. The basal lamina seemed to be an effective barrier for the release of budded progeny virus into the hemocoel and large numbers of budded virus were produced.

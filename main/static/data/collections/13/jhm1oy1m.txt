BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Based on the data of several trials the Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) score has been shown to predict outcome after either intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or endovascular therapy (ET) in acute stroke patients. It is unknown whether the THRIVE score can also predict outcome in everyday clinical practice. Using our prospectively obtained stroke database the utility of the THRIVE score to predict clinical and radiological outcome in everyday clinical practice was analysed. METHODS The relationships between THRIVE and good outcome (modified Rankin Scale â‰¤ 2 at discharge), poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 5-6), in-hospital death, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH) as well as infarct size were examined in patients with distal intracranial carotid artery, M1 and M2 occlusions after either IVT or ET. RESULTS From January 2008 to October 2016 a total of 546 patients were treated with IVT and 492 patients received ET with stent retrievers (with or without IVT). In both treatment groups the THRIVE score predicted clinical outcome (Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared tests for trend P < 0.001 for good outcome, P < 0.001 for poor outcome and P < 0.001 for in-hospital death). In the ET group the THRIVE score remained an independent predictor of outcome after controlling for recanalization. The THRIVE score was associated with the infarct size after IVT or ET, whereas it did not predict SICH rates in either treatment group. CONCLUSIONS In everyday clinical practice the THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and the extent of ischaemia after ET or IVT in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions.

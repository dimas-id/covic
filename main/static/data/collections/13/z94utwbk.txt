The A59 strain of coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), produces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and chronic demyelination. The authors have previously shown that the spike (S) glycoprotein gene of MHV contains determinants of virulence, hepatitis, and demyelination. They then identified viruses containing mutations in the S gene that exhibit alterations in viral pathogenesis. In the present study, the authors produced new recombinant viruses with each one of these S gene mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and targeted recombination and studied the effect of each individual mutation on the pathogenesis of the virus. They identified a combination of mutations in the S1 gene (I375M and L652I) that abolishes demyelination. Individual mutation and other combinations of mutations in the S gene only interfere with virulence and hepatitis and only reduce demyelination (I375M), but do not abolish demyelination completely. Thus, demyelination determinants exist within genomic regions on both sides of the hypervariable region, downstream from the receptor-binding domain in the S1 part of the MHV spike glycoprotein gene. The structure and precise function of these regions awaits further investigation.

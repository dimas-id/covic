This chapter discusses epithelial-membrane polarity, sorting pathways in polarized cells, and the sorting-signal paradigm. Polarized epithelial cells have long captured the attention of cell biologists and cell physiologists. At the electron-microscopic level, one of the most apparent and fundamental features of this cell type is its polarized organization of intracellular organelles and its structurally and compositionally distinct lumenal (apical) and serosal (basolateral) plasma-membrane domains. The polarized epithelial phenotype is an absolute necessity for organ-system function. In the most general sense, these cells organize to form a continuous, single layer of cells, or epithelium, which serves as a semi-permeable barrier between apposing and biologically distinct compartments. Within the tubules of the nephron, these cells orchestrate complex ion-transporting processes that ultimately control the overall fluid balance of the organism. At the surface of the gastrointestinal tract, specialized versions of this cell type control the digestion, absorption, and immuno-protection of the organism.

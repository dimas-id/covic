Practical evidence suggests possible beneficial effects with the combined use of prebiotics and probiotics which can improve production parameters. The objective of the study was to investigate the addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) as prebiotic and the combination of Lactobacillus spp. (L), Bacillus spp. (B) as probiotics on productive parameters and economic feasibility. Four hundred male pigs, hybrids of commercial genetic lines (Pietrain), were used: T1 = control group, T2 = 4 kg/tonne SC, T3 = 0.8 kg/tonne feed L and B, T4 = 4 kg/tonne SC + 0.8 kg/tonne L and B. Productive parameters were recorded in the treatment groups for four periods. Then, the viscera of five pigs per treatment were collected after slaughter to evaluate the histological changes and cytokine concentrations in the ileum. The weight gains of groups at 70–100, 100–125 and 125–150 days in the T4 group showed statistically increases (p < .05). Feed intake had a significant difference (p < .05) in T3 versus T1. The feed‐conversion ratio improved for all periods in the T4 group (p < .05). The eosinophil, mononuclear infiltration and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor‐α and interleukin‐6) in the mucosa were lower for treatments with probiotics. In conclusion, there was an economic benefit when using both prebiotics and probiotics in the diet of pigs from weaning to finishing.

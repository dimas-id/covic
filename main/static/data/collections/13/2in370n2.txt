Anastomotic leak after low anterior resection (LAR) in patients with rectal cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiation can be challenging to treat and can lead to the creation of a permanent stoma. We report the case of a post-operative anastomotic leak after a Baker-type anastomosis during a low anterior resection was successfully managed with transanal endoscopic microsurgical (TEM) debridement and repair. TEM can be a successful endoluminal alternative treatment in the management of anastomotic leak after LAR and can prevent the morbidity associated with re-exploration and colostomy.

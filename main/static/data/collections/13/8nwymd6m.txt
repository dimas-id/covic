Adenoviruses (AdVs) are prevalent and give rise to chronic and recurrent disease. The human AdV (HAdV) species B and C, such as HAdV-C2, C5 and B14, cause respiratory disease, and constitute a health threat for immuno-compromised individuals. HAdV-Cs are well known for lysing cells, owing to the E3 CR1-Î²-encoded adenovirus death protein (ADP). We previously reported a high-throughput image-based screening framework and identified an inhibitor of HAdV-C2 multi-round infection, Nelfinavir Mesylate. Nelfinavir is the active ingredient of Viracept, an FDA-approved inhibitor of the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) aspartyl protease, and used to treat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is not effective against single round HAdV infections. Here, we show that Nelfinavir inhibits the lytic cell-free transmission of HAdV, indicated by the suppression of comet-shaped infection foci in cell culture. Comet-shaped foci occur upon convection-based transmission of cell-free viral particles from an infected cell to neighbouring uninfected cells. HAdV lacking ADP was insensitive to Nelfinavir, but gave rise to comet-shaped foci indicating that ADP enhances but is not required for cell lysis. This was supported by the notion that HAdV-B14 and B14p1 lacking ADP were highly sensitive to Nelfinavir, although HAdV-A31, B3, B7, B11, B16, B21, D8, D30 or D37 were less sensitive. Conspicuously, Nelfinavir uncovered slow-growing round-shaped HAdV-C2 foci, independent of neutralizing antibodies in the medium, indicative of non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission. Our study demonstrates the repurposing potential of Nelfinavir with post-exposure efficacy against different HAdVs, and describes an alternative non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission mode of HAdV.

PURPOSE Robotic LaparoEndoscopic Single-Site Surgery Cholecystectomy has been performed for 5 years using a dedicated platform (da Vinci® Single-Site®) with the da Vinci® Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). While short-term feasibility has been described, long-term assessment of this method is currently outstanding. The aim of this study was to assess long-term parietal complications of this technique. METHODS In this retrospective study, patients operated between 2011 and 2013 were evaluated. Parietal incision was assessed with ultrasonography and patients screened for residual pain from scar tissue. Demographic and perioperative data were also collected. RESULTS We evaluated 48 patients [38 female, 79.2%; median age 49 years (range: 24-81 years)]; mean BMI 25.9 kg/m2 [±SD 4.1 kg/m2]. After a median follow-up of 39 months (range: 25-46 months), six incisional hernias (two patients had a positive echography but a negative clinical examination) were found (12.5%, 95% CI 7.5-30.2), and two patients had a surgical repair. The overall rate of incisional hernia was 16.7% (95% CI 7.5-30.2). Residual pain was observed in 5 of 48 patients. CONCLUSION This preliminary study suggests that a clinically significant rate of incisional hernias can occur after R-LESS-C. Larger studies comparing R-LESS-C to alternative methods with long-term follow-up are necessary.

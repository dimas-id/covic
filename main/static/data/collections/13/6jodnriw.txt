FS-L3 cells, originating from porcine kidney, were used for propagation of Hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) and development of a virus neutralizing (VN) test. Sera of pigs, rats, cows and dogs had VN activities to HEV. On the other hand, sera of mice, rabbits, goats, sheep, horses, cats, chickens, hamsters and human did not have measurable VN activities, although these sera had high HI activities. Our results support the idea that the VN is a more reliable measure of HEV infection than the conventionally used HI test.

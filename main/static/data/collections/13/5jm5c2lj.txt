The impact of rhinovirus in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients is not well defined. A retrospective, matched, case-control study of HSCT recipients with rhinovirus was conducted between 2009 and 2011. Controls were matched for timing relative to transplant, malignancy, and stem cell source. There were 47 cases and 94 controls. Cases and controls did not differ with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, donor source, malignancy, conditioning regimen, immunosuppression, antimicrobial prophylaxis, or significant comorbidities. There were no differences in need for ICU care, 100 day mortality, hospice discharge, relapse of disease, GVHD or development of disease or infection due to CMV or EBV. Other infectious complications after rhinovirus diagnosis were also equal. However, there was an increased number of recurrent hospitalizations from any cause among cases (46.8% vs. 24.5%, P=0.007). Recurrent hospitalizations due to any infection were also more common in cases (34% vs. 14.9%, P=0.015). For patients who were diagnosed with rhinovirus pre-transplant (n=13), there was no difference in outcomes compared to matched controls. HSCT recipients with rhinovirus have an increased risk of hospital readmission. However, there was no difference in outcomes compared to matched controls. Transplantation in patients with active rhinovirus infection appears to be safe.

Rotaviruses and coronaviruses are very common causes of calfhood diarrhea throughout the world. Rotaviral and coronaviral infections in neonatal calves can produce a severe diarrhea of high morbidity but of variable mortality depending upon secondary bacterial infections and electrolyte imbalances. Laboratory diagnosis of rotaviral and coronaviral diarrhea is mostly done by detection of virus particles or virus antigens in fecal specimens. The sample of choice for these diagnostic tests is a fresh fecal sample collected directly from the calf as close as possible to the onset of diarrhea.

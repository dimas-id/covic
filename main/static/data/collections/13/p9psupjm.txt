PURPOSE Because sternal wound complications after sternotomy can be life threatening and often occur in very sick patients, optimal management of these complications remains an important topic. To decrease postoperative morbidity and shorten the recovery period, the senior author (J.A.A.) sought a less invasive approach to sternal debridement and flap closure in carefully selected patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by obtaining specific outcomes data from a series of patients treated with this less invasive method. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of the most recent 174 sternal wounds treated by the senior author, 25 underwent limited debridement and partial bilateral pectoralis major advancement flaps. The charts of these 25 patients were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS In the 25 patients who underwent limited debridement, there were no mortalities intraoperatively or during the 30-day postoperative period. Six patients (24%) experienced complications after debridement, including 1 recurrent sternal wound infection, 1 partial wound dehiscence, 1 seroma, 1 hematoma, and 1 wound edge necrosis requiring revision. Mean length of hospitalization after the procedure was 10 days, compared with 30 days (P = 0.0001) as previously reported with full debridement (Plast Reconstr Surg 2004; 114:676). Mean estimated intraoperative blood loss was reduced from 331 mL during full debridement to 93 mL (P < 0.0001) with limited debridement (Plast Reconstr Surg 2004; 114:676). There was no increase in postoperative morbidity (24 % vs 13 %, P = 0.2117). CONCLUSIONS The authors advocate limited sternal debridement and partial bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps in patients with limited wounds and partially or fully healed sternums. We demonstrate that the procedure is effective but less invasive than complete debridement, reduces operative time and blood loss, and shortens length of hospitalization.

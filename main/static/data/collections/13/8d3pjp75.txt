Abstract Liver injury is commonly observed in the setting of many systemic viral infections. The severity of this injury can range from mild, transient elevations in liver enzymes to acute liver failure. Understanding the rate of liver injury in these infections as well as the appropriate diagnostic evaluations can add clarity to the clinical management of infected patients and in many cases helps direct therapy. This chapter reviews hepatitis caused by viruses other than classical viral hepatitis with an emphasis on epidemiology, patterns of injury, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Agents discussed include cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and various others that can be associated with hepatic manifestations.

The purpose of the study is to describe what is the presentation of breast cancer in women with HIV, their tolerance to therapy, the most common complications of treatment and their outcomes. Retrospective chart review of patients with HIV diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 2013 at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital (UM/JMH) 47 females and 1 male were included in the analysis. The median age of diagnosis was 46 years (IQR 41–52) and 64 % of the women were premenopausal. Median CD4(+) count was 330 cells/µL (IQR 131–589 cells/µL). 41 % had AIDS at time of diagnosis. 94 % of patients presented with locoregional disease and 6 % with late stage breast cancer. 52 % had ER(+) tumors. 6 % had HER-2/neu tumor expression and 21 % had triple negative disease. The 5 year PFS was 50 % (95 % CI 34–64 %), the 5 year OS was 44 % (95 % CI 29–58 %), and the Breast cancer-specific survival was 57 % (95 % CI 40–70 %). Death was attributed to breast cancer in 22 patients, AIDS progression in 6 patients, other medical condition in 1, and for 4, the cause was unknown. Serious adverse events were documented in 46 % of patients treated with chemotherapy. Targeted therapy was well tolerated. Patients with HIV/AIDS and breast cancer pose a major challenge for oncologists. Surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy are well tolerated. Standard dose chemotherapy can have life-threatening side effects which can be managed with growth factor support and antimicrobial prophylaxis. All cancer therapy can be given while continuing with antiviral therapy at full dose.

The glycyrrhizic acid (GA) analog olean-9(11),12(13)-dien-30-oic acid 3β-(2-O-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl-β-D-glucuronopyranoside) (II) was synthesized via reduction of GA by NaBH(4) in refluxing 2-PrOH:H(2)O with subsequent work up with HCl (5%). The cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of this glycoside against HIV-1 was studied in MT-4 cell culture. It was found that II was practically non-toxic for MT-4 cells while inhibiting accumulation of virus-specific protein p24 and RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) (IC(50) 3.1 ±1.0 μg/mL).

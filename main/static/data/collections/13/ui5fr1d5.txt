OBJECTIVE To present our experience in the use of fresh-frozen human bone allograft as an interpositional grafting material for sliding genioplasty to correct chin deformities. METHODS Ten patients underwent sliding genioplasty using morcellized and corticospongious fresh-frozen human bone. Four patients underwent orthognathic surgery associated with genioplasty. Six patient underwent genioplasty associated with rhinoplasty. Panorex, lateral, and frontal cephalogram and computed tomographic scans have been performed for each case preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. One patient subsequently asked for plate removal, and with his consent, a bone biopsy specimen was obtained during the operation. RESULTS Stable aesthetic and functional results were observed in all cases. No infections occurred, and no bone resorption has been clinically or radiologically observed. CONCLUSION The use of fresh-frozen bone allograft reduces patient morbidity and operative time, providing a stable and excellent aesthetic result.

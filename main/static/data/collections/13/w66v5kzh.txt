Abstract Introduction Mucormycosis is a rare but highly lethal fungal infection, usually affecting immunocompromised patients. Aim To present and analyze the diagnostic capabilities of transthoracic ultrasonography in invasive pulmonary mucormycosis. Case study We present a case involving a 41-year-old female patient with pneumonia complicated by multisystem organ failure, who was diagnosed with invasive pulmonary mucormycosis. Results and discussion Transthoracic ultrasonography (TUS) revealed a consolidation area of heterogeneous echostructure with an abnormal air bronchogram, possibly suggestive of an invasive pulmonary fungal disorder. The presence of lesions observed with TUS was confirmed by computed tomography (CT). The final diagnosis of mucormycosis was possible after Mucor species fungi were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage culture. Conclusions (1) TUS is a widely available and inexpensive diagnostic method that is characterized by the absence of adverse effects, and its applicability in the diagnosis of pulmonary disorders other than invasive fungal infections is well documented. (2) Ultrasonographic analysis of lesions facilitates differentiation between bacterial and fungal pneumonia, and the high sensitivity and specificity of the procedure compared to CT scans as a reference method supports the reliability of ultrasound scans in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). (3) The use of TUS in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary mucormycosis appears warranted, particularly in cases when it is impossible to obtain a proven diagnosis. (4) Ultrasonographic diagnosis of invasive lung disorders, including mucormycosis, requires further studies.

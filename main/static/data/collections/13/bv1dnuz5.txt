The functional aspects of the adult house fly crop have not been studied even though various human and domestic animal pathogens have been discovered within the crop lumen. The average volume consumed (midgut and crop) by flies starved for 24 h was 3.88 μl by feeding both sexes on a sucrose phosphate glutamate buffer. In addition, various volumes of a solution (0.125 M sucrose plus Amaranth dye) were fed to 3-d-old adult female house flies to quantify the crop contraction rate as affected by crop volume. As crop volume increased, the contraction rate increased until it reached a peak at 2 μl, after which it declined. It is hypothesized that the high contraction rate of the crop, which in house fly is almost twice the rate of three other fly species, is one of the factors that makes house fly an excellent vector. The mechanism for such a high contraction rate needs to be investigated.

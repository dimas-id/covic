The typical functions of antibodies are based on linking the process of antigen recognition with initiation of innate immune reactions. With the introduction of modern research technologies and the use of sophisticated model systems, recent years have witnessed the discovery of a number of noncanonical functions of antibodies. These functions encompass either untypical strategies for neutralization of pathogens or exertion of activities that are characteristic for other proteins (cytokines, chaperones, or enzymes). Here, we provide an overview of the noncanonical functions of antibodies and discuss their mechanisms and implications in immune regulation and defense. A better comprehension of these functions will enrich our knowledge of the adaptive immune response and shall inspire the development of novel therapeutics.

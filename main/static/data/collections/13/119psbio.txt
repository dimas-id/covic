Intestinal dysfunction, which may cause a series of metabolic diseases, has become a worldwide health problem. In the past few years, studies have shown that consumption of poultry eggs has the potential to prevent a variety of metabolic diseases, and increasing attention has been directed to the bioactive proteins and their peptides in poultry eggs. This review mainly focused on the biological activities of an important egg-derived protein named ovomucin. Ovomucin and its derivatives have good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunity-regulating and other biological functions. These activities may affect the physical, biological and immune barriers associated with intestinal health. This paper reviewed the structure and the structure-activity relationship of ovomucinï¼Œthe potential role of ovomucin and its derivatives in modulation of intestinal health are also summarized. Finally, the potential applications of ovomucin and its peptides as functional food components to prevent and assist in the pretreatment of intestinal health problems are prospected.

BACKGROUND A minority of patients undergoing posterior component separation (PCS) have abdominal wall defects that preclude complete reconstruction of the visceral sac with native tissue. The use of absorbable mesh bridges (AMB) to span such defects has not been established. We hypothesized that AMB use during posterior sheath closure of PCS is safe and provides favorable outcomes. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing PCS with AMB at two hernia centers. Main outcome measures included demographics, comorbidities, and post-operative complications. RESULTS 36 patients were identified. Post-operative wound complications included five surgical site infections. At a median of 27 months, there were five recurrent hernias (13.9%), 2 of which were parastomal, but no episodes of intestinal obstruction/fistula. CONCLUSIONS Utilization of AMB for large posterior layer deficits results in acceptable rates of perioperative wound morbidity, effective PCS repairs, and does not increase intestinal morbidity or fistula formation.

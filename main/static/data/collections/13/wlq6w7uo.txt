We introduce varying spin strengths to the Ising model, a central pillar of statistical physics. With inhomogeneous physical systems in mind, but also anticipating interdisciplinary applications, we present the model on network structures of varying degrees of complexity. We solve it for the generic case of power-law spin strength and find that, with a self-averaging free energy, the model has a rich phase diagram with new universality classes. Indeed, the degree of complexity added by variable spins is on a par to that added by endowing simple networks with increasingly realistic geometries. It is suitable for modeling emergent phenomena in many-body systems in contexts where non-identicality of spins or agents plays an essential role and for exporting statistical physics concepts beyond physics.

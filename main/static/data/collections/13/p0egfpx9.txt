Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), mediated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), can manifest with flu‐like illness and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Immunocompromised patients merit particular attention as altered host immunity may influence both disease severity and duration of viral shedding as is described with several other ribonucleic acid respiratory viruses. Yet immunocompromised status alone, in the absence of other comorbidities, may not necessarily predict severe illness presentations and poorer clinical outcomes as indicated by recent reports of COVID‐19‐infected solid organ transplant recipients and people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Such patients may even be spared the robust inflammatory response that precipitates ARDS associated with COVID‐19, complicating the management of iatrogenic immunosuppression in this setting. We present a case of an orthotopic liver transplant recipient with well‐controlled HIV who successfully recovered from a mild, flu‐like illness attributed to SARS‐CoV‐2.

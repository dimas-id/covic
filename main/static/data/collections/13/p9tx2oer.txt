Deltacoronavirus is the last identified Coronaviridae subfamily genus. Differing from other coronavirus (CoV) genera, which mainly infect birds or mammals, deltacoronaviruses (δ‐CoVs) reportedly infect both animal types. Recent studies show that a novel δ‐CoV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), can also infect calves and chickens with the potential to infect humans, raising the possibility of cross‐species transmission of δ‐CoVs. Here, we explored the deep phylogenetic history and cross‐species transmission of δ‐CoVs. Virus–host co‐phylogenetic analyses showed that δ‐CoVs have undergone frequent host switches in birds, and sparrows may serve as the unappreciated hubs for avian to mammal transmission. Our molecular clock analyses show that PDCoV possibly originated in Southeast Asia in the 1990s, and that the PDCoV cluster shares a common ancestor with Sparrow‐CoV of around 1810. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the diversification, evolution, and interspecies transmission of δ‐CoVs and the origin of PDCoV, providing a model for exploring the relationships of δ‐CoVs in birds and mammals.

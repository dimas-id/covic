BACKGROUND There are few data available concerning the use of intravenous contrast materials in children. OBJECTIVE To assess patterns of intravenous iodinated/gadolinium-based contrast material (ICM/GBCM) use in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS Society of Chairs of Radiology in Children's Hospitals (SCORCH) members were invited to complete a Web-based survey regarding intravenous contrast material use at their institutions. RESULTS Sixty-six percent (42/64) of SCORCH member institutions responded, 76% of which are academic hospitals. Ioversol and gadopentetate dimeglumine are the most commonly used ICMs and GBCMs (52% and 81%, respectively). Premedication policies to mitigate risk of allergic-like contrast reactions are more common for ICMs than GBCMs (71% vs. 32%). For both ICMs and GBCMs, most institutions premedicate or avoid contrast material in the setting of a prior allergic-like contrast reaction of any severity. Policies regarding ICM and GBCM use in children with renal insufficiency are in place at 74% and 88% of institutions, respectively, but are variable. CONCLUSION Policies concerning premedication for prevention of allergic-like contrast agent reactions and administration of contrast materials in children with renal insufficiency are variable and not consistently present at all pediatric institutions. This highlights the need for standardization of practice patterns and pediatric-specific research on these topics.

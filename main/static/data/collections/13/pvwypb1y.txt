Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic affecting more than 200 countries and 180,000 cases in the United States. While the outbreak began in China, the number of cases outside of China exceeded those in China on March 15, 2020 and are currently rising at an exponential rate. The number of fatalities in the United States are expected to exceed more than Italy and China. The disease is characterized predominantly as an acute respiratory illness. However, preliminary data suggests that kidney is a target for the virus and deterioration of renal function was associated with poor outcomes including in-hospital mortality. We pre-sent a report of a patient with COVID-19 who presented with acute onset of symptoms and normal renal function at baseline but rapidly deteriorated resulting in death. The timing of decline in renal function correlated with his worsening clinical status. He was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration without signs of clinical benefit. We also present the possible mechanisms for acute kidney injury in these patients. We performed a review of the emerging literature by searching PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE for studies and/or case series published on this topic. Acute kidney injury might help risk stratify critically ill patients on a fatal course of COVID-19.

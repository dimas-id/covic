Chapter 7 focuses on decision-making. It introduces and discusses the relevant actors and agents responsible for identifying health risks, and developing and ordering responses at the local, national, and international levels. Then it delves into the functions of trust and history in disordering (and potentially re-ordering) health: such as the role of reactance and the ostensible reclaiming of rights by refusing vaccination(s). The latter has been the case in the former East Germany for example, which experienced a large measles outbreak in 2015, as well as in California. The chapter explores ways and means for overcoming such political and policy gaps to promote health rights and responsibilities. Finally, the chapter explores ways in which decision-makers and decision-making respond to health threats that can(not) be contained.

• Several studies suggested Baricitinib as a potential drug for the management of COVID 19 infection through drug repurposing strategies because of its ability to act on AT2 cells and AAK1 mediated endocytosis. • Baricitinib, a Januase Kinase Inhibitor, have known to cause Lymphocytopenia, Neutropenia and Viral Reactivation. • Reported Epidemiological studies have shown that COVID 19 patients have a lesser absolute lymphocyte count closer to the threshold value. • Moreover, incidence of Co-infection for COVID 19 patients is one of the leading causes of Mortality. Baricitinib may enhance the incidence of Co-infection. • Hence, Baricitinib may not be an ideal option for Management of COVID 19.

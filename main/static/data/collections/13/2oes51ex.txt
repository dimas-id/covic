The need for new and useful compounds and biological processes to provide assistance and relief in all aspects of the human condition is ever growing. Drug resistance in bacteria, the appearance of life-threatening viruses, and a tremendous increase in the incidence of fungal and drug-resistant bacterial infections in the worldâ€™s population, each only underscores our inadequacy to cope with these medical problems. Added to this are enormous difficulties in raising enough food on certain areas of the earth to support local human populations. Environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and spoilage of land and water also add to problems facing mankind. In addition, there is the need for bio-derived fuels to supplant the ever-growing demand for petroleum and petroleum products.

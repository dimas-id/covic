Here some progresses of core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) for biomedical applications have been reported. A new synthesis mechanism for preparation of core-shell NPs by using water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsion technique has been investigated. And the applications of the core-shell NPs on cell recognition, oligonucleotide detection, single bacterial detection, pH nano-sensor for single cell, DNA recovery and gene carrier have been demonstrated.

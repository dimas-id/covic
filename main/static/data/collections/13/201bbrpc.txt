Miller Fisher syndrome, also known as Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, is an acute peripheral neuropathy that can develop after exposure to various viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. It is characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Miller Fisher syndrome has recently been described in the clinical setting of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without accompanying imaging. In this case, we report the first presumptive case of COVID-19-associated Miller Fisher syndrome with MR imaging findings.

In this letter we discuss the proposition of Bristian BR (2020) to use the intravenous administration of fish-oil emulsions in critically ill patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We consider that immune-modulatory properties of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, rapidly provided in high amounts by fish-oil emulsions, may be important to change the course of COVID-19's death pathway. Prescriptions should be based on body weight (eg, 0.2-g pure fish-oil lipid emulsion/kg body weight/d) and also should consider combining the parenteral administration of fish-oil emulsions with low oral aspirin intake to trigger resolvin synthesis from EPA and DHA.

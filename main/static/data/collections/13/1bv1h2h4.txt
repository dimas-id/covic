Abstract Since the first accounts of SARS-CoV-2, authorities have encountered numerous unprecedented situations threatening public health. This rapid communication addresses events that led to the quarantining of a hotel in Tenerife, Spain and the effectiveness of the rapidly implemented control measures. In total, eight cases have been associated with the hotel. Due to the international nature of the guests, had these timely precautions not been in place, a multinational cluster might have formed.

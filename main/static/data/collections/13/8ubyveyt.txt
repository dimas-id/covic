Epidemics of infectious diseases have accompanied humans for a long time and, depending on the scale, cause various undesirable social and economic consequences. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries impose restrictions to inhibit spreading of infection. Isolation and limiting interpersonal contacts are particularly recommended actions. Adhering to the rule of isolation may involve restrictions in freedom during daily activities, such as shopping. The aim of the study was to develop a scale of in-store pandemic behavior. The whole process involved 3 stages: qualitative inquiry, scale purification and scale validation, which were based on 3 studies: 1 qualitative (20 in-depth interviews) 2 two quantitative (373 and 584 respondents, respectively), and allowed to identify 8 factors. Following, a theoretical model was created to investigate the impact of in-store infection threat on identified variables. All identified factors significantly correlated with the in-store infection threat which reiterates the importance of providing information revealing the true scale of the pandemic and not leaving space for individuals to create subjective probability judgments. The developed scale can help counteract disinformation and assess consumer behavior compliance and understanding of the official recommendations imposed by governments, enabling more efficient educational efforts.

Many advances have been made in the understanding of intestinal electrolyte transport from the molecular to the whole-tissue level. This chapter discusses the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial ion transport processes, as well as the intra- and extracellular factors involved in their regulation, as a framework for the understanding of virus-induced gastroenteritis. Based on the present knowledge of the effects of rotavirus (RV) infection on the physiology of the intestine at different levels of organization, a working model for the pathogenesis of RV diarrhea is presented in the chapter. The understanding of the pathogenic processes of viral diarrheas may serve as the basis for a rational approach in the design of novel therapeutic strategies and the search for new antiviral drugs.

OBJECTIVE: This article positions the special issue on telepsychology amidst the COVID‐19 pandemic, which has dramatically accelerated the adoption and dissemination of telepsychology. METHOD: The article makes general observations about the themes emerging in the special issue with considerations for application, training, theory‐driven research, and policy. It then presents as a case example the rapid deployment during the pandemic of telepsychology doctoral training and services at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Primary Care Psychology Collaborative. RESULTS: Facilitators to VCU telepsychology deployment included trainee and supervisor resources, strong telepsychology training, and prior experience. Barriers to overcome included limited clinic capacity, scheduling, technology, and accessibility and diversity issues. Lessons learned involved presenting clinical issues, supervision, and working with children and adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychology is crucial for psychological service provision, during the COVID‐19 pandemic more than ever, and that is unlikely to change as psychologists and patients increasingly continue to appreciate its value.

The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in a population is used as a coarse measurement for the burden of disease. However, this number depends heavily on the sampling intensity and the various test criteria used in different jurisdictions. A wide range of sources indicate that a large fraction of cases go undetected. Estimates of the true prevalence of Covid-19 can be made by random sampling in the wider population. Here we use simulations to explore confidence intervals of prevalence estimates under different sampling intensities and degrees of sample pooling.

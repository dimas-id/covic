It was recently described that COVID-19 pneumonia patients had an atypical form of the ARDS syndrome and required gentle ventilation. We report here on benefits of CPAP treatment in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. A 63-year-old patient of African origin presented to the emergency room with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever had started 5 days before her admission. On day 4, rapid clinical deterioration associated to a high respiratory rate and increased oxygen requirements was noted. The patient was working in an intensive care unit and refused to be intubated. Oxygen was administered at a rate of 15 litres per minute via a Boussignac valve, which initially restored normal oxygen saturation, but this treatment was poorly tolerated and the patient withdrew it after 2 h. A CPAP set at a pressure of 8 cm of water (GoodknightÂ®) was then introduced with better tolerance, allowing the patient to wear it almost continuously for more than 38 h. The patient also benefited from the administration of methypredinsolone 40 mg. Concerning tolerance, a substantial advantage was noted for CPAP machine compared to the Boussignac valve with in addition, a clear decrease in respiratory rate. We would like to encourage the use of CPAP, better tolerated for extended hours with lower oxygen flows, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, where acute respiratory distress all too often leads to patient intubation and the genesis of deleterious lung lesions.

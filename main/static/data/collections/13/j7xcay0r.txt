Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates recovered in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan between 2007 and 2010 were subjected to molecular characterization and compared with those isolated a decade ago. The IBV genome was detected in 202 out of 605 field samples from chickens with various clinical signs. Partial sequencing of the S1 gene revealed 153 vaccine strains and 49 field isolates of several genetic groups. Massachusetts, 793/B and D274 remained the predominant IBV genotypes along with QX, whereas B1648, Italy-02, Arkansas and variants accounted for about 12% of the total number. Three IBVs contained recombinant S1 gene sequences comprising genome fragments of QX-type field isolates and vaccine strains H120 (UKR/02/2009) or 4/91 (RF/03/2010), and vaccine strains H120 and D274 (RF/01/2010). The results of the present study showed a significant decline in prevalence of variant IBVs and a further spread of QX-type isolates in commercial chicken flocks in Russia as compared with the 1998 to 2002 data.

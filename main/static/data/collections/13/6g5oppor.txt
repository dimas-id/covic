Bronchial artery embolization is an effective nonsurgical therapy for massive hemoptysis. Routine selection of the bronchial arteries from the aorta usually enables the interventionalist full interrogation and embolization of the culprit vascular abnormality. In problematic cases where bronchial artery access is difficult, a systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunt can be exploited as a retrograde means of vascular intervention. A case is presented where inaccessibility of a tortuous left bronchial artery was circumvented by accessing the left pulmonary artery, leading to successful embolization and control of hemoptysis.

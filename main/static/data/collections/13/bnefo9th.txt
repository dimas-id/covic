INTRODUCTION The development of new revascularization devices has significantly improved recanalization rates and time to reperfusion. A direct aspiration first-pass (ADAPT) technique for stroke thrombectomy was recently shown to be an effective and rapid way to achieve revascularization. The technique focuses on engaging and removing a clot without the use of a separator or retriever by relying on the force and aspiration generated by the catheter. We sought to compare the physical and fluid dynamic properties (force and aspiration) of commercially available catheters to determine the most effective catheter for the ADAPT technique. METHODS Benchtop models were employed to compare aspiration for each catheter by submersing the catheter into a graduated cylinder and aspirating water. The volume of fluid aspirated and flow rates were calculated. Force of aspiration at the tip of each catheter was measured using a vacuum pressure gauge while the catheter was attached to a standard aspiration pump. Force was then calculated. RESULTS The Penumbra 5MAX ACE catheter had the greatest aspiration rate of all the catheters at 245 mL/min. The Penumbra 5 MAX catheter aspirated 212 mL/min, followed by the Navien 058 and DAC 057 with 198 mL/min and 197 mL/min, respectively. The Penumbra 5MAX ACE generated the greatest tip force (18.25 g) and the 5MAX had the least amount of force (14.77 g). CONCLUSIONS The physical and fluid dynamic properties of currently available catheters suggest that the 5MAX ACE is the optimal catheter to use in direct aspiration for stroke therapy.

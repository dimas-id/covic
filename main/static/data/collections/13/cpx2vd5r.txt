Stair climbing is associated with dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation and the development of severe dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study aimed to assess whether (i) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied during stair climbing prevents dynamic hyperinflation and thereby reduces exercise-induced dyspnea in oxygen-dependent COPD-patients, and (ii) the CPAP-device and oxygen tank can be carried in a hip belt. In a randomised cross-over design, oxygen-dependent COPD patients performed two stair-climbing tests (44 steps): with supplemental oxygen only, then with the addition of CPAP (7 mbar). The oxygen tank and CPAP-device were carried in a hip belt during both trials. Eighteen COPD patients were included in the study. Although all patients could tolerate stair climbing with oxygen alone, 4 patients were unable to perform stair climbing while using CPAP. Fourteen COPD patients (mean FEV1 36 ± 14% pred.) completed the trial and were analyzed. The mean flow rate of supplemental oxygen was 3 ± 2 l/min during stair climbing. Lung hyperinflation, deoxygenation, hypoventilation, blood lactate production, dyspnea and the time needed to manage stair climbing were not improved by the application of CPAP (all p > 0.05). However, in comparison to climbing with oxygen alone, limb discomfort was reduced when oxygen was supplemented with CPAP (p = 0.008). In conclusion, very severe COPD patients are able to carry supporting devices such as oxygen tanks or CPAP-devices in a hip belt during stair climbing. However, the application of CPAP in addition to supplemental oxygen during stair climbing prevents neither exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation, nor dyspnea.

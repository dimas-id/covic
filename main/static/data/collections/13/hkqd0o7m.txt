The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been causing respiratory diseases globally, damaging wide-ranges of social-economical activities. This virus is transmitted through personal contact and possibly also through ambient air. Effective biosensor platforms for the detection of this virus and the related host response are in urgent demand. These platforms can facilitate routine diagnostic assays in certified clinical labs. They can also be integrated into point-of-care products. Furthermore, environmental biosensors can be designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the ambient air or in the intensive care ventilators. Here, we evaluate technical components of biosensors, including the biological targets of recognition, the recognition methods and the signal amplification and transduction systems. Effective SARS-CoV-2 detectors can be designed by adequate combination of these technologies.

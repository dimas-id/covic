Between June 1979 and July 1980, faecal specimens were collected from 100 children in Efate, Vanuatu, and examined for the presence of virus-like particles by direct negative staining electron microscopy. Of the children, 40 were hospital patients 22 of whom had gastroenteritis and 18 had other illnesses. The remaining 60 children were apparently healthy controls. Coronavirus-like particles were the most common agents encountered and were detected in approximately 20% of all three groups of children. Particles with the morphological features of calicivirus, astrovirus, adenovirus and parvovirus were also detected.

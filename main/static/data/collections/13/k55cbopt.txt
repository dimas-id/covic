PURPOSE Ideal approaches and materials for reconstruction of large chest wall defects remain a topic of debate. We sought to explore the suitability of a reinforced nanostructured cellulose (NC) patch for chest wall reconstruction in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In four domestic pigs, a standardized 10 × 10 cm chest wall defect was created by resecting three rib segments. Subsequently the defect was reconstructed via a biosynthetic NC patch (16 × 12 cm) reinforced by polytetrafluoroethylene mesh. After 1, 2, 4, and 5 months respectively, gross examination of NC patches was performed following sacrifice of the animals. Specimens of NC patches and surrounding connective tissue underwent histological examinations after staining with Hematoxylin-eosin and Elastica van Gieson. RESULTS All animals survived their observation period without encountering major adverse events. On gross examination all NC patches were intact and well integrated into the surrounding tissue. Histological examination showed clearly demarked zones of foreign body reaction at the patch/host-tissue interface. After 5 months a slight increase in foreign body reaction, fibrous capsule formation and cellular infiltration were observed. No signs of fibroblast proliferation or neovascularization were seen within NC patches at any point. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest a quick healing process and good overall biocompatibility following NC patch implantation.NC might prove an efficient and suitable biomaterial for complex chest wall reconstruction.

The regional processing centre at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre recently faced the substantial challenge of increasing cleaning capacity to meet the current workload and anticipated future demand without increasing its operating budget. The solution, upgrading its cleaning and decontamination system to a highly automated system, met both objectives. An analysis of the impact of the change found that the new system provided additional benefits, including improved productivity and cleaning quality; decreased costs; reduced water, electricity and chemical use; improved worker safety and morale; and decreased overtime. Investing in innovative technology improved key departmental outcomes while meeting institutional environmental and cost savings objectives.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality in lung transplant recipients (LTRs); this review will focus on the most recent advances in this field. RECENT FINDINGS Recent advancements in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the detection of higher rates of CARVs in LTRs. Persistence of rhinovirus has been implicated in the development of acute and chronic rejection, whereas the role of bocavirus remains uncertain. The data on the association of CARV infections with acute or chronic rejection remain less. A recent systematic review failed to show an association between CARV infections and acute or chronic rejection. Different routes of administration of antiviral medications, vaccines and newer promising antiviral medications are being evaluated to assess efficacy and safety. Similarly, newer strategies of vaccination may potentiate the immune response in these patients. SUMMARY With current advanced investigating tools, the full impact of CARV infections in LTR is increasingly coming to realization. Research for novel effective treatments and improved responses to current and new vaccines is ongoing; they would provide great benefit in solving this complex and ever-evolving problem.

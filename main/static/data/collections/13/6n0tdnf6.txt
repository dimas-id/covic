Abstract A two-year-old cat from Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain), presented with two months history of uveitis in the left eye. It had been treated for two months but still showed an active uveitis. After new treatment, eye examination showed a mobile worm in the anterior chamber. Following surgical removal, the worm was obtained. Morphological study revealed that it was a male metastrongyloid nematode (Nematoda: Metastrongyloidea) with caudal bursa and two similar spicules. Molecular tools based on the 18Sr RNA gene sequence identified the parasite as Gurltia paralysans, which is a neurotropic nematode previously found in South America. Therefore, this article describes the first report of ophthalmic case of parasitism by G. paralysans, and cites for first time this species out of South America.

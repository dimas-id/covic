PURPOSE: This study aims to describe the motives and considerations of couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality deciding on preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured dyadic interviews with 13 couples (N = 26) carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality. All couples had an informative consultation in our PGT centre in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Almost all couples considered PGT or natural conception combined with prenatal diagnosis (PND) as the only two reproductive options. Among several considerations mentioned, the majority indicated that the wish to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy was the most important motive to opt for PGT. All couples who opted for PGT had first tried to conceive spontaneously and entered the PGT programme because of their adverse experiences during these attempts (infertility, recurrent miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, birth of an affected child). Couples that refrained from PGT were of advanced maternal age and expressed the long trajectory of PGT as the main reason to refrain. If conceiving spontaneously would not lead to an ongoing pregnancy, these couples also indicated that they would use PGT. CONCLUSION: This study shows that couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality consider PGT and spontaneous conception with PND as relevant reproductive options. They are looking for the option that is in their opinion the fastest way to establish a successful pregnancy. Information on the perceived pros and cons of PGT or spontaneous conception in these couples can help to optimize counselling and psychological support during the decision-making process.

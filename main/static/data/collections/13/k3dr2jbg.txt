We have described previously an immunostimulant derived from Onchocerca volvulus, the helminth parasite that causes onchocerciasis. Recombinant O. volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (rOv-ASP-1) was a potent adjuvant for antibody and cellular responses to protein, polypeptide and small peptide antigens. Our aims were to determine whether rOv-ASP-1 is immunostimulatory for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and, if so, whether it could augment cellular responses against human pathogen antigens in vitro. Cytokines from rOv-ASP-1-stimulated human PBMC were measured by a fluorescence activated cell sorter-based multiplex assay. Recall responses of normal healthy donor (NHD) and chronic hepatitis C virus (c-HCV)-infected patient PBMC to tetanus toxoid (TT) or HCV core (HCVco) antigen, respectively, were measured by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Interferon-gamma was the predominant cytokine induced by rOv-ASP-1. 77.3% of NHD anti-TT and 88.9% of c-HCV anti-HCVco responses were enhanced by rOv-ASP-1. The immunostimulant effect was dependent upon contact between CD56+ and CD56- fractions of PBMC. We have described a helminth-derived protein that can act as an immunostimulant for human recall responses in vitro to TT and, perhaps more importantly, HCV antigens in patients with chronic HCV infection. Our longer-term goal would be to boost anti-viral responses in chronic infections such as HCV.

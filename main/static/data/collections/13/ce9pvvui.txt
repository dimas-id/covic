BACKGROUND To explore the safety and feasibility of the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil) in laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS From December 2010 to June 2011, a total of 28 patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y-esophagojejunostomy anastomosis with OrVil. Perioperative treatments, intraoperative data, postoperative complications and hospital length of stay were evaluated. RESULTS There were no conversions to the open gastrectomy. The mean operation time was 143 minutes and the mean blood loss was 70 ml. Patients resumed an oral liquid diet on postoperative days 4 to 5. Two patients (7%) who suffered postoperative aspiration pneumonia were cured by conservative treatment. The median hospital length of stay was 9.6 days (8 to 11 days), with no inhospital mortalities. The median follow-up time was 14.8 months (12 to 18 months), and postoperative endoscopic examination revealed no anastomosis stenosis in patients who had dysphagia. CONCLUSION The use of the OrVil is technically feasible and relatively safe for Roux-en-Y reconstruction after laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy.

The pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 calls for global health emergency with wide prevalence across 94 countries, and around 3073 deaths reported in china on 7thMarch 2020 which created red alert zone in the country. It was further noticed other than China, countries like the republic of Korea ranked first with 6767 cases, Italy with 4747 and Iran with 3513 cases. The spread of COVID-19 made a historical transition between December 2019 to March 2020 by extending the paradigm to a newer territory every day with the highest predicted reproductive number &lt;2. Hence, while combating the epidemic spread, there are spectra of strategies that require crucial validation, some of which include drug repurposing, enzyme inhibition, target drug delivery etc. Among these, the category of drugs called enzyme inhibitors has a unique opportunity in the process of new drug discovery as these enzymes possess structural versatility starting from the host viral interface and up to the release of a new virus. Drugs entrapped within liposomes are highly effective against intracellular microorganisms as per published observations. Regulatory authorities like World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) strongly recommend the need for the PPEâ€™s like N95 respirator to avoid person to person contact. In this context, Electrospun Nanofiber Technology (ENT) offers ultrathin fibres (20-200nm) with close proximity of 99.97% of high efficient air filtration. Fabrication of ultrafine nano mask by utilizing electospun technology will surely benefit millions of people in a time-dependent manner.

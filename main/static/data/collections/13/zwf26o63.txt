I surveyed the coronavirus vaccine landscape in this post, and then detailed some of the larger efforts in the field here (several updates have been added to that one since its initial posting) Now it’s time to look at several programs that aren’t in either of those, but still have plenty of serious science behind them For an example of a relatively new technology that’s now in use for human patients, there’s the VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) platform, which was used to produce the Ebola vaccine now manufactured by Merck Stat has an excellent long-form article from earlier this year about how this came about, and it’s well worth a read, both for the history itself and as a look into the ups and downs of vaccine research in general The Yale team behind that one had developed a promising vaccine candidate for the SARS coronavirus during its epidemic, and they’re using those lessons in their current work If you look at that second link above on vaccine candidates, you will note that there are several using adenovirus vectors – this is conceptually the same sort of thing, but using a livestock virus (VSV) instead of human or primate-associated adenoviruses I don’t know if the Yale team has partnered with anyone yet, but I should also mention another connection of theirs, a spinoff company called CaroGen that has another engineered virus platform that is also being put to use against SARS-CoV-2 These projects are aiming at FDA approval for Phase I trials, but there’s no word yet on what such an application might go in

Identification of blue‐green cytoplasmic inclusions in neutrophils and/or monocytes on peripheral blood smears is a rare, and likely underreported, finding described in few case reports and small case series studies in critically ill patients with acute liver dysfunction and lactic acidosis (Courville, et al 2017, Gorup, et al 2018, Haberichter and Crisan 2017, Harris, et al 2009, Hodgkins and Jones 2019, Hodgson, et al 2015, Jazaerly and Gabali 2014, Patel, et al 2017, Sin, et al 2019, Soos, et al 2019, Vicente‐Steijn, et al 2020). As these inclusions are thought to herald poor prognosis and death shortly after identification, they have been referred to as “green crystals of death” or “critical green inclusions”.

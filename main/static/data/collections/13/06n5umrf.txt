Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in children has been difficult to diagnose, treat and study, due to atypical clinical presentation, imaging challenges and the rarity of large-vessel embolic occlusion as the etiology of acute neurological change in children. With endovascular thrombectomy showing success in randomized trials of adult AIS, the technique is increasingly being extrapolated to pediatric stroke. However, there is little evidence regarding the safety or efficacy of applying in children these devices developed and tested in adults. There is concern about a vessel-to-device size mismatch that may result in a different complication and benefit profile than typically seen. We report on the successful application in pediatric stroke of a newer-generation, smaller stent retriever, designed to be delivered through relatively smaller and more navigable microcatheters than the prior generation of this device.

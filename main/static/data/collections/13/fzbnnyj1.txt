Four new porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) isolates were genetically characterized. Subgenomic mRNA patterns and the nucleotide sequences of the 5' ends of the S genes, the open reading frame (ORF) 3/3a genes, and the ORF 3-1/3b genes of these PRCV isolates were determined and compared with those of other PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) isolates. The S, ORF 3/3a, and ORF 3-1/3b genes are under intense study because of their possible roles in determining tissue tropism and virulence. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of subgenomic mRNAs revealed that mRNA 2, which encodes for the S gene, of the PRCV isolates migrated faster than the mRNA 2 of TGEV. The PRCV isolates AR310 and LEPP produced eight subgenomic mRNA species, the same number as produced by the virulent Miller strain of TGEV. However, the PRCV isolates IA1894 and ISU-1 produced only seven subgenomic mRNA species. All four of the PRCV isolates were found to have a large in-frame deletion in the 5' end of the S gene; however, the size and location of the deletion varied. Analysis of the ORF 3/3a gene nucleotide sequences from the four PRCV isolates also showed a high degree of variability in this area. The ORF 3 gene of the PRCV isolates AR310 and LEPP was preceded by a CTAAAC leader RNA-binding site, and the ORF 3 gene was predicted to yield a protein of 72 amino acids, the same size as that of the virulent Miller strain of TGEV. The PRCV isolates AR310 and LEPP are the first PRCV isolates found to have an intact ORF 3 gene. The ORF 3a gene of the PRCV isolate IA1894 was preceded by a CTAAAC leader RNA-binding site and was predicted to yield a truncated protein of 54 amino acids due to a 23-nucleotide deletion. The CTAAAC leader RNA-binding site and ATG start codon of ORF 3 gene of the PRCV isolate ISU-1 were removed because of a 168-nucleotide deletion. Analysis of the ORF 3-1/3b gene nucleotide sequences from the four PRCV nucleotides isolates also showed variability.

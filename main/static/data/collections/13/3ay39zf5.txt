Immunosuppression and frequent comorbidities in transplant recipients potentially increase the risk of fatal outcomes of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. A 1965 born male had suffered from haemophilia A. In the nineteen-seventies, he acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, probably via factor VIII supplementation, and in 1985 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Interferon-based HCV therapy resulted in a sustained virological response. Antiviral treatment with emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide/rilpivirin for HIV is ongoing since 2016. HIV suppression with repeatedly negative PCR results has been achieved.

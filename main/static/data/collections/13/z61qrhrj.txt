The province of Bergamo in Italy and in particular Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital was one of the first areas to be hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and experience firsthand all the different phases of the crisis. We describe the timeline of the changes in overall urological workload during the outbreak period from lockdown to the slow reopening of activities. We sought to compare the 2020 hospital scenario with normality in the same period in 2019, highlighting the rationale behind decision-making when guidelines were not yet available. While we focus on the changes in surgical volumes for both elective (oncological and noncancer) and urgent cases, we have still to confront the risk of untreated and underdiagnosed patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: We present a snapshot of changes in urology during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in our hospital in Bergamo, Italy. The effect of medical lockdown on outcomes for untreated or underdiagnosed patients is still unknown.

Minimally invasive surgery is widely used in benign gynecologic diseases and may be used in malignancies. We performed a single-port access laparoscopy staging - bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and washing cytology - in a borderline ovarian tumor. The number of harvested pelvic lymph nodes were twenty-three and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Single-port access laparoscopic staging may be performed in selected patients. The efficacy, safety, and potential benefits of this technique should be evaluated in further trials.

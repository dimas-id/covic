World Health Organization characterized novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as world pandemic. This infection has been spreading alarmingly by causing huge social and economic disruption. In order to response quickly, the inhibitors already designed against different targets of previous human coronavirus infections will be a great starting point for anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this study, our approach integrates different ligand based drug design strategies of some in-house chemicals. The study design was composed of some major aspects: (a) classification QSAR based data mining of diverse SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitors, (b) QSAR based virtual screening (VS) to identify in-house molecules that could be effective against putative target SARS-CoV PLpro and (c) finally validation of hits through receptor-ligand interaction analysis. This approach could be used to aid in the process of COVID-19 drug discovery. It will introduce key concepts, set the stage for QSAR based screening of active molecules against putative SARS-CoV-2 PLpro enzyme. Moreover, the QSAR models reported here would be of further use to screen large database. This study will assume that the reader is approaching the field of QSAR and molecular docking based drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with little prior knowledge. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

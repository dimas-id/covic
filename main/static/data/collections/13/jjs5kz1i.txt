In selective patients with T4 non-small cell lung cancer with the primary tumor invading the mediastinal organs, extended lung resection may contribute to long-term survival. Adequate patients should be given a chance for surgery if complete resection and required reconstruction can be achieved. In this article, we report a 63-year-old male patient with T4 non-small cell lung cancer invading the left atrium. In the patient, we performed an extended left pneumonectomy with en bloc partial resection of the left atrium wall (4Ã—2.5 cm) where the defect was repaired with pericardial patch via cardiopulmonary bypass. No severe complication developed postoperatively. The patient who was given adjuvant chemotherapy has been living for more than 10 years without disease.

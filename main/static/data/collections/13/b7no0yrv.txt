Abstract One hundred avian Pasteurella multocida isolates recovered from cases of fowl cholera and related infections in England and Wales over a 13-year period were characterised by capsular PCR typing and analysis of outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles. Sixty-eight percent of the strains were of capsular type A, 14% were type F, 5% were type D, 4% were type B and 9% were untypable. Nineteen distinct OMP profiles (OMP-types) were identified based mainly on molecular mass heterogeneity of the heat-modifiable (OmpA) and porin (OmpH) proteins. Fifty-six percent of the isolates were represented by 15 OMP-types, whereas 44% of the isolates were associated with four OMP-types. The extensive molecular mass heterogeneity of the OmpA and OmpH proteins supports previous findings that avian P. multocida strains are very diverse. Furthermore, the isolates studied were associated with different clinical symptoms and were recovered from a wide range of lesions and tissues. The high degree of strain diversity together with the wide variety of clinical symptoms suggest that certain avian strains of P. multocida are opportunistic pathogens of relatively low virulence. Strains of capsular types B, D and F, as well as the untypable isolates, were associated exclusively with specific OMP-types and represent distinct and widely disseminated clonal groups. These observations support the view that avian strains of P. multocida have a clonal population structure. Based on previous studies, the molecular mass heterogeneity of the OmpA and OmpH proteins might provide a selective advantage to P. multocida by generating antigenic variation.

Abstract We recently characterized the interaction between the intraviral domains of envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of Puumala and Tula hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae). Herein we report a direct interaction between spike-forming glycoprotein and nucleic acid. We show that the envelope glycoprotein Gn of hantaviruses binds genomic RNA through its cytoplasmic tail (CT). The nucleic acid binding of Gn-CT is unspecific, as demonstrated by interactions with unrelated RNA and with single-stranded DNA. Peptide scan and protein deletions of Gn-CT mapped the nucleic acid binding to regions that overlap with the previously characterized N protein binding sites and demonstrated the carboxyl-terminal part of Gn-CT to be the most potent nucleic acid-binding site. We conclude that recognition of the RNP complex by the Gn-CT could be mediated by interactions with both genomic RNA and the N protein. This would provide the required selectivity for the genome packaging of hantaviruses.

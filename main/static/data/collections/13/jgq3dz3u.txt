Abstract Aim To compare the performances of molecular and non-molecular tests to diagnose respiratory viral infections and to evaluate the pros and contras of each technique. Methods Two hundred ninety-nine respiratory samples were prospectively explored using multiplex molecular techniques (FilmArray Respiratory Panel, Clart Pneumovir), immunological techniques (direct fluorescent assay, lateral flow chromatography) and cell cultures. Findings Molecular techniques permitted the recovery of up to 50% more respiratory pathogens in comparison to non-molecular methods. FilmArray detected at least 30% more pathogens than Clart Pneumovir which could be explained by the differences in their technical designs. The turnaround time under 2 hours for the FilmArray permitted delivery of results when patients were still in the emergency room.

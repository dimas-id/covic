To date, the entry pathway and replication mechanisms for members of the family Bunyaviridae, and especially for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), are poorly understood. Considering the severity of disease and the widespread geographical occurrence of CCHFV, investigating viral entry is of great value for development of antivirals. In this study, we have shown that knockdown of clathrin by small interfering RNA significantly reduced CCHFV nucleocapsid protein and viral RNA levels, suggesting that CCHFV utilizes clathrin-dependent endocytosis. In contrast, caveolin-1, an important constituent of caveolae endocytosis, is not important in CCHFV infection. Moreover, treatment with drugs that are known to interfere with the formation of clathrin-coated pits (sucrose and chlorpromazine) or endosome acidification (bafilomycin A1 and NH(4)Cl) also supported a clathrin-dependent pathway in the entry process of CCHFV. Finally, we demonstrated that cholesterol depletion in the cell plasma membrane significantly inhibited CCHFV infection. In the presence of exogenous cholesterol, this process was reversed, suggesting that cholesterol is important in the life cycle of CCHFV.

In order to restrain an uncontrolled spread of the 2019 Coronavirus-Disease (COVID-19) and to provide sufficient intensive-care unit (ICU) capacity, medical specializations needed to develop new routines and risk-strategy protocols. Those restrictions have also impacted the urologic community. Several medical organisations developed specific information-hubs, blogs and resource centers on how to tackle the COVID-19 situation (1-3). Although the German Society of Urology ("DGU") has published a recommendation to evaluate the need for a timely therapy in prostate cancer (PCa) patients according to D'Amico risk groups on the 2nd of April 2020, up to now no compulsory directives exist regarding omitting radical prostatectomy (RP) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

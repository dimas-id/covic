Advances are being made in understanding the pathogenesis, treatment outcomes and surveillance of Barrett oesophagus. Central obesity and age at onset of gastro-oesophageal reflux are being recognized as risk factors that have implications for screening. The persistent finding of nondysplastic Barrett oesophagus during surveillance is associated with low risk of malignant progression, whereas dysplastic Barrett oesophagus requires continued surveillance.

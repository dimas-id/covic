Abstract Complementary and alternative medicine, including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been used as therapy against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) for almost 30 years. Based on evaluation indicators for AIDS treatment using TCM, we discuss why the survival rate (which has been used widely in Western Medicine) should be adopted as a new important indicator of TCM treatment for AIDS. We advise that further prospective or retrospective cohort studies should be carried out to confirm this hypothesis.

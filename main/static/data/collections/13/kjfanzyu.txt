The level of automation in mechanical ventilation has been steadily increasing over the last few decades. There has recently been renewed interest in physiological closed-loop control of ventilation. The development of these systems has followed a similar path to that of manual clinical ventilation, starting with ensuring optimal gas exchange and shifting to the prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Systems currently aim to encompass both aspects, and early commercial systems are appearing. These developments remain unknown to many clinicians and, hence, limit their adoption into the clinical environment. This review shows the evolution of the physiological closed-loop control of mechanical ventilation.

Abstract In order to evaluate the impact of influenza-like illness and the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in children with oncohematological disease who have completed cancer therapy, 182 children with a diagnosis of oncohematological disease were divided into two subgroups on the basis of the length of time off therapy (<6 months or 6â€“24 months) and randomised 1:1 to receive influenza vaccination or not. The controls were 91 otherwise healthy children unvaccinated against influenza. The results show that the clinical and socioeconomic impact of influenza-like illnesses and the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in oncohematological children who have completed cancer therapy are related to the length of the off therapy period, and seem to be significantly greater in those who have been off therapy for less than 6 months in comparison with healthy controls. This suggests that the administration of influenza vaccination should be strongly recommended only among oncohematological children who have been off therapy for less than 6 months.

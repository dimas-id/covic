This review focuses on clinically important aspects of the etiology, diagnosis, and antimicrobial treatment of pharyngitis and pharyngotonsillitis. Most episodes of throat infection are of viral etiology, and accordingly are not susceptible to antimicrobial drugs currently available. By contrast, streptococcal and other varieties of bacterial pharyngitis do call for appropriate antimicrobial treatment. The review encompasses a discussion of clinical, bacteriological, and serological diagnosis; an algorithm for decision-making about antimicrobial treatment that is based on both clinical findings and culture results; and a summary of treatment regimens, emphasizing the management of streptococcal throat infection.

Patients undergoing pulmonary resection all exhibit, to some degree, a level of pulmonary dysfunction. This is due to the physiologic stress of the procedure performed, the patientâ€™s comorbidities, and preexisting cardiopulmonary reserve. Although prognostic factors for intensive care requirement exist, to date, there is no consensus for postoperative admission. Institutional practices vary across the country, with patients often admitted to intensive care for surveillance. Guidelines published from the American Thoracic Society in 1999 emphasize that admission to the ICU be reserved for those patients requiring care and monitoring for severe physiologic instability. Admissions following pulmonary resection are typically due to respiratory complications and are an independent predictor of mortality. The following chapter will review the indications for admission to the ICU and common issues encountered following pulmonary resection and conclude with a discussion of the management of patients undergoing pulmonary transplantation.

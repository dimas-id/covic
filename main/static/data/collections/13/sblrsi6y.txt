microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate many processes within a cell by manipulating protein levels through direct binding to mRNA and influencing translation efficiency, or mRNA abundance. Recent evidence demonstrates that miRNAs can also affect RNA virus replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus genome or through virus-mediated changes in the host transcriptome. Here, we review the current knowledge on the interaction between RNA viruses and cellular miRNAs. We also discuss how cell and tissue-specific expression of miRNAs can directly affect viral pathogenesis. Understanding the role of cellular miRNAs during viral infection may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms to block RNA virus replication or cell-specific regulation of viral vector targeting.

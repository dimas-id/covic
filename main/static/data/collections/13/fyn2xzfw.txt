Abstract Lung ultrasound examination has been demonstrated to be an accurate imaging method to detect pulmonary and pleural conditions. During pregnancy, there is a need for a rapid assessment of the maternal lung in patients suspected to have COVID-19. We report our experience on lung ultrasound examination in the diagnosis of Sars-Cov-2 pneumonia in a pregnant woman. Typical ultrasound features of this pulmonary pathology, including diffuse hyperechoic vertical artifacts with thickened pleural line and “white lung” with patchy distribution, were observed. We suggest point of care lung ultrasound examination as a diagnostic imaging tool in pregnant women with suspected COVID-19.

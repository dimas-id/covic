The health care industry and, more specifically, the perioperative setting have a 30-year history of acquiring a complete disposable habit. The fast-paced nature of perioperative nursing allows little time to contemplate the costs or impact of these practices; however, nurses are increasingly aware and concerned for their own safety and the safety of those who may be exposed to potential disease-causing materials. It seems to be the time to reconsider the benefits and liabilities of our practice habits. In the absence of definitive, conclusive, and compelling unbiased scientific evidence, we are directed by industry rather than by our own profession.

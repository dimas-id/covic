BACKGROUND Using tetrastarch for fluid resuscitation after a severe trauma injury may increase risks of death and acute kidney injury. The importance of tetrastarch dose, however, is unknown. METHODS A retrospective observational study was performed in two trauma centres using data on type and amount of fluids (balanced crystalloids or tetrastarch) used for pre- and acute in-hospital shock management. We evaluate independent associations between the relative and absolute volumes of tetrastarch and 90-day survival time or the frequency of severe acute kidney failure (AKF). RESULTS We studied 271 patients who had sustained a severe blunt trauma injury (average predicted mortality according to the Revised Injury Severity Classification Score (RISC) 15.1 ± 1.4% [mean, standard deviation]), and who had required more than 2 days of intensive care therapy. In all, 75.3% of patients had received tetrastarch with a crystalloid/colloid ratio of 2.93 ± 2.60. The 90-day mortality was 11.1%, and 7.8% of the patients developed severe AKF. After adjusting for confounders, we found a U-shaped, nonlinear association between absolute or relative volumes of tetrastarch and survival time (p = 0.003 and 0.025, respectively). Optimal relative volumes of tetrastarch approximately ranged from 20 to 30% of total fluids. Giving less than about 1000 ml, or more than about 2000 ml tetrastarch was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing severe AKF (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS There was a complex U‑shaped association between the tetrastarch dose and morbidity/mortality of patients after a severe trauma injury. The optimal crystalloid/tetrastarch ratio for acute shock management appears to range from about 2.5 to 4.0.

Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which can serve as a prototype for combating acts of bioterrorism, in the setting of a Hong Kong acute-care hospital. After overcoming the onslaught of SARS, the Hong Kong community has become aware that emerging infections can occur at any time. This is reinforced by the recent avian influenza outbreaks, which act as a reminder of this looming threat. Hospitals have to evaluate their levels of preparedness against bioterrorism, which can simulate infectious disease outbreaks. The priority areas for improvement include community involvement, staff education, improved information technology, disease surveillance, and additional equipment and staff. Multidimensional and flexible-response plans require strong leadership and clear directions to be effective, and such plans must also consider human frailties during great stress, when every resource is stretched to its utmost limit. The chapter concludes by discussing the various infection-control measures implemented in Hong Kong.

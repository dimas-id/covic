OBJECTIVE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery had been proven effective for appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and inguinal hernia repair. However, single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) in primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) has not been reported. METHODS We prospectively enrolled 30 PSP patients who received thoracoscopic surgery in the division of Thoracic Surgery of China Medical University Hospital. Ten patients received SITS and 20 patients received traditional three-port thoracoscopic surgery. The operative time, blood loss, wound size, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and patient satisfaction score were compared. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the operative time and blood loss between the two groups. However, the VAS pain scores were significantly better in the SITS group in first 24 hours after surgery. Patient satisfaction scores in the SITS group were also significantly better in the first 24 and 48 hours after operation. CONCLUSION Although three-port thoracoscopic surgery for PSP is well established, SITS results in better patient satisfaction and decreased postoperative pain in the treatment of PSP.

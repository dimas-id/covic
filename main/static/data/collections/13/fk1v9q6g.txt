The study was carried out in Sindh province of Pakistan to investigate productive and reproductive performance of ten local goat breeds. The ten goat breeds included in the study were Kamori, Tapri, Bugi-Turi, Pateri, Kachan, Jattan, Lohri, Chappar, Barri, and Thari. The data were collected using a detailed survey on various productive (birth weight, weaning weight, weaning age, average daily gain, milk yield and lactation length) and reproductive (age at first heat, age at first kidding, kidding interval, service period, number of services per conception and twinning percentage) traits of goats. Up sixteen local farmers of each breed were visited by the investigators and information was recorded/collected on prescribed performas. The highest birth weight was observed in Pateri goat (2.90 ± 0.11kg). In case of weaning weight maximum was observed in Kachan (16.0 ± 0.50kg) and lowest in Thari (11.19 ± 0.40 kg). Moreover weaning age was lowest in Thari (3.0 ± 0.11months) and highest was in Bugi-Turi (8.0 ± 0.14months). The highest milk yield was observed in Tapri and Kamori (~ 3.50 kg) followed by Pateri (~2.90 kg), Bugi Tori, Kacchan, Jattan (~ 2.00 kg) and Lohri, Chapper, Barri and Theri (~1 kg). As far as reproductive traits are concerned; age at first heat was lowest in Pateri (around 7 months) while all other breeds ranged from 11 to 15 months). The maximum twining percentage at first kidding was observed in Chappar (25%). Jattan had lowest kidding interval (5.0 ± 0.16 months). On the basis of overall average pre-weaning growth rate of kids, Tapri and Thari appear to have higher growth potential followed by Kamori and Kachhan. It could be concluded that Tapri, Thari and Kamori may be utilized for meat production under existing circumstances in the order of priority. Similarly, Tapri, Kamori and Pateri may be better utilized as dairy goats as well. [Image: see text]

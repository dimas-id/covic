Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a neglected tropical disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. The transmission cycle involves human (or other mammalian) water contact with surface water contaminated by faeces or urine, as well as specific freshwater snails acting as intermediate hosts. The main disease-causing species are S. haematobium, S. mansoni and S. japonicum. According to the World Health Organisation, over 250 million people are infected worldwide, leading to considerable morbidity and the estimated loss of 1.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a likely underestimated figure. Schistosomiasis is characterised by focal epidemiology and an over-dispersed population distribution, with higher infection rates in children. Complex immune mechanisms lead to the slow acquisition of immune resistance, but innate factors also play a part. Acute schistosomiasis, a feverish syndrome, is most evident in travellers following a primary infection. Chronic schistosomiasis affects mainly individuals with long-standing infections residing in poor rural areas. Immunopathological reactions against schistosome eggs trapped in host tissues lead to inflammatory and obstructive disease in the urinary system (S. haematobium) or intestinal disease, hepatosplenic inflammation and liver fibrosis (S. mansoni and S. japonicum). An effective drug—praziquantel—is available for treatment but, despite intensive efforts, no schistosomiasis vaccines have yet been accepted for public use. In this review, we briefly introduce the schistosome parasites and the immunopathogenic manifestations resulting from schistosomiasis. We then explore aspects of the immunology and host-parasite interplay in schistosome infections paying special attention to the current status of schistosomiasis vaccine development highlighting the advancement of a new controlled human challenge infection model for testing schistosomiasis vaccines.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to compare the feasibility and oncologic safety of Single-incision, gasless, Endoscopic trans-axillary bilateral Total thyroidectomy (SET) with open cervical total thyroidectomy in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). MATERIALS AND METHODS From March 2008 to December 2012, PTC patients underwent bilateral total thyroidectomy. Conventional, open surgery was performed on 538 patients (Group O) and endoscopic surgery was performed on 200 patients (Group E). We analyzed the patient's clinicopathologic, postoperative complications, and surgical completeness. RESULTS The mean ages of the patients were 48.9 ± 0.5 (range = 24-77) in Group O and 39.5 ± 0.8 (range = 17-73) in Group E with statistical significance (P < .001). Percentage of female patients were 74.3% in Group O and 96.0% in Group E with statistical significance (P < .001). The postoperative hospital stay in Group O was significantly longer than Group E (4.60 ± 0.05 versus 3.30 ± 0.05; P < .001). The operation time in Group E was significantly longer than Group O (93.9 ± 1.3 versus 142.6 ± 3.3; P < .001). More transient hypocalcemia was found in Group O compared to Group E with statistical significance (28.1% versus 22.4%; P < .001). There were no significant differences with respect to permanent hypocalcemia, permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, seroma, and hematoma. The mean 1 year-stimulated sTg was 0.23 ± 0.03 and 0.18 ± 0.02 in Group O and E, respectively. Tumor recurrence during short-term follow-up at neck ultrasonography (1 year) was detected in 4 patients in Group O. CONCLUSION SET is safe and effective, not only for low-risk patients with early-detected cancer, but also for selected cases of advanced cancer.

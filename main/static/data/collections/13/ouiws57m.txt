This paper presents a comparison between the electroencephalogram (EEG) channels during scoliosis correction surgeries. Surgeons use many hand tools and electronic devices that directly affect the EEG channels. These noises do not affect the EEG channels uniformly. This research provides a complete system to find the least affected channel by the noise. The presented system consists of five stages: filtering, wavelet decomposing (Level 4), processing the signal bands using four different criteria (mean, energy, entropy and standard deviation), finding the useful channel according to the criteria's value and, finally, generating a combinational signal from Channels 1 and 2. Experimentally, two channels of EEG data were recorded from six patients who underwent scoliosis correction surgeries in the Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (PPUKM) (the Medical center of National University of Malaysia). The combinational signal was tested by power spectral density, cross-correlation function and wavelet coherence. The experimental results show that the system-outputted EEG signals are neatly switched without any substantial changes in the consistency of EEG components. This paper provides an efficient procedure for analyzing EEG signals in order to avoid averaging the channels that lead to redistribution of the noise on both channels, reducing the dimensionality of the EEG features and preparing the best EEG stream for the classification and monitoring stage.

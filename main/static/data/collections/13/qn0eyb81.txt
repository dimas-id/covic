The novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. Taste and smell disorders have been reported along with various other clinical problems. In some studies (Fitzgerald, 2020; Machado & Gutierrez, 2020; Parma et al., 2020; Yan, Faraji, Prajapati, Boone, & DeConde, 2020), smell and taste disturbances have been reported in COVID‐19‐positive subjects, suggesting that chemosensory dysfunction should be considered when screening for this disease. In this manuscript, the possible influence of salivary gland dysfunction and hyposalivation in the chemosensory disorders observed in COVID‐19 patients is briefly discussed.

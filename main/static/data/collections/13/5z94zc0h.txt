Characterization of vessels distal from occluded site is important when considering endovascular revascularization therapy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke. The goal of this study was to assess the clinical value of intra-arterial contrasted high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography from the ascending aorta (Ao-CBCT) for visualization of the vessels distal from occluded site. Acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion who were to undergo EVT were evaluated. In EVT, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and Ao-CBCT were performed with local anesthesia. Ao-CBCT images were acquired in a 20-second rotational scan. Contrast medium was injected (1 mL/s for a total of 30 seconds using a 4-Fr catheter and an imaging delay of 10 seconds) from the ascending aorta. We assessed the image quality of Ao-CBCT and compared the visualization of the vessels distal from occluded site among magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), DSA and Ao-CBCT. We analyzed 14 patients (mean age, 66 years; three female patients). Stroke subtypes were cardiogenic (n = 6), atherothrombotic (n = 5) and others/unknown (n = 3). Occluded sites were middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 (n = 8), MCA M2 (n = 2), internal carotid artery (ICA) (n = 2), MCA M4 (n = 1) and basilar artery (BA) (n = 1). All obtained Ao-CBCT images successfully characterized the vessels distal from occluded site, and 11 images (79%) were excellent. In all cases, Ao-CBCT images could depict distal vessels with more detail when compared with MRA and DSA. Ao-CBCT is an efficient method to obtain detailed information regarding vessels distal from occluded site when compared with conventional examination methods.

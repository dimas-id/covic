PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The world is experiencing the evolving situation associated with the outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) virus, and there is more of need than ever for stress management and self-care. In this article, we will define the physiological, psychological and social aspects, stages, and components of stress reactions in the context of COVID-19, review the relevant literature on stress reactions, and offer some guidance on how to help patients mitigate the physiological and psychological impact of the pandemic through resilience-building techniques. RECENT FINDINGS: There is continued evidence that the fight or flight response involves activation throughout the body at physiological, biochemical and immune levels. This response can be mitigated through increasing parasympathetic nervous system activation as well as cognitive and behavioral interventions. SUMMARY: This article will review the stress, provide a theoretical layout to predict upcoming response, and offer clinicians some practical interventions to employ as the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

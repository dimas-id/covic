OBJECTIVE We compared the immediate surgical outcomes of single-port laparoscopic cystectomy (SLC) and conventional laparoscopic cystectomy (CLC) for managing ovarian dermoid cysts. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective case-control study was conducted to enroll 71 patients with dermoid cysts, including 34 patients in the SLC group and 37 patients in the CLC group. The outcome measures included operative time, blood loss, postoperative pain, analgesic use, and serum levels of hormones, including estrogen (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and anti-Mullerian hormone. RESULTS SLC was associated with less time required for specimen retrieval (1.3 ± 0.8 vs. 12.0 ± 3.4 minutes, p < 0.001), fewer ruptured bags (0% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.049), and less need of additional wound elongation (0% vs. 27.0%, p = 0.001) when respectively compared with CLC. Additionally, patients who underwent SLC reported lower postoperative lower abdominal pain and less accumulated postoperative analgesics when respectively compared with patients who underwent CLC. There was no significant difference of hormones between two groups. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated the feasibility of using the single-port method in place of CLC in the management of ovarian dermoid without increased difficulty of techniques or risk of ovarian damage.

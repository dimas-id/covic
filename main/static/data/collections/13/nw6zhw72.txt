OBJECTIVES Human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) is a highly seroprevalent virus that, following primary infection, establishes latency or persistence in some tissues, including lung. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HHV-7 in the lower respiratory tract of hospitalized adult patients. METHODS The prevalence of HHV-7 DNA was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in 212 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from 153 patients. The molecular epidemiology and clinical role of HHV-7 were evaluated. RESULTS HHV-7 DNA was positive in 44 of 212 specimens (20.7%), obtained from 40 of 153 patients (26.1%), in particular 22/68 (32.35%) and 18/86 (20.9%) in transplant and non-transplant patients, respectively (1 patient evaluated both before and after transplantation). No significant difference according to transplant condition or discharge diagnosis was found. Viral load was >100,000 genome equivalents/ml BAL in 6/22 (27.3%) transplant recipients and 4/18 (22.2%) non-transplant patients (p = n.s.). CONCLUSIONS The evaluation of HHV-7 DNA in BAL may be useful to investigate its potential role in lower respiratory tract infection, alone or in association with other viral and/or non-viral pathogens and to distinguish latency from reactivation.

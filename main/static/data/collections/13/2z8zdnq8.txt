A mathematical analysis of patterns for the evolution of COVID-19 cases is key to the development of reliable and robust predictive models potentially leading to efficient and effective governance against COVID-19. Towards this objective, we study and analyze the temporal growth pattern of COVID-19 infection and death counts in various states of India. Our analysis up to June 16, 2020 shows that several states (namely Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh) have reached t-squared power-law growth, while some others like Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh have reached linear growth. Karnataka and Kerala are exhibiting a second wave. In addition, we report that the death counts exhibit similar behavior as the infection counts. These observations indicate that Indian states are far from flattening their epidemic curves.

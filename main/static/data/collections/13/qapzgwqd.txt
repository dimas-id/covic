Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a causative agent of pig diarrhoea, has recently caused significant economic damage worldwide. Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) has been reported to be the receptor for PEDV, although robust evidence is lacking. In the present study, we explored whether pAPN functions as a receptor for PEDV. Human HeLa cells expressing pAPN and pAPN-positive porcine CPK cells failed to support PEDV infection, but were susceptible to infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which utilizes pAPN as a functional receptor. In contrast to TGEV, PEDV did not bind soluble porcine aminopeptidases (pAPs) and infection was not inhibited by the soluble form of pAPs. However, overexpression of pAPN in porcine CPK cells (CPK-pAPN cells) slightly increased the production of PEDV, and the increased replication in CPK-pAPN cells was inhibited by bestatin, an inhibitor of the protease activity of aminopeptidase N. These results suggest that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV, but promotes the infection of PEDV through its protease activity.

SUMMARY Three strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (064:KSNT, K88ac; 020:KSNT, K88ac and 08:K85ab, K99) originally cultured from outbreaks of diarrhoea in piglets a few hours old, were administered orally to gnotobiotic piglets. There was a marked age‐related difference in the clinical response to infection between the 3 strains although they all produced heat‐stable toxin. All 3 strains produced severe clinical signs of depression, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, followed by dehydration and death in one‐day‐old piglets. In piglets infected at 3 days of age the two K88+ ETEC caused diarrhoea and death but the K99+ ETEC induced moderate diarrhoea only. In piglets infected at 7 days of age, the 064 strain produced severe diarrhoea and death, the 020 strain caused mild diarrhoea in 3 of 6 piglets with one death while the 08 strain caused no illness. Pathological changes in the intestinal tract associated with these infections were minimal, or absent. Immunofluorescent staining with homologous hyperimmune sera demonstrated adherence of the 3 ETEC strains to the brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells. Fluorescing organisms were observed in all infected piglets irrespective of the severity of clinical signs but the degree and extent of colonisation varied with the age of the piglets and the infecting strain. This may explain the difference in clinical response between the 3 strains.

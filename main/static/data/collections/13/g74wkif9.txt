Acute renal failure remains a significant concern in all patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Management is particularly challenging in critically ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. Supportive care in the form of accurate volume correction and avoiding nephrotoxic agents are the chief cornerstone of the management of these patients. The pathophysiology of acute renal failure in COVID-19 is multifactorial, with significant contributions from excessive cytokine release. Gaining a better insight into the pathophysiology of renal failure will hopefully help develop more directed treatment options. A considerable number of these patients deteriorate despite adequate supportive care owing to the complexity of the disease and multi-organ involvement. Renal replacement therapy is used for a long time in critically ill septic patients who develop progressive renal failure despite adequate conservative support. Timing and choice of renal replacement therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains an area of future research that may help decrease mortality in this patient population.

This year marks 12 years of the world's first robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) program, the Vattikuti Institute Prostatectomy (VIP). Experience with more than 7000 cases has helped standardize the operation, minimize complications, and enhance functional outcomes. In this article, we discuss our current technique of VIP including refinements such as Veil of Aphrodite nerve sparing using Harmonic ACE curved shears, high anterior release (super Veil), extended pelvic lymph node dissection, percutaneous suprapubic tube bladder drainage, and barbed suture for the urethrovesical anastomosis. In 2012, incorporation of the GelPoint access platform has the potential to further improve the oncologic performance of VIP, especially in high-risk patients.

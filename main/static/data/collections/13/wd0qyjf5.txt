BACKGROUND This study examined the acute effect of intravenous S-nitroso human serum albumin (S-NO-HSA) infusion on overall hemodynamics and oxidative stress in a chronic left-to-right shunt-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension model with right ventricle (RV) failure. METHODS An aortocaval fistula (pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio [Qp/Qs] > 2.0) was surgically created in 50 male Wistar rats. After 10 weeks, they were randomly treated with S-NO-HSA (n = 20) or human serum albumin (HSA; n = 25) infusion (0.5 µmol/kg/h) for 60 minutes. A sham group (n = 10) received S-NO-HSA. RV contractility, RV-vascular coupling, and ventricular interdependence were assessed in vivo at different pre-loads by biventricular conductance catheters. Heart and lung biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of high-energy phosphates, oxidative stress (oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein expression. RESULTS S-NO-HSA, compared with HSA infusion, reduced RV afterload expressed by effective pulmonary arterial elastance (Ea; 0.49 ± 0.3 vs 1.2 ± 0.2 mm Hg/ml; p = 0.0005) and improved RV diastolic function (slope of end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship) as well as contractility indicated by slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Ees). Therefore an increase in efficiency of ventricular-vascular coupling (Ees/Ea) occurred after S-NO-HSA (0.35 ± 0.17 to 0.94 ± 0.21; p = 0.005), but not HSA infusion, leading to positive effect on ventricular interdependence with increased left ventricular stroke volume (56% ± 4% vs 19% ± 5%; p = 0.0013). S-NO-HSA, compared with HSA, treatment improved adenosine 5'-triphosphate (13.9 ± 1.1 vs 7.0 ± 1.8 µmol/g protein) and phosphocreatine (5.9 ± 3.3 vs 1.9 ± 0.6 µmol/g protein; p = 0.01) RV content and decreased the tissue oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione ratio (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS S-NO-HSA reduces pulmonary hypertension and improves RV systolic and diastolic function and RV-arterial coupling, with a positive effect on ventricular interdependence by increasing energetic reserve and reducing oxidative stress.

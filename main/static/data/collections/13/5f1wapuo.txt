In this paper I review diseases reported in both captive and free-ranging wapiti in western North America, with some reference to diseases in captive red deer in Great Britain, Europe, New Zealand, and eastern North America.With the exception of coronavirus in neonates, few viral agents are reported to cause serious disease losses in wapiti in North America at this time. Bacterial diseases of current significance include brucellosis (focus in Wyoming), clostridial diseases, coliform enteritis of neonates, pasteurellosis, and necrobacillosis. The endoparasites most likely to be seen causing lesions in wapiti of western North America are lungworm (Dictyocaulus viviparus), arterial worm (Elaeophora schneideri), and, possibly, liver fluke (Fascioloides magna). Ectoparasites of importance to wapiti are Psoroptes cervinus and Dermacentor albipictus. Nutritional diseases are not covered in this review.

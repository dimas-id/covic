The haemagglutinating ability of three strains of IBV was investigated. It was shown that whereas strain Beaudette had no detectable haemagglutinin, both Connecticut and Massachusetts agglutinated red cells of various species. The haemagglutinin of Connecticut was detectable after sucrose gradient purification whereas that of Massachusetts required both the purification step and incubation with the enzyme phospholipase C to reveal it. The agglutination could be inhibited by specific antisera. Some studies on the nature of the red cell receptor, and the possible presence of a receptor destroying enzyme, are reported.

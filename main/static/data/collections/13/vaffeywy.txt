PURPOSE This study aimed to establish the role of risk factors in the etiology of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS Between September 2001 and March 2008, 1040 patients underwent isolated CABG at our clinic. Nine hundred and eleven of these patients did not have any AF(Non-AF Group) and the other one hundred and twenty-nine had AF (AF Group). A retrospective study was performed for patient, disease and treatment related factors and multivariate analysis was used to identify independent clinical predictors of postoperative AF. RESULTS Postoperative AF was identified in 129 (12.4%) of the patients, and those were significantly older and had significantly higher additive EuroSCORE score as compared with patients without AF. During the postoperative course, patients with postoperative AF also had significantly higher and prolonged (â‰¥6 hours) mechanical ventilation time, longer and prolonged intensive care unit stay and longer hospital stay. Logistic regression analysis revealed that postoperative AF development ratio was 1.690 times higher when the ventilation time was over 6 hours (OR 1.690, 95% CI 1.092-2.615, p = 0.018); 1.240 times higher in the presence of elevated additive EuroSCORE score (OR 1.240, 95% CI1.109-1.385, p = 0.0001); 1.052 times higher in the presence of advanced age (OR 1.052,95% CI 1.031-1.0741, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION Analysis of our data reveals that, patient's age, additive EuroSCORE score, and prolonged ventilation are predictors of postoperative AF. Identification of risk factors might lead to better prevention of this problem and its potential consequences. However, to support our investigation and obtain more reliable evidence, prospective randomized controlled trials are needed.

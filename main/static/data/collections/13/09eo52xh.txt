PURPOSE The adaptations induced by endurance training on the neuromuscular function remain under investigation and, for methodological reasons, unclear. This study investigates the effects of cycling training on neuromuscular fatigue and its peripheral contribution measured during and immediately after cycling exercise. METHODS Fourteen healthy men performed a fatigue test before a 9-week cycling program (PRE) and two tests after training: at the same absolute power output as PRE (POSTABS) and based on the post-training maximal aerobic power (POSTREL). Throughout the tests and at exhaustion (EXH), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and peripheral fatigue were assessed in the quadriceps muscle by electrical nerve stimulation [single twitch (Pt); high-frequency doublet (Db100) and low-to-high-frequency ratio (Db10:100)]. RESULTS Time to EXH was longer in POSTABS than PRE (34 ± 5 vs. 27 ± 4 min, P < 0.001), and POSTREL tended to be longer than PRE (30 ± 6 min, P = 0.053). MVC and peripheral fatigue were overall less depressed in POSTABS than PRE at isotime. At EXH, MVC and Db10:100 were similarly reduced in all sessions (-37 to - 42% and - 30 to - 37%, respectively). Db100 tended to be less depressed in POSTABS than PRE (-40 ± 9 vs. - 48 ± 16%, P = 0.050) and in POSTREL than PRE (-39 ± 9%, P = 0.071). Pt decreased similarly in POSTABS and PRE (-52 ± 16 vs. - 54 ± 16%), but POSTREL tended to be less depressed than PRE (-48 ± 14%, P = 0.075). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms fatigue attenuation at isotime after training. Yet lower or similar fatigue at EXH indicates that, unlike previously suggested, fatigue tolerance may not be upregulated after 9 weeks of cycling training.

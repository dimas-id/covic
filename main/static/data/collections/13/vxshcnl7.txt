The challenge of deploying mission critical services upon virtualised shared network models is the allocation of both radio and cloud resources to the critical actors who require prioritized and high-quality services. This paper describes the design and deployment of an intelligent orchestration cycle to manage end-to-end slices on a NFV architecture. This novel tool includes the monitoring of the network elements at different levels and the processing of the gathered data to produce the corresponding alert mitigation actions.

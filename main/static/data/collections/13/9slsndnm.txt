BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) were at the frontline during the battle against coronavirus. Understanding and managing their fears and anxieties may hold lessons for handling future outbreaks. However, the experiences and perceptions risk of HCWs from coronavirus still remains to be controversial. Thus, the objective of this review is to identify, appraise, and synthesize available evidence related to the experiences and perceptions of risk of HCWs from coronavirus. METHODS: The studies were gathered from PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CBMdisc, CNKI, WKSP, CSJFT, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO, along with several sources of gray literature. The retrieval of full-text studies, data extraction, and quality assessment of the included studies will be independently conducted by 2 reviewers. The meta-aggregative will be used for findings pooling and a summary of ConQual findings tables will be presented in future. RESULTS: This study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION: The literature will provide a high-quality analysis of the current evidence to assess the experiences and perceptions risk of health-care workers from coronavirus.

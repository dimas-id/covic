Due to its borderless nature, COVID-19 has been a matter of common European interest since its very first detection on the continent. Yet this pandemic outbreak has largely been handled as an essentially national matter. Member States adopted their own different, uncoordinated and at times competing national responses according to their distinctive risk analysis frameworks, with little regard for the scientific and management advice provided by the European Union (EU), notably its dedicated legal framework for action on cross-border health threats. To justify such an outcome as the inevitable consequence of the EUâ€™s limited competence in public health is a well-rehearsed yet largely inaccurate argument that calls for closer scrutiny.

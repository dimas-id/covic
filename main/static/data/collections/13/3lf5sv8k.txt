Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) is emerging as a viable minimally invasive surgical technique for small renal tumors. The warm ischemia time (WIT) during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy has been reduced using an early unclamping (EU) technique. We present our technique of EU technique in RAPN. From November 2009 to June 2010, 12 consecutive RAPNs were performed by a single surgeon (A.W.) using EU technique. The median operative time was 227 minutes (176-315); median WIT, 16 minutes (11-25). Median estimated blood loss was 150 mL (50-500) and length of stay 2 days. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. RAPN using EU technique is a safe and feasible option in experienced hands, allowing for a shorter WIT without increasing blood loss. This approach requires a highly skilled bedside assistant who is imminently familiar with the robotic system and advanced laparoscopic techniques.

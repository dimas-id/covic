Abstract In this study, we found that 74 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) exhibited a rapid, dramatic decrease in numbers of circulating myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDCs and pDCs) during the first 2 weeks of illness (5.3- and 28.4-fold reductions for mDCs and pDCs compared with 25 healthy individuals, respectively), with slow return to normal cell numbers during convalescence (weeks 5â€“7 of illness on average). In addition, numbers of circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited milder reductions (2.1- and 1.8-fold at week 1) and earlier return to normal at a mean of weeks 3 and 4, respectively. A significant inverse correlation was found between numbers of DC and T-cell subsets and high-dose steroid treatment. Our novel findings thus suggest that the acute SARS-coronavirus infection probably contributes to the initial reduction of DC and T-cell subsets in blood, and that high-dose steroid administration may subsequently exacerbate and prolong low expression of the cell subsets. These findings will aid the framing of further studies of the immunopathogenesis of SARS.

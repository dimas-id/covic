Infection with Varicella zoster virus (VZV) usually occurs in children up to 15 years with mild symptoms. We present a case of a 22-year old man with a fatal varicella zoster infection. He developed fulminant hepatitis with acute liver failure and an acute respiratory distress syndrom (ARDS). In this article the general aspects of VZV infection are discussed. Treatment options and previous publications are reviewed.

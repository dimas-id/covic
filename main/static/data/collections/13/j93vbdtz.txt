A 52-year-old patient with SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and treated with darunavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). After LMWH cessation, he developed superior mesenteric arterial thrombosis. An abdominal CT scan showed arterial thrombosis of vessels efferent of the superior mesenteric artery with bowel distension. COVID-19 may predispose to venous and arterial thromboembolism. Anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and potential thromboembolism investigated in each symptomatic patient affected by SARS-CoV-2. LEARNING POINTS: Potential thromboembolism must be investigated in each symptomatic patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The preventive and therapeutic use of antithrombotic agents should be strongly considered in order to mitigate thrombotic and haemorrhagic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening condition usually related to a pathology of the bronchial arteries. Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms represent a relatively rare cause of severe airway bleeding, but are associated with a mortality rate of over 50%. A case of massive intraoperative hemoptysis treated with temporary occlusion of the right pulmonary artery and delayed endovascular occlusion of the feeding segmental artery is described.

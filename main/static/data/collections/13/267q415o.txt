We isolated and characterized 10 microsatellite loci in the western long‐fingered bat, Miniopterus magnater. These loci were tested on 48 individuals from Anhui Province of China, and all loci were highly polymorphic. The mean number of observed alleles per locus was 13.6 (range from six to 27). Observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.364 to 0.957, and from 0.676 to 0.951, respectively. After Bonferroni correction, four loci deviated significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. No pairs of loci were in linkage disequilibrium. These polymorphic markers will be used to examine population structure and genetic diversity in this species.

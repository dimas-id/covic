We evaluated the effect of school closure on the occurrence of respiratory infection among children ages 6-12 years and its impact on health care services. During this period, there were significant decreases in the diagnoses of respiratory infections (42%), visits to physician (28%) and emergency departments (28%) and medication purchases (35%). The present study provides quantitative data to support school closure during an influenza pandemic.

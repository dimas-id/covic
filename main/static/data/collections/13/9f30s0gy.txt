Abstract To determine whether transcriptional levels of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) genes are differentially regulated between a first infection with Aeromonas hydrophila and a re-infection, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed in this study using anterior kidney cDNA after the re-infection as tester. Of the 96 clones isolated from the SSH library, 28 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained, of which eight were confirmed to be slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) more up-regulated by the re-infection at 6 h post infection (hpi). Expression kinetics studies at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi revealed that the eight ESTs were significantly (P = 0.016) more up-regulated by the first infection, with a major peak at 3 hpi. A total of 96 genes reported in literature to be up-regulated by bacterial infections were selected and subjected to expression analysis at 3 hpi. Of the 96 selected genes, 19 were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) induced by A. hydrophila after the first infection and the re-infection. The 19 genes belonged to the following five main categories: 1) toll-like receptor (TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR21); 2) antimicrobial peptide (NK-lysin type 1, NK-lysin type 2, NK-lysin type 3, cathepsin D, transferrin, hepcidin); 3) cytokine or chemokine (interleukin-1β, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor α, chemokine CXCL-10); 4) signaling proteins (cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, very large inducible GTPase 1, arginine deiminase type 2, lymphokine-activated killer T-cell originated protein kinase); 5) lysozyme (lysozyme c). Overall, the total 27 genes (8 ESTs plus the 19 selected genes) were significantly (P < 0.001) more induced by the first infection. Peaked expression of lysozyme c and serum lysozyme activity after the first infection were seen at 24 hpi, whereas that after the re-infection were seen at 12 hpi, suggesting that both innate and adaptive immunity were involved in the defense against the re-infection of A. hydrophila.

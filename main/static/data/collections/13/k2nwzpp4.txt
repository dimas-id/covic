A wide range of viruses affect the respiratory tract of transplant recipients, including adenovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus. Prospective studies using contemporary diagnostic techniques have recently improved our understanding of the epidemiology and importance of these respiratory viruses among transplant recipients. From these studies, rhinovirus, in particular, has been shown to be one of the most common causes of infection in stem cell and lung transplant recipients. In addition to epidemiological data, recent studies have also advanced our understanding of management of influenza, adenovirus, and RSV infections among transplant recipients.

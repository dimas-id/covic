INTRODUCTION Increased life expectancy results in a rapid increase of nonagenarian patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by large vessel occlusion (LVO). We conducted this study to assess the efficacy and safety of endovascular thrombectomy (ET) in this age group with use of imaging-based selection. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data from 2 different comprehensive stroke centers and compared the outcomes of ET versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone among eligible nonagenarians with LVO in anterior circulation and evidence of salvageable tissue on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS A total of 617 patients of AIS had been treated with IVT or ET, including 23 eligible nonagenarians. Among these, 9 patients were treated with IVT alone (IVT group) and 14 patients received ET group. Notably, the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates were significantly lower after ET than after IVT (European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study II criteria, 0 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.047; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria, 7.1 vs. 66.7%; p = 0.005). Moreover, although there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups on efficacy, ET tended to lead to greater early neurologic recovery at discharge (71.4 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.102) and improve functional outcome at 90 days (71.4 vs. 44.4%, p = 0.383), respectively. CONCLUSION By using MRI-based selection, ET in nonagenarians with AIS caused by LVO within anterior circulation was safe and may lead to improve early neurologic recovery and functional independence at 90 days, as compared with IVT alone. Randomized trial in larger sample size testing efficacy of ET using diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid attenuated inversion recovery mismatch selection in this age group appears feasible.

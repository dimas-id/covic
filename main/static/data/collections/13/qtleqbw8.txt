This study further elucidates the roles of selected chemokines (IP-10, MIG, and RANTES) and their receptors (CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR3) in asthma. We compared their profiles in six groups of participants-atopic cohort and nonatopic cohort (each including controls and asthmatic patients with or without steroid therapy). Plasma concentration of IP-10 was significantly lower while that of RANTES and the expression of CCR3 were higher in asthmatic patients (all p < 0.05). Plasma RANTES correlated positively with the GINA severity score in all asthmatic patients (r=0.27, p < 0.05), and with IL-13 in nonatopic asthmatic patients (r=0.46, p < 0.05). In asthmatic patients, the ex vivo release of IP-10 and MIG was attenuated in PBMC activated with allergen, mitogens and IL-18 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, plasma RANTES may be a surrogate marker for asthma and the diminished Th1 related CXC chemokine production may contribute to Th2 predominance in asthma.

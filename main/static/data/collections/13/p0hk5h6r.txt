OBJECTIVE To determine the acceptability, to women, of wearing a portable fetal electrocardiogram recording device at different stages of pregnancy and to gain insight into their experience of its use for long-periods of monitoring of small-for-gestational fetuses in the home environment. METHODS A qualitative study using both a questionnaire and focus group involving women with singleton pregnancy >24 weeks gestation, no evidence of fetal malformation and an estimated fetal weight below 10th gestational centile on ultrasound scan. Fetal heart rate recordings were collected for up to 20 h. RESULTS In total, 59 questionnaires were completed; 35 after wearing the monitor for the first time and an additional 24 from the women who wore the device for a second time. Six women participated in the focus group; the principal theme identified related to the practicality of the fetal electrocardiogram device. Other themes identified were the discomfort that resulted from wearing the monitor and the reassurance provided in knowing that the baby's heart rate was being monitored. CONCLUSION Long-term ambulatory fetal electrocardiogram monitoring is an acceptable method of monitoring small-for-gestational fetuses. Overall, women concluded that benefits of wearing the device outweighed any discomfort it caused.

BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in postoperative complications have been demonstrated in bariatric surgery, yet the relationship of race to complication severity is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: Adult laparoscopic primary bariatric procedures were queried from the 2015 and 2016 MBSAQIP registry. Adjusted logistic and multinomial regressions were used to examine the relationships between race and 30-day complications categorized by the Clavien-Dindo grading system. RESULTS: A total of 212,970 patients were included in the regression analyses. For Black patients, readmissions were higher (OR = 1.39, p < 0.0001) and the odds of a Grade 1, 3, 4, or 5 complication were increased compared with White patients (OR = 1.21, p < 0.0001; OR = 1.21, p < 0.0001; OR = 1.22, p = 0.01; and OR = 1.43, p = 0.04) respectively. The odds of a Grade 3 complication for Hispanic patients were higher compared with White patients (OR = 1.59, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Black patients have higher odds of readmission and multiple grades of complications (including death) compared with White patients. Hispanic patients have higher odds of a Grade 3 complication compared with White patients. No significant differences were found with other races. Specific causes of these disparities are beyond the limitations of the dataset and stand as a topic for future inquiry.

BACKGROUND Stapled haemorrhoidectomy has been performed with different techniques and staplers. We review our initial experience with the new DST EEA 33 stapler and neu@ anoscope. METHODS A review of all patients who underwent stapled haemorrhoidectomy using the DST EEA 33 over a 14-month period was conducted. Short-term outcomes of bleeding, pain and retention of urine requiring admission or strictures requiring surgical intervention were studied. RESULTS There were 1,118 patients operated from August 2007 to October 2008. The median age was 46-year-old (20-82 years) and 51% were females. The median operating time was 15 min (range 5-45 min), and median follow-up was 7 months (range 3-16 months). There were 26 patients (2.3%) who were admitted for inability to pass urine and 20 required catheterisation. Fifty-two patients (4.6%) were admitted for post-operative bleeding. In 32 cases the bleeding stopped spontaneously, while 19 patients required adrenaline injection and packing for hemostasis. Only one patient required surgical hemostasis. Thirty-three patients (2.9%) were admitted for post-operative pain and stayed for a median of 1 day (range 1-4 days). There were 14 patients (1.2%) who developed anorectal strictures requiring surgical intervention. All underwent anoplasty at a median of 3 months post-operatively (range 2-5 months), with good result. There were no recurrent haemorrhoids during follow-up. CONCLUSION Stapled haemorrhoidectomy using the DST EEA 33 stapler is safe. The neu@ anoscope provides good visibility and handling, and is a useful tool in this procedure.

This article describes the investigation of a calf pneumonia outbreak in a dairy herd and the practical steps taken to treat sick animals, as well as improve overall calf management. High levels of morbidity meant a blanket treatment approach with antibiotics and NSAIDs was taken for all calves. Key management changes were made in calving pens, colostrum management was improved, changes to ventilation in calf sheds were made, and a protocol for feeding calves was drawn up.

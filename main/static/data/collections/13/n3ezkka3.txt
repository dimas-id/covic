BACKGROUND The novel SARS-CoV-2 caused a large number of infections and deaths worldwide. Thus, new ideas for an appropriated assessment of patients' condition and clinical treatment are of utmost importance. Therefore, in this study, the laboratory parameters of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were evaluated to identify the correlation between cytokine expression and other laboratory parameters. METHODS A retrospective and single-center study was performed in Wuhan, involving 83 severe or critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory parameters in ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV2 were collected. The association between parameters was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS Patients' median age was 66 years (IQR, 57-73), and 55 (66%) were men. Among the 83 patients, 61 (73%) had 1 or more coexisting medical condition. The median concentration of IL-2R, IL-6, IL8, IL10, and TNFα were above the normal range, without IL-1β. A significant negative correlation between IL-6 and platelet count was discovered (r2 = -0.448, P<0.001) as well as a significant correlation between IL-6 and other platelet parameters. Finally, a correlation between multiple cytokines and coagulation indicators was found, pro-inflammatory factors were found to be more associated to coagulation parameters, with the highest correlation between IL-6 and the International normalized ratio (INR) (r2=0.444, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggested that cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, IL-6 seems more relevant in the evaluation of the condition of COVID-19 patients.

PURPOSE Optimal management of extracranial carotid artery dissections (eCAD) in pediatric patients is not well documented, and endovascular interventions are rarely reported. METHODS A 10-year-old girl sustained multiple systemic injuries in a motor vehicle accident, including an eCAD with pseudoaneurysm. She initially failed both aspirin and endovascular stenting with progressive enlargement of a traumatic cervical carotid pseudoaneurysm and stenosis. RESULTS Second-stage endovascular stent placement with coiling resulted in successful occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm. At 30-month imaging follow-up, the parent vessel remained patent with no evidence of the pseudoaneurysm. CONCLUSION In the setting of poly-trauma, management of eCAD can be complex especially in the pediatric population. There is little data on the endovascular treatment of eCAD in children. Failed endovascular therapies are extremely rare. Our report supports surveillance imaging as repeat endovascular treatment may be necessary.

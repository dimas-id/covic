BACKGROUND Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) has become the latest minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic technique due to its characteristics, e.g., non-invasion, accuracy, real-time positioning. In this study, we investigated the application of ENB biopsy combined with Massage staining in the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPL). METHODS The clinical data of 15 PPL patients undergoing ENB biopsy plus Massage staining between August 2017 and January 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, there were 12 male and 3 female, and the mean age was (51.3±2.1) years old. RESULTS The diameter of PPLs ranged from 6 mm to 36 mm (mean: 14.0 mm). The successful biopsy rate was 66.7%. All patients successfully underwent Massage staining. The distance between the centers of staining and lesion was (1.0±0.4) cm, and the diameter of staining was (2.8±0.6) cm. The mean operation time was (26.7±5.3 ) min, and the mean blood loss during surgery was (3.3±1.5) mL. There was no pneumothorax, hemothorax and pulmonary vascular injury during the procedure. CONCLUSIONS The ENB biopsy plus Massage staining technique caused very few complications, and provided high precision, which warrants further application.

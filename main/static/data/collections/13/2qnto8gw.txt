BACKGROUND Alarms have been raised that COVID-19 may disproportionately affect certain populations with substance use disorders, particularly Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), however warnings have largely focused on social risks such as reduced availability of services. Objectives: This commentary highlights three plausible biological mechanisms for potentially worsened outcomes in patients with OUD who contract COVID-19. Results: Opioid-related respiratory depression may amplify risks of hypoxemia from COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Complex opioid immune modulation may impact host response to COVID-19, though the effect direction and clinical significance are unclear. Drug-drug interactions may affect individuals with OUD who are co-administered medications for OUD and medications for COVID-19, particularly due to cardiac adverse effects. Conclusions/Importance: There are plausible biological mechanisms for potentially worsened outcomes in patients with OUD who contract COVID-19; these mechanisms require further study, and should be considered in individuals with OUD.

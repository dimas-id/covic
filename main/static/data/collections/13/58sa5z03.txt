Aim: HIV-infected patients risk coinfection with HBV and HCV. This study aimed to investigate molecular epidemiology of HBV and HCV coinfection in Iranian HIV-infected individuals. Materials & methods: In this cross-sectional study, serological markers of HBV and HCV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis B e-antigen [HBeAg], hepatitis B e-antibody [HBeAb] and hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]) and anti-HCV antibodies [anti-HCV Abs] were tested in 198 Iranian HIV-infected patients. From plasma, HBV viral load was determined using COBAS TaqMan 48, and HCV-RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-nested PCR. Results: 85 out of 198 (42.9%) patients were anti-HCV Ab positive and 42/198 (21.2%) had detectable HCV-RNA. Eight (4.0%) had traceable HBV-DNA. All these patients were infected by HBV genotype D. 55 (27.8%) were HBcAb positive. Nine (4.4%) were HBsAg and anti-HCV Ab positive. Conclusion: None were HIV-RNA/HCV-RNA/HBV-DNA positive, 21.2% were HIV-RNA/HCV-RNA positive and 4.0% were HIV-RNA/HBV-DNA positive. Therefore, studies on diagnosing these infections in HIV-infected individuals may be valuable.

Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) and chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) are well-known causes of repeated gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is the most common endoscopic therapy used, but some patients need multiple APC sessions. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recently used in GAVE and CRP treatment with promising results. In this case series, we analyzed data for 15 patients with GAVE and 5 patients with CRP that had multiple prior APC treatment. They were treated with RFA HALO 90 catheter (HALO90 Ablation Catheter System; Covidien, GI Solutions, Sunnyvale, CA) in our tertiary referral center. A total of 20 patients received 32 RFA procedures (8 in the CRP group and 24 in the GAVE group). The median number of the procedures was 2 (range 1-4). The hemoglobin levels in the GAVE group were 83 g/L pre-RFA and 98 g/L post-RFA and in the CRP group, 86 g/L pre-RFA and 103 g/L post-RFA. A total of 16/20 patients (80%) were transfusion-free after the completion of RFA treatment. Technical success of the treatment was 95% (19/20 patients). RFA can be safely and successfully used in APC refractory GAVE and CRP patients.

OBJECTIVE To apply online surveying to assess the general physical and mental well-being of obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs) working in COVID-19 designated hospitals in Turkey. METHODS A prospective survey-based study using an online survey platform. Three hundred participants working at COVID-19 designated hospitals in Turkey identified from a hospital database were sent a link to the survey by email between April 29 and May 20, 2020. RESULTS A total of 253 OB/GYNs (31 consultants and 222 residents) completed the survey, for a response rate of 84.3%. Of respondents, 191 (76.4%) were anxious about coming into contact with pregnant women infected with COVID-19. 74.4% stated that they were afraid of getting sick. 64.8% reported that they had fallen into despair at times because of the pandemic. 66.5% stated that their family lives were affected. 72.4% started living separately from their families because of the pandemic. CONCLUSION Despite the difficulties in patient care during the pandemic, OB/GYNs continued providing for their patients, which reflected positively on their perceptions of the profession. The importance of trust in the national healthcare system, presence of adequate PPE, finding a suitable coping mechanism, and family support were essential for Turkish OB/GYNs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

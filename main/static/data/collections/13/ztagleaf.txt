Compared with supine positioning, head-up positioning improves preoxygenation and prolongs the time to oxygen desaturation. We reevaluated benefits of head-up positioning using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with pulse oximetry in a pig model. Six pigs (mean ± SD weight: 25.3 ± 0.6 kg) were anesthetized with isoflurane and evaluated in four positions—supine, head-up, head-down, head-up to supine—just before apnea (positions’ order after “supine” was randomized). In each position, after 5 min of preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, apnea was induced and the time to SpO(2) < 70% measured. Hemodynamic and blood-gas variables and the cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were evaluated using NIRS and recorded. Hypovolemia was induced by collecting 600 mL blood. Apnea experiment was performed again in each position. The times (seconds) ± SD to SpO(2) < 70% were 108 ± 13 (supine), 138 ± 15 (head-up; P < 0.0001 vs all other positions); 101 ± 12 (head-down) and 106 ± 15 (head-up to supine) during normovolemia, and 110 ± 29, 120 ± 7 (not significant vs all other positions), 101 ± 16, and 106 ± 11, respectively, during hypovolemia. Although the TOI was not associated with the positions during normovolemia, the head-up position during hypovolemia decreased TOI from 62% ± 6% (supine) to 50% ± 9% (head-up; P = 0.0019) before preoxygenation, and it remained low during apnea. The head-up position improves preoxygenation, but repositioning to supine negates the benefits. Head-up positioning during evident hypovolemia should be avoided because the cerebral oxygenation could decrease.

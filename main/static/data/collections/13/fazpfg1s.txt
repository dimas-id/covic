Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has been emerging in several swine-producing countries for years. In our study, 719 porcine diarrhoea samples from 18 provinces in China were collected for PDCoV and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) detection. The epidemiological survey revealed that the positive rates of PDCoV, PEDV and coinfection were 13.07%, 36.72% and 4.73%, respectively. The entire spike (S) genes of eleven detected PDCoV strains were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the majority of PDCoVs could be divided into three lineages: the China lineage, the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage and the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage. The China and the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineages showed much greater genetic divergences than the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage. The present study detected one new monophyletic branch that contained three PDCoVs from China, and this branch was separated from the China lineage but closely related to the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage. The strain CH-HA2-2017, which belongs to this new branch, had a possible recombination event between positions 27 and 1234. Significant amino acid substitutions of PDCoV S proteins were analysed and displayed with a three-dimensional cartoon diagram. The visual spatial location of these substitutions gave a conformational-based reference for further studies on the significance of critical sites on the PDCoV S protein.

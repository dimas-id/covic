Regular physical activity grants significant health effects and lowers the risk of premature death for all causes, in particular cardiovascular ones in asymptomatic subjects. Physical activity is useful in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and lung diseases, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, cancer and depression. Recent studies correlate inactivity with chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity, at the origin of chronic non-communicable diseases. The evidence must be taken seriously into consideration in this particular CoViD-19 emergency period and long-term effects of prolonged limitation of sports activity must not be overlooked. Contagion in open places is very difficult and the absolute prohibition of sports activities in open places and the closure of parks are creating discomfort and confusion. Institutions and media are generating the wrong message that active people must be looked at with disapproval. Instead, this habit should be encouraged, in order to protect citizens' and community health, lightening the welfare load for society.

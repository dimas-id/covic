We found the publication on "COVID-19 Related School Closings and Risk of Weight Gain Among Children" to be interesting.1 Rundle et al. noted that "we anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely double out-of-school time this year for many children in the U.S. and will exacerbate the risk factors for weight gain associated with summer recess."1 In fact, there are several factors relating to nutritional status of the children. We would like to share observations from Thailand, the second country in the timeline of COVID-19.2 In Thailand, school aged children in rural areas where COVID-19 disease outbreak exists are usually underweight.3 Thus, school closing means the children have to live with poor parents adding to economic problems of the family.

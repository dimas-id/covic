An increased incidence of HFE gene mutations has been described in hematologic malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the allelic frequency of HFE gene mutations in 154 adult patients with acute leukemia (AL) [107 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 20 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 27 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)]. The allelic frequency of the H63D mutation was 29% in AL patients and 25% in the healthy controls [P = 0.41; odds ratio (OR) = 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77 - 1.93]. No difference was found between controls and AML or APL patients, whereas the H63D mutation was significantly more frequent in ALL than controls (44% vs. 25%, P = 0.04; OR = 2.37; 95% CI = 1.05 - 5.36). The overall comparison of the mutation among the three subtypes of AL demonstrated a higher allelic frequency in ALL (P = 0.02). In conclusion, our data demonstrate a correlation between the presence of the H63D mutation and the occurrence of ALL in adult patients.

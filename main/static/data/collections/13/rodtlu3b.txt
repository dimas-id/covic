BACKGROUND Muscle hernias are uncommon clinical conditions with no uniform solution of repair. Biocompatible mesh allows for repair of hernias without the donor site morbidity and complications from direct repair under tension. METHODS Over a 6-month period at a Level 1 Trauma centre, four consecutive symptomatic muscle hernias were identified, two in the forearm and two in the lower limb. Three resulted from high-speed motorbike accidents, one from a mining accident. All patients had hernia repair at a minimum of 4 months post accident. A 10 × 15 cm × 1.0 mm sheet of acellular collagen matrix was fashioned to fit as an underlay of the fascia defect. Patients were clinically followed at the 2-, 6-, 12- and 26-week mark. Final phone contact was made 18 months post-operatively. RESULTS All patients were pleased with their cosmetic and functional outcomes. All patients returned to work and sport 3 months after reconstruction. CONCLUSION Symptomatic hernias as a result of trauma can be safely reconstructed with a biological mesh implant. This approach can prevent complications from previously described methods and return to active lifestyles with good results.

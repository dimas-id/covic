The role of suction regulators in nosocomial infections has, to our knowledge, not been studied. A sampling of devices used in hospitals was conducted. Many regulators (173 [37%] of 470) were found to be colonized. A suction circuit model revealed that pathogens can disseminate throughout the circuit (retrograde and antegrade), colonizing an experimental patient stomach.

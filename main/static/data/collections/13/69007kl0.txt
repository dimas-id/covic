Background and Aims Endoscopy services have had to rapidly adapt working practices in response to COVID-19. As recovery of endoscopy proceeds, there are numerous challenges facing our workforce which can impair effective teamworking. We designed and developed a novel toolkit to support teamworking in endoscopy during the pandemic. Methods A human factors model was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy teams. From this, we identified a set of key teamworking goals which informed the development of a toolkit to support several team processes. The toolkit was refined following expert input and refinement over a six-week period. Results The toolkit consists of four cognitive aids that can be used to support team huddles, briefings and debriefs, alongside techniques to optimise endoscopic non-technical skills across the patient procedure pathway. We describe the processes that local endoscopy units can employ to implement this toolkit. Conclusion A toolkit of cognitive aids, based on human factors principles, may be useful in supporting teams, helping them adapt to working safely in the era of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND The da Vinci Single-Port (SP) robot is a novel platform designed to facilitate single-incision robotic surgery (rSILS). The objective of this study was to describe our initial experience using this platform for SP robotic (SPr) right colectomy. METHODS Under a Food and Drug Administration-regulated feasibility study and Institutional Review Board approval, a patient with cecal adenocarcinoma underwent an SPr right colectomy. The primary endpoint was the safety and feasibility of the first SPr right colectomy performed in the USA. Secondary endpoints included perioperative metrics, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS An SPr Standard right colectomy was performed through a 4-cm single incision without the need for conversion or additional port placement. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL and there were no intraoperative complications. The robot was docked once with a docking time of 19 min. Total console time was 116 min and operative time was 219 min. The patient tolerated clear liquids on postoperative day (POD) 0 and a low-residue diet on POD 1. The patient had flatus and a bowel movement on POD 1. She was discharged home on POD 3. Final pathology showed pT3N0 cecal adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 0/24 lymph nodes positive for disease. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience demonstrates that an SPr right colectomy is feasible and can be safely completed. We completed an oncologic resection of a cecal adenocarcinoma without complications. The SP robot facilitates the utilization of robotic technology in a single-incision platform to perform colorectal procedures and offers promising benefits in the advancement of robotic surgery.

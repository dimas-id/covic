INTRODUCTION The use of biologic mesh where native tissue deficiencies limit reconstructive options has been well documented in the adult population, with increasing use to address the special requirements of complex abdominal wall reconstruction. There is, however, little documented evidence as to the safety and efficacy of these products in the pediatric population. METHODS This retrospective case series details 5 pediatric cases of complicated abdominal hernia repair with Strattice®, a non-crosslinked porcine acellular dermal matrix. Outcomes measured include recurrence, infection, seroma formation, symptomatic bulging, and need for mesh removal. Defect size, mesh size, and history of prior abdominal operations and infection were also recorded. RESULTS Patients received Strattice® with an average area of 132.2 (24-250)cm2 and primary closure was achieved over a mesh underlay in three (60%) patients, while the remaining required a bridging approach secondary to lateral defects. Complications included suture extrusion, requiring suture removal, hernia recurrence without bulge, noted incidentally, and seroma formation, requiring placement of drains. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the use of porcine ADM in pediatric patients appears to be potentially safe and efficacious in the context of complex abdominal wall defects, including those with substantial contamination. Our small series builds on previous reports in this difficult patient population. Although additional study, with larger subject pools, would assist in solidifying the observations seen in this and other series, initial findings suggest that porcine ADM is a valuable tool in the treatment of these complex patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Case series: Treatment study, Level IV.

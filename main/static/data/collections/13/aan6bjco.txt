Dear Editor, I read with interest the review, “Living with HIV in the time of COVID‐19: a glimpse of hope” by Adadi et al. published in the Journal of Medical Virology. However, I believe that the conclusions made within this article should be taken with caution as the outcomes of patients co‐infected with HIV and SARS‐CoV‐2 are not definitive and evidence regarding this matter is constantly evolving.

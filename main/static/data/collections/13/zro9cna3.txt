Radiofrequency radiation (RFR) is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with frequencies of 3 kHzâ€“300 GHz. RFR is produced by many man-made sources, including mobile phones and base stations, television and radio broadcasting facilities, radar, medical equipment, microwave ovens, radiofrequency heaters as well as a diverse variety of other electronic devices within our living and working environments. Owing to ongoing public concern and the increasing prevalence of RFR-emitting devices, a great deal of research has been conducted over the past 50 years to evaluate the biological and/or health effects of thermalizing and non-thermalizing RFR exposures. In the absence of decisive epidemiological evidence to support or refute an association between RFR exposure and cancer risk, laboratory studies of possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis by RFR are important. The scientific literature on this subject is full of conflicting results and the question of whether RFR exposure can contribute to cancer risk remains unresolved. This chapter contains a literature review of the evidence for RFR-induced cytogenetic effects, but also a critique of the literature, highlighting deficiencies in the design of some studies that should be taken into account when assessing the health risk of RFR.

Diabetes is one of the main comorbidities in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because the presence of diabetes and COVID-19 in the same patient is related to a poor clinical prognosis and a high probability of death, it is necessary to determine what findings allow us to predict a good or bad resolution of the disease in order to opt for a traditional treatment or a more incisive one. In this way, in the present work we analyze which laboratory parameters showed differences in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who recovered and in those who had complications or died.

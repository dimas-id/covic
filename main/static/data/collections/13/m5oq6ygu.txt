PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (COVID-19) occurred in December 2019, and then engulfed the entire world, presenting a significant and urgent threat to global health. Many research institutes have been involved in the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: At present, the strategy of new use of old drugs is mainly used to screen candidate drugs against the novel coronavirus (later termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) and inhibit excessive immune response. Related research has made great progress. SUMMARY: In this review, we summarize the drugs used for COVID-19 treatment in China based on the emerging basic and clinical data. It is hoped that this review will be useful to provide guidance for the prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19.

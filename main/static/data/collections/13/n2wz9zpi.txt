Renal disturbances by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consisted of acute kidney injury, due to acute tubular necrosis induced by sepsis, hydration, cytokine storm syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and hypoxia. As the direct cytopathic effect of virus on various renal cells has been detected in previous studies, direct virus invasion to the renal tubular cells and interstitium or glomeruli is possible. Previous studies showed that coronavirus enters into the cells by angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors that are extensively presented in the renal cells. Further, acute kidney injury in COVID-19 is strongly associated with higher mortality and morbidity and is an indicator for survival with Coronavirus infection. In the overall approach to patients with COVID-19 infection, special attention should be paid to control of classical risk factors of kidney injury.

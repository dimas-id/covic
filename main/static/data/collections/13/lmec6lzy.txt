As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more patients will require palliative and end-of-life care. In order to ensure goal-concordant-care when possible, clinicians should initiate goals-of-care conversations among our most vulnerable patients and, ideally, among all patients. However, many non-palliative care clinicians face deep uncertainty in planning, conducting, and evaluating such interactions. We believe that specialists within palliative care are aptly positioned to address such uncertainties, and in this article offer a relevant update to a concise framework for clinicians to plan, conduct, and evaluate goals-of-care conversations: the GOOD framework. Once familiar with this framework, palliative care clinicians may use it to educate their non-palliative care colleagues about a timely and critical component of care, now and beyond the COVID-19 era.

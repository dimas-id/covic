Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection that causes a potentially fatal respiratory disease. Although the SARS outbreak lasted less than 1 year, it resulted in significant morbidity and mortality and impacted nursing practices. A literature review was conducted. Only English language research articles in peer-reviewed journals, national organization publications, and book chapters were utilized. Data from 37 relevant articles were extracted, analyzed, and summarized. SARS' clinical description is presented, including its common signs/symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Recommended isolation practices for labor and delivery and proper procedures for donning, using, and doffing personal protective equipment are provided. Potential maternal outcomes include spontaneous miscarriage during the first trimester, preterm birth, emergency cesarean section, renal failure, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, surgical site infection, and maternal death. There have been no documented cases of vertical transmission; passive immunity is suspected on the basis of the presence of antibodies in some maternal body fluids. Potential neonatal outcomes include complications related to premature birth, intrauterine growth restriction, respiratory distress syndrome, and severe gastrointestinal manifestations. It is not known if or when SARS will reemerge, but perinatal and neonatal nurses should become familiar with its clinical description and proper infection control procedures to halt potential outbreaks.

Design Case series. Introduction The most common signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include headache, sore throat, hyposmia, hypogeusia, diarrhoea, dyspnoea and pneumonia. Dermatological manifestations have also been reported but few authors have documented oral signs and symptoms. Methods Three cases are reported where oral ulceration or blistering is found in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Results One patient had serologically confirmed COVID-19, whilst the remaining two cases were only suspected. Two patients reported pain from the palate, whilst the third reported in the tongue. The first two patients had lesions affecting keratinised tissue consistent with herpes simplex lesions but with no history of herpetic infection. The third patient had lesions compatible with erythema multiforme. Conclusions The authors suggest a link between COVID-19 and oral ulceration and blistering, but acknowledge these signs may often go undetected due to a lack of intraoral examination during hospital admission.

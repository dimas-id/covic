Objective: To observe the clinical effect of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule combined with Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods： From January 31, 2020 to February 11, 2020, 70 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated in Bozhou people's hospital were selected. According to the different treatments, they were divided into two groups: 40 patients in combination group and 30 patients in Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule group. Patients in both groups were given routine Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule orally. On this basis, the combination group was given oral Shufeng Jiedu Capsule for 10 d. The antipyretic time and the disappearance time of dry cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, diarrhea and other symptoms of patients in two groups were compared. The negative conversion ratio and negative conversion time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were also compared between two groups of patients. Results： There were significant differences in antipyretic time, the disappearance time of dry cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, pharyngeal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and novel coronavirus negative conversion time in the combination treatment group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The negative conversion time of combination treatment group was significantly shorter than Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule group (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The combination of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule and Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule was better than Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule alone in the treatment of COVID-19, which could significantly shorten the symptoms improvement time and negative conversion time of the clinical patients.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare cosmetic satisfaction with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) compared with multi-port surgery. DESIGN Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS Twenty women who underwent laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) via LESS or multi-port surgery. INTERVENTIONS Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery or multi-port surgery. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Cosmetic satisfaction was assessed using the Body Image Questionnaire at baseline and at 1, 4, and 24 weeks after surgery. Of the 20 LESS procedures, 1 was converted to multi-port surgery because of severe adhesions, and 1 woman assigned to undergo multi-port surgery was lost to follow-up. The 2 surgery groups did not differ in clinical demographic data and surgical results or postoperative pain scores at 12, 24, and 36 hours. Compared with the multi-port group, the LESS group reported significantly higher cosmetic satisfaction at 1, 4, and 24 weeks after surgery (p < .01). CONCLUSION Compared with multi-port surgery, LESS is not only a feasible approach with comparable operative outcomes but also has an advantage insofar as cosmetic outcome.

In cases of hypoxia, oxygen can be supplied via a number of methods including face masks, nasal cannulae, hyperoxygenated oxygen chambers and mechanical ventilation. Administering oxygen via the respiratory tract is, however, limited in respiratory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, pneumoconiosis and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or following the inhalation of asphyxiating poisons. This has led to research into new methods of supplying oxygen that bypass the lungs. Research has investigated the efficacy of intravenous hyperoxygenated solutions (HOS) as auxiliary oxygen supplies in several hypoxic states including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, respiratory failure, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial ischaemia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, poisoning, neonatal hypoxia, altitude sickness, large burns and traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Much of the research has taken place in China and more than 3.5 million hypoxic patients have received HOS, with good therapeutic effects. This review summarizes the literature supporting the use of this novel treatment.

The abstracts presented in this program were originally slated to be presented at the AMCP 2020 meeting in Houston, Texas, April 21-24. The meeting was canceled because of the COVID-19 crisis. In lieu of the scheduled poster presentations, many poster presenters have shared additional information about their research at https://plan.core-apps.com/amcp2020. Professional abstracts that have been reviewed are published in the Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy's Meeting Abstracts supplement.

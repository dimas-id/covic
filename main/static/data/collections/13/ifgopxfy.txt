The purpose of this paper is to develop a professional consensus that proposes, in the light of the current scientific evidence and the clinical experience of an expert panel, some clinical recommendations directed at the Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery (OTS) specialist and with the aim of reducing the variability in the prophylactic management of venous thromboembolic disease in knee and hip arthroplasty in clinical practice. The Delphi method was used, which consisted of two rounds of an e-mail questionnaire. Of the 55 items considered, a consensus was reached in 37 (67.2%) of them. In 31 cases there was consensus with the formulation of the item, and in 6 cases there was no agreed consensus. It was observed that there was a consensus in multiple clinical recommendations that could help OTS specialists in the making of decisions in their clinical practice.

A vital arm of the innate immune response to viral infection is the induction and subsequent antiviral effects of interferon (IFN). Rotavirus reduces type I IFN induction in infected cells by the degradation of IFN regulatory factors. Here, we show that the monkey rotavirus RRV and human rotavirus Wa also block gene expression induced by type I and II IFNs through a mechanism allowing signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 activation but preventing their nuclear accumulation. In infected cells, this may allow rotavirus to block the antiviral actions of IFN produced early in infection or by activated immune cells. As the intracellular expression of rotavirus nonstructural proteins NSP1, NSP3, and NSP4 individually did not inhibit IFN-stimulated gene expression, their involvement in this process is unlikely. RRV and Wa rotaviruses also prevented the tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-driven gene expression. In addition, NF-kappaB was activated by rotavirus infection, confirming earlier findings by others. As NF-kappaB is important for the induction of IFN and other cytokines during viral infection, this suggests that rotavirus prevents cellular transcription as a means to evade host responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of this strategy by a double-stranded RNA virus.

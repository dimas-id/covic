Mobile communications are propagated by electromagnetic fields (EMFs), and since the 1990s, they operate with pulse-modulated signals such as the GSM-1800 MHz. The biological effects of GSM-EMF in humans affected by neuropathological processes remain seldom investigated. In this study, a 2-h head-only exposure to GSM-1800 MHz was applied to (i) rats undergoing an acute neuroinflammation triggered by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, (ii) age-matched healthy rats, or (iii) transgenic hSOD1(G93A) rats that modeled a presymptomatic phase of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Gene responses were assessed 24 h after the GSM head-only exposure in a motor area of the cerebral cortex (mCx) where the mean specific absorption rate (SAR) was estimated to be 3.22 W/kg. In LPS-treated rats, a genome-wide mRNA profiling was performed by RNA-seq analysis and revealed significant (adjusted p value < 0.05) but moderate (fold changes < 2) upregulations or downregulations affecting 2.7% of the expressed genes, including genes expressed predominantly in neuronal or in glial cell types and groups of genes involved in protein ubiquitination or dephosphorylation. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses confirmed gene modulations uncovered by RNA-seq data and showed that in a set of 15 PCR-assessed genes, significant gene responses to GSM-1800 MHz depended upon the acute neuroinflammatory state triggered in LPS-treated rats, because they were not observed in healthy or in hSOD1(G93A) rats. Together, our data specify the extent of cortical gene modulations triggered by GSM-EMF in the course of an acute neuroinflammation and indicate that GSM-induced gene responses can differ according to pathologies affecting the CNS.

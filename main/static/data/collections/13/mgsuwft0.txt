Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating ­syndrome of diffuse alveolar damage that develops via a variety of local and systemic insults such as sepsis, trauma, ­pneumonia, and aspiration. It is interestingly to note that only a subset of individuals exposed to potential ALI-inciting insults develop the disorder and the severity of the disease varies from complete resolution to death. In addition, ALI susceptibility and severity are also affected by ethnicity as evidenced by the higher mortality rates observed in African-American ALI patients compared with other ethnic groups in the USA. Moreover, marked differences in strain-specific ALI responses to inflammatory and injurious agents are observed in preclinical animal models. Together, these observations strongly indicate genetic components to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALI. The identification of genes contributing to ALI would potentially provide a better understanding of ALI pathobiology, yield novel biomarkers, identify individuals or populations at risk, and prove useful for the development of novel and individualized therapies. Genome-wide searches in animal models have identified a number of quantitative trait loci that associate with ALI susceptibility. In this chapter, we utilize a systems biology approach combining cellular signaling pathway analysis with population- based association studies to review established and suspected candidate genes that contribute to dysfunction of endothelial cell barrier integrity and ALI susceptibility.

Aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11.) belongs to exoprotease family, which can catalyze the cleavage of peptide bond which connects the N-terminal amino acid to the penultimate residue in a protein. Aminopeptidases catalyze the process of removal of the N-terminal amino acids of target substrates by sequential cleavage of one amino acid residue at a time. Microbial aminopeptidase are of great acceptance as industrial enzymes with varying applications in food and pharma industry since these enzymes possess unique characteristics than aminopeptidases from other sources. This review describes the various applications of microbial aminopeptidases in different industrial sectors. These enzymes are widely used in food industry as a debittering agent as well as in the preparation of protein hydrolysates. In baking, brewing, and cheese making aminopeptidases are extensively used for removing the bitterness of peptides. The inhibitors of these enzymes are found great clinical applications against various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and viral infections. Aminopeptidases are widely used for the synthesis of biopeptides and amino acids, and found to be efficient than chemical synthesis. These enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing organophosphate compounds, thus having biological as well as environmental significance.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in neonatal piglets can cause up to 100% mortality, resulting in significant economic loss in the swine industry. Like other coronaviruses, PEDV N protein is a nucleocapsid protein and abundantly presents at all stages of infection. Previously, we reported that the N protein of trypsin-independent PEDV 8aa is cleaved during virus replication. In this study, we further investigated the nature of N protein cleavage using various methods including protease cleavage assays with or without various inhibitors and mutagenesis study. We found that PEDV 8aa infection in Vero cells leads to apoptotic cell death, and caspase 6 or 7 can cleave PEDV 8aa N protein at the late stage of the replication. The caspase-mediated cleavage occurs between D(424) and G(425) near the C-terminal of N protein. We also report that both cleaved and uncleaved N proteins are exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells.

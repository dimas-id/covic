OBJECTIVES To describe our buried penis repair technique that includes penile release, tissue resection, wound closure, and penile reconstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 73 patients were treated from 2007 to 2017. Patients can be categorised into five stages: Stage I, involves only a phimotic band; Stage 2, required excision of diseased penile skin with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG); Stage 3, requires scrotal excision; Stage 4, requires escutcheonectomy; and Stage 5, requires panniculectomy. Successful treatment hinges on adequate excision of diseased skin and de-bulking followed by replacement of deficient skin with STSG. RESULTS In all, 36 of 73 (49%) patients had Stage 1-3 disease, whilst 37 of 73 (51%) were Stage 4-5. There were complications within the first 30 days in 44 of 73 (60%) patients. In all, 62 of 73 (85%) patients either had no complications or Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications and nine (12%) had complications beyond 30 days. Only five of 36 (14%) patients with Stage 1-3 disease had complications. One patient developed recurrent phimosis. CONCLUSION The buried penis is a challenging surgical entity where conservative treatment will most likely lead to failure. Surgery is the only means for a lasting cure in these patients and should be used as a first-line treatment. One should expect complications postoperatively, especially within the first 30 days; however, these are mostly limited to Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications.

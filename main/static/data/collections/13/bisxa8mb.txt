We thank our colleagues for their constructive discussion on our recently published study(1). Regarding prevalence, indeed, growing literature yields a variable frequency of loss of smell (LOS) in Covid‐19 patients, that may be hypothetically due to differences in the location and amount of viral load, to the different immune response between younger mild‐symptomatic outpatients (higher prevalence) and more severely affected inpatients (lower prevalence)(1,2), and to the variable methods of measurement.

Patients with immunodeficiency and/or under immunosuppressive therapy have an increased risk of complications due to infectious diseases. After solid organ transplantation infections are the second most common cause of death. Prophylactic measures should therefore routinely be carried out. Infections in immunosuppressed patients may be associated with atypical clinical symptoms making the diagnosis and therapy a challenge for the treating physician. Viral and opportunistic infections in particular can be a therapeutic pitfall. A careful surveillance of the patient with respect to infectious diseases is essential in order to be able to make an early diagnosis and initiate appropriate measures.

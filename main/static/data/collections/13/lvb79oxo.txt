Adult-onset Stillâ€™s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic, autoinflammatory disorder that often presents in adolescence and early adulthood with fever, rash, and polyarthritis. There are significant genetic and clinical similarities with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) with a different chronological disease onset. The disease can have many protean characteristics leading to delays in diagnosis. Treatment includes corticosteroids; traditional immunomodulators, such as methotrexate; and targeted biologic treatments that include IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors.

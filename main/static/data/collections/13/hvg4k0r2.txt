Renin is the rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and can induce hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) through the over-activated renin-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin (Ang) II-Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) axis. Prorenin and renin bound to the (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] not only increase the catalytic conversion of angiotensinogen (AGT) to Ang I, but also upregulate the expression of profibrotic genes. This review will discuss the inhibition of renin and the (P)RR system pharmacologically and nutritionally.

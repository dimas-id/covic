The threat of a major coronavirus pandemic urges the development of suitable strategies to combat these pathogens. HCoV-NL63 is an α-coronavirus that can cause severe lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization. We report here the 3.4 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the HCoV-NL63 coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer, which is the conformational machine responsible for entry into host cells and the sole target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. The map resolves the extensive glycan shield obstructing the protein surface and, in combination with mass-spectrometry, provides a structural framework to understand accessibility to antibodies. The structure also reveals a remarkable modular architecture of the receptor-binding subunit and the complete architecture of the fusion machinery including the triggering loop and the C-terminal domains, which contribute to anchoring the trimer to the viral membrane. Our data further suggest that HCoV-NL63 and other coronaviruses use molecular trickery, based on masking of epitopes with glycans and activating conformational changes, to evade the immune system of infected hosts.

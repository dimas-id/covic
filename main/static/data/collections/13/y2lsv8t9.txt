Abstract A wide variety of microorganisms are potential respiratory pathogens, and the spectrum of known pathogens for each respiratory infection syndrome has not changed markers over recent years. Detection of likely etiologic agents of respiratory infections can help direct management and can also play an important role in disease surveillance. For this purpose, we are still reliant on many traditional diagnostic tools that have been used for decades in order to determine the microbial etiology of respiratory infections. However, these tools have been increasingly supplemented by newer methods, particular molecular diagnostic techniques, which have enabled the more rapid detection of many pathogens that were previously difficult to detect. These advances have particularly lead to improvements in the ability to detect respiratory viruses and also other microorganisms that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. Recognition of the existence of the lung microbiome has challenged the traditional views of pneumonia pathogenesis and may provide the opportunity for new diagnostic tools that are focused on more than just detection of specific known pathogens. Continued liaison between clinicians and laboratory staff is vital in order to facilitate the most cost-effective use of laboratory diagnostics.

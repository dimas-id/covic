This paper describes the development of the NCHC's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Grid project-An Access Grid (AG)-based disease management and collaborative platform that allowed for SARS patient's medical data to be dynamically shared and discussed between hospitals and doctors using AG's video teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities. During the height of the SARS epidemic in Asia, SARS Grid and the SARShope website significantly curved the spread of SARS by helping doctors manage the in-hospital and in-home care of quarantined SARS patients through medical data exchange and the monitoring of the patient's symptoms. Now that the SARS epidemic has ended, the primary function of the SARS Grid project is that of a web-based informatics tool to increase pubic awareness of SARS and other epidemic diseases. Additionally, the SARS Grid project can be viewed and further studied as an outstanding model of epidemic disease prevention and/or containment.

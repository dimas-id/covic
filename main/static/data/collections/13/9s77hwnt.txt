Abstract This article has presented a rational protocol for examining stools for enteric pathogens. When modified according to a laboratory's geographical location and patient population, this approach should allow efficient, comprehensive diagnosis of diarrheal disease. Laboratories should be able to examine stools routinely for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Y. enterocolitica, intestinal parasites [including Cryptosporidium (14)], rotavirus, and C. difficile toxin. When unusual organisms such as pathogenic E. coli are suspected, or tissue culture facilities for C. difficile toxin assays are unavailable, the use of reference laboratories is strongly encouraged.

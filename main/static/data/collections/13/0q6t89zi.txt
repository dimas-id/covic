PURPOSE OF REVIEW To evaluate new information on the importance of right ventricular function, diagnosis and management in cardiac surgical patients. RECENT FINDINGS There is growing evidence that right ventricular function is a key determinant in survival in cardiac surgery, particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of this condition is helped by the use of specific hemodynamic parameters and echocardiography. In that regard, international consensus guidelines on the echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular function have been recently published. New monitoring modalities in cardiac surgery such as regional near-infrared spectroscopy can also assist management. Management of right ventricular failure will be influenced by the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction. The differential diagnosis and management will be facilitated using a systematic approach. SUMMARY The use of right ventricular pressure monitoring and the publications of guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular anatomy and function allow the early identification of right ventricular failure. The treatment success will be associated by optimization of the hemodynamic, echocardiographic and near-infrared spectroscopy parameters.

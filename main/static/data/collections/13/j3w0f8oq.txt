Malaria is a reemerging disease in the countries where it was eradicated previously, whereas it is endemic in many countries including tropical countries. In India, malarial infection is on rise due to rapid urbanization and overcrowding in all major metropolitan cities. The incidence of morbidity and mortality due to malaria infection is increasing and could be attributed to drug resistance in strains of malarial parasite. Combining immune modulation strategies with anti-malarial drugs has a beneficial effect in an attempt to improve treatment for malaria. Along with clinical presentation and outcome of this parasitic infection, it is important to understand immunological disturbances associated with biological mechanisms underlying these actions in better understanding of pathogenesis of malarial infection. Immune and inflammatory responses in malarial infection are controlled and co-ordinated by various cytokines and chemokines. This review focuses on commonly seen immunological disturbances associated with malarial infection resulting in related humoral and cell mediated immune functions primarily with innate to subsequent adaptive immunity in tackling this parasitic infection.

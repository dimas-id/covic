The transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan and Hubei Province differ considerably from those in the rest of China. In Hubei province SARS-CoV‑2 led to a dramatic outbreak. Intensive control measures (travel restrictions, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts and others) led to the control of the outbreak. Despite travel restrictions SARS-CoV‑2 was detected in other provinces in the following weeks. Consistent and intensive identification and isolation of infected persons (“containment”) was able to prevent an outbreak outside Hubei province, providing an example for the control of SARS-CoV‑2.

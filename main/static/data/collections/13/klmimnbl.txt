Model peptides composed of alanine and leucine residues are often used to mimic single helical transmembrane domains. Many studies have been carried out to determine how they interact with membranes. However, few studies have investigated their lipid-destabilizing effect. We designed three peptides designated KALRs containing a hydrophobic stretch of 14, 18, or 22 alanines/leucines surrounded by charged amino acids. Molecular modeling simulations in an implicit membrane model as well as attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared analyses show that KALR is a good model of a transmembrane helix. However, tryptophan fluorescence and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that the extent of binding and insertion into lipids increases with the length of the peptide hydrophobic core. Although binding can be directly correlated to peptide hydrophobicity, we show that insertion of peptides into a membrane is determined by the length of the peptide hydrophobic core. Functional studies were performed by measuring the ability of peptides to induce lipid mixing and leakage of liposomes. The data reveal that whereas KALR14 does not destabilize liposomal membranes, KALR18 and KALR22 induce 40 and 50% of lipid-mixing, and 65 and 80% of leakage, respectively. These results indicate that a transmembrane model peptide can induce liposome fusion in vitro if it is long enough. The reasons for the link between length and fusogenicity are discussed in relation to studies of transmembrane domains of viral fusion proteins. We propose that fusogenicity depends not only on peptide insertion but also on the ability of peptides to destabilize the two leaflets of the liposome membrane.

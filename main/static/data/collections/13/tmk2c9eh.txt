Abstract Background The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a life-threatening illness, which represents a challenge to all the health-care workers. Neurosurgeons around the world are being affected in different ways. Objectives This is the first study regarding the readiness of neurosurgery residents towards the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. The aim is to identify the level of knowledge, readiness, and the impact of this virus among neurosurgery residents in different programs. Methods A cross-sectional analysis in which 52 neurosurgery residents from different centers were selected to complete a questionnaire-based survey. The questionnaire comprised of three sections and 27 questions that ranged from knowledge to impact of the current pandemic on various features. Results The median knowledge score was 4 out of 5. The proportion of participants with satisfactory knowledge level was 60%. There was a statistically significant difference between the knowledge score and location of the program. Around 48% of the neurosurgery residents dealt directly with COVID-19 patients. Receiving a session about personal protective equipment (PPE) was reported by 57.7%. The neurosurgery training at the hospital was affected. About 90% believed that this pandemic influenced their mental health. Conclusion Neurosurgery residents have a relatively good knowledge about COVID-19. The location of the program was associated with knowledge level. Most of the participants did not receive a sufficient training about PPE. Almost all responders agree that their training at the hospital was affected. Further studies are needed to study the impact of this pandemic on neurosurgery residents.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare operative and postoperative results of ovarian cortex retrieval by conventional laparoscopy (1cm umbilical site and 3 accessory 5-mm-reusable working ports) (HASS) versus single site laparoscopy (SSL). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Fertility Preservation Programme at La Fe University Hospital-University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain, 2011 to 2012. Fertility Preservation Programme at La Fe University Hospital of Valencia, Valencia, Spain. PATIENTS Twenty-one patients with cancer (breast cancer: n = 17; Hodgkin's lymphoma: n = 3; and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: n = 1). INTERVENTION Ovarian cortex retrieval either by conventional laparoscopy using an umbilical Hasson port and 3 accessory ports (HASS group: n = 11) or by SSL (SSL group: n = 10). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Operative length, blood loss, postoperative pain (visual analog scale for pain at 6, 24, and 48 hours), need of additional analgesia, quality of life (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions), cosmesis of the scar, and patient's self-perception were assessed at 24 and 48 hours and 3 months after surgery. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Estimated blood loss, operative length, and postoperative pain did not differ between groups. The start of chemotherapy was not delayed in either group, and cosmesis and image self-perception were also similar. CONCLUSION The SSL approach can be considered a safe option compared with the classic multisite approach.

With the advent of laparoscopic surgery, the need of optimal visualization and efficient instrumentation has created a need for better understanding of the characteristics of the surgical plume. Despite the technological advances of digital imaging and dissector technology (ultrasonic, radiofrequency electrical, and bipolar), the inconvenient and sometimes harmful generation of a surgical plume decreases visualization, often requiring the surgeon to remove the scope from the surgical field and remove the obstructing particles. If visualization is suboptimal or lost during bleeding, the outcome can be deadly. Therefore, we reviewed the available reports in the literature focused on the quantification of surgical plumes.

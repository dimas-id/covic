We read with interest the letter by D'Antiga evaluating the early experience with Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) in liver transplant (LT) recipients in Bergamo and suggesting the absence of correlation between immunosuppression and severity of disease. We report two cases of early liver transplant recipients infected by SARS-CoV-2 with only mild clinical manifestations. On the contrary, long-term recipients with comorbities showed a more aggressive course and worse prognosis. Considering the emerging evidence of the contribution of immune activation in the severity of the COVID-19, immunosuppression may in part prevent a more aggressive course of the disease.

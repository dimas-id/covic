Respiratory viruses have been recognised as causative agents for a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and severe respiratory compromise in neonates during birth hospitalisation. Early‐life respiratory virus infections have also been shown to be associated with adverse long‐term consequences. CONCLUSION: Preventing virus infections by intensifying hygiene measures and cohorting infected infants should be a major goal for neonatal intensive care units, as well as more common use of virus diagnostics. Active virus surveillance and long‐term follow‐up are needed to ascertain the causality and exact underlying mechanisms for adverse long‐term consequences.

Abstract In the presence of infectious diseases, people's actions have consequences for others but not ones that they take into account in making their choices. These externalities arise for individuals' decisions about both prevention and therapy and condition the design of government interventions. Subsidies are one form of intervention but may be constrained by circumstances to be less than optimal.

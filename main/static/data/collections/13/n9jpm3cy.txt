Global population expansion has increased interactions and conflicts between humans and nonhuman primates over shared ecological space and resources. Such ecological overlap, along with our shared evolutionary histories, makes human-nonhuman primate interfaces hot spots for the acquisition and transmission of parasites. In this chapter, we bring to light the importance of human-macaque interfaces in particular as hot spots for infectious disease ecological and epidemiological assessments. We first outline the significance and broader objectives behind research related to the subfield of primate infectious disease ecology and epidemiology. We then reveal how members of the genus Macaca, being among the most socioecologically flexible and invasive of all primate taxa, live under varying degrees of overlap with humans in anthropogenic landscapes. Thus, human-macaque interfaces may favor the bidirectional exchange of parasites. We then review studies that have isolated various types of parasites at human-macaque interfaces, using information from the Global Mammal Parasite Database (GMPD: http://www.mammalparasites.org/). Finally, we elaborate on avenues through which the implementation of both novel conceptual frameworks (e.g., Coupled Systems, One Health) and quantitative network-based approaches (e.g., social and bipartite networks, agent-based modeling) may potentially address some of the critical gaps in our current knowledge of infectious disease ecology at human-primate interfaces.

We here propose to model active cases data from COVID-19 by a continuous effective model based on a modified diffusion equation under Lifshitz scaling with a dynamic diffusion coefficient. The proposed model is rich enough to capture different aspects of a complex virus diffusion as humanity has been recently facing. The model being continuous it is bound to be solved analytically and/or numerically. So, we investigate two possible models where the diffusion coefficient associated with possible types of contamination are captured by some specific profiles. The active cases curves here derived were able to successfully describe the pandemic behavior of Germany and Spain. Moreover, we also predict some scenarios for the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. The scenarios unveil how the lockdown measures can flatten the contamination curves. We can find the best profile of the diffusion coefficient that better fit the real data of pandemic.

We congratulate Martín Carreras-Presas et al (2020) for their instructive article presenting cases of oral vesiculobullous lesions associated with SARS-COV-2 infection (Martín Carreras-Presas et al., 2020). Furthermore, an irregular ulcer on the tongue (Chaux-Bodard, Deneuve & Desoutter, 2020) and reactivation of oral herpes simplex virus type-1 were reported as intraoral findings of COVID-19 patients, recently (Tang et al., 2020).

PURPOSE To investigate the effects of alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) during one-lung ventilation (OLV) on end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) of the dependent lung. METHODS Patients who were planned to undergo lung resection surgery for lung tumors and needed OLV for at least 1 h were included in the study. After turning the patients into the lateral position under total intravenous anesthesia, OLV was commenced using a double-lumen endobronchial tube. EELV was measured using the nitrogen washout technique at 20 min after OLV started (baseline) and 15, 30, 45, 60 min after ARM was performed on the dependent lung. RESULTS Among 42 patients who completed the study, EELV increased at 15 min after ARM by 20% or greater compared with baseline in 21 patients (responders). Responders were significantly shorter in height (158 vs. 165 cm, p = 0.01) and had smaller preoperative functional residual capacity (2.99L vs. 3.65L, p = 0.02) than non-responders. Before ARM, responders had significantly higher driving pressure (14.2 vs. 12.4 cmH2O, p = 0.01) and lower respiratory system compliance (23.6 vs. 31.4 ml/cmH2O, p = 0.0002) than non-responders. Driving pressure temporarily dropped after ARM in responders, while no significant change was observed in non-responders. Fourteen out of 21 responders kept EELV 20% or more increased EELV than baseline at 60 min after ARM. CONCLUSION EELV of the dependent lung was increased by 20% or greater in half of the patients responding to ARM. The increased volume of the dependent lung caused by ARM was maintained for 60 min in two-thirds of the responders.

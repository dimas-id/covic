The Difficult Airway Society 2015 guidelines recommend and describe in detail a surgical cricothyroidotomy technique for the can't intubate, can't oxygenate (CICO) scenario, but this can be technically challenging for anaesthetists with no surgical training. Following a structured training session, 104 anaesthetists took part individually in a simulated can't intubate, can't oxygenate event using simulation and airway models to evaluate how well they could perform these front-of-neck access techniques. Main outcomes measures were: ability to correctly perform the technical steps; procedural time; and success rate. Outcomes were compared between palpable and impalpable cricothyroid membrane scenarios. Anaesthetists' technical abilities were good, as assessed by a video analysis checklist score. Mean (SD) procedural time was 44 (16) s and 65 (17) s for the palpable and impalpable cricothyroid membrane models, respectively (p â‰¤ 0.001). First-pass tracheal tube placement was obtained in 103 out of the 104 palpable cricothyroidotomies and in 101 out of the 104 impalpable cricothyroidotomies (p = 0.31). We conclude that anaesthetists can be trained to perform surgical front-of-neck access to an acceptable level of competence and speed when assessed using a simulator.

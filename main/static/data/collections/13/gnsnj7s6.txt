During the interepidemic period between October 1 and November 20 1987 96 miners from a coal mine were examined who suffered from diseases of the upper airways which caused their work incapacity. In paired sera the rise of antibodies against M. pneumoniae and respiratory viruses were examined (adeno, influenza virus A and B, Coxsackie A21, corona 229E and OC43, parainfluenza type 1, 2 and 3, rhino type 13 and 44, RS). A viral aetiology was confirmed in 31 patients (32.3%). An evident rise of antibodies against the following viruses was found: adenoviruses 3X, Coxsackie A21 5X, coronaviruses 229E 1X and OC43 2X, parainfluenza virus type 1 1X and type 2 5X, rhinovirus type 13 11X and type 44 4X, RS virus 1X. As to the period of work incapacity and clinical manifestations, there was no difference between the diseases caused by different agents. The results of the investigation indicate that also viruses which are not used in common diagnostic practice may frequently evoke diseases which cause work incapacity.

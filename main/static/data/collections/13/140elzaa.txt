PURPOSE This study assessed the acceptability of laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) for patients with previous intra-abdominal surgery (PIS). METHODS Sixteen patients with PIS had undergone LAG; 9 of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, 2 of laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy and 5 of laparoscopy-assisted remnant gastrectomy (LARG). Difficulty, safety, and accuracy of LAG were compared between patients with PIS and with no previous intra-abdominal surgery. An independent group of 11 cases with open remnant gastrectomy (ORG) was used for comparing with LARG. RESULTS No significant difference was observed in conversion rate, intraoperative complication, operation time, blood loss, dissected lymph nodes, postoperative complications and hospital stay between PIS, and no PIS. There was no significant difference in operative time, dissected lymph nodes, and postoperative complications between LARG and ORG. Blood loss was lesser and postoperative hospital stay was shorter in LARG than in ORG. CONCLUSION LAG for patients with PIS is acceptable.

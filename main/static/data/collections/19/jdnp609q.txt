The idea is to design a simple function that can describe typical virus-load curves without solving a full virus load dynamic model. We present such a standard virus load function and validate it on data from influenza A as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection data for Macaque monkeys and humans. Further, we compare the virus load function to an established {it target model} of virus dynamics as presented by A. Smith in cite{Amber2018}. This virus-load function can be used as input to higher level models for the physiological effects of a virus infection, for models for tissue damage, and to develop treatment strategies.

Abstract A 25-kDa protein, with an N-terminal amino acid sequence homologous to that of xylanase inhibitor and designated as xylanase inbibitor-like protein (XILP) was purified from sorghum seeds. The isolation protocol consisted of affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. XILP inhibited mycelial growth in various phytopathogenic fungi. The antifungal activity was thermostable and pH-stable. XILP inhibited proliferation of various cancer cell lines but did not do so in human embryonic liver (WRL 68) cells. There was no mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes. XILP reduced the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 11.1Î¼M, but lacked inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 integrase and SARS coronavirus proteinase. In conclusion, sorghum XILP is thermostable and pH stable and exhibits potent antifungal, antiproliferative, and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities.

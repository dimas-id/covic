The means used by enveloped viruses to bypass cellular membranes are well characterized; however, the mechanisms used by non‐enveloped viruses to deliver their genome inside the cell remain unresolved and poorly defined. The discovery of short, membrane interacting, amphipathic or hydrophobic sequences (known as membranotropic peptides) in both enveloped and non‐enveloped viruses suggests that these small peptides are strongly involved in breaching the host membrane and in the delivery of the viral genome into the host cell. Thus, in spite of noticeable differences in entry, this short stretches of membranotropic peptides are probably associated with similar entry‐related events. This review will uncover the intrinsic features of viral membranotropic peptides involved in viral entry of both naked viruses and the ones encircled with a biological membrane with the objective to better elucidate their different functional properties and possible applications in the biomedical field.

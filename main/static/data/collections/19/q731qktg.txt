Human intestinal maltase (HMA) is an α-glucosidase responsible for the hydrolysis of α-1,4-linkages from the non-reducing end of malto-oligosaccharides. HMA has become an important target in the treatment of type-2 diabetes. In this study, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and EGCG glucoside (EGCG-G1) were identified as inhibitors of HMA by an in vitro assay with IC(50) of 20 ± 1.0 and 31.5 ± 1.0 μM, respectively. A Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed that EGCG and EGCG-G1 were competitive inhibitors of maltose substrate against HMA and inhibition kinetic constants (K (i)) calculated from a Dixon plot were 5.93 ± 0.26 and 7.88 ± 0.57 μM, respectively. Both EGCG and EGCG-G1 bound to the active site of HMA with numerous hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions.

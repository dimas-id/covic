Abstract Here we describe a case of viral sepsis beyond the neonatal period caused by human parechovirus subtype 3 (HPeV-3), which manifested as cardio-respiratory failure, hepatitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). HPeV-1 and 2 were originally classified as enteroviruses but the advent of sequence analysis led to them being recognized as a new genus in the picornavirus family. Subsequently, nine additional HPeV strains have been reported including HPeV-3 in 1999. 1 The spectrum of disease that these viruses may cause is still unknown, and they are rarely screened for in clinical practice.

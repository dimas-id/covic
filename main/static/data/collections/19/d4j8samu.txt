Abstract Astroviruses are a common cause of gastroenteritis in children worldwide and can also cause infection in a range of domestic and wild animal species. Canine astrovirus (formally named as Mamastrovirus 5, MAstV5) has been reported worldwide, and its role as an enteric pathogen is still controversial. Herein, we describe the genomic characterization of a MAstV5 (strain crab-eating fox/2016/BRA) identified in a wild canid (Cerdocyon thous) diagnosed with canine distemper virus (CDV) as causa mortis. The nearly complete genome comprised 6579 nt in length and displayed the archetypal organization of astroviruses. The present report is the first evidence of MAstV5 infection in an animal species other than the dog and highlights a possible natural astrovirus spillover between domestic and wild canids. Moreover, these results show the first evidence of extra-intestinal MAstV5, suggesting a virus systemic spread. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the astroviruses biology and their interactions with the wildlife health.

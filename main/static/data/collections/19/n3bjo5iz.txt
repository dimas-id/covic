PURPOSE The aim of our study was to evaluate factors influencing effectiveness of percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<3 cm). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between December 2007 and August 2015, 49 patients with 65 previously histological typed HCC were treated in a total of 61 sessions. Tumours were subdivided into central (>3 cm from the capsule) (n = 22) and peripheral (<3 cm from the capsule) (n = 43). Imaging follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, then annually. Mean follow-up period was 18 months (range 1-55). Location of the lesion, age, sex, and underlying disease of the patients was analyzed and related with efficacy. RESULTS Technical success was obtained in all cases. Residual disease was registered in 21 lesions (32.3 %): 13 were peripheral and 8 were central. Twelve of them were retreated with percutaneous MWA. Local recurrence was recorded in 8 lesions (12.3 %): 5 were retreated with MWA. No significant difference in terms of effectiveness was observed in lesions located in a central position and those situated in the peripheral position. Age, sex, and underlying disease not influenced results. Only one major complication was observed. The rate of minor complications was 24.5 %. Mortality at 30 days was 0 %. CONCLUSIONS Our results encourage the role of MWA in the treatment of small HCC. More numerous series and randomized studies are necessary to state the role of MWA and to select cases in which MWA may be more effective and safer than RFA.

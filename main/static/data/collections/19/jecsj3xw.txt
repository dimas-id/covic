Objectives: Investigate the characteristics and rules of hematology changes in patients with COVID-19, and explore the possibility to identify moderate and severe patients using conventional hematology parameters or combined parameters. Methods: The clinical data of 45 moderate and severe type patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 13, 2020 were collected. The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively. Conclusions: The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD is the best hematology index and can help clinicians to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients, and it can be used as a useful indicator to help prevent and control the epidemic.

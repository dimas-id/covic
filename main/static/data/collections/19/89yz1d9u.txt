Abstract Background Viral respiratory tract infections are frequent among Hajj pilgrims. However, it is still not known whether viruses are responsible for the symptoms observed in sick pilgrims or whether they only colonize sick and asymptomatic pilgrims. Patients and methods A prospective cohort study was conducted among French Hajj pilgrims in 2016. Medical follow-up and systematic nasal swabbing were performed pre- and post-Hajj. Additional samples were obtained per-Hajj, at symptom onset in ill pilgrims. Viruses were identified using the BioFire FilmArray® Respiratory multiplex qualitative PCR panel. Results 109 pilgrims were included. 83.5% presented respiratory symptoms during Hajj and 39.5% were still symptomatic on return. 5.5% of pre-Hajj, 95.2% of per-Hajj (at symptom onset) and 46.5% of post-Hajj samples tested positive (p < 0.0001). Acquisition rates of rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus were respectively 38.6%, 19.8% and 2.0%. Although rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A clearance were respectively 70.6%, 71.4% and 100% on return, overall virus carriage proportion on return was 75.0% in pilgrims with influenza-like illness and 44.0% in those who have never experienced this symptoms or resolved it (OR = 4.05, 95% CI [1.02–16.02]). Conclusions Viruses likely play some role in the pathogenesis of the respiratory tract infections at the Hajj. Point of care-rapid multiplex PCR assays are valuable diagnosis tools in this context when used at respiratory symptom onset or soon after.

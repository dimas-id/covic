BACKGROUND Sacrococcygeal hernia is a very rare condition that is usually secondary to sacrococcygectomy, and its ideal treatment regimen is unclear. Herein, we report a case of sacrococcygeal hernia occurring in a patient who had no history of sacrococcygeal operation, present the operative procedures of mesh repair via a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach that has not been described, and discuss our experience in diagnosis and treatment with a review of the literature. CASE SUMMARY A 54-year-old woman who chiefly complained of a 10-year history of a reversible bulge in her right sacrococcygeal region was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination revealed a bulge in the right sacrococcygeal region upon standing, which disappeared in the prone position but relapsed when performing the Valsalva manoeuvre. Computed tomography displayed an abnormality in the structure of the tissues between the midline of the sacrococcygeal region and the right gluteus muscle. The patient was diagnosed with sacrococcygeal hernia and received hernia repair with mesh through a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach. On laparoscopy, the rectum was dissected posterolaterally, and a defect was identified in the right anterior sacrococcygeal region through which part of the rectum protruded. This was followed by the placement of a self-gripping polyester mesh via a sacrococcygeal approach. There were no postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 and was followed for more than 6 mo with no recurrence. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic mesh repair is recommended as a priority of surgical options for sacrococcygeal hernias, while choosing a self-gripping mesh can help avoid the risk of presacral vessel injury by reducing suture fixation.

PURPOSE Although diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract are common in patients with Parkinson's disease, there is a paucity of data regarding postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2007-2011) was utilized to analyze outcomes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing colorectal surgery. Main outcomes were risk-adjusted inpatient morbidity, mortality, hospital charge, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 6490 patients were identified. Utilization of laparoscopic surgery in Parkinson's patients has progressively increased in frequency over the latest 5 years analyzed. The most common diagnoses were colorectal malignancy (39 %) and intestinal obstruction (20 %). Right hemicolectomy (37 %) and sigmoidectomy (30 %) were the most common operations. Laparoscopy was used in 18 % of Parkinson's patients and most commonly in the elective setting. 54.3 % of Parkinson's patients had emergency surgery compared to 38.6 % in non-Parkinson's. Overall morbidity and mortality were significantly lower after laparoscopic surgery compared to open (20 vs. 25 % and 2.1 vs. 6.6 %, respectively). Length of stay was significantly shorter (OR -1.86; p < 0.01) for laparoscopic operations, but there were no significant differences in risk-adjusted outcomes between laparoscopic and open groups. CONCLUSION PD patients have high rates of morbidity and mortality after colorectal surgery; this may be because more than half of all patients in this population undergo emergent surgery. The laparoscopic approach appears to have short-term benefits in this patient population.

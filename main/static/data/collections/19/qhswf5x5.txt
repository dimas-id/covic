BACKGROUND This report details our experience with laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) fundoplication for GERD and provides a comparison to earlier contiguous patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic fundoplication. METHODS With institutional review board approval, symptoms before and after LESS fundoplications and conventional laparoscopic fundoplications were scored by patients. Outcomes after 130 consecutive LESS fundoplications were compared to 130 contiguous consecutive outcomes after conventional laparoscopic fundoplications. RESULTS Patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic vs. LESS fundoplication were very similar. There were no conversions to "open" operations and no notable complications with LESS fundoplication. Symptom reduction was broad and dramatic for patients undergoing LESS or conventional laparoscopic fundoplication; 96 % of patients who underwent LESS fundoplication scored their incision as â‰¥8 (1 = revolting to 10 = beautiful). CONCLUSIONS Relative to conventional laparoscopy, LESS surgery provides excellent resolution of symptoms without an apparent scar. In comparison to conventional laparoscopy, LESS fundoplication is as safe with similar symptom improvement and superior cosmesis.

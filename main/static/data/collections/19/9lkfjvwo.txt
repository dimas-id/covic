Diarrheal disease is responsible for 8.6% of global child mortality. Recent epidemiological studies found the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium to be a leading cause of pediatric diarrhea with particularly grave impact on infants and immunocompromised individuals. There is neither a vaccine nor effective treatment. We establish a drug discovery process built on scalable phenotypic assays and mouse models that takes advantage of transgenic parasites. Screening a library of compounds with anti-parasitic activity we identified pyrazolopyridines as inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis. Oral treatment with the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 results in potent reduction in intestinal infection of immunocompromised mice. Treatment also leads to rapid resolution of diarrhea and dehydration in neonatal calves, a clinical model of cryptosporidiosis that closely resembles human infection. Our results suggest the Cryptosporidium lipid kinase PI(4)K as a target for pyrazolopyridines and warrant further preclinical evaluation of KDU731 as a drug candidate for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.

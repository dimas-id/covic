Hysterectomy is the most common surgical gynecologic procedure, which is frequently related to the treatment of leiomyoma. The laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer infection rates, and a faster return to daily activities. Most gynecologists do not recommend a hysterectomy via the vagina or a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) in the case of a uterus weighing more than 300 g. This case report presents the case of an LAVH undertaken in a 43-year-old patient with a uterus weighing 2,800 g. There are no definite guidelines concerning the procedure for a large uterus, and the literature is vague regarding the best surgical procedure for these cases. The size of the uterus does not seem to be an absolute contraindication for endoscopic surgery. This procedure relies entirely on the surgeon's ability.

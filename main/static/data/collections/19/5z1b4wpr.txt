BACKGROUND Ever since single-incision laparoscopic surgery was introduced 12 years ago, it has undergone many attempts to improve its feasibility and accessibility. We herein are reporting our early experience with SILS Port as a multichannel single-port access to perform laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Six morbidly obese patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy using the SILS Port as a common point of entry for 3 trocars. The same perioperative protocol was implemented for all 6 patients. RESULTS All 6 SILS Port laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies were successfully performed using this technique. The 3 super-obese male patients with central obesity required the insertion of a 5-mm subxiphoid trocar. The mean operating time was 123 minutes. There were no mortalities or postoperative complications noted during the immediate follow-up period of all 6 patients. CONCLUSION SILS gastrectomy using SILS Port is safe and feasible.

Haemorrhage is the most frequent revealing condition of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). We report a rare case of unruptured parietal bAVM revealed by spontaneous thrombosis of the main draining vein, responsible for a focal neurological deficit. The bAVM was embolized in emergency conditions; complete regression of the neurological symptoms was observed within five days after the embolization. Potential mechanisms of such spontaneous thrombosis of the bAVM's main drainage pathway as well as an exhaustive review of the literature concerning this rare revealing condition are presented and discussed.

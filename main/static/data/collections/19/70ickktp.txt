Recently a commercial antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit in the form of a dipstick (Bovine Enterichek, Biovet Inc.) was made available to bovine practitioners and producers for the rapid detection of Betacoronavirus 1 (BCV-1), Rotavirus A (RV-A), Escherichia coli K99(+), and Cryptosporidium parvum in feces from diarrheic calves. The diagnostic performance of Bovine Enterichek was evaluated in comparison with a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (mrtPCR). One hundred fecal samples were procured from diagnostic submissions to Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and were used for the assessment. The agreement quotient (kappa) in results for each pathogen between Bovine Enterichek and mrtPCR were 0.095 (BCV-1), 0.521 (RV-A), 0.823 (E. coli K99( + )), and 0.840 (C. parvum). In comparison to mrtPCR, the diagnostic sensitivity of Bovine Enterichek was 60.0%, 42.3%, 71.4%, and 81.5%, and the diagnostic specificity was 51.4%, 100%, 100%, and 98.6% for BCV-1, RV-A, E. coli K99( + ), and C. parvum, respectively. The current study suggested that Bovine Enterichek can be a rapid test tool in the field for detection of RV-A, C. parvum, or E. coli K99(+) in feces from calves at acute stage of clinical disease. However, test results for BCV-1 by the kit should be interpreted with caution due to low specificity and sensitivity of the kit.

Since March 2020, the world is involved in the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2. Some authors have described the ultrasonographic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in adults and children, but data on neonates are lacking. Our objective was to describe the ultrasonographic lung pattern on newborns with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Newborns who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in respiratory samples and were evaluated with point-of-care lung ultrasound (LU) from March to April 2020 were included. LU was performed bedside by a single investigator at the time of diagnosis and every 48 h during the first week following diagnosis. Six areas were studied. Three neonates were included. Infants’ comorbidities included meconium aspiration syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and Hirschsprung’s disease. One required mechanical ventilation. No deaths occurred. LU showed B-lines, consolidation, and spared areas. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion was observed Conclusions: LU could be of value when managing COVID-19 neonates. We describe the findings of lung ultrasound monitoring during the first week following diagnosis in three neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic demonstrated the significance of a global health threat to human beings. Although pandemic H1N1 vaccines have been rapidly developed, passive serotherapy may offer superior immediate protection against infections in children, the elderly and immune-compromised patients during an influenza pandemic. Here, we applied a novel strategy based on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized peripheral blood memory B cells to screen high viral neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from individuals vaccinated with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine PANFLU.1. Through a massive screen of 13 090 immortalized memory B-cell clones from three selected vaccinees, seven MAbs were identified with both high viral neutralizing capacities and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activities against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. These MAbs may have important clinical implications for passive serotherapy treatments of infected patients with severe respiratory syndrome, especially children, the elderly and immunodeficient individuals. Our successful strategy for generating high-affinity MAbs from EBV-immortalized peripheral blood memory B cells may also be applicable to other infectious or autoimmune diseases.

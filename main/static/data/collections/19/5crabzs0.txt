Coagulopathy (Tang, et al 2020) and a prothrombotic diathesis with high D‐dimer and fibrinogen levels (Al‐Samkari, et al 2020) are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Extensive thrombosis in small vessels and the microvasculature in lungs and extrapulmonary organs has been confirmed histologically (Zhang et al 2020). Early studies showed that the venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence in hospitalised COVID‐19 patients can be as high as 25% (Songping, et al 2020), and more recent studies have indicated this can be expanded to other macrovascular thrombotic complications, such as a higher than expected prevalence of pulmonary emboli in patients with COVID‐19 (Klok, et al 2020, Stoneham, et al).

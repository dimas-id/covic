BACKGROUND Tobacco consumption is the leading cause of preventable death globally. The global mortality burden of tobacco use lies predominantly in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). There is much evidence on the effectiveness of tobacco cessation RCTs in high-income nations. However, the evidence base in LMICs is far more limited. To effectively design randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that mitigate tobacco-related harms in LMICs, further understanding of RCTs in this environment will be helpful. We will provide quality evidence regarding the scope of tobacco cessation RCTs in LMICs. METHODS A scoping review of tobacco cessation RCTs will be conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science and Sociological Abstracts will be searched to capture current literature. We will review RCTs that have already been done on tobacco cessation in the LMICs. The key outcome will be tobacco cessation in adults. Examples of the key outcome include smoking abstinence and reduction of tobacco use. Study selection will conform to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines and study quality assessed with a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument. DISCUSSION As researchers attempt to minimize the harms from tobacco in LMICs, they need to be aware of scientific evidence to develop RCTs to achieve their aim. The review will complement the evidence base on tobacco cessation in LMICs.

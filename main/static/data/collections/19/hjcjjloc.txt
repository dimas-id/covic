Replicons based upon the human coronavirus 229E (HCV 229E) genome were transfected into HCV 229E infected cells. We demonstrate that a synthetic RNA comprised of 646 nucloetides from the 5' end and 1465 nucloetides from the 3' end of the HCV 229E genome is replication competent. We conclude that the cis-acting elements necessary for replication are located in these 5' and 3' genomic regions. Furthermore, we inserted the intergenic region of the HCV 229E nucleocapsid protein gene into this basic construct and were able to demonstrate the transcription of "subgenomic" RNAs.

The dermatological manifestations of CoVID-19 infection (CI) are variable, including livedo/necrosis, pseudochillblains, vesicular (monomorphic vesicles unlike varicella), urticarial and maculopapular subtypes1 . We report the cutaneous manifestations of two Han-Chinese patients in Singapore with CI and highlight their instructive features. Case 1 is a 43-year-old male with CI who developed truncal and limb rashes 12 days after onset of respiratory symptoms.

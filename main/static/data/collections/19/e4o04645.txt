The King Airway is a temporary airway device used primarily in the pre-hospital setting and typically exchanged for an endotracheal tube upon arrival to the emergency department. Since this usually occurs before imaging, many radiologists are unfamiliar with the King Airway. This lack of familiarity can have important consequences for the patient and treating team. The purpose of this article is to raise awareness of the King Airway among radiologists, emphasize appropriate positioning, and review the imaging complications of incorrect positioning.

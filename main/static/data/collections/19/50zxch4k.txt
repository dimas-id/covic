Chromatic thresholds were measured using the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT), the Colour Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test, and the Cone Specific Contrast Test (CSCT) at ground and 3780 m (12,400 ft) for subjects with normal color vision and red-green color vision defects. The CAD revealed a small (~10%) increase in the red-green thresholds for the trichromatic subjects and a similar increase in the blue-yellow thresholds for the dichromats. The other two color vision tests did not reveal any significant change in chromatic thresholds. The CAD results for the trichromats were consistent with a rotation of the discrimination ellipse counterclockwise with little change in the elliptical area. This alteration in the color discrimination ellipse can occur when retinal illumination is lowered.

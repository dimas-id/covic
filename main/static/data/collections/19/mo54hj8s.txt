Mountain riparian zones are excellent buffers for protecting aquatic ecosystems from nutrient runoff in nitrogen deposition processes due to fertilization and manure. Denitrification is a critical process for transferring soil N to the atmosphere. Denitrifying bacterial communities in soil are indicative of the soil quality of a functional ecosystem. We investigated the effects of physicochemical properties of soil on the diversity and activity of denitrifiers in the top-soil and sub-soil of two typical montane riparian meadows: a multi-colored and a flood-plain meadow. Illumina MiSeq 2500 sequencing of nirS showed that the multi-colored meadow had greater diversity and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers than the flood-plain meadow and that the total N content, ammonium content, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in soil differed significantly between the two types of meadows. The abundances of dominant denitrifiers at phylum and genus levels showed different responses to the two soil layers of the two meadow types. In top-soils, the highest abundance of Firmicutes was recorded in the multi-colored meadow, while in the flood-plain meadow, there was the highest abundance of Proteobacteria. The Actinobacteria abundance was the highest in top-soil and sub-soil of the flood-plain meadow. The abundance of Chloroflexi was the highest in top-soil of the flood-plain meadow and in sub-soil of the multi-colored meadow. The diversity of denitrifying bacteria was strongly influenced by variations of soil properties down the soil profile. Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed that the diversity and community composition of denitrifying bacteria were strongly associated with most of the soil properties. Therefore, physicochemical soil properties, and particularly the organic carbon, nitrate, and ammonium contents, influence the diversity and abundance of denitrifiers in soil.

Summary Background: How coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting management of myocardial infarction is a matter of concern, as medical resources have been massively reorientated and the population has been in lockdown since 17 March 2020 in France. Aims: To describe how lockdown has affected the evolution of the weekly rate of myocardial infarctions (non–ST-segment and ST-segment elevation) hospital admissions in Lyon, the second largest city in France. To verify the trend observed, the same analysis was conducted for an identical time window during 2018–2019 and for an unavoidable emergency, i.e. birth. Methods: Based on the national hospitalization database (Programme de médicalisation des systèmes d'information [PMSI]), all patients admitted to the main public hospitals for a principal diagnosis of myocardial infarction or birth during the 2nd to the 14th week of 2020 were included. These were compared with the average number of patients admitted for the same diagnosis during the same time window in 2018 and 2019. Results: Before lockdown, the number of admissions for myocardial infarction in 2020 differed from that in 2018–2019 by less than 10%; after the start of lockdown, it decreased by 31% compared with the corresponding time window in 2018–2019. Conversely, the numbers of births remained stable across years and before and after the start of lockdown. Conclusion: This study strongly suggests a decrease in the number of admissions for myocardial infarction during lockdown. Although we do not have a long follow-up to determine whether this trend will endure, this is an important warning for the medical community and health authorities.

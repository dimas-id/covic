This study was aiming to investigate the knowledge, practice and attitudes of secondary school and university students toward MERS-CoV infection. This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Study participants were recruited from several constituent colleges of King Saud University and secondary schools in Riyadh. Data were collected using self-administered, closed-ended questionnaires. Frequencies and proportions were computed for descriptive purposes. Chi square test was utilized to depict statistical difference between groups. Among the 1109 students who answered the questionnaires, 53.1% were male, and 46.9% were female. Level of knowledge about clinical presentation of MERS is generally similar among university and school students. The most frequently reported source of transmission is entering crowded spaces and being exposed to coughing and sneezing. Additionally, hand washing was the most commonly reported method of protection against the infection. The localized spread of MERS in Saudi Arabia and the number of fatalities associated with it might have increased public interest in understanding how to maintain proper precautionary measures both on a community and on an individual level. More emphasis should be placed on educating the student participants about preventive measures such as using tissues when sneezing and coughing and proper tissue disposal.

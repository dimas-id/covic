I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous work nurses are undertaking at the frontline of healthcare throughout the world currently. I also want to pay my respects to those nurses and their families and friends who have sadly lost their lives from COVID-19 emphasising the risks our workplaces present. The work of all nurses globally reinforces their pivotal role in healthcare during this time of crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic - something I never thought we would see to this scale in our lifetime.

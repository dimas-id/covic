We describe our technique of minimally invasive chest wall resection for primary lung cancer. We used this technique to perform two lobectomies combined with chest wall resection using thoracoscopic assistance. The intercostal muscles and vessels were divided using a vessel-sealing device, which was easy to maneuver through the access incision, achieving reliable hemostasis. In one patient, adding the utility port just over the dorsal edge of the chest wall proved useful for dissecting the distal area of the chest wall. This approach required only minimal incision without cutting the uninvolved extrathoracic musculature of the chest.

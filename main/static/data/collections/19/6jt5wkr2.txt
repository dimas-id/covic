This manuscript presents a model for HIV dynamics of seropositive individuals under antiretroviral treatment described from fuzzy set theory by two different approaches considering interactivity: differential equation with interactive derivative and differential equation with Fréchet derivative. It also establishes an identity between interactive derivative and fuzzy Fréchet derivative. With this identity, we establish when the solutions of the two differential equations coincide. Lastly, we present biological interpretations for both cases.

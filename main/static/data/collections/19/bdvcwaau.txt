In the event of an infectious disease outbreak, home health nurses are called upon to care for patients who have been placed on isolation precautions. To protect themselves, patients, and caregivers, nurses must be knowledgeable about infectious diseases and infection control procedures. A checklist is provided to assist the nurse and caregiver with guidance in performing the patient's care.

Hemodynamic monitoring and optimization improve postoperative outcome during high-risk surgery. However, hemodynamic management practices among Chinese anesthesiologists are largely unknown. This study sought to evaluate the current intraoperative hemodynamic management practices for high-risk surgery patients in China. From September 2010 to November 2011, we surveyed anesthesiologists working in the operating rooms of 265 hospitals representing 28 Chinese provinces. All questionnaires were distributed to department chairs of anesthesiology or practicing anesthesiologists. Once completed, the 29-item questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Two hundred and 10 questionnaires from 265 hospitals in China were collected. We found that 91.4% of anesthesiologists monitored invasive arterial pressure, 82.9% monitored central venous pressure (CVP), 13.3% monitored cardiac output (CO), 10.5% monitored mixed venous saturation, and less than 2% monitored pulse pressure variation (PPV) or systolic pressure variation (SPV) during high-risk surgery. The majority (88%) of anesthesiologists relied on clinical experience as an indicator for volume expansion and more than 80% relied on blood pressure, CVP and urine output. Anesthesiologists in China do not own enough attention on hemodynamic parameters such as PPV, SPV and CO during fluid management in high-risk surgical patients. The lack of CO monitoring may be attributed largely to the limited access to technologies, the cost of the devices and the lack of education on how to use them. There is a need for improving access to these technologies as well as an opportunity to create guidelines and education for hemodynamic optimization in China.

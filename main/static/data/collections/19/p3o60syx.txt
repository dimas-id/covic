AIM: Today, humanity is living through the third serious coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002â€“2003 and MERS in 2012. While the final cost on human lives and world economy remains unpredictable, the timely identification of a suitable treatment and the development of an effective vaccine remain a significant challenge and will still require time. The aim of this study is to show that the global collective effort to control the coronavirus pandemic (Covid 19) should also consider alternative therapeutic methods, and national health systems should quickly endorse the validity of proven homeopathic treatments in this war against coronavirus disease. SUBJECT AND METHODS: With the help of mathematics, we will show that the fundamental therapeutic law on which homeopathy is founded can be proved. RESULTS: The mathematical proof of the law of similarity justifies perfectly the use of ultra - high diluted succussed solution products as major tools in the daily practices of homeopathy. CONCLUSION: It is now time to end prejudice and adopt in this fight against Covid-19 alternative therapeutic techniques and practices that historically have proven effective in corresponding situations.

Prepubertal vaginal discharge is most commonly caused by vulvovaginitis and is rarely caused by lymphatic malformations, resulting in chylous vaginal discharge. The diagnosis of chylous vaginal discharge remains a challenge because of a knowledge gap. We describe a 12-year-old girl with intermittent vaginal discharge for 10 years. Although we found a high signal in the vagina on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the final diagnosis, vaginal lymphatic leakage, was established on lymphoscintigraphy. Lymphatic leakage in the vagina on lymphoscintigraphy was the key imaging feature of chylous vaginal discharge in this patient. Moreover, diffuse radioactivity was found in the abdomen and thorax on lymphoscintigraphy, which indicated the multiple cystic lymphatic malformations and intestinal lymphangiectasia combined with T2-weighted MRI. Thus, T2-weighted MRI could be used in combination with lymphoscintigraphy to simply identify chylous vaginal discharge.

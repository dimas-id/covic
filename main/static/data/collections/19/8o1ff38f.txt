The diverse, evolutionary architectures of proteins can be regarded as molecular fossils, tracing a historical path that marks important milestones across life. The B1-subfamily of GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) are medically significant proteins that comprise 15 transmembrane receptor proteins in Homo sapiens. These proteins control the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP as well as various vital processes in the body. However, little is known about the evolutionary correlation and conservational blueprint of this GPCR subfamily. We performed a comprehensive analysis to understand the evolutionary architecture among 13 members of the B1-subfamily. Multiple sequence alignment analysis exhibited six multiple sequence aligned blocks and five highly aligned blocks. Molecular phylogenetics indicated that CRHR1 and CRHR2 share a typical ancestral relationship and are siblings in 100% bootstrap replications with a total of 24 nodes observed in the cladogram. CRHR2 has the maximum number of extremely conserved amino acids followed by ADCYAP1R1. The longest continuous number sequence logos (74) were found between sequence location 349 and 423, and consequently, the maximum and minimum logo height recorded was 3.6 bits and 0.18 bits, respectively. Finally, to understand the model and pattern of evolutionary relatedness, the conservation blueprint, and the diversification among the members of a protein family, GPCR distribution from several species throughout the animal kingdom was analysed. Together, the study provides an evolutionary insight and offers a rapid method to explore the potential of depicting the evolutionary relationship, conservation blueprint, and diversification among the B1-subfamily of GPCRs using bioinformatics, algorithm analysis, and mathematical models.

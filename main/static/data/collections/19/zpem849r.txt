Abstract Twisted wind flows generated by the complex terrain of Hong Kong induce two types of complication to Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA), first, imposing a false boundary condition on the wind tunnel tests done for AVA and, second, creating an ambiguity in determining the approaching wind direction in calculating the probability of occurrence of winds. The latter issue is partially solved using correction methods in post-analysis of AVA but the accuracy of these methods is not yet accessed. This study employs two twisted wind profiles to test an urban area in a boundary layer wind tunnel to investigate the influence of twisted wind flows on the outcomes of AVA and to estimate the accuracy of three common correction methods: No-Shift, Threshold, and Proportional methods. The results reveal significant differences in wind speeds at the pedestrian level for twisted and conventional wind flows at locations with low building densities. The discrepancies in wind speeds are minimum at the locations where the density of buildings is high. The indicators calculated by the No-Shift method frequently deviate from those of the twisted wind flows, while the Threshold and Proportional methods routinely over-predict the indicators of AVA.

Simple and traditional hydrothermal fabrication of a novel balsam pear-shaped CuO with high SERS enhancement is presented. XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electronic microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscope), HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscope), UV-Vis, and Raman are adopted to ensure that this balsam pear-shaped CuO with dense nanoparticle protuberance is successfully prepared. The LOD of this CuO SERS substrate is 4.79 μg L-1 with R6G as molecular probe. By using DFT (density functional theory) calculation and FDTD (finite difference time domainmethod) simulation, both EM (electromagnetic enhancement) and CM (chemical enhancement) mechanisms are investigated, and the results show that these two-enhancement mechanisms can coexist in this balsam pear-shaped CuO. Finally, the prepared substrate has been applied for the determination of trace levels of paraquat in solution , and results show that its LOD for paraquat is 275 μg L-1 (optimum Raman band: 1646 cm-1 Raman shift), which is better than the government standard in China. A dexterous and facile way for fabrication of CuO SERS-active substrates with low cost and high performance, quite promising in detection of chemically hazardous substances and pesticide residue is provided.

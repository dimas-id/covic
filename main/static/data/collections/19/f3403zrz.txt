At the end of my doctoral studies, in 1988, I published a review article on the major steps of transcription and translation during the mammalian reovirus multiplication cycle, a topic that still fascinates me 30 years later. It is in the nature of scientific research to generate further questioning as new knowledge emerges. Our understanding of these fascinating viruses thus remains incomplete but it seemed appropriate at this moment to look back and reflect on our progress and most important questions that still puzzle us. It is also essential of being careful about concepts that seem so well established, but could still be better validated using new approaches. I hope that the few reflections presented here will stimulate discussions and maybe attract new investigators into the field of reovirus research. Many other aspects of the viral multiplication cycle would merit our attention. However, I will essentially limit my discussion to these central aspects of the viral cycle that are transcription of viral genes and their phenotypic expression through the host cell translational machinery. The objective here is not to review every aspect but to put more emphasis on important progress and challenges in the field.

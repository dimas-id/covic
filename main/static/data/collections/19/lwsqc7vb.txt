This study adapted an 8-item COVID-19 Perceived Risk Scale (CPRS) to assess COVID-19 related personal risk. The sample comprised 3,109 Turkish adults (49.98% males; Meanage = 38.64 Â± 10.40). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirmed a two-factor structure (cognitive and emotional dimensions), with satisfactory reliability. The subscales were correlated with severity and self-efficacy related to COVID-19 and mental health. Women reported higher levels of emotional risk, overall risk, and severity than men. Findings indicate that the CPRS is a psychometrically-sound scale for assessing COVID-19 related perceived risk. The scale can be used to assess people who are vulnerable to the risk of COVID-19.

Rhinovirus (RV) is a common respiratory viral infection linked to worsening of chronic respiratory diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF) and asthma. RV was tested by RT-PCR in samples (n = 465) collected from the upper (nasal swab, oropharyngeal suction, and sputum) and lower (bronchoalveolar washings) respiratory tract of 110 children with CF. Air samples (n = 52) collected from the operating theatres and outpatient clinics were tested for RV. RV was found in 43% of children <5 years suffering an exacerbation, and 12% of older children (5-17 years). RV particles were detected in the air of clinic rooms. Detection of RV is important in better understanding viral infections in patients with CF.

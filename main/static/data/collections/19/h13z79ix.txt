BACKGROUND Postoperative staple line leaks and bleeding are the most common reasons for complications in surgical procedures that involve organ resection, such as sleeve gastrectomy. Increasing the safety of these operations requires improving the instruments (endostaplers or endocutters) used for stapling and sectioning the tissues. METHODS We present a new prototype stapler for marketing in resection surgery, especially designed for the sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS We suggest that the medical instrument industry creates devices in which the channel along which the knife blade runs is located asymmetrically. This would allow more staples to be placed on the side of the gastric remnant, thus improving the sealing and hemostasis of the suture line and reducing the number of complications for patients as a result. CONCLUSIONS The application of new concepts in medical surgical devices can improve the safety of the procedures in our patients.

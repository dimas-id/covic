In a year's survey (December 1976-November 1977) of 190 children admitted to hospital with acute gastroenteritis, an "aetiological" agent was found in stools by electron microscopy in 41% of cases. Rotavirus were found in 34% of patients. We also found Coronavirus-like particles and Astrovirus-like particles in 25 and 5 stools, respectively. Improvements are awaited to demonstrate the responsibility of these virus in gastroenteritis.

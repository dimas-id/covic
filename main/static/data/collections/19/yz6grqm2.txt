During ovariohysterectomy, suspensory ligament (SL) rupture permits retraction of the ovary and distal ovarian pedicle through a limited ventral midline incision. This allows the surgeon to confirm that the pedicle is securely double ligated and includes no ovarian remnant. For less experienced surgeons, SL rupture is often difficult and daunting because the ligament is buried within the abdominal viscera and must be identified blindly by palpation. Furthermore, in dogs, the ligament must be digitally disrupted, which may cause hemorrhage and serious injury to surrounding structures such as the ovarian pedicle. This article describes step-by-step techniques to disrupt the SL in dogs and cats. We have found that these techniques can be taught easily and successfully to novice surgeons.

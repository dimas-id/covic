Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) are crucial for mitochondrial function and hence cellular energy production. A new paper in Development investigates the function of MRPs in early mouse development, thanks to a battery of knockout mutants. We caught up with first author (and recent graduate) Agnes Cheong and her supervisor Jesse Mager, Associate Professor at the Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, to find out more.

PURPOSE Aneurysm recanalization is a main concern after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. But to date, no systematic analysis of the risk factors affecting its occurrence has been conducted in a large series of patients. Analysis of Recanalization after Endovascular Treatment of intracranial Aneurysm (ARETA) is a multicenter, prospective trial whose aim is to collect a large series of patients treated endovascularly to analyze factors affecting aneurysm recanalization. STUDY DESIGN Patients with ruptured or unruptured aneurysms treated endovascularly will be enrolled from December 2013 to December 2014 in 19 participating centers in France. Patient and aneurysm characteristics will be recorded as well as the type of endovascular treatment and the occurrence of procedural or post-procedural complications. Post-procedural and follow-up imaging after one year will be analyzed independently by two readers using a 3-grade scale (complete occlusion, neck remnant, or aneurysm remnant). The progression of aneurysm occlusion will also be evaluated (improved, stable, or worsened). Aneurysm occlusion at one year and progression of aneurysm occlusion will be analyzed in light of patient, aneurysm, and treatment factors. CONCLUSION ARETA is a large, prospective, multicenter trial designed to assess predictive factors of aneurysm recanalization after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms.

Abstract Viral spread is considered a promising target for antiviral therapeutics, but the associated mechanisms remain unclear for gallid alpha herpesvirus 1 (ILTV). We previously identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) as a crucial host determinant of ILTV infection. The present study revealed accelerated spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. This phenomenon was independent of either viral replication or the proliferation of infected cells and could not be compromised by neutralizing antibody. Neither extracellular vesicles nor the direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections between adjacent cells contributed to the enhanced spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. Further genome-wide transcriptional profile analyses in combination with functional validation identified fatty acid metabolism as an essential molecular event during modulation of the intercellular spread and subsequent cytopathic effect of ILTV by Src. Overall, these data suggest that Src controls the cell-to-cell spread of ILTV in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner, which determines the virus's cytopathic effect.

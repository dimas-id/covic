INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic hemihepatectomy has not yet become widely accepted because of the technical difficulties in controlling each Glissonean pedicle laparoscopically. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE The subjects in the present study included 12 patients who underwent laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy between August 2007 and June 2011. Arantius' ligament was divided. Retracting the caudal stump of the ligament revealed a space between the left Glissonean pedicle and the liver parenchyma. The left Glissonean pedicle could be easily encircled by using an Endo Retract Maxi. No Glissonean injuries, including bleeding or biliary leakage, occurred in any of the 12 patients. DISCUSSION Therefore, the Arantius' ligament approach for the left extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle appears to be feasible and safe for successfully performing pure laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy.

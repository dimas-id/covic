In recent months, despite being aware of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries faced increasing epidemic of this disease. Nearly all countries tried to decrease human-to-human contact as the principal mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Other modes of transmission also need to be clarified in more depth, especially, the foodborne transmission (FBT). We assessed the effect of animal origin foods (AOF) consumption on the pandemic of COVID-19. For this purpose, we studied the relationship among 20 food supply as independent variables, and the parameter of Total Cases (TC) as dependent variable. The statistical analyses included parametric, non-parametric, frequentist, and Bayesian methods. Results showed a relationship between a group of AOF and TC. So, the role of FBT of COVID-19 should be more significant than previously thought. The possibility of Animal Origin Foodborne Transmission should be taken into more consideration. The perspective is to expand the surveillance of SARS-Cov-2 during the food production chain.

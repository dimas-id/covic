Purpose: In this study, the recently emerged advances in Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) are investigated and employed, for achieving the automatic and non-invasive diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Methods: A Computer-Aided Diagnostic model for the acceptable and non-invasive prediction of CAD using the State Space Advanced FCM (AFCM) approach is proposed. Also, a rule-based mechanism is incorporated, to further increase the knowledge of the system and the interpretability of the decision mechanism. The proposed method is tested utilizing a CAD dataset from the Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine of the University of Patras. More specifically, two architectures of AFCMs are designed, and different parameter testing is performed. Furthermore, the proposed AFCMs, which are based on the new equations proposed recently, are compared with the traditional FCM approach. Results: The experiments highlight the effectiveness of the AFCM approach and the new equations over the traditional approach, which obtained an accuracy of 78.21%, achieving an increase of seven percent (+7%) on the classification task, and obtaining 85.47% accuracy. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that the AFCM approach in developing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps outperforms the conventional approach, while it constitutes a reliable method for the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease. Conclusions and future research related to recent pandemic of coronavirus are provided.

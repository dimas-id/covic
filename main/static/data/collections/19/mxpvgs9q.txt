As an emerging global health challenge, COVID-19 requires international knowledge to reach novel possible therapeutic strategies, especially for intensive-care patients. During the early stages of infection, pneumocytes II are the primary infected cells, harming the respiratory system. We have previous evidence in murine models that MScâ€™s secretome can be used to treat pulmonary injuries induced with bleomycin, due to its content: growth factors, extracellular vesicles, and exosomes. We hypothesize and strongly recommend MSc secretome testing and production, in xenofree conditions, to be used as an alternative approach in SARS-Cov-2 patients in critical conditions.

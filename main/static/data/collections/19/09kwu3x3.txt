BACKGROUND The accuracy of pressure measurements by Manoscan high-resolution manometry (HRM) system is affected by pressure drift (PD). The PD is partly related to temperature and study duration, but other factors that contribute to errant pressure recording have not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify contributing factors to pressure recording error. METHODS In total, 660 in vitro experiments were conducted on seven HRM catheters to determine the effects of sustained pressure exposure, catheter impingement, temperature, duration of study, and immersion in saline or acid on recorded pressure and PD. KEY RESULTS At room temperature and without application of pressure, the PD was negligible. Application of sustained pressure significantly increased PD and catheter impingement of even 15° produced remarkable increases in the recorded pressure as well as post-recording PD. There was significant variability across sensors in their propensity to develop PD with temperature. Body (37°C) and freezing (0°C) temperatures resulted in significantly higher absolute value of PD in the opposite algebraic direction, respectively (for individual sensors). Although the overall trend was for higher PD with increasing temperature, some of the pressure sensors demonstrated inherently negative PD at body temperature. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES In addition to the known effects of temperature, both sustained pressure exposure and catheter impingement significantly affect the recorded pressure and the magnitude of the PD observed at the end of the recording. These effects can be substantial enough to result in erroneous manometric diagnoses.

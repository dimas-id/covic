PURPOSE The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an adjunctive therapy to radiotherapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy (CT) for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with TCM to treat NPC were extensively searched in eight databases. Two researchers independently assessed the quality and validity of the included trials and extracted outcome data. Thirteen RCTs were included for analysis. RESULTS Compared to using RT and/or CT, TCM combined with conventional cancer therapy had significantly improved Karnofsky performance status (KPS) [odds ratio (OR) 4.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.06-7.56]. TCM as an adjunctive therapy significantly reduced the serious adverse effects of RT to the oral mucosa and skin so that grade I+II prevailed [OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.31-3.66; OR 8.63, 95% CI 3.28-22.70, respectively]. The combined therapy significantly enhanced immunoregulation, improving the levels of CD3, CD4 T cells (OR 10.08, 95% CI 1.38-18.78; OR 7.08, 95% CI 2.41-11.74, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review suggests that TCM as a therapy adjunctive to RT and/or CT vs only RT and/ or CT has significant efficacy in terms of improvement of quality of life (QoL), alleviation of acute adverse effects, and enhancement of immunoregulation.

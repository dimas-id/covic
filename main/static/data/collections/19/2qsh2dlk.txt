As cancer patients are clinically known to be predisposed to COVID-19 infection, a corollary question of whether COVID-19 infection predisposes to cancer is explored. This article seeks to establish an association between novel coronavirus sequelae and cancer. A literature review on COVID-19 mechanisms of action, molecular responses it elicits upon infection and tumorigenesis pathways is conducted to establish this association. Major signaling pathways implicated in aberrant cellular growth are activated, the ensuing cytokine storm weakens the immune system response to tumors, and patients may develop cancer as a result of superimposed mutagenic and/or carcinogenic events. Future work needs to be performed to support this hypothesis, both in in vitro models and preclinical studies. COVID-19 patients may need to be monitored post-infection for developing cancer.

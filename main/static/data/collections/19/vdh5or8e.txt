INTRODUCTION Anastomotic dehiscence remains an important challenge for colorectal surgeons worldwide. Extensive research focused on performing a safe anastomosis is conducted with rats being the most used model when examining colorectal anastomoses. In daily clinical practice resorbable sutures are used when hand-sewn anastomoses are performed. However, in the experimental studies examining colorectal anastomoses, non-resorbable sutures have predominantly been used. The aim of this study was to compare a rapidly resorbable suture with a non-resorbable suture in experimental colorectal anastomoses. METHODS This was an experimental, prospective, case-control study using forty male Wistar rats. A colonic anastomosis was performed in a standardized fashion with either rapidly resorbable or non-resorbable suture. On the seventh postoperative day, the animals were sacrificed and the breaking strength of the anastomoses was measured. RESULTS No suffering or poor wellbeing of the animals was registered. No animals died or were prematurely sacrificed. At tissue harvesting, no anastomotic leaks or signs of peritonitis were registered. The breaking strengths of the anastomoses were comparable in the two groups (median 2.175 (range 1.479-2.880) Newton vs. 2.267 (1.290-4.042) Newton (P = 0.256) for resorbable and non-resorbable sutures, respectively). We found no significant correlations between pre- to postoperative weight-loss and anastomotic strength. CONCLUSION Non-resorbable suture was comparable with rapidly resorbable suture with regards to breaking strength of an experimental colonic anastomosis. Thus, absorbable suture can be used in experimental studies which then more easily can be compared to clinical practice.

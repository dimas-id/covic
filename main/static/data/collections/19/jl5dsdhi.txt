NETosis, being an alternative form of cell death is the creation of web-like chromatin decondensates by suitably primed neutrophils as a response to stimulus aimed at containing and eliminating the same. In certain situations, it causes more harm than benefit in the form of bystander damage directly or via activation of autoimmune mechanisms. Such pathophysiology finds evidence in both Periodontal disease and COVID-19. Coupled with impaired removal, NETs have been implicated in both these disease forms to promote a state of inflammation and be a source of constant harm to the tissues involved. This potentially forms groundwork to implicate Periodontal disease as predisposing towards adverse COVID-19 related outcomes.

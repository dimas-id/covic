An accelerated solid-phase enzyme-immunoassay has been developed which permits identification of antigens and antibodies to them within 30-40 min, even directly at the site of specimen collection. The method was tested on the models of foot-and-mouth disease virus, vesicular disease of swine, vesicular exanthema of swine, Aujeszky's disease, leukemia, and coronavirus infection of cattle.

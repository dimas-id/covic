This study was conducted to determine the compassion levels of nurses working in a university hospital. The study sample consists of 227 nurses who were available and participated in the research voluntarily during the study. The study data were collected by using “Nurse Description Form” and “Compassion Scale (CS).” In the analysis of the study data, number, percentage, mean and independent T test and ANOVA test were used. The total mean score of CS of the nurses was found as 97.02 ± 10.67. There was no statistically significant difference between gender, marital status and weekly work hours of the nurses and their total CS score means and total sub-scale score means. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant difference between the age variable of the nurses and the sub-scale of “separation,” between the education level of the nurses and their total CS score means. As a result, it was found that the level of compassion of the nurses was moderate and the level of education affected the compassion levels of the nurses.

Of the 206 patients who contracted Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore five developed large artery cerebral infarctions. Four patients were critically-ill and three died. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given to three patients. An increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was also observed among the critically-ill patients. We believe our experience warrants an increased vigilance against stroke and other thrombotic complications among critically-ill SARS patients in future outbreaks, especially if treatment such as intravenous immunoglobulin, that increases pro-thrombotic tendency, is contemplated.

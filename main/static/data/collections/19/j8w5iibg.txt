PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the results of a protocol for a tension-free reconstruction of the abdominal wall in midline incisional hernia repair, based on the rational association of components separation and prosthesis, independently of the hernia size. METHODS A total of 100 consecutive patients with midline incisional hernias were prospectively included in the study. Three groups according to the transverse diameter of the defect [group A (<4 cm, N = 18), group B (4-10 cm, N = 59), and group C (>10 cm, N = 23)] were identified. RESULTS Components separation was necessary in 54% of the patients: 16.7% (3/18) in group A, 59.3% (35/59) in group B, and 69.6% (16/23) in group C. Complete tension-free reconstruction was achieved in 87% of the patients: 94.4% (17/18) in group A, 91.5% (54/59) in group B, and 69.6% (16/23) in group C. Overall morbidity rate was 21% (21/100) [group A 16.7% (3/18), group B 22% (13/59), and group C 21.7% (5/23)]. Hospital length of stay was 3.7 ± 3.3 days (group A 1.83 ± 1.43 days, group B 3.05 ± 2.11 days, and group C 6.91 ± 4.45 days). Median follow-up was 25 months (interquartile range 12.25-55.25) with overall recurrence of 2%. CONCLUSION A tension-free abdominal wall reconstruction can be achieved in most cases of small and large midline incisional hernia repair, by a stepwise approach based on a rational association of components separation and double mesh prosthesis, with a low morbidity and recurrence rates.

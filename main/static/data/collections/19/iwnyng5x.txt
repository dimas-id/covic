An 18-year-old male patient who had undergone single-incision thoracoscopic surgery for left spontaneous pneumothorax was diagnosed with bilateral recurrent pneumothorax. We performed thoracoscopic reoperation and observed adhesions between the previous incision and the left lung. A bulla that was thought to be the cause of the recurrent left pneumothorax was found on the mediastinal side of previously ligated lesions. Longer incisions during single-incision thoracoscopic surgery may be more likely to cause adhesions. Despite the restricted view during surgery, care must be taken to identify all bullae. Use of reinforcement techniques is also important to prevent recurrence.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines which leads to lung damage, respiratory failure, and resultant increased mortality. Immunomodulatory therapy has the potential to inhibit cytokines and quell the immune dysregulation. Controversial data found improved oxygenation after treatment with tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, sparking a wave of interest and resultant clinical trials evaluating immunomodulatory therapies. The purpose of this article is to assess potential pro-inflammatory targets and review the safety and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies in managing patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19.

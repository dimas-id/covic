Computational argumentation has recently become a fast growing field of research. An argument consists of a claim, such as “We should abandon fossil fuels”, which is supported or attacked by at least one premise, for example “Burning fossil fuels is one cause for global warming”. From an information retrieval perspective, an interesting task within this setting is finding the best supporting and attacking premises for a given query claim from a large corpus of arguments. Since the same logical premise can be formulated differently, the system needs to avoid retrieving duplicate results and thus needs to use some form of clustering. In this paper we propose a principled probabilistic ranking framework for premises based on the idea of tf-idf that, given a query claim, first identifies highly similar claims in the corpus, and then clusters and ranks their premises, taking clusters of claims as well as the stances of query and premises into account. We compare our approach to a baseline system that uses BM25F which we outperform even with a primitive implementation of our framework utilising BERT.

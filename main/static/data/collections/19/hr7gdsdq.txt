INTRODUCTION Conventional laparoscopic procedures have been used for splenic diseases and concomitant gallbladder stones, frequently in patients with hereditary spherocytosis since 1990's. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of single-site surgery with conventional instruments in combined procedures. PRESENTATION OF CASE SERIES Six consecutive patients who scheduled for combined cholecystectomy and splenectomy because of hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia were included this study. Both procedures were performed via trans-umbilical single-site multiport approach using conventional instruments. All procedures completed successfully without conversion to open surgery or conventional laparoscopic surgery. An additional trocar was required for only one patient. The mean operation time was 190min (150-275min). The mean blood loss was 185ml (70-300ml). Median postoperative hospital stay was two days. No perioperative mortality or major complications occurred in our series. Recurrent anemia, hernia formation or wound infection was not observed during the follow-up period. DISCUSSION Nowadays, publications are arising about laparoscopic or single site surgery for combined diseases. Surgery for combined diseases has some difficulties owing to the placement of organs and position of the patient during laparoscopic surgery. Single site laparoscopic surgery has been proposed to have better cosmetic outcome, less postoperative pain, greater patient satisfaction and faster recovery compared to standard laparoscopy. CONCLUSION We consider that single-site multiport laparoscopic approach for combined splenectomy and cholecystectomy is a safe and feasible technique, after gaining enough experience on single site surgery.

Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug that has been used for over 50 years mainly to treat tapeworm infections. However, with the increase in drug repurposing initiatives, niclosamide has emerged as a true hit in many screens against various diseases. Indeed, from being an anthelmintic drug, it has now shown potential in treating Parkinson's disease, diabetes, viral and microbial infections, as well as various cancers. Such diverse pharmacological activities are a result of niclosamide's ability to uncouple mitochondrial phosphorylation and modulate a selection of signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β‐catenin, mTOR and JAK/STAT3, which are implicated in many diseases. In this highlight, we discuss the plethora of diseases that niclosamide has shown promise in treating.

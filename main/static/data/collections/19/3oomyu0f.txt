The epidemic caused by 2019 novel coronavirus has been highly concerned by the international community including World Health Organization (WHO). This is an endless battle against human life and health. Never forget the past, the teacher of the future. When you think hard, draw inferences from one instance. Many phenomena and problems in the work of epidemic prevention, control and treatment are worthy of our deep reflection. We should use scientific thinking and dialectical materialism to make a practical and realistic summary. The purpose is to win the battle as soon as possible, and more importantly, to avoid repeating the same mistakes and prevent trouble before it happens.

The authors present an easily manufactured modification of the Getinge Group Maquet Flow-i anaesthesia machine that gives it potential to be used long-term as an Intensive Care ventilator for emergency circumstances. There are some 7000 such machines in use worldwide, which could assist in increasing ICU ventilated bed capacity in a number of nations. The authors believe this modification has potential as a solution to increasing ventilator numbers for the COVID-19 pandemic, in hospitals where the Flow-i is underutilised for its designed purpose during this emergency.

Introduction Intubation can sometimes be difficult in patients with lesions in the mouth floor. Ameloblastoma is a frequently encountered tumor of the maxillofacial area. An extensive lesion might occupy the floor of the mouth, prevent displacement of the tongue, limiting the space for inserting a laryngoscope blade and resulting in difficult intubation even with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Case presentation A 66-year-old man (67 kg; 171 cm) with a mental swelling was diagnosed with ameloblastoma and scheduled for surgical resection. The tumor was extensive, occupying most of the anterior floor of the mouth. We were concerned about impossible direct laryngoscopy because the massive tumor in the floor of the mouth compressed the base of the tongue against the posterior wall of the pharynx, restricting the space for inserting the laryngoscope blade. Therefore, we planned to perform awake nasal fiberoptic intubation to secure the airway. Although the procedure was complicated by the massive tumor, successful intubation was achieved by hand-assisted alteration of the direction of the endotracheal tube (ETT) under direct laryngoscopy. Discussion Awake fiberoptic intubation was complicated by the tumor protrusion to deviate the ETT. Discovering of the ETT deviation by the insufficient blade insertion facilitated visualizing the vocal cords with the fiberoptic scope. Conclusion Identification of ETT deviation even with insufficient blade insertion and hand-assisted alteration of the direction of the ETT might raise the chances of successful fiberoptic intubation. The anesthesiologist should be aware of the likelihood of failed fiberoptic intubation and plan for alternative approaches to secure the airway.

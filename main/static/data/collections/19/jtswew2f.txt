PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate the outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lung metastases from head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine patients (two men and seven women; mean age, 61.6 y) with 45 lung metastases (mean diameter, 1.1 cm; range, 0.4-2.7 cm) from head and neck ACC underwent RF ablation in 30 sessions. Primary endpoints were technical success, technique effectiveness, and procedural complications. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS). RESULTS RF ablation was technically successful for all 45 metastases. The median tumor follow-up period was 37.1 months (range, 12.9-128.3 mo). Local progression occurred in six tumors, two of which were treated again and subsequently showed complete response. Major complications (pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement) occurred in five sessions (16.7%). The median patient follow-up period was 61.6 months (range, 20.5-134.5 mo). Two patients died of disease progression at 38.9 and 61.6 months after RF ablation, respectively, whereas the other seven remained alive at the end of the study. OS rates from the initial RF ablation were 100% at 3 years and 83.3% at 5 years (mean survival time, 106.4 mo). OS rates from the treatment of the primary site were 100% at 5 years and 62.5% at 10 years (mean survival time, 210.1 mo). CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation is an acceptable and effective local treatment for lung metastases from head and neck ACC. However, further study is needed to evaluate its effect on patient survival.

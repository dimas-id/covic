Venous thrombosis is a major public health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality and has a substantial impact on the quality of life. Over the years, it has become more apparent that anticoagulation alone in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is insufficient in the prevention of postthrombotic syndrome, which adversely impacts the quality of life of the patient, and it is insufficient in preventing recurrence of DVT. With the advent of innovative catheter designs to deliver thrombolytic therapies in the treatment of DVT, there have been significant advances in the management of DVT. We review the management of DVT with emphasis on catheter-directed interventions.

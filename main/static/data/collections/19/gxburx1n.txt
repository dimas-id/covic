INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to introduce and examine a modified mechanical end-to-side esophagogastrostomy method ("reverse-Tornado" anastomosis) in laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy. METHODS Five patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy were analyzed retrospectively. Esophagogastrostomy in the anterior wall was performed in three patients, and esophagogastrostomy in the posterior wall was performed in two patients. Clinicopathological features, operative outcomes (operative time, operative blood loss), and postoperative outcomes (complications, postoperative hospital stay, reflux esophagitis) were evaluated. RESULTS Operative time was normal (278 min). There was no marked operative blood loss, postoperative complications, prolonged hospital stay, or reflux esophagitis. CONCLUSION Esophagogastrostomy was completed in a normal time with reverse-Tornado anastomosis. This method can be safe and can enable good postoperative quality of life.

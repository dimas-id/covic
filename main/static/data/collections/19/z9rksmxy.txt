The demand for rapid and simple development of a vaccine against a newly emerging infectious disease is increasing worldwide. We previously revealed that UV-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virions (UV-V) elicited high levels of humoral immunity and a weak Th0 response in mice immunized subcutaneously. To ensure the safety of such a whole inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine, we additionally treated the UV-V vaccine with formalin, resulting in the UV-F-V vaccine. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the UV-F-V+alum vaccine in mice revealed that it generated comparable neutralizing serum anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody levels as the UV-V+alum vaccine. Moreover, both vaccines induced similar frequencies of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody-producing cells in bone marrow. Interestingly, the UV-F-V vaccine induced fewer IgG(2a) subtype antibodies and higher interleukin-4 production in vaccinated mice than did UV-V. Thus, UV-F-V imposes a Th2-type bias on the immune response, unlike UV-V. We propose here that doubly-inactivated SARS-CoV virions by UV and formalin constitute a safe vaccine that may effectively induce neutralizing antibodies in humans.

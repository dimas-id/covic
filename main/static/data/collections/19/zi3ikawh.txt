We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of laparoscopic suturing with or without barbed suture for myomectomy or hysterectomy. We used a systematic electronic search strategy of published literature using the following databases: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, and OVID MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations databases. The following medical subject heading terms, key words, and their combinations were used: laparoscopy, myomectomy, hysterectomy, and barbed suture. Studies in which women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy or hysterectomy using barbed suture or conventional suture were selected. The main outcome measures chosen for the current meta-analysis were operative time, suturing time, estimated blood loss or change in hemoglobin level, and degree of suturing difficulty. The results of the meta-analysis studies were expressed as the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Compared with the use of conventional suture, the total operative time of laparoscopic myomectomy (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI, -0.88 to -0.28) and the suturing time to close the uterine incision (SMD = -1.38; 95% CI, -1.86 to -0.90) were significantly reduced with the use of barbed suture. Meta-analysis on laparoscopic hysterectomy shows that the time to suture the vaginal vault, the total operative time, and the estimated blood loss were comparable with or without the use of barbed suture. The degree of suturing difficulty was reported in 2 randomized trials. Compared with the use of conventional suture, the degree of suturing difficulty was lower with the use of barbed suture (SMD = -1.39; 95% CI, -1.83 to -0.95). The use of barbed suture facilitates laparoscopic suturing of myomectomy incision and closure of the vaginal vault. Its use is associated with a reduced operative time of laparoscopic myomectomy.

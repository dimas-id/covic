BACKGROUND Laparoscopic fenestration is one of the treatment options for symptomatic hepatic cysts, either solitary or in context of polycystic liver disease (PLD), but indications, efficacy and surgical techniques are under debate. METHODS A systematic literature search (1950-2017) of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library was performed (CRD42017071305). Studies assessing symptomatic relief or symptomatic recurrence after laparoscopic fenestration in patients with symptomatic, non-parasitic, hepatic cysts were included. Complications were scored according to Clavien-Dindo. Methodological quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS Out of 5277 citations, 62 studies with a total of 1314 patients were included. Median NOS-score was 6 out of 9. Median follow-up duration was 30 months. Symptomatic relief after laparoscopic fenestration was 90.2% (95% CI 84.3-94.9). Symptomatic recurrence was 9.6% (95% CI 6.9-12.8) and reintervention rate was 7.1% (95% CI 5.0-9.4). Post-operative complications occurred in 10.8% (95% CI 8.1-13.9) and major complications in 3.3% (95% CI 2.1-4.7) of patients. Procedure-related mortality was 1.0% (95% CI 0.5-1.6). In a subgroup analysis of PLD patients (n = 146), symptomatic recurrence and reintervention rates were significantly higher with respective rates of 33.7% (95% CI 18.7-50.4) and 26.4% (95% CI 12.6-43.0). Complications were more frequent in PLD patients, with a rate of 29.3% (95% CI 16.0-44.5). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic fenestration is an effective procedure for treatment of symptomatic hepatic cysts with a low symptomatic recurrence rate. The symptomatic recurrence rate and risk of complications are significantly higher in PLD patients.

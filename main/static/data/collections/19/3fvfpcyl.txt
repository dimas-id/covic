In non-polarized cell culture models, influenza virus has been shown to enter host cells via multiple endocytic pathways, including classical clathrin-mediated endocytic routes (CME), clathrin- and caveolae-independent routes and macropinocytosis. However, little is known about the entry route of influenza virus in differentiated epithelia, in vivo site of infection for influenza virus. Here, we show that in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney type II (MDCK II) cells, influenza virus has a specific utilization of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway and requires Eps15 for host cell entry.

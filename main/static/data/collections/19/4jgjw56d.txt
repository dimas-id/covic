The COVID-19 pandemic has altered many aspects of personal and professional life, including how psychiatry is practiced and how trainees are taught. This Open Forum outlines the challenges faced by psychiatric training directors in adult as well as child and adolescent psychiatry in meeting the educational needs of trainees amid this international crisis. Prioritizing trainee protection and education as well as high-quality treatment for patients, the authors discuss effective communication strategies, rapid telepsychiatry expansion into clinical practice, curricular adjustments, and the importance of well-being. This Open Forum concludes with reflections and considerations for training directors as they prepare for subsequent stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

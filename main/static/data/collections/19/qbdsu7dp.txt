OBJECTIVES To investigate the role of chest CT for the diagnostic work-up for patients with suspected infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The clinical data and imaging findings of the first nucleic acid-negative COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared with the first nucleic acid-positive patients. RESULTS Compared with the first nucleic acid-positive patients, the onset time of the first nucleic acid-negative patients was shorter [(3.58±2.94) d], but the diagnosis was longer [(3.92±3.66) d]. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the clinical data and radiological findings between the 2 groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION Chest CT examination is important to avoid COVID-19 missed diagnosis due to false negative nucleic acid.

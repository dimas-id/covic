To date, we have no French data about the psychiatric consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the confinement. In the largest French psychiatric emergency centre, we compared the average number of consultations per day during the confinement with the same period preceding the confinement and with the same periods of previous years, and we observed a significant drop in attendance. Our team had to adapt promptly to these changes in public mental health services, and we set up a telephone hotline dedicated to psychiatric patients and their families, in order to prevent a secondary psychiatric crisis.

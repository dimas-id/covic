The international discourse about public health ethics is becoming more intensive and complex. The starting point is bioethics. The debate about public health ethics is simultaneously a debate about an adequate identity of public health, its goals, tasks and standards. In Germany there is a tremendous need to take part in this discourse. German experiences within the traditions of social medicine, social hygiene and medical ethics could significantly contribute to the international discussion. Unfortunately the German speaking public health community has hardly acknowledged the topic of ethics. The reasons for this are not explicitly known. The Angloamerican discourse is much more developed, but the concepts, terms and paradigms should not simply be transferred. They should critically be proven.

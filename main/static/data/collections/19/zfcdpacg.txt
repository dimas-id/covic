OBJECTIVE To analyze the features of organ dysfunction in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the factors inducing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in these patients. METHODS The clinical data of 135 SARS patients and 13 patients with severe SARS complicated by MODS were studied retrospectively. RESULTS SARS could result in organ dysfunction. Its incidence rate was high, the patients' condition was severe, and the mortality was higher. SARS could end in MODS and the mortality was 92.3x. The main dysfunctioning organs were the lung (76.9x), the immune system (92.3x), the cardiovascular system (30.8x), the blood system (61.5x), the liver (38.5x), and the kidney (53.8x). CONCLUSION Dysfunction of organs are closely correlated with prognosis of SARS. The causes of MODS in SARS are probably injury to the immune system and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

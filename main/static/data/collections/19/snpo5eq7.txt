Dynamic conversational agent-based support for collaborative learning has shown significant positive effects on learning over no-support or static-support control conditions in prior studies. In order to understand the boundary between human-led and AI-led support for collaboration, we compare in this study an approach where the agentâ€™s primary role is to help students regulate their own collaboration with two more typical prompting strategies that are used only during a reflection phase: one designed to provide a specific informational focus for the reflection, and the other designed to draw out evaluation, elaboration, and exploration of alternative perspectives. Significant positive effects on learning over and above just the human-led form of support are observed when either of the prompting strategies are used.

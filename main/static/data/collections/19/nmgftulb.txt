PURPOSE OF REVIEW To provide updates regarding the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). RECENT FINDINGS Within the past years, five moderate-sized randomized controlled trials evaluated different DAPT durations after percutaneous coronary intervention. These studies included a significant percentage of ACS patients that varied from 30 to 75% depending on the study. Results suggest that in selected populations prolonging DAPT does not offer additional protection from ischemic events and increases bleeding complications. However, results from a large-scale registry illustrate that DAPT durations beyond 6 months are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Moreover, a multicenter registry demonstrated that the context underlying DAPT cessation is an additional correlate of outcomes after stent implantation. SUMMARY Current guidelines suggest 12 months of DAPT after an initial presentation with ACS. Emerging evidence suggest that in selected populations shorter duration might be acceptable.

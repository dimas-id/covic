Blume et al. studied the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the mismatch between social and biological sleep-wake timing as well as sleep. Increased flexibility of social schedules reduced the mismatch while sleep quality was reduced, possibly due to increased burden. These adverse effects may be alleviated by daylight exposure and physical exercising.

On February 1, 2020, China announced a novel coronavirus CoVID-19 outbreak to the public. CoVID-19 was classified as an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although the disease was discovered and concentrated in Hubei Province, China, it was exported to all of the other Chinese provinces and spread globally. As of this writing, all plans have failed to contain the novel coronavirus disease, and it has continued to spread to the rest of the world. This study aimed to explore and interpret the effect of environmental and metrological variables on the spread of coronavirus disease in 30 provinces in China, as well as to investigate the impact of new China regulations and plans to mitigate further spread of infections. This article forecasts the size of the disease spreading based on time series forecasting. The growing size of CoVID-19 in China for the next 210 days is estimated by predicting the expected confirmed and recovered cases. The results revealed that weather conditions largely influence the spread of coronavirus in most of the Chinese provinces. This study has determined that increasing temperature and short-wave radiation would positively increase the number of confirmed cases, mortality rate, and recovered cases. The findings of this study agree with the results of our previous study.

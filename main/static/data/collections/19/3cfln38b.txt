OBJECTIVE To describe the development of the Patient Barcode Registration System (PBRS) over time and confirm the usability and feasibility of the system's latest version during a large trauma drill. METHODS The development of a PBRS started around 1993 aiming to provide an effective tool for patient registration, tracking, and tracing during major incidents. The PBRS uses wristbands with barcodes to follow and register patients in the care process. During a large trauma drill, 120 patients and 40 relatives were registered and traced in the system. Errors in registration, tracking, and tracing of persons were registered. RESULTS Of the 120 patients, no patient data were lost and patients could be traced in real time throughout the treatment process by the command team. Strategic decisions could be made based on the information provided by the system. Patient relatives were easily matched and government agencies received regular updates on the number and characteristics of the patients. CONCLUSION The PBRS is a usable, feasible, and sustainable patient tracking and tracing tool to be used during the hospital response to major incidents. Lessons learned during the last 20 years include the need for continuous updates to withstand the challenge of time. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2017;11:244-250).

Management of distal ureter by en block resection during radical nephrectomy for upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is considered as standard of care. In this report, we describe our technique for management of lower ureter which utilizes both the endoscopic and laparoscopic approach. The nephrectomy including the dissection of the lower ureter was completed laproscopically. The ureteral orifice was scored using a hook passed through a 24 Fr nephroscope and secured .Transurethral suturing of the defect with SewRight SR5 device passed through the working channel of the 24 Fr nephroscope was done. Our report highlights the fact that management of lower ureter in TCC pelvis can be done endoscopically/laproscopically without compromising the oncological principles. Our novel technique demonstrates feasibility of intra mural resection of the ureter and primary closure of the bladder endoscopically.

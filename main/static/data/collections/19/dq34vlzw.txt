EDTA dependent pseudothrombocytopenia (EDTA-PCTP) is a phenomenon that characterized by a spurious decrease of platelets in vitro due to the aggregation of platelets in EDTA anticoagulant blood samples. We report the first case of a transient appearance of EDTA-PCTP in a patient with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). A 59-year-old woman was admitted to the isolated ward for severe type of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the time of admission, her platelet count was in a normal range. Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding. Since the peripheral blood smear showed a platelet aggregation, a blood sample anticoagulanted with citrate was tested and the number of platelet was normal. The phenomenon disappeared after 17 days when the patient was cured. This case emphasized the importance of peripheral blood smear and clinical manifestation, especially in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.

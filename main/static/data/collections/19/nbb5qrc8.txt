Background: Why some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe COVID-19 disease and others do not is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for severe disease and to lay the basis for risk stratification based on demographic data and health records. Methods: The design was a matched case-control study. Cases were ascertained as all those with a positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 in the national virology laboratory database. Those who had been admitted to a critical care unit or had died within 28 days of a positive test were classified as severe cases. For each case, ten controls matched for sex, age and primary care practice were selected from the population register. For cases and controls we extracted all diagnostic codes from the past five years of hospital discharge records, all drug codes from prescriptions encashed during the past nine months and we linked to the national diabetes register. Rate ratios for associations with severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. The performance of predictive models for severe COVID-19 was estimated by cross-validation. Findings:In a logistic regression based on the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios were 2.26 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.86 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio (95% CI) 14.9 (12.7, 17.5). Univariate rate ratios (95% CIs) for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 4.88 (3.26, 7.31) for Type 1 diabetes, 2.58 (2.30, 2.88) for Type 2 diabetes, 2.40 (2.14, 2.70) for ischemic heart disease, 3.90 (3.52, 4.32) for other heart disease, 3.10 (2.81, 3.42) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 12.1 (8.4, 17.4) for chronic kidney disease, 5.5 (4.8, 6.2) for neurological disease, 4.70 (2.90, 7.62) for chronic liver disease and 4.11 (2.72, 6.21) for immune deficiency or suppression. 1443 (65%) of the severe cases and 6536 (30%) of the controls had at least one of these listed conditions. In those aged under 40 years the frequencies of any listed condition were 26 (43%) in cases and 46 (8%) in controls. The odds ratio for severe disease associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past year was 16.6 (13.3, 20.6) and the odds ratio associated with at least one hospital admission in the past five years was 5.6 (5.0, 6.2); these associations remained strong and significant after adjusting for the listed conditions. Most cases without listed conditions had either prescriptions or hospitalisations, and highly significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. A predictive model based on age and sex alone had an expected information for discrimination of 1.81 bits. In the model conditional on age and sex further demographic variables provided another 0.46 bits, and this increased to 0.89 bits when listed conditions were included, and to 1.5 bits when indicator variables for hospital diagnoses and prescription encashments were also included. Conclusions:Along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 disease is strongly associated with past medical history; most younger persons developing severe disease have an underlying medical condition. The comorbidities associated with increased risk are not limited to the lists of risk conditions designated by public health agencies. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in medical and prescribing records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is over.

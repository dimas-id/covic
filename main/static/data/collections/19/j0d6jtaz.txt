This chapter discusses the need for greater levels of scientific literacy in contemporary society. It identifies three major curriculum thrusts that collectively inform scientific literacy – learning science, learning about science, and doing science – with a principal focus on learning about science, often referred to as nature of science (NoS). Particular emphasis is given to the importance of the language of science, the values, norms and traditions of scientists, and the reality of contemporary practice. The remainder of the chapter discusses direct and indirect connections with scientists and the impact of these on developing understanding about science. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the possibilities and pitfalls of such connections.

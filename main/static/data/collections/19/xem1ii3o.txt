Muscle flap transposition is one of the surgical treatment options for empyema with alveolarpleural fistula (APF) or bronchopleural fistula (BPF). This surgical procedure is invasive because it is typically performed by standard thoracotomy. We performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) debridement, decortication, and obliteration of an empyema cavity using a pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) flap harvested through minimal skin incisions for a case of acute empyema with APF. This VATS procedure is effective and less invasive and can be a new option for the thoracoscopic surgical treatment of acute empyema with APF.

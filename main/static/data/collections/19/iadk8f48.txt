INTRODUCTION Acute appendicitis is one of the most commonly encountered surgical problems in everyday practice. With the recent increase in popularity of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), several techniques for SILS appendectomy have already been described. We herein describe our own simplified technique for single incision transumbilical laparoscopic appendectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS From December 2008 to August 2009, a total of 26 patients consented for single incision laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were collected. RESULTS Our technique was successful in 19 out of 26 (73.1%) patients, while seven patients required the placement of additional trocars. None of the patients needed conversion to an open approach. Mean OR time was 45.9 min. The mean length of stay was 1.1 day. Only one patient had developed postoperative umbilical wound infection. CONCLUSION Our technique for single incision laparoscopic transumbilical appendectomy is safe feasible, and reproducible. Prospective randomized studies comparing the single incision laparoscopic approach with its conventional multiport counterpart are necessary to confirm the conclusions of our early experience.

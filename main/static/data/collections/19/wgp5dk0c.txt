The family Togaviridae is described; it contains four genera--Alphavirus, Flavivirus, Pestivirus and Rubivirus--and additional members. The main characteristics of the family are as follows: single-stranded, linear RNA, molecular weight about 4 X 10(6). Virions have isometric nucleocapsids surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope containing host cell lipid and virus-specified polypeptides including one or more glycopeptides. Virions yield infectious RNA. There are at least 80 members; all the alphaviruses and most flaviviruses are arboviruses in the biological sense.

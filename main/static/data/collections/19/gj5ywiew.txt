The concept of "global health" that led to the establishment of the World Health Organization in the 1940s is still promoting a global health movement 70 years later. Today's global health acts first as a guiding principle for our effort to improve people's health across the globe. Furthermore, global health has become a branch of science, "global health science," supporting institutionalized education. Lastly, as a discipline, global health should focus on medical and health issues that: 1) are determined primarily by factors with a cross-cultural, cross-national, cross-regional, or global scope; 2) are local but have global significance if not appropriately managed; and 3) can only be efficiently managed through international or global efforts. Therefore, effective global health education must train students 1) to understand global health status; 2) to investigate both global and local health issues with a global perspective; and 3) to devise interventions to deal with these issues.

BACKGROUND Pelvic floor functioning is an important concern for women requiring a hysterectomy for endometrial cancer. The incidence of pelvic floor symptoms has not been reported in women who have undergone a hysterectomy for early-stage endometrial cancer. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate pelvic floor function in women who have had surgical treatment for early-stage endometrial cancer as part of the multinational Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium trial and to compare patients' outcomes who had total abdominal vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN A multinational, phase III, randomized noninferiority trial compared disease-free survival of patients who had total abdominal hysterectomy vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy. This substudy analyzes the results from a self-administered validated questionnaire on pelvic floor symptoms (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory) administered preoperatively, and at follow-up visits 6, 18, 30, 42, and 54 months postoperatively. RESULTS Overall, 381 patients with endometrial cancer were included in the analysis (total abdominal hysterectomy, n = 195; total laparoscopic hysterectomy, n = 186). At 6 months postsurgery both groups experienced an improvement in Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory scores compared to presurgical pelvic floor well-being (total abdominal hysterectomy: mean change -11.17; 95% confidence interval, -17.11 to -5.24; total laparoscopic hysterectomy: mean change -10.25; 95% confidence interval, -16.31 to -4.19). The magnitude of change from baseline in pelvic floor symptoms did not differ between both treatment groups up to 54 months postsurgery. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that pelvic floor function in terms of urinary, bowel, and prolapse symptoms are unlikely to deteriorate following abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy and are reassuring for women undergoing hysterectomy for early-stage endometrial cancer.

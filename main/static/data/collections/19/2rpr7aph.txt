Motivation Recombinant protein production is a widely used technique in the biotechnology and biomedical industries, yet only a quarter of target proteins are soluble and can therefore be purified. Results We have discovered that global structural flexibility, which can be modeled by normalised B-factors, accurately predicts the solubility of 12,216 recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. We have optimised B-factors, and derived a new set of values for solubility scoring that further improves prediction accuracy. We call this new predictor the ‘Solubility-Weighted Index’ (SWI). Importantly, SWI outperforms many existing protein solubility prediction tools. Furthermore, we have developed ‘SoDoPE’ (Soluble Domain for Protein Expression), a web interface that allows users to choose a protein region of interest for predicting and maximising both protein expression and solubility.

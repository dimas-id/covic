Mice are the premier mammalian models for studies of human physiology and disease, bearing extensive biological similarity to humans with far fewer ethical, economic, or logistic complications. To facilitate glycomic studies based on the mouse model, we comprehensively profiled the mouse serum N-glycome using isomer-specific nano-LC/MS and -LC/MS/MS. N-Glycans were identified by accurate mass MS and structurally elucidated by MS/MS. Porous graphitized carbon nano-LC was able to separate out nearly 300 N-linked glycan compounds (including isomers) from just over 100 distinct N-linked glycan compositions. Additional MS/MS structural analysis was performed on a number of novel N-glycans, revealing the structural characteristics of modifications such as dehydration, O-acetylation, and lactylation. Experimental findings were combined with known glycobiology to generate a theoretical library of all biologically possible mouse serum N-glycan compositions. The library may be used for automated identification of complex mixtures of mouse N-glycans, with possible applications to a wide range of mouse-related research endeavors, including pharmaceutical drug development and biomarker discovery.

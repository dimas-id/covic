To find a conclusive definition for contemporary purposes and uses, we look at many of the various definitions of disasters through cataclysmic events, historical records, public policies, laws, and organizational usage. Our natural progression leads us to modern theories of disaster and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) that have had to tackle new types of disasters that are being brought about by the interconnectivity of societies, people, diseases, technology, etc., increasing in magnitude and complexity like what was seen in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 and on-setting disasters like climate change. After looking at all the historical evidence, we come to a definition for the term disaster for modern usage and what it means for policy implications.

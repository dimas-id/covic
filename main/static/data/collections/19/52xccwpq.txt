OBJECTIVE to present our initial experience of laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) renal surgery. METHODS between May 2009 and March 2010, nine nephrectomies and one cyst decortication were performed in nine patients. Eight of the procedures were done with three 5mm trocars inserted through a unique peri-umbilical incision. In two cases, a specific single-port device was used. All operations were achieved with a 5-mm 30Â° lens and conventional laparoscopic instruments. The specimens were entrapped in a 10mm endoscopic bag and extracted through the umbilical incision. RESULTS mean age was 56 years old. Mean BMI was 23.5 [19-34]. Mean operative time was 149min [80-240], and estimated blood loss was 90ml [20-250]. None of the patients required blood transfusion. Mean length of stay was 4.1 days [3-5]. Only one major complication occurred (functional occlusion). One conversion to conventional laparoscopy was necessary in a case of inflammatory kidney. Histologic exam showed benign lesions (cyst and non functional kidney) in seven cases, and papillary carcinoma in three cases. CONCLUSION LESS surgery is feasible. Its advantages over conventional laparoscopy are not clear. LESS is a new procedure that should benefit from the improvement of technical instrumentation.

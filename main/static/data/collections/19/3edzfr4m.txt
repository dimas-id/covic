INTRODUCTION The renal nephrometry scoring (RNS) system enables prediction the feasibility of nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) in renal masses. There is insufficient data regarding the outcome of robot-assisted NSS in tumors with RNS ≥10. We reviewed the trifecta outcomes of patients undergoing robotic NSS with high RNS and compare it with tumors of low and intermediate RNS. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our prospectively maintained data of all robot-assisted NSS were reviewed, and those with RNS of ≥10 were identified. Patient data, outcomes and postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate were compared between high, intermediate and low RNS patients. RESULTS In high RNS group, the mean age of the patients was 53 years (male:female = 15:3). Mean diameter of tumors was 6.28 cm (3.0-10.5 cm). Mean operative time was 173.61 ± 52.66 min and mean warm ischemia time was 27.85 ± 5.27 min. Mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 363.89 ± 296.45 ml. Mean hospital length of stay was 5.39 ± 1.91 days (3-9 days). When compared with low and intermediate RNS, only EBL and need for pelvicalyceal system repair was significantly higher in high RNS group. Postoperative complications, renal function preservation and oncological outcomes at 3 months were comparable in all the three groups. CONCLUSION Robot-assisted NSS is feasible with comparable outcomes in tumors with high RNS.

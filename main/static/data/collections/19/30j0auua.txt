Coronaviridae (CoVs) are single stranded RNA viruses. βeta‐CoVs encompasses Bat coronavirus (BCoV), the human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus. In December 2019, a new βeta‐CoVs was identified in Wuhan, China, SARS‐CoV‐2. The genome sequencing demonstrated a 79.5% and 96.2% identity to SARS‐CoV and a bat CoV genome, respectively, supporting the interspecies transmission and the origin of this new pandemia.

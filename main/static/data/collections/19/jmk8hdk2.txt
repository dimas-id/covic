Purpose. – In the geriatric units of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, 129 cases of fever (38° C or more) were recorded prospectively during the 1995–1996 winter period in a population of 503 hospitalised patients (25.6%), and were investigated for the detection of a viral aetiology. Methods. – In febrile patients, a standard form was used to record clinical and biological parameters, including the results of investigations for respiratory viruses from a nasal swab and dual serum specimens. Results. – A clinical or radiological respiratory infection was found in 69 cases (53.5% of all cases of fever), including 14 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. In comparison to nonviral respiratory infections, the RSV infections were characterised by the prevalence of anorexia (57% vs 20%, P < 0,05) and rhinorrhea (64% vs 5%, P < 0,01). No influenza infection was recorded despite the concomitant circulation of influenza virus in the community. A nosocomial outbreak of RSV infection (nine cases, attack rate of 18.7%) was identified in a long-stay care unit. Conclusion. – This study illustrates the high prevalence (10.9%) of RSV infections in elderly patients with fever during this season and the importance of hygienic measures to control the spread of nosocomial outbreaks.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To show a new laparoscopic technique of hysteropexy for uterine retrodisplacement (retroversion and/or retroflexion). DESIGN Narrated step-by-step explanation of the Bologna hysteropexy technique using descriptive text and an educational video. SETTING Tertiary referred center of minimally invasive gynecology, Sant'Orsola Hospital, Bologna University. INTERVENTIONS The Bologna hysteropexy is proposed as an additional procedure after surgical laparoscopic interventions for benign gynecologic disease. The technique consists of 2 semicontinuous absorbable sutures (Biosyn monofilament no. 1 [Covidien, Mansfield, MA] with 2/3 inch diameter needle, 36 mm) suspending the uterus to the anterior abdominal wall, through the plication and shortening of round ligaments. A knot is tied intracorporeally between the 2 free ends of the semicontinuous sutures, drawing a V shape figure and resulting in uterine ventrosuspension. CONCLUSION The Bologna technique hysteropexy is simple and quick to perform. It is effective in suspending the uterus in anteverted and anteflexed positions at 6-month ultrasound follow-up. No perioperative complications were recorded. It can be done with a standard surgical suture-passer and does not add additional cost to surgery. Furthermore, an absorbable suture is desirable for fertile women.

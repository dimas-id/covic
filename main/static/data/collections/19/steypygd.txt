In this chapter we shall review recent developments in computational vaccinology, highlighting work in the area of epitope and antigen identification, and the discovery of delivery vectors and adjuvants. These diverse activities all have the potential to reduce significantly the laboratory resource needed for efficient vaccine discovery. We discuss how computational analysis of pathogenic genomes by epitope mapping and reverse vaccinology can provide viable vaccine targets.

We describe the third confirmed case of novel coronavirus infection in a resident of the Arabian Peninsula. Our patient presented, as did 2 prior cases, with severe pneumonia and renal dysfunction requiring intensive care support including assisted ventilation. However, unlike the earlier cases, and despite underlying chronic disease and a single kidney, he survived his infection and has been discharged home. The Ministry of Health continues active surveillance for additional cases. As this case report goes to press, 2 additional confirmed cases have been identified in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Contact investigations are in progress. Future work will focus not only on the origin of the virus and mechanisms of transmission, but also the host factors that influence pathogenesis and prognosis.

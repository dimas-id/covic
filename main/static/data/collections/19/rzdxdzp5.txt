Abstract Objective To describe a relatively rare hypersentivity reaction with pulmonary manifestations in a pediatric patient. Data sources Electronic medical records. Study selection Patient treatment in the pediatric critical care unit. Data extraction and synthesis Electronic medical records. Conclusions Eosinophilic pneumonias are rare in the pediatric population. Peripheral eosinophilia is not necessary to make the diagnosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage is the diagnostic study of choice. Lung biopsies are rarely needed to make the diagnosis. The treatment of choice is steroids. If steroids fail to improve the patient's condition, consider IVIG, and cyclosporine A.

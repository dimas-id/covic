BACKGROUND Obsessive compulsive disorder has been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a kind of anxiety disorder characterized by a combination of repetitive thoughts and repetitive behaviors for reducing anxiety. We aimed to investigate the frequency of OCD in patients with MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS 112 patients with multiple sclerosis participated in this study. Demographic data were obtained through using patients' medical records. MS clinical subtypes, the duration of disease and neurological signs were determined. The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to quantify disability in MS, which was confirmed by psychiatrist through using DSM-IV criteria for OCD. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to rate the severity of OCD. Data analysis was performed by SPSS for Windows software (version 15.0) and Chi-square test and Exact test were used for analyzing data. RESULTS The frequency of OCD in patients with MS was 16.1%. The OCD was significantly correlated with a higher EDSS score (X(2) = 86.515, P = 0.0001). OCD was also significantly correlated with the duration of disease, phenotypic subgroup, cranial nerve involvement, cerebellar, autonomic, sensory and motor nerve involvement. CONCLUSIONS OCD might be considered in quantifying disability of patients with MS. It might be suggested that all the patients with MS to be screened for OCD.

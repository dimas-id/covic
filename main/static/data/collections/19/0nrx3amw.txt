The majority of all acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are viral in aetiology. Bacterial infection, either as a prime cause or secondary to the initial viral infection, can be effectively eradicated with appropriate drug therapy. A course of penicillin is usually effective in cases of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Macrolide antibiotics may be prescribed as an alternative, especially if Î²-lactamase-producing strains are present. Roxithromycin achieves high tissue concentrations, and cure rates between 85 and 100% have been reported in various URTIs.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a highly infectious viral disease Clinical observations have shown that Qing-Fei-Da-Yuan (QFDY) granules have good anti-COVID-19 effects, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear In this study, we explored the potential mechanism of QFDY with regard to its anti-COVID-19 effect We first screened the active chemical constituents of QFDY based on the pharmacodynamic activity parameters, followed by screening with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform The Uniprot database was used for querying the corresponding genes of the target, and Cyoscape 3 6 1 software was used to construct the network of herb-compound-target Protein interaction analysis, target gene function enrichment analysis, and signal pathway analysis were performed via STRING database, Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, and KEGG Pathway database Molecular docking was used to predict the binding capacity of the core compound with COVID-19 hydrolase 3CL and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) The results showed that a network of herb-compound-target was successfully constructed, with key targets involving PTGS2, HSP90AA1, CAMKK2, NCOA2, and ESR1 Major metabolic pathways affected were those in cancer, procancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and apoptosis The core compounds, such as quercetin, luteolin, and naringenin, showed a strong binding ability with COVID-19 3CL hydrolase;compounds such as anemasaponin C and medicocarpin showed a strong binding ability with ACE2 Thus, it is predicted that QFDY has the characteristics for multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel overall control The mechanism of action of QFDY in the treatment of COVID-19 may be associated with the regulation of genes co-expressed with ACE2, the regulation of inflammation and immune-related signaling pathways, and the influence of COVID-19 3CL hydrolase and ACE2 binding ability

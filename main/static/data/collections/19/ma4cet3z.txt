There have been over 7 million cases and almost 413,372 deaths globally due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated disease COVID-19, as of June 11, 2020. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there is a common source for these infections. The overall sequence similarities between the spike protein of 2019-nCoV and that of SARS-CoV are known to be around 76-78% and 73-76% for whole protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Thus, they have the potential to serve as drug and/ or vaccine candidate. However, the individual response against 2019-nCoV differs due to genetic variations in the human population. Understanding the variations in Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that may affect the severity of 2019-nCoV infection could help in identifying individuals at higher risk from the COVID-19. A number of potential drugs/vaccines as well as antibody/cytokine-based therapeutics are running in various developmental stages of preclinical/clinical trials against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV with substantial cross-reactivity, which may be used against COVID-19. For diagnosis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard test for initial diagnosis of COVID-19. Kit based on serological tests are also recommended for investigating the spread of COVID-19 but it is challenging due to antibodies cross-reactivity. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent reports available regarding the host-pathogen interaction, morphological and genomic structure of the virus, and the diagnostic techniques as well as available and potential therapeutics against COVID-19.

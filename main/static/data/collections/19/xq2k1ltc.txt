As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread, some patients are presenting with abdominal symptoms without respiratory complaints. Our case series documents four patients who presented with abdominal symptoms whose abdominopelvic CT revealed incidental pulmonary parenchymal findings in the imaged lung bases and were subsequently confirmed positive for COVID-19 via laboratory testing. It remains to be seen whether these patients will eventually develop respiratory symptoms. While it is possible that the patients' abdominal complaints are coincidental with CT findings, it is interesting that patients can have such extensive incidental disease in the lungs on CT without respiratory symptoms.

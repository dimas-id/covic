Swine influenza virus (SIV) RNA and antigen were detected in 15 naturally infected pigs by in situ hybridization using a nonradioactive digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe and by immunohistochemistry using an influenza virus H1N1-specific monoclonal antibody. A 582-base pair cDNA probe for viral RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein of SIV type A H1N1 strain was generated by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry gave similar results for serial sections from each of 15 lung samples. Positive cells typically exhibited a dark brown (in situ hybridization) or red (immunohistochemistry) reaction product in the nucleus and cytoplasm without background staining. A strong positive signal for both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was detected mainly in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells. A less intense signal was detected in the interstitial and alveolar macrophages. Simultaneous detection of hybridization and immunohistochemical signals on serial sections provided evidence that SIV had replicated in positive cells. The in situ hybridization technique developed in this study was useful for the detection of SIV RNA in tissues taken from naturally infected pigs and may be a valuable technique for studying the pathogenesis of SIV infection.

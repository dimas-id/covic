OBJECTIVE To investigate whether angiographically defined occlusion type could predict of the etiology of acute intracranial large artery occlusion and the stentriever response. METHODS We reviewed consecutive patients with acute intracranial large artery occlusion who underwent endovascular treatment and examined their workups for embolic sources. Patient demographics, laboratory findings, hyperdense artery sign, and angiographic occlusion type (truncal-type or branching-site occlusion) were compared between embolic sources (+) and (-) groups. These variables were also compared between stentriever failure and success groups. Details of endovascular procedures were also compared according to occlusion type. RESULTS A total of 259 patients (mean age 70.3 years; M:F = 132:127) were finally included. Of these patients, 216 (83.4%) were assigned to the embolic sources (+) group after thorough evaluation. Young age, no coronary artery disease, and truncal-type occlusion (odds ratio [OR] 9.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.74-22.0) were independently associated with the embolic source (-) group. Of the overall group, 224 patients (86.5%) underwent stentriever-based endovascular treatment. Hypertension, diabetes, high C-reactive protein level, and truncal-type occlusion (OR 32.2; 95% CI 7.78-133.0) were independent predictors of stentriever failure. Truncal-type occlusion was associated with more reocclusion (77.3% vs 5.0%), resulting in recanalization failure by the stentriever (81.8% vs 20.3%), a longer puncture-to-recanalization time (118.0 vs 49.5 minutes), and more rescue treatment for final successful recanalization (78.9% vs 7.0%). CONCLUSIONS Angiographic occlusion type is an independent predictor of stentriever refractoriness and of the underlying stroke mechanism.

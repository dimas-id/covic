Sequencing of part of a clone from a transmissible gastroenteritis virus genome cDNA library led to the identification of the gene encoding the E1 matrix protein. The amino acid sequence of the primary translation product predicts a polypeptide of 262 residues which shares many features with the previously characterized murine hepatitis virus and infectious bronchitis virus E1 proteins. However, N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that a putative signal peptide of 17 residues was absent in the virion-associated polypeptide. The predicted mol. wt. of the mature unglycosylated product, 27,800, is in agreement with the experimental Mr value.

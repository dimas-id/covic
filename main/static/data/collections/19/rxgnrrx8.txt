As reporting of COVID‐19 at the US state level has become more granular, many states have reported a higher proportion of deaths among African‐Americans. In our study, we assessed state level data on race, population density, age, obesity rates, insurance data, GDP, per capita healthcare resources (hospital‐beds/ventilators per‐capita), median household income and high‐school graduation rates. We report a higher death rate among states with a greater proportion of African‐American residents despite adjusting for case rates and state‐level factors. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study looking at state level data (from across the US) and mortality with COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

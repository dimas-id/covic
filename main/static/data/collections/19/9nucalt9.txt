This study provides evidence that subcutaneous vaccination of cattle with a commercially available modified-live virus combination vaccine can help reduce clinical signs associated with infectious bovine rhinotracheitis infections in feedlot animals vaccinated at the time of arrival. Calves vaccinated 72 or 96 hours before challenge had reduced clinical signs, lower body temperatures, lower virus titers, and 39% to 76% greater weight gains compared with nonvaccinated controls.

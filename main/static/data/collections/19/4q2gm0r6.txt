OBJECTIVE Stapling systems can significantly improve lung tissue approximation during open and video-assisted thoracic surgery. We here evaluated an iDrive Ultra powered stapling system for lung resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS The iDrive Ultra powered stapling system( Covidien) is the powered version of the EndoGIA stapling system. It comprises hand-held control unit combined with a loading unit,which is a powered EndoGIA- cartridges, for use in open and minimally invasive thoracic surgery. The mounted control unit has uses as follows:controlling the accurate placement of the cartridge by orientating the tip of the rigid shaft;and controlling the closure of the stapler and the firing. From April to July 2013, the system was used for a consecutive series of 15 patients during thoracic lung surgery. RESULTS There were 6 women and 9 men, with a mean age of 62 years. The following procedures were performed:lobectomies, segmentectomies, and wedge resections. The system was used for stapling lung parenchyma for wedge resection(5 patients), segmentectomy( 2 patients), or fissure division (9 patients). There were no stapling failures and no complications related to use of the staplers. CONCLUSIONS The new powered and handy stapling system is safe and efficient for lung resection.

Live recombinant bacteria represent attractive antigen delivery systems able to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses against heterologous antigens. The first live recombinant bacterial vectors developed were derived from attenuated pathogenic microorganisms. In addition to the difficulties often encountered in the construction of stable attenuated mutants of pathogenic organisms, attenuated pathogens may retain a residual virulence level that renders them unsuitable for the vaccination of partially immunocompetent individuals such as infants, the elderly or immunocompromised patients. As an alternative to this strategy, non-pathogenic food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) maybe used as live antigen carriers. This article reviews LAB vaccines constructed using antigens other than tetanus toxin fragment C, against bacterial, viral, and parasitic infective agents, for which protection studies have been performed. The antigens utilized for the development of LAB vaccines are briefly described, along with the efficiency of these systems in protection studies. Moreover, the key factors affecting the performance of these systems are highlighted.

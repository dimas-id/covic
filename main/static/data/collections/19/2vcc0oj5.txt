We have developed an aptameric enzyme subunit (AES) which can detect the DNA in a homogeneous solution. The AES is an artificial enzyme subunit composed of an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer bearing a target-molecule binding site. We connected a probe DNA to a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer at its 5′ or 3′ end. The inhibitory activity of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer bearing the probe DNA decreased compared to that of the original aptamer; however, it recovered upon hybridization with the target DNA. Using this AES, we were able to detect target DNAs by measuring the thrombin activity in a homogeneous solution.

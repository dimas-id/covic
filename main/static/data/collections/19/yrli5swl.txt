Abstract This study used the conceptual framework of organizationalâ€“public relationship cultivation strategies to quantitatively evaluate how the Chinese government's international media relationship cultivation strategies at news conferences changed from 2001 to 2009. It found that the Chinese government has begun to enhance its international media relations efforts but that there is room for further improvement.

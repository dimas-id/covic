The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has substantially impacted the global supply chain of personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals. At the time of our project, local and national recommendations for PPE were based on supply rather than provider or patient safety, and we intended to give providers a better option than scarves and cloth masks. Our objective was to utilize in-house 3D-printing capabilities to make 3D-printed face masks for our orthopaedic trauma providers that use filters that were verified to be nearly equivalent to the filtration material that is found in N95 masks. To meet this goal, we used open-source face-mask design files from the National Institutes of Health with use of an Ultimaker S3 desktop printer. We printed 50 reusable face masks with replaceable filter inserts and distributed them to physicians, physician assistants, and residents in a midwestern level-I trauma center. Our work highlights the innovative solutions that are being explored on a local level to confront the nationwide PPE shortage in the United States.

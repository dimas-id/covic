Macrophages belong to the mononuclear phagocytic system lineage. This cell type is unique in that it is a crucial player in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. The material described in this overview is a brief description of what I presented as a World's Poultry Science Association-sponsored lecture at the annual meetings of the Poultry Science Association in 2002. Therefore, I have not attempted to present an up-to-date review of literature on this topic. Rather, I have summarized some salient research accomplishments made by our research group over the years in the area of avian macrophage biology and function.

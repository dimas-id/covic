Early in June 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced yet another unique infectious disease outbreak, the first evidence of community-acquired monkeypox in the United States. By July 8, 2003, a total of 71 cases had been reported to CDC from 6 states. When emerging infectious diseases are reported in the United States, particularly when these reports receive widespread media attention, obstetrician-gynecologists may be called upon to rapidly respond to queries from their patients and to address certain infectious disease risks within their clinical practices. In addition, obstetrician-gynecologists may have specific concerns about the implications for an infectious disease outbreak, such as monkeypox, for pregnant women. Therefore, it is important that obstetrician-gynecologists know how to gather up-to-date and accurate information about infectious disease outbreaks and that they be familiar with the public health response system for responding to such outbreaks.

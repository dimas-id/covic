SUMMARY Veterinary pharmacy is an often unknown and therefore, underrepresented career path for pharmacists. Uniquely, pharmacists—even untrained in veterinary medicine—are the only healthcare professional legally allowed to provide care for human and non-human patients 1. The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a peculiar situation that, not only highlights veterinary pharmacy as a career path, but stresses the role veterinary pharmacists, trained in both human and veterinary medicine, can play in zoonotic diseases. Specialized training in veterinary medicine allows the pharmacist to serve as a resource for both physicians as well as veterinarians during zoonotic events by helping to ascertain feasibility of therapeutic options given the species. Additionally, veterinary pharmacists involved in translational research would be vital for the drug development process as they would be aware of biologic nuances between the species and how they may affect the ultimate therapeutic outcome 2.

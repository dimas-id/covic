After intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection of infant mice with CCHF virus, virus titers in liver remained significantly higher than in other organs except blood (serum). Within the liver, virus antigen was first found by immunofluorescence (IFA) in Kupffer cells followed by more extensive hepatic spread. Later, virus was found in other organs including brain and heart. Ribavirin treatment significantly reduced infant mouse mortality and extended the geometric mean time to death. Ribavirin treatment reduced CCHF virus growth in liver and significantly decreased, but did not prevent, viremia. Despite a substantial viremia, infection of other organs including brain and heart was not detected in ribavirin-treated mice. A hepatotropic virus subpopulation with less neurovirulence than the parent was isolated from liver of ribavirin-treated mice (single dose, 100 mg/kg). After serial passage in placebo-treated mice, the exclusive hepatotropism was lost.

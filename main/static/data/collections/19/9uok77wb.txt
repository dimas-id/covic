This retrospective study aimed to clarify the short- and mid-term outcomes of elderly patients who underwent surgery to treat left-sided native valve infective endocarditis (LSNIE). Between July 2005 and September 2015, 179 patients underwent surgical treatment for active LSNIE at a single institution. Patients were classified into two groups: ≥65 years (elderly group) and <65 years (non-elderly group). Clinical features, surgical information, postoperative complications, and three-year survival rates were compared. The average ages were 74.2 ± 6.4 and 45.2 ± 12.6 years in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively. The elderly group had a higher predicted mortality rate and a lower incidence of preoperative septic emboli-related complications. Echocardiographic assessments of infected valves were generally homogenous between the groups. The elderly patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than the non-elderly patients (26.3% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). For patients who survived to discharge, the three-year cumulative survival rates were 75.0% ± 8.2% and 81.2% ± 3.4% in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively (P = 0.484). In conclusion, elderly patients are at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality after surgery for LSNIE. However, once elderly patients are stabilized by surgical treatment and survive to discharge, the mid-term outcomes are promising.

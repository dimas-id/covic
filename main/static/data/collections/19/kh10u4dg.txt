We present a retrospective analysis of the available articles on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) published since the outbreak of the disease. SARS is a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Originating in Guangdong, Southern China, at the end of 2002, it has spread to regions all over the world, affecting more than 8000 people. With high morbidity and mortality, SARS is an important respiratory disease which may be encountered world-wide. The causative virus was identified by a WHO-led network of laboratories, which identified the genome sequence and developed the first molecular assays for diagnosis. For the respiratory physician, detecting SARS in its earliest stages, identifying pathways of transmission, and implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies are all important. The WHO and the CDC have published helpful definitions of ‘suspected’ and ‘probable’ cases. However, the symptoms of the disease may change, and laboratory tests and definitions are still limited. Even in a situation of no new cases of infection, SARS remains a major respiratory health hazard. As with influenza virus outbreaks, new epidemics may arise at the end of each year.

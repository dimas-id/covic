Lung transplantation reduces mortality in patients with end-stage lung disease; however, only approximately 21% of lungs from potential donor patients undergo transplantation. A large number of donor lungs become categorized as unsuitable for lung transplantation as a result of lung injury around the time of brain death. Limiting this injury is key to increasing the number of successful lung procurements and subsequent transplants. This narrative review by a working group of pulmonologists, respiratory therapists, and lung transplant specialists elucidates principles of mechanical ventilatory support that can be used to limit lung injury in potential lung donor patients and examines the implementation of protocolized strategies in enhancing the procurement of donor lungs for transplantation.

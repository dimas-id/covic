Fruits and vegetables are major components of a healthy diet, but are subject to severe pest pressure. Approximately 30% of all insecticides applied worldwide are used to control insects affecting vegetables and fruits. Transgenic, or more commonly referred to as genetically modified (GM), vegetables and fruits offer unique opportunities for controlling insects and the pathogens they transmit. Aphid transmitted viruses have been particularly difficult to manage by tactics aimed at reducing aphid populations and in many cases there has not been virus resistant plant germplasm. Farmers in the USA have benefited from having GM virus resistant squash and papaya available to them as tools in their overall IPM programs. In the USA, Bt sweet corn has proven effective for control of Lepidoptera and continues to be accepted in the fresh market. However, the best opportunities for GM vegetables and fruits are in developing countries where 83% of the worldâ€™s population lives, the majority of vegetables and fruits are produced and pest problems are most acute.

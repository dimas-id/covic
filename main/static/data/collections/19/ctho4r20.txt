A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China by the end of 2019, and then, the disease spread across China and became a global pandemic. Nevertheless, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 until now. In addition to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19 is active to study and screen effective antiviral drugs, and has found that chloroquine, an old antimalarial,shows activity against SARS-CoV-2. Then, chloroquine was included in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Currently, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, two chloroquine derivatives, are under clinical use. Although these two agents exhibit similar mechanisms of drug actions, there is a difference between these two chemicals in terms of target populations, therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions. This paper summarizes the currently available data and experiences from clinical treatment for malaria with chloroquine drugs, so as to provide insights into the more rational use of chloroquine agents for the treatment of COVID-19.

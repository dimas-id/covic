During physiological stress (e.g., exercise, hypoxia), blood flow is shunted to specific anatomical regions to protect critical organs; yet, splenic blood flow in these circumstances remains to be investigated. Despite being classically viewed as a non-critical organ, recent experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests the spleen plays a significant role in cardiovascular pathophysiology. We hypothesized that splenic blood flow is prioritized in the development of heart failure (i.e., chronic state of reduced cardiac output). Five-week-old male Wistar rats were randomized for either myocardial infarction (MI; n = 58) or sham (n = 56) surgery. At 2, 5, and 9 weeks post-surgery, Doppler ultrasound measurements of the splenic, left renal, left common carotid, and left femoral arteries were performed. Cardiac function was assessed at all time points using echocardiography and at 9 weeks post-surgery using invasive hemodynamic analysis. Splenic and cerebral blood flow was preferentially maintained at 9 weeks post-MI, whereas blood flow to the lower limb and kidney were reduced. Spleen size increased by 5 weeks post-MI and remained elevated. Splenic blood flow was maintained in conditions of decreased cardiac output, when other tissues showed decreased blood flow. The maintenance of blood flow in the face of decreased cardiac output indicates that splenic function is being prioritized during heart failure.

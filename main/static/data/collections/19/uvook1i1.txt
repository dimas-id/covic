OBJECTIVES Few studies have reported on the utility and efficacy of laparoscopic colectomy in the paediatric population. We aim to compare the characteristics and outcomes of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent open vs laparoscopic treatment at our centre. METHODS A 10-year retrospective review was performed. Collected data included demographics, indication for surgery, operative characteristics, histopathology results, post-operative course and peri-operative complications. RESULTS A total of 58 patients underwent subtotal colectomy for IBD, with 38 laparoscopic procedures. The cohort included 33 males and 25 females with a mean age at surgery of 12.9 Â± 3.3 years. The pre-operative diagnosis was ulcerative colitis in n = 41, Crohn's disease in n = 5 and indeterminate colitis in n = 11. There was an 84.2% concordance between the pre-operative and the post-operative histological diagnoses. Overall, 34 (58.6%) patients had complications, of which 19 (32.7%) patients required return to theatre. The complication rate was significantly smaller for laparoscopic compared to open procedures (42.1% vs 75%) as well as for elective compared with emergency colectomies (38.4% vs 75%). Four patients (10.5%) required conversion to open approach. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic approach is feasible and safe in most paediatric patients with IBD and has a lower complication rate and better recovery than open procedures, especially when performed in an elective setting.

Abstract: The 1968 UNESCO Biosphere Conference (in partnership with the FAO, WHO and the UN) was the first intergovernmental conference to consider both human and health ecology from a scientific point of view. Thus, it has a leading role in addressing health issues related to ecological diversity on a global scale. It insists on the need for integrated, planned, multidisciplinary policy action for the use and conservation of natural resources within the framework of international cooperation.

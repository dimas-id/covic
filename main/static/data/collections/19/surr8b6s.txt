OBJECTIVE To determine whether opportunistic salpingectomy in patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy has any deleterious effects on ovarian reserve and surgical risk. STUDY DESIGN We performed a retrospective review of patients who had no desire for future child bearing and who were undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy for symptomatic myomas at 4 institutions. Among them, 41 patients concurrently underwent opportunistic salpingectomy (the opportunistic salpingectomy group) and 65 patients did not undergo salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy (the no-salpingectomy group). The primary and secondary outcome measures were change of ovarian reserve determined by the rate of decline in the anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) level from before surgery to 3 months post-surgery, and surgical outcomes. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There were also no differences in surgical outcomes, such as operative time, operative bleeding, hospital stay, or complications between groups. The decline rate in AMH was 18.6% (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-46.8%) in the opportunistic salpingectomy group and 10.4% (IQR 2.6-46.8%) in the no-salpingectomy group, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.593). CONCLUSION Opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy was not associated with negative effects on ovarian reserve or increased surgical risk.

Aminopeptidase N (CD13) was recently identified as a molecular target of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor Ezetimib. Regarding that CD13 is expressed in lipid rafts of monocytic cells, we have investigated whether Ezetimib influences raft function in these cells. Expression of raft‐associated antigens (CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD16, CD36, and CD64) was followed by flow cytometry and/or immunoblot in human monocyte‐derived macrophages in response to in vitro administration of Ezetimib. Cellular redistribution of CD13 was assessed by confocal imaging. Ezetimib significantly decreased the surface expression of CD13, CD16, CD64, and CD36; furthermore, it induced a shift of CD13 from plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles, and thus it quite likely modulated monocytic raft‐assembly. © 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology

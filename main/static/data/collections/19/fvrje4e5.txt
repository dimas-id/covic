ETS-related gene (ERG) is a member of the E-26 transformation-specific (ETS) family of transcription factors with roles in development that include vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, haematopoiesis and bone development. ERG's oncogenic potential is well known because of its involvement in Ewing's sarcoma and leukaemia. However, in the past decade ERG has become highly associated with prostate cancer development, particularly as a result of a gene fusion with the promoter region of the androgen-induced TMPRRSS2 gene. We review ERG's structure and function, and its role in prostate cancer. We discuss potential new therapies that are based on targeting ERG.

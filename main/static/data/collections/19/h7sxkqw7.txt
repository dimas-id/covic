Abstract China's participation in global governance, inspired by the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, is driven by the guiding principle of “building a community of shared future for mankind”. China has been promoting the Belt and Road Initiative and South-South Cooperation and has made significant contributions to the prosperity of human beings. Along with the opportunities that globalization brought about such as the World Health Organization and the boom in the economy, global health challenges also emerged. This resulted in certain obstacles for China when it sought to advocate the Belt and Road Initiative and when it attempted to carry out its strategy to address global health issues. What are the emerging challenges for global health? What can China do for global health? Why does global health need China? We tried to address these questions as China's global engagement continues to expand in the new era. This article makes the case for Chinese approaches, including getting involved in public health, being consistent in addressing local conditions, sharing China's experience with handling health services, and strengthening government-led action while being guided by relative policies. China has a lot to offer in the promotion of global health and in overcoming the challenges and risks that this goal currently faces. Thus, China should be considered an inseparable part of global health governance and bilateral health development cooperation.

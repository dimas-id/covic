Background: There is conflicting data regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 hospitalized patients Objective: To assess the efficacy of HCQ in increasing SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance Design: Retrospective observational study Setting: Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Participants: Hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection Intervention: None Measurements: The primary outcome was the time from a confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab to turn negative. A negative nasopharyngeal swab conversion was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case followed by two negative results using RT-PCR assay with samples obtained 24 hours apart Results: 34 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Nineteen (55.9%) patients presented with symptoms, and 14 (41.2%) had pneumonia. Only 21 (61.8%) patients received HCQ. The time to SARS-CoV-2 negativity nasopharyngeal test was significantly longer in patients who received HCQ compared to those who did not receive HCQ (17 [13-21] vs. 10 [4-13] days, p=0.023). HCQ was independently associated with time to negativity test after adjustment for potential confounders (symptoms, pneumonia or oxygen therapy) in multivariable linear regression analysis. On day 14, 47.8% (14/23) patients tested negative in the HCQ group compared to 90.9% (10/11) patients who did not receive HCQ (p=0.016). Limitations: Small sample size and retrospective design with a potential risk of selection bias Conclusion: HCQ was associated with a slower viral clearance in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease. Data from ongoing randomized clinical trials with HCQ should provide a definitive answer regarding the efficacy and safety of this treatment.

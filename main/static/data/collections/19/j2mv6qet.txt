Targeting nanoparticles equipped with diagnosis “tools” to malignant cells or tissues for optimal therapy is a popular concept of theranostics. As one of the most reliable and sensitive diagnosis “tools,” nucleic acid detection is of growing practical interest with respect to molecular diagnostics of cancer and other genetic diseases. Particularly, PCR-based and other nucleic acid amplification strategies are most widely used in theranostics. This chapter aims at systematization and critical summarization of the applications of DNA- or RNA-targeted nucleic acid amplification strategies in theranostics.

During the delivery of dental care, there is the potential for the dissemination and/or exposure to blood and other body fluids as well as numerous microorganisms that colonize the mouth and/or oral, nasal, and respiratory fluids/secretions. Dentists, dental staff, and patients can be exposed to a variety of pathogenic microorganisms from these sources within the dental office. Contamination from any of these organisms may result in disease transmission which may occur from direct contact with infected body fluids and tissues, or indirectly by contacting surfaces and/or devices that have been contaminated. This phenomenon can occur anywhere in the world where dental care is provided. The principles of infection control must be employed to ensure that dental care is delivered in as safe a manner as possible for both the dental providers and the patients.

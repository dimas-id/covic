BACKGROUND Studies have reported that BIS is unreliable in children because its algorithm provides misleading information about the actual depth of anesthesia. Raw EEG analysis provides direct neurophysiologic measurement of cerebral activity. The relationship between age and EEG has rarely been reported, thus the aim of the present study was to compare raw electroencephalography (EEG) among different age groups of surgical patients under general anesthesia with 1.0 MAC sevoflurane. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 135 patients aged 0-80 years old (ASA physical status I or II) undergoing surgery, who were divided into 6 groups: 1-12 months old (group 1), 1-3 years old (group 2), 3-6 years old (group 3), 6-18 years old (group 4), 18-65 years old (group 5), and 65-80 years old (group 6). Different raw EEG waves (alpha, delta, and theta) were compared for all subjects. RESULTS The BIS values in groups 1 to 6 were 52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0, 44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, and 49.1±6.2 respectively. Compared with groups 1 and 2 (52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0), BIS values of groups 3, 4, and 5 (44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, respectively) were lower (P<0.05). Theta frequency was observed in the 6 groups. The EEG frequencies in groups 1 to 6 were 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (6.0-7.0), 6.3 (6.0-7.0), and 6.0 (5.1-6.0), respectively. Compared with group 6, EEG frequencies in groups 4 and 5 were higher (P<0.05). BIS value was significantly correlated with EEG frequency (R²=0.063, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Analyzing raw EEG waves provides more accurate judgement of depth of anesthesia, especially in pediatric cases in which monitors often provide misleading values.

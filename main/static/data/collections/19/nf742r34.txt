In the first 20 years of the new century, two times of coronavirus “visiting” China has become a public health emergency, which has attracted great attention at home and abroad. At the critical time of epidemic prevention and control in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the excellent achievements of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) show the advantages and contributions of TCM. In view of the complexity of the symptoms of patients with coronavirus infection, the diversity of organ and tissue damage and functional damage or failure, how to adapt to the needs of clinical prevention and treatment is not only a problem of modern medicine, but also a problem of TCM. In this review article, the authors combed the research of TCM prescription and single medicine after understanding the cause of coronavirus infection and pathogenicity and multiple organ dysfunction and failure caused by coronavirus. Based on the emphasis on the TCM scientific research and application, the TCM therapeutic effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection is discussed. The framework of new drug research and development based on possible “target” is proposed, and we put forward the ideas for researching new TCM products through the expanding molecular mechanism of infection.

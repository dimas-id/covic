BACKGROUND The number of obese and morbidly obese patients within the developed world is dramatically increasing within the last 20 years. Apart from demographical changes, obese patients are especially prone to have oestrogen-dependent morbidities and neoplasias, of which laparoscopic treatment should be the standard of care. The increasing number of patients with BMI >40 is concerning, making it necessary to summarise considerations for safe and effective Gynaecological Laparoscopic Surgery. CONSIDERATIONS The sequel to successful laparoscopic surgery in obese patients comprises an interdisciplinary appreciation of laparoscopy. Preoperatively, anaesthetics and medical review are suggested to optimise treatment of comorbidities (i.e. infections and blood sugar levels). Positioning of the patient should consider anti-slip options and pannus fixation to ease laparoscopic access and decrease pressure to the chest. There is no standard port placement in obese patients and landmarks have to be the bony structures of the pelvis and ribs. Retraction of the bowel is essential and mobilisation of the sigmoid with fan retractors or endoloops can accomplish adequate vision. 30Â° scopes can be considered for vision "around the obstacle". An experienced assistant with anticipation of surgical steps is favourable for successful surgery completion. Intra-operatively, good surgical techniques are essential. Vessel sealing systems reduce the need for instrument changes and may be helpful in following visualised tissue planes. A transvaginal vault closure may be advantageous compared to laparoscopic closure and Endostiches may be preferred to close the fascia of large trocar sites under vision.

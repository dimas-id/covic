Carbohydrates are the most abundant natural products. Besides their role in metabolism and as structural building blocks, they are fundamental constituents of every cell surface, where they are involved in vital cellular recognition processes. Carbohydrates are a relatively untapped source of new drugs and therefore offer exciting new therapeutic opportunities. Advances in the functional understanding of carbohydrateâ€“protein interactions have enabled the development of a new class of small-molecule drugs, known as glycomimetics. These compounds mimic the bioactive function of carbohydrates and address the drawbacks of carbohydrate leads, namely their low activity and insufficient drug-like properties. Here, we examine examples of approved carbohydrate-derived drugs, discuss the potential of carbohydrate-binding proteins as new drug targets (focusing on the lectin families) and consider ways to overcome the challenges of developing this unique class of novel therapeutics.

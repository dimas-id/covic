BACKGROUND Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIM To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions. METHODS The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus. RESULTS A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms. CONCLUSIONS Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

A recombinant live vector vaccine was produced by insertion of cDNA encoding the structural proteins (P1) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) into a replication-competent human adenovirus type 5 vaccine strain (Ad5 wt). Groups of cattle (n = 3) were immunized twice, by the subcutaneous and/or intranasal routes, with either the Ad5 wt vaccine or with the recombinant FMDV Ad5-P1 vaccine. All animals were challenged by intranasal instillation of FMDV 4 weeks after the second immunizations. In the absence of a detectable antibody response to FMDV, significant protection against viral challenge was seen in all of the animals immunized twice by the subcutaneous route with the recombinant vaccine. The observed partial protection against clinical disease was not associated with a reduction in titre of persistent FMDV infections in the oropharynx of challenged cattle.

To investigate if intradermal (ID) vaccination and intramuscular (IM) vaccination result in a comparable reduction of horizontal transmission of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), two registered E2 subunit marker vaccines were examined. Vaccine A was a water-in-oil emulsion containing the E2 glycoprotein originating from the Alfort/TÃ¼bingen strain and vaccine B was a water-oil-water emulsion containing the E2 glycoprotein originating from the Brescia strain. Eight groups, of ten pigs each, were vaccinated with either vaccine A or B, intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID). Two different vaccination-challenge intervals were used for each vaccine. Furthermore, one group was vaccinated with a tenfold ID dose of vaccine A and one non-vaccinated group served as a control group. Five pigs from each group were challenged with the moderately virulent CSFV strain Paderborn, while the remaining five pigs served as contacts. Using vaccine A, full transmission to all contact pigs in both ID vaccinated groups occurred. No virus transmission was observed when IM vaccinated pigs were challenged 14 days post-vaccination (14dpv) whereas only one out of five contact pig became infected when they were challenged 10dpv. Using vaccine B no virus transmission was observed when pigs were ID or IM vaccinated and challenged 10dpv. When challenged 3dpv full transmission occurred in the ID vaccinated group, whereas four out of five contact pigs became infected in the IM vaccinated group. This result indicates that ID vaccination does not result in better protection against horizontal CSFV transmission compared to IM vaccination, for the vaccines studied.

Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) has recently been used by general surgeons to perform cholecystectomies and pre-peritoneal hernia repairs with mesh using minimally invasive surgery, thus decreasing post-operative pain and a more cosmetic result of the surgery being obtained. We describe the first cases of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in spontaneous pneumothorax using the SILS system. There are no previous reports on the use of the SILS system in VATS for spontaneous pneumothorax. This system also allows us to obtain a more cosmetic surgical result, as well as decreasing the mean post-operative hospital stay and the need for analgesics to improve the post-operative pain.

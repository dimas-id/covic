Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic in the past four months and causes respiratory disease in humans of almost all ages. Although several drugs have been announced to be partially effective treatments for this disease, no approved vaccine is available. Here, we described the construction of a recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum strain expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The results showed that the spike gene with optimized codons could be efficiently expressed on the surface of recombinant L. plantarum and exhibited high antigenicity. The highest protein yield was obtained under the following conditions: cells were induced with 50 ng/mL SppIP at 37 °C for 6–10 h. The recombinant spike (S) protein was stable under normal conditions and at 50 °C, pH = 1.5, or a high salt concentration. Recombinant L. plantarum may provide a promising food-grade oral vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

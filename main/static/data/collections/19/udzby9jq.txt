The coronavirus disease pandemic has affected our practice as healthcare professionals (HCP). As burn surgeons, we are obliged to provide the best possible care to our patients. However, due to the risk of viral transmission, the goal should be to provide safe care to our patients as well as ensure the safety of the whole team providing burn care. The burn patients are usually debilitated and require a prolonged hospital stay and multiple operative procedures which puts them and everyone involved in their care at increased risk of coronavirus infections and transmission. This warrants special caution to the burn team while managing such patients. In this review, we aim to highlight the key considerations for burn care teams while dealing with burn patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

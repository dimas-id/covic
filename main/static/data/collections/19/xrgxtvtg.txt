PURPOSE To evaluate the radiation doses delivered during volumetric helical perfusion CT of the thorax, abdomen or pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS The dose-length product (DLP) and CT dose index (CTDIvol) were recorded and effective dose (E) determined for patients undergoing CT (4D adaptive spiral) for tumour evaluation. Image noise and contrast to noise (CNR) at peak enhancement were also assessed for quality. RESULTS Forty two consecutive examinations were included: thorax (16), abdomen (10), pelvis (16). Z-axis coverage ranged from 11.4 to 15.7 cm. Mean DLP was 1288.8 mGy.cm (range: 648 to 2456 mGy.cm). Mean CTDIvol was 96.2 mGy (range: 32.3 to 169.4 mGy). Mean effective dose was 19.6 mSv (range: 12.3 mSv to 36.7 mSv). In comparison mean DLP and effective dose was 885.2 mGy.cm (range: 504 to 1633 mGy.cm) and 13.3 mSV (range: 7.8 to 24.5 mSv) respectively for the standard staging CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Mean tumour CNR at peak enhancement was 1.87. CONCLUSION The radiation dose imposed by perfusion CT was on average 1.5 times that of a CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis. The dose is not insubstantial, and must be balanced by the potential clinical utility of additional physiologic data. Further efforts towards dose reduction should be encouraged.

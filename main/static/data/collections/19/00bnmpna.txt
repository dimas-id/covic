Aminopeptidase N has been identified as the cellular receptor for human coronavirus HCoV-229E and was a putative receptor for the spike glycoprotein encoded by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We report here identification of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANPEP, encoding human aminopeptidase N, in Chinese. All ANPEP exons and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified from unrelated normal individuals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Nine SNPs were revealed after direct sequencing of PCR amplified fragments which showed changes of DHPLC chromatogram. Four of these polymorphisms, T321M(962C > T), S651L(1952C > T), S752N(2255G > A) and G764R(2290G > A), were non-synonymous; the remaining exonic synonymous and intronic ones were T795T(2385C > T), IVS7 + 17G > A, IVS14-16A > G, IVS17 + 12C > G and IVS17 + 44C > T. Our data may be useful for studies to investigate the role of host genetic factors in SARS pathogenesis, especially for identifying SARS-susceptible and/or anti-SARS alleles.

Turbulent microscopic flow is simulated in homogeneous porous media using numerical methods by employing the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling techniques. Turbulence model independence is verified using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). A periodic domain consisting of a single Turbulence Representative Elementary Volume (REV-T) represents the porous medium in simulations. Since the Benard-von Karman vortex street, a product of the von Karman instability, cannot occur in porous media with a low porosity, a build-up of vortices in the void space is observed to cause a complex interaction between the vortices. When the von Karman instability emerges in microscopic flow within a homogeneous porous medium consisting of periodically arranged solid obstacles, the confinement that is inherent in the medium causes the macroscopic flow to deviate from the principal flow direction. The causation is investigated, and several governing parameters are identified. A breakdown of the transient process from aligned to deviatory flow is provided to illustrate the developmental stages. A suitable explanation as to why the deviation is sustained is provided as well.

The 2019 coronavirus infection (called SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, spread rapidly throughout the world. In many countries the exponential growth of Covid-19 cases is overwhelming health care systems with overcrowding of hospitals and overflowing Intensive Care Units. While people must stay at home to reduce the spread of this virus health-care workers do the exact opposite. In some countries doctors are working with insufficient protection and are constantly at risk of contracting Covid-19. Health-care workers should be constantly monitored because if they are infected they may spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members. Increased rates of infection in health-care workers could cause the health-care system to collapse and a further worsening of the pandemic; if there are too few doctors it will be even more difficult to manage.

As a novel coronavirus pathogen, COVID-19 and the current associated pandemic has rapidly transformed daily life since its first detection in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Not only are strict social distancing measures now the status quo, but within the occupational setting of healthcare provision, healthcare workers (HCWs) have had to quickly adapt to an entirely different way of working. Part of this new routine encompasses the now habitual donning of personal protective equipment (PPE), not least the filtering face piece respirator (FFP), particularly for aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). In this regard, front-line workers face the largest risk not only from COVID-19 exposure, but also from the consequences of wearing PPE for extended periods.

Pneumothorax in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) often presents as a difficult-to-treat disease. Autologous blood-patch pleurodesis has previously been used for the treatment of pneumothorax. Blood outside its own environment is an irritant; therefore, chest physicians must watch closely for an allergic reaction. The injection is simple, painless, causes no side effects, is an inexpensive treatment for pneumothorax and is available not only in patients with persistent air leak but also in those with residual air space. A case is reported here of blood-patch pleurodesis for pneumothorax in lung fibrosis due to PSS. As an alternative therapy for difficult-to-treat pneumothorax in patients with PSS with persistent air leak and residual air space, autologous blood-patch pleurodesis would be one of the treatment options.

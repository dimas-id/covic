Aim: This article aims to inform and share the experience of a Singaporean tertiary level neurosurgical unit in an academic medical centre during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: This is a descriptive study of our segregation team model which is designed with the aim of optimizing manpower and ensuring the safety and welfare of the neurosurgical unit, while maintaining and prioritizing excellent patient care. Result: We describe our method of team segregation, rostering, and outline some principles that we adhere to in its design. We also summarise the restructuring of our inpatient and outpatient service, including the operating theatre and protocols for specific procedures, intensive care and general wards, as well as clinic services and multidisciplinary meetings. Conclusion: We end with a commentary on residency training and anticipated challenges. Given the likely protracted course of the pandemic, it is key to account for sustainability of such measures and the conservation of resource via the reduction of pateint volume, upkeep of staff emotional and physical health and harnessing technologies such as telemedicine.

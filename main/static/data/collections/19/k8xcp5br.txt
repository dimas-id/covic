Background and study aim Outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread from China to the rest of the world. Although it is primarily transmitted by contact and droplets, aerosol-generating procedures also seem to carry the possibility of airborne viral transmission. As such, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be considered a risky procedure, with several position statements recommending the adoption of safe practices in endoscopic procedures. This article aims to describe an additional tool to protect healthcare personnel during endoscopy. Methods A covering box made of acrylic plastic, named Endoprotector, was designed to cover the patientâ€™s head, while taking into consideration movements performed by patients and healthcare staff during an endoscopic procedure. Results A cough simulation using fluorescent dye confirmed the potential benefit of the box during endoscopy, thus protecting healthcare staff from air droplets. The feasibility and practicality of the box was also tested with patients during endoscopy. Conclusion The reusable Endoprotector is easily and affordably manufactured and may reduce air droplets and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other microorganisms during endoscopy.

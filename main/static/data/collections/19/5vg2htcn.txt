Erythema nodosum (EN) is a common dermatological manifestation with many different aetiologies. Often however, the aetiology remains unidentified. We present here a 42-year-old male patient with an EN that is due to an acute COVID-19 infection. Most of the usual aetiologies were excluded by laboratory testing and imaging studies. This case is, to our knowledge, the first report of this cutaneous manifestation in the context of a COVID-19 infection. The EN was successfully treated with the disappearance of the COVID-19 infection and topical corticosteroids.

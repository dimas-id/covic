Substance use disorder (SUD) is a relapsing brain disorder characterized by compulsion and chronicity. SUD has detrimental effects on oral health. Drugs and alcohol negatively impact oral health by inducing a myriad of orofacial conditions including xerostomia, dental caries, periodontal disease, bruxism, pre-cancer and cancer, to name a few. Limited recommendations are available for dental professionals on how best to manage patients afflicted with SUD. The aim of this article is to review the oral health consequences of alcohol and commonly abused drugs to provide guidelines for the public health community and dental professionals. The United Nations estimates that a quarter billion people, representing five per cent of the global adult population, used drugs at least once in 2015. Developing public health interventions that include the participation of dental professionals and access to dental services for persons afflicted with SUD could play a critical role in improving their quality of life, their recovery, and their reintroduction into society.

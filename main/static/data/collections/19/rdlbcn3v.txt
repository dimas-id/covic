Concentration by airfuge and protein A-colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy (PAG-IEM) offered a rapid and sensitive method for detection and identification of coronaviruses from various species. The method was applied to partially purified tissue culture-adapted or egg-adapted mammalian and avian coronaviruses and to clarified fecal samples from diarrheic calves and turkey poults for detection of enteric coronaviruses. Aggregates of virus coated with specific antibody were seen in virus samples mixed with homologous antiserum but not in control samples containing preexposure serum. At least a 10-50-fold enhancement of the sensitivity of direct EM for virus detection was obtained using protein A-colloidal gold complex as an electron-dense marker. The PAG-IEM method demonstrated low nonspecific background labeling and permitted detection of soluble and particle-associated antigen. Reciprocal cross-reactivity was detected among the subgroup of mammalian hemagglutinating coronaviruses, and antisera to 4 members of other subgroups only recognized their homologous virus.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for a pandemic that emerged in December 2019. Heterogeneous clinical forms are described from asymptomatic to severe hypoxaemic acute respiratory syndrome with multisystem organ failure. The impact of this coronavirus disease 2019 on the endocrine glands remains unknown. However, the results of previous studies on viruses from the same family allow us to write proposals for patients followed for chronic endocrine diseases. Currently, if these subjects are infected with SARS-CoV-2, they must not stop their treatment. In some cases, hormone replacement doses have to be increased. In case of worsening clinical signs, hormonal biological monitoring must be done. This article will be helpful for improving the management of chronic endocrine diseases that could affect thyroid, adrenals, gonads and pituitary gland functions. Proposals could be applied in COVID-19 infected subjects or in those who have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.

Background: Since the first appearance in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed serious threats to the public health in many Chinese places and overseas It is essential to quantify the transmissibility on real-time basis for designing public health responses Methods: We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers in China, Hubei province and Wuhan city by using the renewable equation determined by the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19 We compare the average reproduction numbers in different periods of time to explore the effectiveness of the public health control measures against the COVID-19 epidemic Results: We estimated the reproduction numbers at 2 61 (95% CI: 2 47-2 75), 2 76 (95% CI: 2 54-2 95) and 2 71 (95% CI: 2 43-3 01) for China, Hubei province and Wuhan respectively We found that the reproduction number largely dropped after the city lockdown As of February 16, the three reproduction numbers further reduced to 0 98, 1 14 and 1 41 respectively Conclusions: The control of COVID-19 epidemic was effective in substantially reducing the disease transmissibility in terms of the reproduction number in China reduced to 0 98 as of February 16 At the same time, the reproduction number in Wuhan was probably still larger than 1, and thus the enhancement in the public health control was recommended to maintain

BACKGROUND Nasal high flow (NHF) oxygen therapy and CPAP are modes of noninvasive respiratory support used to improve respiratory function in multiple patient groups. Both therapies provide positive pressure, although this varies during the respiratory cycle. The purpose of this study was to measure and compare the airway pressure generated during different phases of the respiratory cycle in patients receiving NHF at various gas flows. METHODS Patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were invited to participate. Nasopharyngeal pressure measurements were performed using NHF with gas flows of 30, 40, and 50 L/min. All measurements were performed in random order, with the subject breathing with mouth closed. RESULTS During NHF the mean ± SD nasopharyngeal airway pressures were 1.5 ± 0.6, 2.2 ± 0.8, and 3.1 ± 1.2 at 30, 40, and 50 L/min using NHF. Analyses also determined the mean peak expiratory and mean expiratory plateau pressures. CONCLUSIONS The expiratory pressure during NHF was higher than the mean pressure previously reported for NHF. This may account in part for the disproportional clinical effects seen with NHF. (Australian Clinical Trials Registry www.anzctr.org.au ACTRN12609000305224).

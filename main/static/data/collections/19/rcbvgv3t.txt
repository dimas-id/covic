OBJECTIVE Currently, many studies are being performed that focus on the efficacy and safety of the vessel sealing system (VSS) in various fields of surgery. However, in the field of oral cancer surgery, the efficacy and safety of VSS use have not been clarified. METHODS One hundred and fifty-one patients underwent oral cancer resection and reconstructive surgery. They were divided into two groups: Ligasure vessel sealing system (LVSS) group and conventional surgery (CS) as control. Intra-operative blood loss, operating time, and incidence of post-operative complications and recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS LVSS use significantly reduced intra-operative blood loss. The operating time was shortened only in mandibular gingiva cancer surgery. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to the incidence of post-operative complications and recurrence. CONCLUSIONS LVSS use was found to be effective and proved to be efficient and safe, and may be useful in oral cancer surgery.

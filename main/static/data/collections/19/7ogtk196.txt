BACKGROUND Since 1 January 2005, bariatric surgery has been monitored in Germany. All related data are registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS Data collection regarding obesity and metabolic surgery was started in an online database in 2005. Follow-up data are collected once a year. Participation in the quality assurance study is voluntary. RESULTS Since 2005, 10,330 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures have been performed in Germany. In total, 8,013 patients were female and 2,317 were male. Male patients suffered significantly more comorbidities than female patients. The men also had higher body mass indexes (BMIs) and ages than the women at the time of operation. Data on the gender-specific aspects of RYGB from the Nationwide Survey of Bariatric Surgery in Germany (GBSR) showed a significant difference in anastomotic insufficiency at the gastro-entero-anastomosis. The leakage rate was 2.37 % (55/2,317) in men and 1.68 % (135/8,013) in women. Additionally, specific complication and mortality rates were significantly higher in male than in female patients. CONCLUSIONS Metabolic and obesity surgery is becoming increasingly popular in Germany. Data from the GBSR show significant differences in preoperative comorbidities and postoperative complication and mortality rates between male and female patients. There is a need for further evaluation of gender-specific aspects to optimize patient selection and reduce specific postoperative complications.

Abstract Membrane-anchored serine proteases are a group of extracellular serine proteases tethered directly to plasma membranes, via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage (GPI-anchored), a C-terminal transmembrane domain (Type I), or an N-terminal transmembrane domain (Type II). A variety of biochemical, cellular, and in vivo studies have established that these proteases are important pericellular contributors to processes vital for the maintenance of homeostasis, including food digestion, blood pressure regulation, hearing, epithelial permeability, sperm maturation, and iron homeostasis. These enzymes are hijacked by viruses to facilitate infection and propagation, and their misregulation is associated with a wide range of diseases, including cancer malignancy.

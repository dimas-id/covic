BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis in Ethiopia is a re-emerging threat to public health, with increased geographical distribution and number of cases. It is a fatal disease without early diagnosis and treatment; thus, the availability of affordable diagnostic tools is crucial. However, due to delays caused by import regulations, procurement and late delivery of imported test kits, accessibility remains a problem in the control program. Therefore, we aimed to produce and evaluate the performance of an in-house liquid (AQ) direct agglutination test (DAT) antigen. RESULT: The AQ-DAT was produced at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, using Leishmania donovani strain (MHOM/ET/67/L82). Sera from 272 participants; 110 microscopically confirmed cases of VL, 76 apparently healthy and 86 patients who had infectious disease other than VL were tested with AQ-DAT, and standard kits: Freeze-dried DAT (FD-DAT) and rK39. Taking microscopy as a gold standard; the sensitivity and specificity of the AQ-DAT were 97.3 and 98.8%, respectively. It had high degrees of agreement (k > 0.8), with a significant (P < 0.05) correlation compared to microscopy, FD-DAT, and rK39. CONCLUSION: Although further standardization is required, the in-house AQ-DAT could improve diagnostic accessibility, minimize intermittent stock outs and strengthen the national VL control program.

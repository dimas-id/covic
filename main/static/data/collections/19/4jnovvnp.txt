The 2014â€“2015 outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa has been considered a major global health emergency by the WHO. Implications for health care providers including oral and maxillo-facial surgeons have been published by the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA), and other medical societies and public health organizations. While the risk of infection with the Ebola virus seems to be rather small in Europe, maxillo-facial and plastic surgeons often travel to Africa to treat patients with facial burns, cleft-lip and palate, and noma. The likelihood of an encounter with patients infected by Ebola virus in subsaharan and West Africa, therefore, has increased during the last 2 years. The purpose of this short overview was to summarize the virology of the Ebola virus, transmission, epidemiology, clinical features, oral manifestations, treatment, and possible implications for maxillo-facial surgeons of EDV.

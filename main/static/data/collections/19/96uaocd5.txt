On 3 April 2013, suspected and confirmed cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection became notifiable in the primary care sector in Taiwan, and detection of the virus became part of the surveillance of severe community-acquired pneumonia. On 24 April, the first imported case, reported through both surveillance systems, was confirmed in a man returning from China by sequencing from endotracheal aspirates after two negative throat swabs. Three of 139 contacts were ill and tested influenza A(H7N9)-negative.

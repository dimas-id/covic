PURPOSE The aim of this study was to report our experience in embolization of high flow peripheral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with Onyx. MATERIAL AND METHODS Nineteen patients (10 men, 9 women) with peripheral high-flow AVMs who were treated with arteruial embolization using Onyx were retrospectively included. AVMs were located in the head and neck (6), extremities (5), chest (2), kidney (2), uterus (2), pelvis (1) and parietal (1). In 13 patients, embolization was done using Onyx only. One patient underwent embolization by direct puncture, the others by transarterial approach. Embolization was performed in one or multiple sessions (up to 5). A total of 28 sessions were performed. Follow-up was performed with a delay between 10 and 34 months. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all patients. Complete devascularization was obtained in 12 patients. Surgical excision was performed in 9 patients. Non-target Onyx embolization was not observed. One patient developed stroke. In 1 patient microcatheter fracture occured. One patient presented severe pain and bradycardia during the procedure that disappeared shortly after. One patient had persistent but less frequent epistaxis after embolization. Another patient had persistent pain without improvement. One patient was lost to follow-up. Other patients were free of symptoms on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Embolization with OnyxÂ® is an interesting option for management of peripheral high-flow AVMs either preoperatively or as a single treatment.

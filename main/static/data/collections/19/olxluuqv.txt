BackgroundHigh levels of morbidity caused by adenovirus among US military recruits have returned since the loss of adenovirus vaccines in 1999. The transmission dynamics of adenovirus have never been well understood, which complicates prevention efforts MethodsEnrollment and end-of-study samples were obtained and active surveillance for febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) was performed for 341 recruits and support personnel. Environmental samples were collected simultaneously. Classic and advanced diagnostic techniques were used ResultsSeventy-nine percent (213/271) of new recruits were seronegative for either adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad-4) or adenovirus serotype 7 (Ad-7). FRI caused by Ad-4 was observed in 25% (67/271) of enrolled recruits, with 100% of them occurring in individuals with enrollment titers <1:4. The percentage of recruits seropositive for Ad-4 increased from 34% at enrollment to 97% by the end of the study. Adenovirus was most commonly detected in the environment on pillows, lockers, and rifles ConclusionsPotential sources of adenovirus transmission among US military recruits included the presence of adenovirus on surfaces in living quarters and extended pharyngeal viral shedding over the course of several days. The introduction of new recruits, who were still shedding adenovirus, into new training groups was documented. Serological screening could identify susceptible recruits for the optimal use of available vaccines. New high-throughput technologies show promise in providing valuable data for clinical and research applications

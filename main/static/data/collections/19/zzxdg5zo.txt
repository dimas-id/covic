Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus and the primary causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first occurred in China and rapidly spread worldwide The government of the Republic of Indonesia confirmed its first two cases of COVID-19 in March 2020 COVID-19 is a serious illness with no efficacious antiviral medication or approved vaccine currently available Therefore, there is a need to investigate the genome of SARS-CoV-2 In this study, we characterized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein genes from Indonesia to investigate their genetic composition and variability Overall, ten SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene sequences retrieved from GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) and the GISAID EpiCoV database (Germany) were compared We analyzed nucleotide variants and amino acid changes using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X and analyzed gene similarity using the LALIGN web server Interestingly, we revealed several specific mutation sites, however, there were no significant changes in the genetic composition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein genes, when compared to the WuhanHu-1 isolate from China However, this is a preliminary study and we recommend that molecular epidemiology and surveillance programs against COVID-19 in Indonesia be improved

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute HBV infection and acute exacerbations of chronic HBV infection can cause acute liver injury (ALI) or fulminant hepatitis (FH). At this stage, spontaneous survival is poor, less than 25%. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of specific management of patients with HBV-ALI/FH. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute HBVinfection and acute exacerbations of chronic HBVinfection can cause acute liver injury (ALI) or fulminant hepatitis (FH). Spontaneous survival at this stage is poor. It is urgent to distinguish between these two entities so that antiviral therapy can be initiated rapidly. Although the indications for antiviral therapy are clear for HBV reactivation, there is no true consensus regarding ALI/FH related to acute HBV infection. The global management of HBV-related FH does not differ from that implemented for other causes of FH, i.e. close cardiorespiratory and neurological monitoring, treatment with acetylcysteine, organ support in the event of organ failure (haemodynamic, renal, respiratory) and albumin dialysis. Liver transplantation remains the only alternative when certain criteria for a poor prognosis are met. A recurrence of HBV infection on the graft can be prevented post-transplant by the administration of HBIG and antiviral therapy for HBV, the modalities varying depending on the risk of recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disorder characterized by an exacerbated but ineffective inflammatory response, which can be classified as primary and secondary HLH. HLH associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is uncommon. This case report accounted an immunocompetent patient who was confirmed to be Mycobacterium infection, or rather, highly suspected tuberculosis (TB) associated HLH, with a favorable outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old man presented with persistent fever, pancytopenia, and hyperferritinemia. A bone marrow smear demonstrated hemophagocytosis, and pathological examination of lung biopsy was positive for acid-fast bacilli, which established the diagnosis of Mycobacterium infection and HLH. Then the patient treated successfully with anti-TB therapy, along with 8 weeks of etoposide. CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes that HLH should be kept in mind when clinicians encounter a patient with severe infection presenting with pancytopenia and hyperferritinemia. Given the high mortality, early diagnosis and appropriate therapy can provide patients with a favorable prognosis.

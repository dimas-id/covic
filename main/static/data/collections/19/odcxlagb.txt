Bacteriocins are peptides of ribosomal synthesis that are active against bacteria related to the producing strain. They have been widely used in the food industry as biopreservatives. The generation of hybrid peptides by combining the genes that encode two different bacteriocins has made it possible to study the mechanisms of action of the bacteriocins that compose them and also develop new peptides with improved biotechnological applications. Hybrid bacteriocins may be obtained in several ways. In our laboratory, by combining enterocin CRL35 and microcin V (Ent35-MccV), we obtained a broad-spectrum peptide that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ent35-MccV is sensitive to the action of intestinal proteases and is heat resistant, which makes it a good candidate for use as a biopreservative. For this reason, the peptide was tested in skim milk and beef burgers as food models. We also obtained more potent variants of the hybrid by modifying the central amino acid of the hinge region that connects the two bacteriocins. This review also discusses future applications and perspectives regarding the Ent35-MccV and other hybrid peptides.Key Points• Ent35-MccV is a new broad-spectrum bacteriocin.• The mechanism of action of bacteriocins can be studied using hybrid peptides.• Genetic engineering allows obtaining improved bacteriocin derivatives.• Hybrid peptides can be used in the food, pharmaceutical, and veterinary applications.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, advantages and surgical outcomes of laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy (LBA) by an anterior transperitoneal approach. METHODS From 1994 to 2018, 552 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy, unilateral in 531 and bilateral in 21 patients (9 females and 12 males). All patients who underwent LBA were approached via a transperitoneal anterior route and form our study population. Indications included: Cushing's disease (n = 11), pheochromocytoma (n = 6), Conn's disease (n = 3) and adrenal cysts (n = 1). RESULTS Mean operative time was 195 ± 86.2 min (range 55-360 min). Conversion was necessary in one case for bleeding. Three patients underwent concurrent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and ductal stone extraction in one. Three postoperative complications occurred in one patient each: subhepatic fluid collection, intestinal ileus and pleural effusion. Mean hospital stay was 6.1 ± 4.7 days (range 2-18 days). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, transperitoneal anterior LBA was feasible and safe. Based on our results, we believe that this approach leads to prompt recognition of anatomical landmarks with early division of the main adrenal vein prior to any gland manipulation, with a low risk of bleeding and without the need to change patient position. Unlike the lateral approach, there is no need to mobilize the spleno-pancreatic complex on the left or the liver on the right. The ability to perform associated intraperitoneal procedures, if required, is an added benefit.

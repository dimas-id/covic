This study demonstrates that the envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV) could be incorporated into the lipid membrane of lentivirus pseudotype particles. The assembly procedure was initiated by the transfection of 293T cells with three plasmids: (i) a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) packaging construct, (ii) a transfer plasmid expressing a reporter gene, and (iii) a plasmid expressing large (L), middle (M), and small (S) HBV envelope proteins. After 2 days, hepatitis B surface antigen and the antigenic forms of L, M, and S were detected at the cell surface by flow cytometry. Also, virus particles that were able to infect cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were released. Under optimal conditions, 50% of PHH could be infected. In addition, the susceptibility of PHH and the resistance of other cell types to the pseudotype particles were similar to those observed for HBV and hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which shares the same L, M, and S. Furthermore, the infection of PHH by the pseudotype was sensitive to known inhibitors of HBV and HDV entry. These findings of specific and efficient infection of hepatocytes could be applicable to liver-specific gene therapy and may help clarify the attachment and entry mechanism used by HBV and HDV.

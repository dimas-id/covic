Publisher Summary Pathogenic microorganisms usually originate from an infected host or directly from the environment; however, only a small proportion of these microbes cause infection. This chapter discusses the pathogens that are transmitted through the environment such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Many human pathogens can be transmitted only by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal such as herpesvirus. Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect inhalation of infectious droplets or through contact with contaminated fomites. Water-borne diseasesâ€”such as yellow fever, dengue, filariasis, malaria, onchocerciasis, and sleeping sicknessare transmitted by insects that breed in water or live near water. The common bacterial pathogens transmitted through water include Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and Legionella. Opportunistic pathogens are also numerous in the environment, and the most important opportunistic pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis and water-borne outbreaks may be caused by norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Coxsackie virus, echovirus, and adenoviruses. Respiratory diseases are also associated with a large number of viruses such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and adenovirus. Generally, viral and protozoan pathogens survive longer in the environment than enteric bacterial pathogens.

An understanding of the underlying mechanism of side-branching is paramount to control and/or potentially form mammalian organs, such as lungs, kidneys, and glands. Motivated by an activator-inhibitor approach that is believed to dominate the initiation of side-branching, I show that the mechanism stems from the nonlinear (subcritical) Turing bifurcation to periodic and spatially localized solutions that are essential for excitation at the differentiation-front propagation. The results demonstrate a distinct robust mechanism of side-branching through numerical analysis of model equations that have been employed to study branching in the lungs.

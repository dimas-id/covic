This chapter introduces the Tolerance Scheduling problem, which involves the decision-making issues in rescheduling processes. The solutions to this problem can be incorporated in the design of Decision Support Systems (DSS) in Industry 4.0 environments. We present here the mathematical foundations for the solutions of the Tolerance Scheduling problem as well as the technical requirements of their embodiment in Industry 4.0â€™s DSS. We illustrate these ideas in a case study with a single machine, in which we analyze the performance of the model at different tolerances.

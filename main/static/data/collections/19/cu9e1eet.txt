In this study, we investigate the infection system of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) with a nonlocal operator defined in the Caputo sense. With the help of the fractional natural decomposition method (FNDM), which is based on the Adomian decomposition and natural transform methods, numerical results were obtained to better understand the dynamical structures of the physical behavior of 2019-nCoV. Such behaviors observe the general properties of the mathematical model of 2019-nCoV. This mathematical model is composed of data reported from the city of Wuhan, China.

Obsessive‚Äêcompulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by unwanted and distressing thoughts, images or urges (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts that aim to decrease the resulting distress or according to rigid rules (compulsions) (APA, 2013). Different studies suggest OCD to affect up to 3.1 % of the general population and to be associated with substantial disability and decreased quality of life (Fontenelle, Mendlowicz, & Versiani, 2006; Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, & Kessler, 2010).

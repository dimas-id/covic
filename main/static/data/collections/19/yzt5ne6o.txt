OBJECTIVE The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus circulating in the Arabian Peninsula since September 2012. It leads to significant respiratory disease and among patients with co-morbidities is associated with high mortality. This research studied the mortality rate of MERS-CoV among intensive care unit (ICU) patients and the correlation of mortality with different co-morbidities. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study conducted at the Intensive Care Unit of the King Fahad Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Data was obtained through patient chart review. RESULTS The total sample consisted of 52 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection patients. 39 patients died, with a 75% case-fatality rate. Many patients had underlying co-morbidities, including diabetes mellitus (51.9%), hypertension (46.2%), and chronic renal disease (21.2%). CONCLUSIONS MERS-CoV ICU mortality remains markedly high due to a combination of factors; the disease process of MERS-CoV leads to multiple organ failure, particularly respiratory and renal failure.

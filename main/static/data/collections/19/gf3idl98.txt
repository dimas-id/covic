To characterize T-cell large granular leukemia in Asia, 22 Chinese patients from a single institute were reported, together with an analysis of 88 Asian and 272 Western patients identified from the literature. In our cohort, anemia due to pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) occurred in 15/22 (68%) of cases, being the most common indication for treatment. Neutropenia was only found in 8/22 (36%) cases, and recurrent infections, the most important clinical problem in Western patients, were not observed. None of our cases presented with rheumatoid arthritis. These clinical features were consistently observed when compared with the 88 other Asian patients. Combined data from our cohort and other Asian cases showed that Asian patients, compared with Western patients, had more frequent anemia (66/110, 60% versus 113/240, 47%; p = 0.044), attributable to a much higher incidence of PRCA (52/110, 47% versus 6/143, 4%; p < 0.001). However, Western patients presented more frequently than Asian patients with neutropenia (146/235, 62% versus 33/110, 30%; p < 0.001) and splenomegaly (99/246, 40% versus 16/110, 15%; p < 0.001). Notably, Western patients were about eight to ten times more likely than Asian patients to have rheumatoid arthritis (73/272, 27% versus 4/106, 4%; p < 0.001) and recurrent infections (81/272, 30% versus 3/107, 3%; p < 0.001). These clinicopathologic differences have important implications on disease pathogenesis and treatment.

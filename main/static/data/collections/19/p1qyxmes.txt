Abstract For more than three decades, RNA recombination remained a puzzle and has only begun to be solved in the last few years. The available data provide evidence for a variety of RNA recombination mechanisms. Non-homologous recombination seems to be the most common for RNA. Recent experiments in both the in vitro and the in vivo systems indicate that this type of recombination may result from various transesterification reactions which are either performed by RNA molecules themselves or are promoted by some proteins. The high frequency of homologous recombination manifested by some RNA viruses can be easier explained by a replicative template switch.

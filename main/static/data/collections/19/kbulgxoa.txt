Objective@#To Summarize mathematical and statistical models used in the area of infectious diseases modelling, to provide ideas and suggestions for the model-based analysis and decision-making of COVID-19.@*Methods@#By reviewing the commonly used mathematical and statistical models in the analysis of infectious diseases, with a focus on the mathematical models of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) that have been published and their practical effects.@*Results@#Infectious diseases modelling based on multi-source information has become the main research trend, and the published mathematical models of COVID-19 epidemic need to be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability.@*Conclusions@#It is recommended to build a more advanced mathematical/statistical model by allowing for the characteristics of new coronaviruses and to use more informative data to improve the analysis and decision-making of the new epidemic.

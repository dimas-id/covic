The Covid-19 outbreak put enormous stress on the health system worldwide, and objective data to handle the emergency are still needed. We aimed to objectively assess the consequence of severe symptoms of Covid-19 infection on sleep quality through wrist actigraphy monitoring of four patients during the sub-acute recovery stage of the disease. The sleep of those patients who had experienced the most severe respiratory symptoms and who had needed prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay showed lower Sleep Efficiency and Immobility Time and higher Fragmentation Index compared to those patients who had experienced only mild respiratory symptoms and not requiring ICU stay. Wrist actigraphy assessment provided important clinical information about the sleep and activity levels of Covid-19 patients during the post-acute rehabilitation management.

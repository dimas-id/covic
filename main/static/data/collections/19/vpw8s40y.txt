OBJECTIVE To delineate and clarify neuromuscular disorders in patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). DESIGN Case series with follow-up ranging from 3 weeks to 2 months. SETTING National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei. PATIENTS We investigated 4 patients with SARS who had concomitant neuromuscular problems. A diagnosis of SARS was based on the demonstration of serum coronavirus antibodies. Clinical presentations, laboratory results, electrophysiologic findings, and follow-up conditions were determined. RESULTS Patients developed neuromuscular problems approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS. Two women experienced motor-predominant peripheral nerve disorders. A man developed myopathy and a third woman experienced neuropathy and myopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 2 patients with neuropathy disclosed normal protein content and the absence of pleocytosis and SARS coronavirus antibodies. Both patients with myopathy had elevated serum creatine kinase levels. A rapid clinical and electrophysiologic improvement was evident during follow-up examinations, with a good prognosis. CONCLUSIONS The neuromuscular problems in patients with SARS are considered to be critical-illness polyneuropathy or myopathy, possibly coexistent. Further pathological and microbiological studies are necessary to determine the relationship between SARS coronavirus and neuromuscular problems.

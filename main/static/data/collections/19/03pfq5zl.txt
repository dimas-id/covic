The prevalence and impact of non-cardiac comorbidities in adult patients with congenital heart disease increase over time, and these complications are often specifically a consequence of the long-term altered cardiovascular physiology or sequelae of previous therapies. For the ACHD patient admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for either surgical or medical treatment, an assessment of the burden of multisystem disease, as well as an understanding of the underlying cardiovascular pathophysiology, is essential for optimal management of these complex patients. This chapter takes an organ-system-based approach to reviewing common comorbidities in the ACHD patient, focusing on conditions that are directly related to ACHD status and may significantly impact ICU care.

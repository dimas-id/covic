Since December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 became a major epidemic threat in China and later spread worldwide. During the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in mainland China, the Chinese Obstetricians and Gynecologists Association distributed guidelines regarding the care of gynecologic patients. These guidelines were developed by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and represent an effort to integrate infection control strategy and promote professionalism in medical practice. The guidelines represent collaboration with experts from 31 provinces and autonomous regions of mainland China over 2 weeks' time. With the implementation of these guidelines, no nosocomial infections of coronavirus disease 2019 have been identified at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. We think these guidelines might be helpful to departments of obstetrics and gynecology internationally during these unprecedented times. In our guidelines, we describe basic infection precaution principles, an epidemiologic screening tool, prioritization of surgical procedures, and operating room requirements. Using these principles, we then review the management of gynecologic patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in the outpatient and operative and nonoperative inpatient settings and in clinical trials.

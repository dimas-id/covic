We describe a cost-effective, scalable technology to produce SARS-COV-2 spike (S) protein based on stable expression in HEK293 cells, and its use to develop a highly specific and sensitive ELISA test. The assay allows early detection of anti-S IgG seroconversion and endpoint titers correlate with virus neutralization. The low-cost S-antigen production, together with sample collection by finger prick and dried blood spots, allowed the development of a half-dollar test that fits the urgent need for large-scale serological surveillance in low-income countries.

To compute flows around a body with a rotating or movable part like a tiltrotor aircraft, the multi axes sliding mesh approach has been proposed. This approach is based on the unstructured moving grid finite volume method, which has adopted the space-time unified domain for control volume. Thus, it can accurately express such a moving mesh. However, due to the difficulty of mesh control in viscous flows and the need to maintain the stability of computation, it is restricted to only inviscid flows. In this paper, the multi axes sliding mesh approach was extended to viscous flows to understand detailed flow phenomena around a complicated moving body. The strategies to solve several issues not present in inviscid flow computations are described. To show the validity of the approach in viscous flows, it was applied to the flow field of a sphere in uniform flow. Multiple domains that slide individually were placed around the sphere, and it was confirmed that the sliding mesh did not affect the flow field. The usability of the approach is expected to be applied to practical viscous flow computations.

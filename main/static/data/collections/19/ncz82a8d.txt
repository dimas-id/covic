Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) are widespread and infect virtually all mammals. We report here the first case of a natural mutant and reassortant serotype 3 reovirus from mink in China, known as MRV3 SD-14. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that the MRV3 SD-14 may have resulted from a reassortment involving MRVs that infected swine, humans and mink. Interestingly, the S1 segment, which encodes the viral attachment protein Ïƒ1, which influences viral virulence and cell tropism in the host, had a stop codon mutation at amino acid 246. Surveillance of the virulence and evolution of MRVs in humans and other animals deserves more attention.

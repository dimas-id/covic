Life in academics often seems like an endless series of transitions: from medical student to intern, from junior resident to senior, from fellow to faculty, from junior faculty to senior, and sometimes from local leader to national figure. Looking back now on my own career and those of others, the most important lesson Iâ€™ve learned is that we are ultimately defined more by how we manage those transitions, and how we treat the people we meet along the way, than we are by the professional accomplishments that bring us recognition and awards.

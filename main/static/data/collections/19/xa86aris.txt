The S protein of hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus is shown to be a hemagglutinin requiring N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as a receptor determinant on the surface of erythrocytes. The ability of bovine coronavirus to recognize 9-O-acetylated sialic acid was used to establish a binding assay for the detection of glycoproteins containing this type of sugar. The assay is very fast, because it uses the acetylesterase of the viral HE protein to localize bound virus.

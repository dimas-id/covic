Background The Society of European Robotic Gynaecological Surgery (SERGS) aims at developing a European consensus on core components of a curriculum for training and assessment in robot assisted gynaecological surgery. Methods A Delphi process was initiated among a panel of 12 experts in robot assisted surgery invited through the SERGS. An online questionnaire survey was based on a literature search for standards in education in gynaecological robot assisted surgery. The survey was performed in three consecutive rounds to reach optimal consensus. The results of this survey were discussed by the panel and led to consensus recommendations on 39 issues, adhering to general principles of medical education. Results On review there appeared to be no accredited training programs in Europe, and few in the USA. Recommendations for requirements of training centres, educational tools and assessment of proficiency varied widely. Stepwise and structured training together with validated assessment based on competencies rather than on volume emerged as prerequisites for adequate and safe learning. An appropriate educational environment and tools for training were defined. Although certification should be competence based, the panel recommended additional volume based criteria for both accreditation of training centres and certification of individual surgeons. Conclusions Consensus was reached on minimum criteria for training in robot assisted gynaecological surgery. To transfer results into clinical practice, experts recommended a curriculum and guidelines that have now been endorsed by SERGS to be used to establish training programmes for robot assisted surgery.

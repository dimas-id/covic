Introduction: Only little is known about COVID-19 in patients with asthma. There is no data on COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma or patients with asthma who are treated with monoclonal antibodies.Case Study: Here, we present the case of a severe eosinophilic asthmatic in whom benralizumab treatment, an anti-IL-5R monoclonal antibody, was initiated 2 years ago. Prior to benralizumab treatment, every viral infection had resulted in a prolonged course of oral corticosteroids (OCS). Since initiation of benralizumab, the patient has had good asthma control. Mid-March 2020, the patient developed high fever.Results: A SARS-CoV-2-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) was positive. The patient's symptoms subsided after few days. No OCS was needed. The asthma control questionnaire 6-item scale worsened moderately in the week of the infection and returned to normal levels thereafter. The asthma control test, measuring longer term asthma control, showed no decline.Conclusion: The course of COVID-19 was very mild in this particular patient with severe eosinophilic asthma. So far, there is no evidence that would suggest a more severe course of COVID-19 in patients with asthma. It is worth noting, that prior to the initiation of benralizumab this patient had multiple exacerbations per year triggered by viral infections (4/year), which all required OCS. Whilst only anecdotal, this case study provides the first evidence to support the current recommendation of continuing monoclonal antibodies in patients with severe asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic.

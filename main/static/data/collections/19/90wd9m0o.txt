PURPOSE To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation for the treatment of liver metastases from gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven consecutive patients with 21 GIST liver metastases received RF ablation under computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic guidance. Liver metastases were solitary in two patients and multiple in five patients, with a mean maximum tumor diameter of 2.2 cm±1.1 (range, 1.2-4.2 cm). In addition to feasibility and safety, local tumor progression and overall and GIST-related survival associated with RF ablation were assessed. RESULTS All liver metastases were treated in 12 RF sessions, after which contrast-enhanced CT showed disappearance of tumor enhancement. No RF procedure-related complications occurred. Local tumor progression developed in one tumor (4.8%) during the mean follow-up period of 30.6 months±27.5 (range, 5.9-76.4 mo). New liver metastasis in untreated liver and lung metastasis developed in one patient each. One patient died of subarachnoid hemorrhage 5.9 months after RF ablation, but no GIST-related deaths occurred. The respective overall and GIST-related survival rates were 85.7% (95% confidence interval, 33.6%-97.8%) and 100% at 1, 3, and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation is a feasible, safe, and useful therapeutic option for the treatment for GIST liver metastases.

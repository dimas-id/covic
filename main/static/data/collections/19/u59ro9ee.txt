Objective The objective of this article is to conduct a single-centre evaluation and quick literature review of the effectiveness of primary flow-diverter (FD) treatment of ruptured blood blister aneurysms (BBAs), with additional relevance of adjunctive coiling. Methods Patients presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) due to ruptured BBAs and subsequently treated with FDs were retrospectively selected from June 2010 to January 2017. Treatment techniques, angiographic data on occlusion rates and procedural success as well as clinical outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were collated. Cross-reference of results were made with available literature. Results Thirteen patients harbouring 14 BBAs were recruited. Of the 14 aneurysms, five (35.7%) showed immediate complete occlusion after the procedure (four of these five patients had adjunctive coiling). All of the aneurysms showed complete occlusion by the six- to nine-month control diagnostic angiogram. No rebleed or retreatment was experienced. Twelve of 13 (92%) patients had an mRS score of 0-1 at the last clinical follow-up. From the pooled data of the literature review, eventual aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 48/56 patients, with five patients requiring further endovascular treatment. In the clinical follow-up period, an mRS of 0-2 was recorded for 83.3% (45/54) of patients. Conclusion Endovascular reconstruction of BBAs using FD treatment is an effective method with good final clinical outcomes. Adjunctive use of coiling achieves higher incidence of immediate complete occlusion of BBAs.

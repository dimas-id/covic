Introduction:Improved antisepsis of human and non-human surfaces has been identified as a key feature of transmission reduction. There are no previous studies of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated nasal and oral antiseptic formulations of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) for virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report on the efficacy of PVP-I against the virus that causes COVID-19. Methods: PVP-I nasal antiseptic formulations and PVP-I oral rinse antiseptic formulations from 1-5% concentrations as well as controls were studied for virucidal efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Test compounds were evaluated for ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as measured in a virucidal assay. SARS-CoV-2 was exposed directly to the test compound for 60 seconds, compounds were then neutralized and surviving virus was quantified. Results: All concentrations of nasal antiseptics and oral rinse antiseptics evaluated completely inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Conclusions: Nasal and oral PVP-I antiseptic solutions are effective at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus at a variety of concentrations after 60s exposure times. The formulations tested may help to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 if used for nasal decontamination, oral decontamination or surface decontamination in known or suspected cases of COVID-19.

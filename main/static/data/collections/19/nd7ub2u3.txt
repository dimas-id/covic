Methods that enable rapid, sensitive and specific analyses of nucleic acid sequences have positive effects on precise disease diagnostics and effective clinical treatments by providing direct insight into clinically relevant genetic information. Thus far, many CRISPR/Cas systems have been repurposed for diagnostic functions and are revolutionizing the accessibility of robust diagnostic tools due to their high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity. As RNA-guided targeted recognition effectors, Cas9 variants have been utilized for a variety of diagnostic applications, including biosensing assays, imaging assays and target enrichment for next-generation sequencing (NGS), thereby enabling the development of flexible and cost-effective tests. In addition, the ensuing discovery of Cas proteins (Cas12 and Cas13) with collateral cleavage activities has facilitated the development of numerous diagnostic tools for rapid and portable detection, and these tools have great potential for point-of-care settings. However, representative reviews proposed on this topic are mainly confined to classical biosensing applications; thus, a comprehensive and systematic description of this fast-developing field is required. In this review, based on the detection principle, we provide a detailed classification and comprehensive discussion of recent works that harness these CRISPR-based diagnostic tools from a new perspective. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of CRISPR-based diagnostics are outlined.

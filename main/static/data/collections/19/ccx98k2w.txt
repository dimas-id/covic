Contemporary management of early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is evolving and can be attributed to a change in size and histology of lung cancer, advancements in imaging modalities, instrumentation and surgical techniques. The emergence of segmentectomy has further challenged the existing treatment landscape, with promising results. Despite limited widespread adoption, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) segmentectomy is a safe option in the treatment of patients with small stage I lung cancers, with excellent oncologic results and improved morbidity relative to open techniques. In this paper, we critically examine the utility of segmentectomy, and the emerging role of VATS, including technical tips and tricks, in the management of T1a lung carcinoma.

PURPOSE The use prosthetic materials for the surgical repair of abdominal wall defects has become almost standard practice. This study was designed to assess the expression of different growth factors (VEGF/TGF-β1) and macrophages during the early host tissue incorporation of several polypropylene lightweight (PP-LW)-including one partially absorbable-and heavyweight (PP-HW) prosthetic meshes. METHODS Ventral defects were created in the anterior abdominal wall of New Zealand rabbits and repaired by fixing PP-LW meshes of different pore size and a low porosity PP-HW mesh to the edges of the defect. Following killing 14 days after implant, specimens were taken to examine TGF-β1/VEGF gene and protein expression by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The macrophage response was also assessed. RESULTS All the materials showed good host tissue incorporation, with a more severe inflammatory reaction and greater numbers of macrophages recorded in the partially absorbable LW implants. Relative amounts of VEGF mRNA were significantly lower for the LW partially absorbable implants compared with the remaining LW meshes. Protein expression of VEGF showed undetectable or minimum staining in the different groups. TGF-β1 mRNA levels were also lower in the partially absorbable group compared with one of PP-LW type of mesh. Gene expression patterns were consistent with the TGF-β1 protein levels detected. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that VEGF and TGF-β1 expression were independent of mesh pore size. The expression of both growth factors and the macrophage response were correlated with the presence of biodegradable material in the mesh. The presence of absorbable material in the LW mesh gave rise to a more intense inflammatory reaction and the reduced synthesis of growth factors known to contribute to neotissue maturation.

Sepsis is the leading cause of death in infants and children worldwide. The growing drug resistance in nosocomial gram-negative bacteria has resulted in treatment challenges. One of the most common multi-drug-resistant bacteria is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistance to antibiotics used in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections limits the therapeutic options. We present a tigecycline administration in a 5-month-old infant with patent arterial duct, heart failure, and respiratory failure due to respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis with subsequent respiratory distress syndrome and severe sepsis caused by multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite combined antibiotic therapy with meropenem, amikacin, and colistin, inflammatory markers increased. Because of life-threatening condition, tigecycline was added to the therapy and was administered intravenously twice daily. Within 48 h, inflammatory markers started to decrease and tigecycline therapy continued for 13 days without adverse effects. Tigecycline used in combination with other antibiotics might be a valuable therapeutic approach in the management of multi-drug-resistant bacteria infections in pediatric patients when conventional antibiotics have failed. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline administration in critically ill pediatric patients.

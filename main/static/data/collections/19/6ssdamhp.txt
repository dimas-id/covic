Otitis, sinusitis, and mastoiditis represent a range of common upper respiratory tract infections that are more common in children than in adults. The clinical presentation of otitis varies based on the anatomic site of disease. Acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion are infections of the middle ear, and otitis externa is infection of the external auditory canal. Otitis is one of the most common infections seen in young children. Each case represents an opportunity to practice precise diagnostic skills and to practice judicious antibiotic use. Sinusitis, while also relatively common, may present with nonspecific signs and symptoms. An accurate diagnosis requires a complete history and careful physical examination to help distinguish between viral rhinosinusitis, a condition that is usually self-limiting, and bacterial rhinosinusitis, a condition that requires treatment with antibiotics. Mastoiditis is a less common condition that can occur as a complication of otitis media. Prompt recognition and appropriate antibiotic treatment, often in combination with surgical debridement, is required to prevent further spread of the infection and the development of secondary complications.

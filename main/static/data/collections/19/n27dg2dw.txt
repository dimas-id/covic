Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders characterized by relative or absolute lack of insulin; this can lead to several ocular manifestations, among them diabetic retinopathy and cataracts. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microangiopathy that involves retinal precapillary arterioles, postcapillary venules, and large vessels, causing them to be functionally and anatomically incompetent. Hyperglycemia seems to be the most probable cause of damage to the retina due to interference in cellular metabolism and transduction processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate retinal thickness in eight diabetic dogs, four females and four males of different breeds and ages ranging from 6 to 15 years, by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to compare them with non-diabetic dogs. Assessment provided by OCT in diabetic dogs showed retinal layers thinning and loss of stratification when compared to non-diabetic dogs (198&#956;m versus 219&#956;m respectively), with statistical significance (p=0.008). OCT images may suggest that diabetes mellitus causes retinal neuropathy in dogs, as also seen in diabetic humans.(AU)

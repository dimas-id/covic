OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2 types of external ureteral stents on the number of urological complications after kidney transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from 366 consecutive transplants performed between January 2013 and January 2015 in our hospital, in which an external ureteral stent was placed during surgery and removed after 9 days. Urological complications were defined as urinary leakage or ureteral stenosis requiring percutaneous nephrostomy placement. RESULTS A total of 197 patients received a straight stent with 2 larger side holes (type A; 8F "Covidien" tube; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and 169 patients received a single J stent with 7 smaller side holes (type B; 7F "Teleflex" single J stent; Teleflex Medical, Athlone, Ireland). We found a significantly higher number of percutaneous nephrostomy placements with type A stents, with 34 (17%) versus 16 (9%) in type B (P = .030). Reason for percutaneous nephrostomy placement, occurrence of stent dysfunction, and need for early removal (< 8 days) were equal in both groups (P = .397), whereas incidence of rejection and urinary tract infection were higher in type B stent group. Patient and graft survival did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Use of the type B stent was associated with less urological complications compared with the type A stent.

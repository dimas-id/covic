Despite recent advances in endovascular therapy for peripheral artery disease, current technologies remain limited by rates of long-term restenosis and application to complex lesion subsets. This article presents data on upcoming therapies, including novel drug-coated balloons, drug-eluting stents, bioresorbable scaffolds, novel drug delivery therapies to target arteries, techniques to limit postangioplasty dissection, and treatment of severely calcified lesions.

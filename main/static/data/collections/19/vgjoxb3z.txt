PROBLEM While studies have discussed the parenting practices and challenges of African immigrants, no paper has synthesized the results of these qualitative studies. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the literature to summarize and interpret knowledge of African immigrants' parenting practices and challenges in destination countries to identify future directions for research, policy, and practice. ELIGIBILITY We used a qualitative research synthesis method involving meta-summary and meta-synthesis of the literature. A research librarian assisted in searching ten databases. Two members of the research team independently reviewed 1794 articles. We included articles that: (a) reported a qualitative research study; (b) was written in English; and (c) provided the perspective of African immigrant parents on their parenting practices and/or challenges. SAMPLE A total of 24 articles met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS Our results indicate that parenting practices of African immigrants include the following: changes in discipline practices across transnational borders and the use of physical discipline, respect as a deeply embedded value of parenting, integration of cultural values into parenting, and integration of religious practices into parenting. We also found gender differences in parenting. Challenges faced by African immigrants in parenting their children in destination countries include lack of informal/community support, access to services and lack of formal support, cultural conflict in parenting, fear related to social services, and language barriers. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our study identifies a need for culturally appropriate policies and practices that build on the strengths of African immigrants in destination countries while addressing their unique challenges.

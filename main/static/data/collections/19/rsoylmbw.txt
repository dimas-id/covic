Using 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequencing, we identified 6 patients infected with Elizabethkingia bruuniana treated at E-Da Hospital (Kaohsiung, Taiwan) during 2005-2017. We describe patient characteristics and the molecular characteristics of the E. bruuniana isolates, including their MICs. Larger-scale studies are needed for more robust characterization of this pathogen.

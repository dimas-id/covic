Cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 include myocarditis, demand ischemia, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias with prothrombotic state being a major underlying pathogenetic mechanism In this report we present a case of a 57-year-old, otherwise healthy, woman who presented with chest pain and nausea and was found to have an inferior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the setting of an active COVID-19 infection Angiography revealed tortuous coronary arteries with a 100% right coronary artery occlusion with high thrombus burden and normal left coronary system In light of the available literature regarding the pro-thrombotic effects of this novel corona virus, we continued full dose anticoagulation with Enoxaparin after the cardiac catheterization and transitioned to rivaroxaban and we also continued the patient on dual antiplatelet therapy prior to discharge

AIM To evaluate the effect of instant urinary catheterization on pregnancy rates in women who are on bed rest after embryo transfer (ET). METHODS This retrospective study included patients who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment at the Akdeniz University Fertility Clinic between January 2015 and March 2016. All patients were advised bed rest for an hour after ET. The clinic's electronic database was screened to identify the uterine anatomy of the patients, transferred embryo quality, and urinary catheterization status. Only women with an anteverted and anteflexed uterus and cycles that resulted in high-quality blastocyst transfers were included in this analysis. Finally, 71 cycles with urinary catheterization and 81 cycles with no catheterization were analyzed. RESULTS The clinical (53.5 vs. 40.7%, p = 0.115) and ongoing pregnancy (43.7 vs. 35.8%, p = 0.323) rates were comparable between urinary catheterization and non-catheterization groups. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression including confounding factors revealed that urinary catheterization was independently associated with clinical pregnancy (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.03-4.13, p = 0.041). However, no significant association was detected between catheterization and the clinically more relevant, ongoing pregnancy (OR 1.65, 95% CI 0.82-3.30, p = 0.160). CONCLUSION Our preliminary findings on the use of instant urinary catheterization after ET are promising and justify further investigation in larger prospective studies.

Pregnancy has been associated with severe influenza, an association highlighted during the 2009 pandemic of influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection. To assess the underlying mechanism, we infected pregnant and non-pregnant ferrets with A(H1N1) pdm09 virus. A(H1N1)pdm09-infected pregnant ferrets also had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in their pulmonary tracts. Systemically, total CD8(+) T cell counts and A(H1N1)pdm09-specific B-cell responses in blood were significantly lower in pregnant ferrets. This model predicts that the poorer outcome for pregnant women during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic was due to an elevated level of viral replication and to a cytokine imbalance that led to a less effective immune response.

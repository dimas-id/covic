BACKGROUND Leakage and benign strictures occur frequently after esophagectomy. The objective of this study was to analyze the outcome of hand-sewn end-to-end versus end-to-side cervical esophagogastric anastomoses. METHODS A series of 390 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction was analyzed. RESULTS The end-to-end technique was performed in 112 (29 %) patients and the end-to-side in 278 (71 %) patients. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 20 (18 %) patients with an end-to-end anastomosis versus 58 (21 %) patients with an end-to-side anastomosis (p = 0.50). A higher incidence in anastomotic strictures was seen in end-to-end anastomoses (48 (43 %)) compared with end-to-side anastomoses (89 (32 %); p = 0.04). Moreover, a median of 11 (7-17) dilations was necessary in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group compared with four (2-8) dilations in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group (p < 0.036). After multivariate analysis, the difference in anastomotic leakage rates remained nonsignificant (p = 0.74), whereas anastomotic stricture rate and number of dilations were higher in the end-to-end group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION The technique of anastomosis is not significantly related to anastomotic leakage rate. However, patients with end-to-end anastomoses develop postoperative strictures more frequently, requiring a higher number of dilations compared to end-to-side anastomoses.

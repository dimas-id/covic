BACKGROUND/AIM Adequate mediastinal lymphadenectomy during thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TE) requires an extensive operating field. In order to rectify this problem, we developed slender tracheal forceps that can pass through a 12-mm trocar. PATIENTS AND METHODS TE in the prone position was performed in 58 patients with esophageal cancer using slender tracheal forceps. Perioperative and postoperative clinical data were compared against those of 61 patients who underwent transthoracic open esophagectomy (OE). RESULTS The mean duration of thoracic manipulation was significantly longer in the TE than OE group: 226.2 versus 171.3 minutes (p<0.0001). Mean blood loss was significantly lower in the TE than OE group: 39.9 versus 176.8 g (p<0.0001). A mean of 23.4 mediastinal lymph nodes were dissected in the TE group and 25.1 in the OE group. The timing of extubation tended to be earlier in the TE group. Postoperative morbidity did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION Slender tracheal forceps are acceptable for fine mediastinal lymphadenectomy in thoracoscopic surgery for esophageal cancer, and the technique could contribute to development of minimally invasive surgery.

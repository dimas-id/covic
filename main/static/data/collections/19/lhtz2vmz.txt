OBJECTIVE Head trauma is one of the most important emergency health problems both in the world and in our country. The objective in our study is to (i) state the correlation between the findings of bispectral index score (BIS) and computed tomography (CT), which are used to evaluate the level of consciousness of patients with isolated head trauma, and (ii) investigate objective results about the patient's level of consiousness/alertness according to the CT modality, which is used frequently. METHODS This prospective study was carried out between 03.01.2014 and 09.01.2014 in the emergency department of Fatih Sultan Mehmet Education and Research Hospital. The average BIS scores were correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) point, the Canadian CT Head Rule major and minor criteria, and the pathologic findings in CT imaging. The patients' demographic features, vital signs at admission, and arrival times at the hospital were investigated. RESULTS In our study, 64 (31.7%) patients were female, and 138 (68.3%) patients were male. The mean BIS scores were 84.99±11.20 (86.05) and 93.78±3.80 (95.05) in patients with and without CT pathologies, respectively. The correlation between CT pathology and BIS scores was statistically significant: BIS scores were lower in patients with CT pathologies (p=0.001; p<0.01). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the BIS and GCS scores (45.6%) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION We showed that most head traumas occur after dangerous accidents, and according to the results, we can predict that males are more frequently affected than females. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between BIS scores and GCS points. In our study, the BIS scores were statistically significantly lower in patients with CT pathology than in patients without. We can predict that if the BIS score of the patient is low, then there will be the presence of pathology on CT imaging.

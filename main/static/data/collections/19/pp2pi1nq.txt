Fifteen 6‐week‐old crossbred weaners weighing about 12 kg each were randomly divided into three groups of five animals each. One group of pigs was inoculated first with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus and then 3 days later with CSF virus. The second group received classical swine fever (CSF) virus, while the third group was inoculated with PRRS virus only. The aim of the experiment was to determine whether a primary PRRS virus infection influences the clinical outcome of experimentally induced CSF in young pigs. The PRRS virus infected weaners developed mild respiratory symptoms and recovered completely. All five weaners which were inoculated with CSF virus only showed severe clinical signs typical of the acute form of CSF. One pig had to be killed 15 days post‐inoculation (p.i.); the remaining four died between the 18th and 22nd day p.i. The clinical course of the animals inoculated with both viruses was slightly different from that of the pigs that received only CSF virus. Four out of five pigs from the PRRS/CSF group became febrile and viraemic earlier than the animals which received CSF virus only. These pigs had to be killed 15–17 days post CSF virus inoculation. One animal in this group survived the acute phase of CSF and recovered completely. It was concluded that the observed divergences of the clinical courses would not have been noticed under field conditions. Therefore these findings cast doubt on the relevance of PRRS virus infection potentiating significantly the clinical outcome of CSF in young pigs.

AIM To establish the provision of fetal surgery for myelomeningocele (MMC) worldwide. METHODS Through the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD) Fetal Therapy Special Interest Group and the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet), fetal therapy centres were surveyed (September 2017-June 2018) regarding availability of fetal MMC surgical repair, patient inclusion criteria, repair techniques, number of cases, and outcome reporting. Responses were summarised on an interactive map on the ISPD website. RESULTS Forty-four of 59 centres responded (74.6%) of which 34 centres (77.1%) currently offered fetal surgery for MMC and seven centres (15.9%) were awaiting a first case after service set up. Patient inclusion criteria were similar and based on the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) trial. Five centres (14.7%) operated beyond 26 weeks' gestational age, outside the MOMS criteria. Open fetal surgery was provided in 23 centres (67.6%), fetoscopic surgery only in five (14.7%), and six centres offered both types (17.6%). Neurosurgical closure was similar for open surgery but highly variable in fetoscopy surgery. The median number of cases per centre was 21 (range 1-253). CONCLUSIONS Fetal surgery for MMC is now offered globally. Two thirds of centres offer open repair via hysterotomy using criteria based on the MOMS trial.

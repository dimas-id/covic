INTRODUCTION: The secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) family provides a seemingly endless array of potential biological functions that is only beginning to be appreciated. In humans, this family comprises 9 different members that vary in their tissue distribution, hydrolytic activity, and phospholipid substrate specificity. Through their lipase activity, these enzymes trigger various cell-signaling events to regulate cellular functions, directly kill bacteria, or modulate inflammatory responses. In addition, some sPLA(2)â€™s are high affinity ligands for cellular receptors. OBJECTIVE: This review merely scratches the surface of some of the actions of sPLA(2)s in innate immunity, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. The goal is to provide an overview of recent findings involving sPLA(2)s and to point to potential pathophysiologic mechanisms that may become targets for therapy.

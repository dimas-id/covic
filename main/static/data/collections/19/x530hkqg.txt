The phenomenon of dynamic stall produce adverse aerodynamic loading which can adversely affect the structural strength and life of aerodynamic systems. Aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) provides an effective approach for delaying and mitigating dynamic stall characteristics without the addition of auxiliary system. ASO, however, requires multiple evaluations time-consuming computational fluid dynamics models. Metamodel-based optimization (MBO) provides an efficient approach to alleviate the computational burden. In this study, the MBO approach is utilized for the mitigation of dynamic stall characteristics while delaying dynamic stall angle of the flow past wind turbine airfoils. The regression Kriging metamodeling technique is used to approximate the objective and constrained functions. The airfoil shape design variables are described with six PARSEC parameters. A total of 60 initial samples are used to construct the metamodel, which is further refined with 20 infill points using expected improvement. The metamodel is validated with the normalized root mean square error based on 20 test data samples. The refined metamodel is used to search for the optimal design using a multi-start gradient-based method. The results show that an optimal design with a [Formula: see text] delay in dynamic stall angle as well a reduction in the severity of pitching moment coefficients can be obtained.

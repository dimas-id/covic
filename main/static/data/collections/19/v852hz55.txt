OBJECTIVE Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy for which an optimal treatment algorithm is lacking. We endeavored to assess the current treatment outcomes for SDC with a multimodality treatment approach combining surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy Â± concurrent chemotherapy. STUDY DESIGN Case series with chart review. SETTING A National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The clinical record of 17 patients with salivary duct carcinoma were analyzed to assess locoregional control, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS All SDC cases (n = 17) were managed with surgical resection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (47.1%) or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (52.9%). Median patient follow up was 37 months. An aggressive disease course was generally observed, with 3-year recurrence-free survival and overall survival of 34.4% and 35.5%, respectively. The majority of recurrences were distant. Intensification with adjuvant concurrent chemotherapy was not associated with improved outcomes on univariate survival analysis. CONCLUSION For salivary duct carcinoma, a multimodality treatment approach is associated with acceptable locoregional control rates but poor distant control and overall survival. Novel systemic therapies may be needed to optimize clinical outcomes.

In this issue of Blood, DeBaun(1) proposes a forward-thinking evidence-based strategy to limit the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) at high risk for stroke. DeBaun argues that rapid initiation of low- and fixed-dose (10 mg/kg per day) hydroxyurea treatment while the children are receiving prophylactic chronic transfusions, and before blood supply is disrupted, ensures that when blood shortages do occur, the clinical benefit of hydroxyurea will be more quickly established, and the children will be better protected.

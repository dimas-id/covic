The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has influenced clinical care in unprecedented ways. There is an urgent need to share best practice in providing diabetes care services in areas affected by COVID. This is a brief review for clinicians managing diabetes in low-income countries based on currently available data. The data is rapidly evolving; however, people with diabetes and its related comorbidities have increased risk for severe disease, and prolonged recovery and mortality. This review is also informed by data from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These two viruses share similarities with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus with causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was also known as 2019-nCOV. We discuss glucovigilance in COVID-19, the challenges and the opportunities. We put a spotlight on investigational new drugs for treatment of COVID medications and virtual care. Diabetologists and clinicians handling high-volume diabetes clinics are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19.

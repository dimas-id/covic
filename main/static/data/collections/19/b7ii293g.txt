AIM Aim of this study was to report the authors' experience with the anterior transperitoneal approach, and with an anterior submesocolic approach in case of left sided lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 1994 to January 2011, 122 males and 170 females with a mean age of 50.7 years (range: 19-84) underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) at 2 centers in Ancona and Rome (Italy) (that follow the same protocol). Fifteen patients underwent bilateral LA, the anterior transperitoneal approach was used in 233 cases (79.8%) and the anterior submesocolic in 59 (20.2%). One hundred and two patients had Conn's syndrome, 51 miscellaneous lesions, 55 Cushing's syndrome, 47 incidentalomas, 46 pheochromocytoma, 2 metastatic masses, 2 myelolipomas and 2 adrenogenital syndromes. The lesions had a mean diameter of 3.24 cm (range: 0.5-10). RESULTS Mean operating time was 120 minutes (range: 30-390). Conversion to open surgery was required in 13 cases (4,45%). Blood pressure and heart rate were stable during the operation. There were 5 major complications. Mobilization and resumption of diet occurred on the first postoperative day. Mean hospital stay was 4.32 days (range: 2-30). DISCUSSION Early identification and ligature of the adrenal vein, with minimal gland manipulation, are the major advantages, especially in case of pheochromocytoma. CONCLUSIONS Adrenal masses can be successfully treated using a laparoscopic transperitoneal anterior approach, in presence of a suitable anesthesiological and surgical team's experience.

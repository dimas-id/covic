Morgagni hernia is a rare type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia caused by lack of fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membrane anteriorly leading to a defect in the foramen of Morgagni. These are rare hernias and typically present early in life. Those that do not get repaired during infancy or adolescence often present later in life with variable symptoms including obstruction, incarceration, strangulation, pulmonary symptoms, chest pain, etc. Herein we present an adult case that was found incidentally after a screening computerized tomography (CT) chest scan was done for history of smoking. There are two unique aspects to this case: first, given the large size of her hernia, her only complaint was mild shortness of breath and second, the innovative use of mesh as a suture bolster.

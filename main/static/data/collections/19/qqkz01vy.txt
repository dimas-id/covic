We have read with great interest the article by Fernandez‐Nieto et al. showing histopathological pictures of one of the two biopsied cases from their 24 patients diagnosed of vesicular lesions related to COVID‐19.(1) They additionally performed a real‐time PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 that was negative in four tested cases.(1) Regarding their case histopathological pictures, we agree with their description as we can observe acantholytic cells, some of them with dyskeratotic features or grouped without a clear molding of nucleus but reminiscent of the multinucleated giant cells typically observed in herpetic lesions, a picture that looks to our eyes, most likely as an infrequent entity named pseudoherpetic Grover disease (GD),(2) first described as vesicular GD by Fernandez‐Figueras.(3)

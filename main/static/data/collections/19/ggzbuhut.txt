A heterologous neutralization assay for feline infectious peritonitis virus serology was developed using a single continuous cell line of canine origin, A-72, which is susceptible to cytopathic infection with both transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs and canine coronavirus. Of several coronavirus isolates tested, the 1-71 isolate of canine coronavirus demonstrated the most effective neutralization by serum and body fluids of cats with histopathologically confirmed feline infectious peritonitis.

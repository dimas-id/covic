To identify the potential B-cell antigenic epitopes within the N-terminus of SARS-CoV (SARS-associated coronavirus, SARS-CoV) M protein and characterize monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the protein as well as its recognizing region, we expressed and purified a portion of SARS-CoV M protein (amino acid 1–43) in Escherichia coli (E. coli). By using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we showed that the purified recombinant M protein could be recognized by four SARS-CoV-positive human sera even when those sera were 12,800-fold diluted. Furthermore, we characterized one representative IgG2 MAb, 3H9, which exhibited a strong immunoreaction to both recombinant M protein and native viral protein of SARS-CoV. We found a B-cell antigenic epitope located between amino acid 1–15 and defined the MAb recognizing region within amino acid 16–28 of M. These findings not only suggest that both recombinant M protein and its specific MAbs may be used as the diagnostic reagents for SARS, but also provide a potential target site for the design of an epitope-based vaccine against SARS.

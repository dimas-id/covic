While ranking approaches have made rapid advances in the Web search, systems that cater to the complex information needs in professional search tasks are not widely developed, common issues and solutions typically rely on dedicated search strategies backed by ad-hoc retrieval models. In this paper we present a legal search problem where professionals monitor news articles with constant queries on a periodic basis. Firstly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using traditional retrieval models against the Boolean search of documents in chronological order. In an attempt to capture the complex information needs of users, a learning to rank approach is adopted with user specified relevance criteria as features. This approach, however, only achieves mediocre results compared to the traditional models. However, we find that by fine-tuning a contextualised language model (e.g. BERT), significantly improved retrieval performance can be achieved, providing a flexible solution to satisfying complex information needs without explicit feature engineering.

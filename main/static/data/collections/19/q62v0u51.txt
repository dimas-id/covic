Groups in ecology are often affected by sudden environmental perturbations. Parameters of stochastic models are often imprecise due to various uncertainties. In this paper, we formulate a stochastic Holling II one-predator two-prey system with jumps and interval parameters. Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution. Moreover, the sufficient conditions for the extinction and persistence in the mean of the solution are obtained.

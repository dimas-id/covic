The ecology of cytopathic expression of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in HRT-18 cells was analyzed within virus-induced plaques by scanning electron microscopy. Virus replication was cytocidal for many HRT-18 cells, a function enhanced in the presence of trypsin. A monolayer of cells remained that imparted a characteristic turbidity to the plaque. These structurally normal, lysis-resistant cells did not stain with fluorescent antibodies specific for BCV antigens, failed to adsorb virus particles or mouse erythrocytes in contrast to the susceptible cells. The survival of cells in the plaque interior reflects a non-productively infected population with evidence of viral persistence.

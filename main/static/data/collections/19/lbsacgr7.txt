Children have shown more physical resilience to COVID-19 than adults, but there is a cohort of vulnerable infants and young children who may experience disease burden, both in the acute phase and chronically. Children may have had early undocumented exposure to COVID-19. Even when the risk of exposure was known, developmental variables may have made the avoidance of physical proximity difficult for children. Preliminary hypotheses concerning neurotropic factors have been documented by researchers. Children with COVID-19 and comorbid physical or mental disorders may be vulnerable to exacerbations of neurotropic factors and comorbidities, the neural impact of which has been documented for other coronaviruses. Researchers are investigating COVID-19 symptom descriptions, neurotropic mechanisms at the genomic and transcriptomatic levels, neurological manifestations, and the impact of comorbid health complications. Neuropsychologists need information concerning the likely impact of COVID-19 on children. With a view toward that goal, this article provides recommendations for relevant for some initial updates in neuropsychology practice.

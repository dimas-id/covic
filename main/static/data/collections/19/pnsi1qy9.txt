PURPOSE To assess the impact of mesh size and fixation devices on short-term outcomes in a consecutive series of tension-free laparoscopic abdominal wall repairs. METHODS Data for 120 consecutive, unselected patients undergoing tension-free laparoscopic incisional (n=63) or umbilical (n=57) hernia repair were prospectively collected. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate variables influencing outcomes. RESULTS Persistent seromas were observed in 13 patients (10.83%) and 2 recurrences (1.98%) occurred. Mesh size >300 cm was associated with increased hospital stay [odds ratio (OR) 4.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-15.53; P=0.008], increased postoperative day 1 (POD1) pain assessed with visual analog scale (OR 5.51; 95% CI, 1.76-17.2; P=0.003), and the presence of complications (OR 10.4; 95% CI, 1.85-58.96; P=0.007). Body mass index >30 resulted in increased hospital stay (OR 3.05; 95% CI, 1.23-7.57; P=0.01) and increased POD1 visual analog scale (OR 2.28; 95% CI, 1-5.18; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS Mesh size and obesity were the main factors influencing postoperative outcomes.

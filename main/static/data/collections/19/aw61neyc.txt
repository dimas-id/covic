Methamidophos (MET) is a pesticide that has toxic properties, including effects on fertility. This study aimed to assess the joint action of treatment time and exposure to methamidophos on the male reproductive system. MET was orally administered to adult male Swiss mice at a dose of 0.004 mg.kg(−1) for 15 and 50 consecutive days. The following parameters were evaluated: weight of reproductive organs, spermatogenesis, sperm and Sertoli cell count, daily sperm production and sperm transit time. Short-term exposure to methamidophos induced a decrease in epididymal weight. The frequency of stages V–VI of spermatogenesis increased and the frequency of stage IX decreased. In the epididymis, sperm transit time (caput/corpus) was reduced and the relative sperm number (cauda) increased. Long-term exposure induced an increase in the frequencies of stages I–IV and V-VI and decreased the stages VII-VIII and IX. The number of Sertoli cells with evident nucleoli was reduced in both exposures. These results confirm the reproductive toxicity of MET.

Over the last 2 decades, yeast two-hybrid became an invaluable technique to decipher protein–protein interaction networks. In the field of virology, it has proven instrumental to identify virus–host interactions that are involved in viral embezzlement of cellular functions and inhibition of immune mechanisms. Here, we present a yeast two-hybrid protocol that has been used in our laboratory since 2006 to search for cellular partners of more than 300 viral proteins. Our aim was to develop a robust and straightforward pipeline, which minimizes false-positive interactions with a decent coverage of target cDNA libraries, and only requires a minimum of equipment. We also discuss reasons that motivated our technical choices and compromises that had to be made. This protocol has been used to screen most non-structural proteins of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of betacoronavirus genus, against a mouse brain cDNA library. Typical results were obtained and are presented in this report.

No effective treatment for COVID-19 has been well established yet. Nafamostat, known as anticoagulant, has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities against COVID-19. We report three cases of COVID-19 pneumonia who progressed while using antiviral drugs and needed supplementary oxygen therapy, improved after treatment with nafamostat. These preliminary findings show the possibility that Nafamostat can be considered to be used in elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who need oxygen therapy. The effectiveness of nafamostat should be evaluated in further studies.

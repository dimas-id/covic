In response to the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, the Georgia Department of Public Health developed the Infectious Disease Network (IDN) based on an EVD preparedness needs assessment of hospitals and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers. The network consists of 12 hospitals and 16 EMS providers with staff specially trained to provide a coordinated response and utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the transport or treatment of a suspected or confirmed serious communicable disease patient. To become a part of the network, each hospital and EMS provider had to demonstrate EVD capabilities in areas such as infection control, PPE, waste management, staffing and ongoing training, and patient transport and placement. To establish the network, the Georgia Department of Public Health provided training and equipment for EMS personnel, evaluated hospitals for EVD capabilities, structured communication flow, and defined responsibilities among partners. Since March 2015, the IDN has been used to transport, treat, and/or evaluate suspected or confirmed serious communicable disease cases while ensuring health care worker safety. Integrated infectious disease response systems among hospitals and EMS providers are critical to ensuring health care worker safety, and preventing or mitigating a serious communicable disease outbreak.

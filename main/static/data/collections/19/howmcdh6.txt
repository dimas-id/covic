1. We have demonstrated for the first time that the helicase of a ribonucleic acid virus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is a valid target for drug development. 2. Using high throughput screen and chemical synthesis, several lead compounds targeting the SARS-CoV helicase have been identified. We have shown that these compounds can inhibit SARS-CoV helicase activity and viral growth in cell culture systems. These compounds can potentially be used to target other viruses.

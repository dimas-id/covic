The microbes that cause human infectious diseases are complex, dynamic, and constantly evolving. They reproduce rapidly, mutate frequently, adapt with relative ease to new environments and hosts, and frequently breach the species barrier between animals and humans. Social, economic, and environmental factors linked to a host of human populations and activities can accelerate and amplify these natural phenomena. The ability of infectious diseases to spread internationally—carried by humans, insect vectors, food and food products, and livestock—has been greatly augmented by the pressures of a crowded, closely interconnected, and highly mobile world. When they spread internationally, infectious diseases often lead to global emergencies.

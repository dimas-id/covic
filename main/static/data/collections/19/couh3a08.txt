BACKGROUND Patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) develop pancreatobiliary issues after surgery. Endoscopic management via the conventional route with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is quite limited due to the altered anatomy. Laparoscopic-assisted ERCP (LA-ERCP) via the excluded stomach has been highly successful. Reported use of laparoscopic-assisted EUS (LA-EUS) is extremely rare. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted at two tertiary referral centers for cases that involved laparoscopic-assisted ERCP and EUS. Patient demographic data were collected along with data regarding procedure, indication, complications and length of stay. RESULTS A total of 16 cases involving 15 patients were identified: 11 cases of LA-ERCP and five cases of combined LA-EUS plus LA-ERCP were performed. Four patients had previously undergone failed endoscopy via the conventional route (27 %). There was a 100 % biliary/pancreatic cannulation and intervention rate. There were no endoscopic-related complications. Therapeutic interventions included laparoscopic cholecystectomy, lysis of adhesions, biliary and pancreatic sphincterotomy, biliary and pancreatic stent placement, stone removal including mechanical lithotripsy and EUS biopsy and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Average discharge was on postoperative day 3.4. However, 50 % were discharged after 1 day. CONCLUSIONS LA-ERCP and combined LA-EUS plus LA-ERCP are safe and highly successful diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for a wide variety of pancreatobiliary ailments in RYGB patients.

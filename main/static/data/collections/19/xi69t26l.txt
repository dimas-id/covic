OBJECTIVE Current literature demonstrates a lack of comparative in vivo studies regarding laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF). This randomized trial aimed to compare 3 popular methods of minimizing or reducing LLF in laparoscopic surgery by heating the lens using warm saline, applying anti-fog solution to the lens, and rubbing the lens with chlorhexidine solution. METHODS Ninety-six participants underwent randomization to be allocated in control (n = 24), warm saline (n = 24), anti-fog solution (n = 24), and chlorhexidine groups (n = 24). The primary outcome measure was the severity of LLF during the first 3 min after laparoscope insertion into the abdominal cavity. The severity of LLF was rated on a 10-point visual clarity scale ranging from 0 (clearest) to 10 (foggiest). The secondary outcome measures were (1) the severity of LLF during the remaining operative time other than the first 3 min, (2) the number of lens cleansings, and (3) the total time required to clean the lens. RESULTS Lens fogging during the first 3 min and remaining operative time other than the first 3 min was significantly decreased in the warm saline group compared to that in the other 3 groups (all, P < 0.001). In post hoc analysis, the anti-fog solution group was significantly foggier than the warm saline group, but clearer than the chlorhexidine and control groups. The number of lens cleansings and total time required to clean the lens were significantly lower in the warm saline and anti-fog solution groups than in the chlorhexidine and control groups (all, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The use of warm saline leads to significantly fewer fogging events than the use of anti-fog solution or chlorhexidine solution, resulting in an improved continuity of surgery.

Cognitive impairment is a common occurrence that has been shown to occur in over 50 % of patients following critical illness. This impairment occurs across a range of domains including attention, memory, processing speed, and executive dysfunction. In this article, we will discuss the pathophysiology behind cognitive impairment including hypoxemia and cytokines. Secondly, we will describe the risk factors for cognitive impairment including age, length of stay, and delirium. Lastly, we will review emerging data related to the use of cognitive rehabilitation, formation of postintensive care clinics in qualifying patients, and potential neuropharmacologic therapy. While our chapter focuses on cognitive impairment generally, it places a particular emphasis on executive dysfunction, not because impairment occurs solely in this domain but because impairments of an executive nature may be uniquely debilitating.

Abstract The current pandemic has driven the medical community to adapt quickly to unprecedented challenges. Among these challenges is the need to minimize staff exposure to COVID-19 during neonatal cardiac procedures. In this report, we describe measures we have taken to protect health care workers while ensuring successful outcomes. These measures include wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, physical distancing, designating separate delivery and transport teams, and limiting the number of providers in direct contact with any patient who is infected or whose infection status is unknown. Learning objectives 1. To understand specific challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 2. To recognize measures that can be taken to minimize health care workers' exposures to the virus during high-risk neonatal cardiac procedures 3. To review the management of neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries and inadequate mixing

Aminopeptidase inhibitors strongly affect the proliferation and function of immune cells in man and animals and are promising agents for the pharmacological treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Membrane alanyl-aminopeptidase (mAAP) has been considered as the major target of these anti-inflammatory aminopeptidase inhibitors. Recent evidence also points to a role of the cytosol alanyl-aminopeptidase (cAAP) in the immune response. In this study we used quantitative RT-PCR to determine the mRNA expression of both cAAP and mAAP in resting and activated peripheral T cells and also in CD4+, CD8+, Th1, Th2 and Treg (CD4+ CD25+) subpopulations. Both mAAP and cAAP mRNAs were expressed in all cell types investigated, and in response to activation their expression appeared to be upregulated in CD8+ cells, but downregulated in Treg cells. In CD4+ cells, mAAP and cAAP mRNAs were affected in opposite ways in response to activation. The cAAP-specific inhibitor, PAQ-22, did not affect either cAAP or mAAP expression in activated CD4+ or CD8+ cells, whereas in activated Treg cells it markedly upregulated the mRNA levels of both aminopeptidases. The non-discriminatory inhibitor, phebestin, significantly increased the amount of mAAP and cAAP mRNA in CD4+ and that of cAAP in Treg cells.

A total of 239 human milk samples collected from mothers in Chiba City, Japan during 1994-1997 were tested for the presence of anti-coronavirus antibody. Interestingly, twelve human milk samples were positive for IgA against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, and this represented 5%. These findings provided evidence that the interspecies transmission of coronavirus between human and porcine might occur in nature. This report is noteworthy because it is the first, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrating the presence of antibody against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus in human milk.

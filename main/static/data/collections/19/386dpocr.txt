Using a participatory research approach, we enlisted 12 U.S. Centers for Independent Living (CILs) to recruit and enroll 170 adults with intellectual disability (ID) to be randomized to either The Safety Class, an abuse prevention group program, or usual care. Participants were asked to complete pre, post, and 3-month follow-up questionnaires. CIL staff members facilitated the eight-session, interactive program. Quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that participation in a brief safety program may improve safety protective factors among men and women with ID. The Safety Class serves as one model for delivering an abuse prevention and education intervention to adults with significant safety needs but extremely limited access to relevant community resources.

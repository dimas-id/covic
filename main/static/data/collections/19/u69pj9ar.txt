Dermal substitutes coupled with split thickness skin graft are the primary method of treating most severe full-thickness burns particularly when there is a lack of healthy donor skin. Although dermal replacements optimize functional and aesthetic outcomes in patients, the risk of infection and the amount of time required to process most dermal substitutes delay treatment potentially compromising graft take and the overall healing process. The purpose of this case series is to describe the treatment course of patients with severe burn injuries using a novel synthetic Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix (NovoSorb BTM) in conjunction with RECELL Autologous Cell Harvesting Device, a new methodology allowing for a timely point-of-care preparation of an autologous skin cell suspension in combination with a 3:1 split-thickness skin graft. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case series to describe the treatment algorithm and clinical outcomes of deep full-thickness burns utilizing BTM in conjunction with RECELL ASCS.

L-SIGN is a C-type lectin that is expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Capture of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) by this receptor results in trans-infection of hepatoma cells. L-SIGN alleles have been identified that encode between three and nine tandem repeats of a 23 residue stretch in the juxtamembrane oligomerization domain. Here, it was shown that these repeat-region isoforms are expressed at the surface of mammalian cells and variably bind HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 and HCV pseudoparticles. Differences in binding were reflected in trans-infection efficiency, which was highest for isoform 7 and lowest for isoform 3. These findings provide a molecular mechanism whereby L-SIGN polymorphism could influence the establishment and progression of HCV infection.

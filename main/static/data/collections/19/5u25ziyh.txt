Throughout the history of humanity, major global events have caused great changes in human practices. As the outbreak of COVID-19 has developed worldwide, various big events of the world are either cancelled or postponed like the Olympics, religious events, award ceremonies, etc. Numerous dermatological organizations have been monitoring daily recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, along with the numerous travel restrictions issued by companies and medical institutions. It has been a very difficult but necessary decision for all the organizers to cancel the meetings last minute or a few months in advance.

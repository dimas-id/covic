The spread of infectious disease is an inherently stochastic process. As such, real time control and prediction methods present a significant challenge. For diseases which spread through direct human interaction, (e.g., transferred from infected to susceptible individuals) the contagion process can be modeled on a social-contact network where individuals are represented as nodes, and contacts between individuals are represented as links. The model presented in this paper seeks to identify the infection pattern which depicts the current state of an ongoing outbreak. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely paths of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The heuristic performance is presented for a range of randomly generated networks and different levels of information. The model results, which include the most likely set of infection spreading contacts, can be used to provide insight into future epidemic outbreak patterns, and aid in the development of intervention strategies.

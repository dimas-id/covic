Hypoxic injury results in cell death, tissue damage and activation of inflammatory pathways. This is mediated by pathological Connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel (HC) opening resulting in osmotic and ionic imbalances as well as cytokine production perpetuating the inflammatory environment. Gap19 is an intracellularly acting Cx43 mimetic peptide that blocks HC opening and thus promotes cell survival. However, native Gap19, which must enter the cell in order to function, exhibits low cell permeability. In this study, Gap19 was conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide, Xentry, to investigate if cellular uptake could be improved while maintaining peptide function. Cellular uptake of Xentry-Gap19 (XG19) was much greater than that of native Gap19 even under normal cell culture conditions. Peptide function was maintained post uptake as shown by reduced ethidium homodimer influx and ATP release due to Cx43 HC block. While XG19 blocked pathologic HC opening though, normal gap junction communication required for cell repair and survival mechanisms was not affected as shown in a dye scrape-load assay. Under hypoxic conditions, increased expression of Syndecan-4, a plasma membrane proteoglycan targeted by Xentry, enabled even greater XG19 uptake leading to higher inhibition of ATP release and greater cell survival. This suggests that XG19, which is targeted specifically to hypoxic cells, can efficiently and safely block Cx43 HC and could therefore be a novel treatment for hypoxic and inflammatory diseases.

Treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia has evolved over the last two decades. Endovascular therapy is now the treatment of choice for patients with lesions amenable to such an approach. Open revascularization remains the standard of care but is frequently being reserved for lesions containing intraluminal thrombus or severe calcification. In most cases, celiac axis (CA) stenting is not needed since revascularization of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) alone results in symptomatic resolution. This report describes a case of a patient with chronic mesenteric ischemia and diffuse gastric ulcers found to have a common origin of the SMA and CA that was treated endovascularly using a bifurcated stent technique.

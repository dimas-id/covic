Background Fetuin-A and leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT-2) are liver-derived proteins. Fetuin-A is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obese patients with T2D have higher plasma fetuin-A levels than those without T2D. LECT-2 has positive correlation with the severity of both obesity and insulin resistance. The changes in plasma fetuin-A are not consistent after bariatric surgery and no studies have investigated the changes in LECT-2 on the obese patients with T2D after bariatric surgery. Methods Overall, 18 patients undergoing gastric bypass (GB) and 16 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were enrolled. The fasting plasma fetuin-A and LECT-2 levels were measured at baseline, one week, three months, and one year after surgery. Results Both the GB and SG groups significantly decreased the body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, a body shape index; the triglyceride, fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c, C-peptide levels; and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) one year after surgery. The SG group showed a decreasing trend in plasma fetuin-A levels one year after SG surgery. There are no significant changes in LECT-2 one year after either GB or SG. Fetuin-A had a near significant negative relationship with insulin (P = 0.056) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.050) in the SG group. Changes in fetuin-A had a significant positive relationship with changes in BMI (P = 0.031) and waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.031) in the GB group and had a near significant positive correlation with FBS (P = 0.051) in the SG group. Discussion Neither GB nor SG modifies plasma levels of plasma fetuin-A or LECT-2 in T2D patients after surgery. The changes in plasma fetuin-A have a positive correlation with those of the BMI and waist-to-hip ratio 12 months after GB.

A patent false lumen with persistent flow after endovascular repair of type B aortic dissection (TBAD) is associated with an ongoing risk of aortic dilation and rupture. We describe the case of a 64-year-old man who initially underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair for acute complicated TBAD, but continued to have symptomatic retrograde aneurysm filling and dilatation because of a patent false lumen. Coil embolization of the patent false lumen successfully excluded the aneurysmal thoracic aorta from further perfusion, and led to a decease in aneurysm size on follow-up. Our case report is followed by a discussion on this management strategy and a review of literature.

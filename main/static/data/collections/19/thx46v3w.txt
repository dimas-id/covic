PURPOSE OF REVIEW The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the recent research and progress made in the field of pediatric vasculitis. RECENT FINDINGS Over the past year, researchers have described several polymorphisms in Henoch-Schonlein purpura and Kawasaki Disease as well as the association between various vasculitides and infections. International and multidisciplinary efforts in Kawasaki Disease have resulted in recommendations for its diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management to improve patient care and further increase global collaboration. Researchers are investigating the role of inflammation and its role in endothelial health and atherosclerosis. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications; however, we continue to have incomplete treatment successes. SUMMARY Vasculitides are rare conditions with significant morbidity and mortality whose prognosis has improved with newer diagnostic modalities and treatments; however, we continue to have insufficient knowledge of vasculitides and lack unambiguous diagnostic criteria. As technology continues to progress it is clear that a single cause of these diseases may be an oversimplification: the genetic makeup of individuals, as well as various environmental exposures, are of vital importance in the pathophysiology and evolution of disease processes, as well as response to therapy. Efforts should continue to improve international multicenter collaboration and interdisciplinary efforts to help solve this ever-growing puzzle.

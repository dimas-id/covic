Abstract The sequence of the S gene of a field canine coronavirus (CCoV), strain Elmo/02, revealed low nucleotide (61%) and amino acid (54%) identity to reference CCoV strains. The highest correlation (77% nt and 81.7% aa) was found with feline coronavirus type I. A PCR assay for the S gene of strain Elmo/02 detected analogous CCoVs of different geographic origin, all which exhibited at least 92â€“96% nucleotide identity to each other and to strain Elmo/02. The evident genetic divergence between the reference CCoV strains and the newly identified Elmo/02-like CCoVs strongly suggests that a novel genotype of CCoV is widespread in the dog population.

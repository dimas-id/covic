We characterize the precompact sets in spaces of vector valued continuous functions and use the resulting criteria to investigate asymptotic behaviour of such functions defined on a halfline. This problem arose in the context of a qualitative study of solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem. We give particular consideration to the relationship between vector valued asymptotically almost periodic functions on a subinterval [α, ∞] of the real line and precompactness of the set of its translates. Our compactness criteria are also applied to a question concerning the approximation property for spaces of vector valued continuous functions with topologies induced by weighted analogues of the supremum norm. as well as to obtain nonlinear variants on factorization of compact operators through reflexive Banach spaces.

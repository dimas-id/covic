In South Korea, WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) was detected in 34 (7%) of 486 children with acute lower respiratory tract infections, 3 (4.2%) of 72 asymptomatic children, and as coinfection with other respiratory viruses in 23 (67.6%) children. Although WUPyV was frequently detected, its clinical role has not been distinguished from that of coinfecting viruses.

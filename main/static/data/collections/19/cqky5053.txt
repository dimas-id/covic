The survival of pathogens depends on their ability to overcome host immunity, especially arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) which must withstand the immune responses of both the host and the arthropod vector. Successful arboviruses often modify host immunity to accelerate pathogen transmission; however, few studies have explored the underlying mechanism. Here we report attracted herbivore infestation on the virus-infected plants promote transmission by the associated vector herbivore. This herbivore-induced defense suppression underpins a subversive mechanism used by Begomovirus, the largest genus of plant viruses, to compromise host defense for pathogen transmission. Begomovirus-infected plants accumulated βC1 proteins in the phloem where they were bound to host defense regulators, transcription factor WRKY20 and two mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6. Once perceiving whitefly herbivory or endogenous secreted peptide PEP1, the plants started dephosphorylation on serine33 and stimulated βC1 protein as a phosphatase. βC1 dephosphorylated MPK3/6 and WRKY20, the latter negatively regulated salicylic acid signaling and vascular callose deposition. This viral hijacking of WRKY20 accumulated more vascular callose by which enforced whitefly prolonged salivation and phloem sap ingestion, therefore impelling more virus transmission among plants. We present a scenario in which viruses dynamically respond to the presence of their vectors, suppressing host immunity and promoting pathogen transmission only when needed.

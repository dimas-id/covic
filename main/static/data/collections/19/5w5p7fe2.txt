BACKGROUND: The incidence of gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome has already been described in adults. Several approaches have been employed in the treatment of gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome with different outcomes. One of the most promising agents is eculizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody directed against C5 complement protein. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported the case of a 3-year-old white boy with medulloblastoma who underwent high-dose chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation. Afterwards he started maintenance chemotherapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. After five courses he presented a progressive clinical worsening, which resulted in a systemic thrombotic microangiopathy. Initially he was treated with rituximab without clinical improvement. Therefore he started therapy with repeated cycles of eculizumab. After seven infusions he showed a gradual improvement and finally a complete remission of gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Eculizumab prevents serious complement-mediated vascular damage for chemotherapy-induced thrombotic microangiopathy in pediatric cases.

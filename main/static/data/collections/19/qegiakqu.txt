Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has occurred in China and has spread around the world rapidly. As an acute respiratory infectious disease, COVID-19 has been included in type B infectious diseases and managed according to the standard of type A infectious disease in China. Given the high risk of COVID-19 infection during endoscopic procedures via an airborne route, the Chinese Society of Digestive Endoscopy issued a series of recommendations to guide the endoscopy works in China during the pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, no new infectious case of COVID-19 resulting from endoscopic procedures has been reported in China to date. Here, these recommendations are integrated to provide guidance about the prevention of COVID-19 for endoscopists. The recommendations include advice about postponing non-urgent endoscopies, excluding the possibility of COVID-19 in patients undergoing endoscopy, protection of medical staff from coronavirus infection, and cleaning of endoscopy centres.

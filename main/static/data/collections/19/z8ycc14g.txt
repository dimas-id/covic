Minimally invasive techniques to treat children and adolescents requiring surgery have increasingly become standard of care. Similarly, gynecologists frequently use laparoscopy to treat pelvic pathology. We present the necessary equipment and surgical techniques required to perform gynecologic procedures on the pediatric and adolescent population. We will give particular focus to the treatment of adnexal masses, chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, and ovarian torsion. We will also discuss the role of the incidental appendectomy in children and adolescents.

The outbreak of COVID-19 is now a pandemic. The Korean government has declared the highest infectious-disease alert as a 'red' and the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the highest level (Phase 6). Control of COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide public health problem that governments and individuals must overcome. Recently, infection cluster occurred in a call center located in Seoul. The Ministry of Employment and Labor has decided to support call center companies use the cost of installing partitions, air purifiers, hand sanitizers and masks to prevent droplet and aerosol infections. Air purifiers are expected to be installed on the floor and exhaust stayed on the higher level such as desk or breathing zone of worker. When a worker coughs or releases droplets near a colleague's respiratory system, the droplets can spread throughout the call center space through the air flow. If there is only one infected person, there is a chance that the infection cluster will increase. Installation of air purifiers may cause new problems, so the control to prevent infection should not lead to a new infection. Therefore, using the air purifier to control the COVID-19 should be approached with caution.

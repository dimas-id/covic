The intelligent research assistant, VERA, supports inquiry-based modeling by supplying contextualized large-scale domain knowledge in the Encyclopedia of Life. Learners can use VERA to construct conceptual models of ecological phenomena, run them as simulations, and review their predictions. A study on the use of VERA by college-level students indicates that providing access to large scale but contextualized knowledge helped students build more complex models and generate more hypotheses in problem-solving.

OBJECTIVE To observe clinical effect of heat-sensitive moxibustion on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to discusses the effective moxibustion treatment program. METHODS A total of 42 patients with COVID-19 (general type) were treated with heat-sensitive moxibustion at the acupoint area of Shenque (CV 8) and Tianshu (ST 25). The treatment was conducted under the standards of heat-sensitive moxibustion manipulation, which were "locating acupoint by feeling, moxibustion by differentiate sensation, dosage varies individually, ending after sufficient dosage". The incidence of deqi after first heat-sensitive moxibustion, the reduction of negative emotions, the improvement of chest distress and impaired appetite, and the active acceptance rate of moxibustion before and after treatment were observed. RESULTS ① The deqi rate of heat-sensitive moxibustion for 20 min、40 min、1 h were respectively 52.4% (22/42), 90.5% (38/42), 100.0% (42/42). ② The incidences of feeling relaxed and comfortable immediately after the first, second, and third heat-sensitive moxibustion were 61.9% (26/42), 73.8% (31/42), and 92.9% (39/42), which were higher than 42.9% (18/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion treatment (P<0.05). ③ The incidences of chest distress after the first, second, and third heat-sensitive moxibustion were 23.8% (10/42), 16.7% (7/42), and 9.5% (4/42), which were lower than 50.0% (21/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion treatment (P<0.05); the incidences of impaired appetite after the first, second, and third heat-sensitive moxibustion were 26.2% (11/42), 19.0% (8/42), 9.5% (4/42), which were lower than 57.1% (24/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion treatment (P<0.05). ④ After the first treatment, the active acceptance rate of patients for heat-sensitive moxibustion was 100.0% (42/42), which was higher than 11.9% (5/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion (P<0.05). CONCLUSION The heat-sensitive moxibustion can effectively reduce the negative emotions and improve the symptoms of chest distress and impaired appetite with COVID-19. It is generally accepted by patients, and worthy of popularization and application in clinical treatment.

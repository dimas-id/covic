One Albuquerque, NM, ED's staff were quarantined after exposure to a suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient, which underscores the importance of reducing risks of transmission. Reduce the number of contacts by isolating patients immediately. Triage nurses should have quick access to N-95 respirators. Ask security to screen all patients arriving by car before they enter the ED.

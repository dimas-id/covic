The present paper aims to study the effect of manufacturing build orientation on both flexural quasi-static and fatigue behaviours of semi-crystalline polyamide 6 obtained by Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), by considering the porosity and surface roughness. The glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and crystallinity degree were measured complementary to understand better the process. Fatigue analysis is here fully described in visco-elastic domain of material. The results highlight that the XZ build orientation is better than the XY one and suggest that porosity plays an important role. The obtained results are also compared with conventional techniques given by the literature review.

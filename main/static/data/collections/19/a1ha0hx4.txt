World Health Organization has suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through person-to-person transmission and contact with contaminated surfaces. However, rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggests other routes such as airborne transmission may be involved. A few research studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential transmission of this virus through air. Although some studies have found no evidence of airborne transmission, other more recent work is proving the presence of SARS-CoV-2 even in public places. Also, the past experiences and knowledge about the mechanisms of similar viruses such as SARS-CoV support this hypothesis. It seems that the best decision at the moment is to follow a conservative approach, and accept the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is able to be transmitted through air. By this, control measures could be employed to prevent further COVID-19 infection.

Abstract Antiviral therapy is one of the most exciting aspects of virology, since it has successfully employed basic science to generate very effective treatments for serious viral infections. Table 1 lists selected examples of those human viral diseases for which there are established antiviral drugs. Therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has demonstrated that the potential impact antivirals can have on a lethal, chronic infection with lifesaving therapy administered to more than 12million individuals by 2015. This dramatic advance is about to be recapitulated for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The development of new antiviral drugs is very much a work in progress, with active drug discovery programs for filoviruses, coronaviruses, dengue, and others.

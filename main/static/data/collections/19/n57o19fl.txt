The use of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is on the decline around the world despite the evidence base suggesting that it is a safe, effective and durable short-stay procedure which can be safely revised and is well tolerated by patients when they are appropriately supported.

This brief communication discusses what some of the drivers may be that are leading surgeons to abandon the band.

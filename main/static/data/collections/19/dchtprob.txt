INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS the aim of this study was to evaluate a link between mesh infection and shrinkage. METHODS twenty-eight Wistar rats were implanted with synthetic meshes that were either non-absorbable (polypropylene (PP), n = 14) or absorbable (poly (D: ,L: -lactic acid) (PLA94), n = 14). A validated animal incisionnal abdominal hernia model of mesh infection was used. Fourteen meshes (n = 7 PLA94 and n = 7 PP meshes) were infected intraoperatively with 10e6 CFU Escherichia coli, and compared with 14 non-infected meshes (n = 7 PLA94 and n = 7 PP meshes) (control groups). Explantations were performed on day 30. Shrinkage was evaluated by a reproducible numerical analysis of mesh area. Infection and histological study were evaluated on day 30. RESULTS non-infected meshes were less shrunk than infected meshes for both non-absorbable (5.0 ± 1.7% versus 21.6 ± 6.1%, p < 0.05) and absorbable meshes (2.4 ± 0.9% versus 11.0 ± 2.5%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION this study highlights a link between infection and shrinkage in the model used.

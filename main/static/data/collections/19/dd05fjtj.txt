The constant demand for new antibiotic drugs has driven efforts by the scientific community to prospect for peptides with a broad spectrum of action. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have acquired great scientific importance in recent years due to their ability to possess antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity. In the last two decades, plants have attracted the interest of the scientific community and industry as regards their potential as biofactories of heterologous proteins. One of the most promising approaches is the use of viral vectors to maximize the transient expression of drugs in the leaves of the plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Recently, the MagnifectionTM expression system was launched. This sophisticated commercial platform allows the assembly of the viral particle in leaf cells and the systemic spread of heterologous protein biosynthesis in green tissues caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens "gene delivery method". The system also presents increased gene expression levels mediated by potent viral expression machinery. These characteristics allow the mass recovery of heterologous proteins in the leaves of N. benthamiana in 8 to 10 days. This system was highly efficient for the synthesis of different classes of pharmacological proteins and contains enormous potential for the rapid and abundant biosynthesis of AMPs.

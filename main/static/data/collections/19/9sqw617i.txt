The intent of this work was to examine the intersection of COVID-19 fear with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences among adults living in the United States. Data are from a nationally representative sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults surveyed online during demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race and ethnicity, geography). The sample week of March 23, 2020. The sample was poststratification weighted to ensure a balanced representation across social and demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race or ethnicity, geography). The sample comprised 51% female; 23% non-White; 18% Hispanic; 25% of households with children under 18 years of age; 55% unmarried; and nearly 20% unemployed, laid off, or furloughed at the time of the interview. Respondents were fearful, averaging a score of nearly 7 on a scale of 10 when asked how fearful they were of COVID-19. Preliminary analysis suggests clear spatial diffusion of COVID-19 fear. Fear appears to be concentrated in regions with the highest reported COVID-19 cases. Significant differences across several U.S. census regions are noted (p < .01). Additionally, significant bivariate relationships were found between socially vulnerable respondents (female, Asians, Hispanic, foreign-born, families with children) and fear, as well as with mental health consequences (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms, on average, were high (16+ on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and more than 25% of the sample reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. More in-depth psychosocial research is needed using nationally representative samples that can help to inform potential mental health risks, as well as by targeting specific mental health interventions.

Informed consent process has become a challenging issue before surgery for any emergency obstetric care during this COVID pandemic. There is an increased risk of morbidity if there is a need of intensive care unit postoperatively and a risk of high mortality if patient has symptoms of COVID-19. Admission to intensive care unit adds on to the financial burden to the patient. Also, there is an increased risk of perinatal anxiety and depression during the COVID pandemic. When an asymptomatic carrier develops symptoms of COVID after delivery or caesarean section, the morbidity increases. So we have designed an informed consent form for patients undergoing emergency obstetric surgeries incorporating some points specific for COVID-19.

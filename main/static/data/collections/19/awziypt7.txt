The main goal of any risk management practice is to be able to insure an acceptable level of predictability in order to gain a lead-time to mitigate a possible risk. However, until new risk management approaches are employed to fill the gap between the known and unknown, most crises will continue to come as a surprise. Risk is latent until an external event or an internal process will reveal its existence. Predictive analysis is an indispensable tool that can help decision makers preemptively test all possible or even some perceived impossible operational scenarios before a risk transforms into crisis or disaster. To be prepared is a better position than to discover the risk too late for business continuity or disaster recovery measures. In this way, predictive emulation becomes necessary for appropriate risk mitigation.

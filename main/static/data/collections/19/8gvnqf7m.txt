Although “fever and rash” is a common complaint in the pediatric emergency department, most causes are benign. Of the more severe causes, several have been greatly reduced by vaccination programs. In addition, new vaccines such as those for invasive meningococcal disease hold promise for an even brighter future. Although meningococcemia remains an important concern when evaluating a child with fever and a rash, the resurgence of measles, the emergence of invasive group A streptococcal disease and antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the fear of agents of bioterrorism (anthrax, smallpox) have changed the landscape of fever and rash in the 21st century. The purpose of this article is not to offer a comprehensive differential of febrile exanthema, but rather to highlight some new concerns related to the evaluation of fever and rash in today's emergency department.

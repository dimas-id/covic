High-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) has become the method of choice for evaluation of esophageal motility disorders. There is a paucity of data with this technique from Hispanic countries. This study aims to characterize the diagnostic outcome of HREM in a large cohort of consecutive patients in Mexico.This study was conducted in Monterrey, Mexico from March 1, 2013 to March 31, 2015. Our diverse study population included patients from a major academic institution and the community. HREM was done applying the Chicago Classification 3. Diagnostic outcome was grouped as weak peristaltic disorders, gastroesophageal junction disorders, and hypertensive/uncoordinated peristalsis.We studied 670 consecutive patients, 57% were women, mean age was 43.8 years. The majority (465 [69%]) were referred for preoperative evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 365 (78%) of whom had a normal study. Overall, 193 (29%) patients had abnormal motility, the most common disorder being weak peristalsis (104 [54%]). In patients with dysphagia, the most frequent finding was achalasia (23/46 [50%]).To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the diagnostic outcome of HREM in a large cohort of Hispanic patients in Latin America. At our open access center, 69% of patients were referred for preoperative evaluation of GERD, reflecting the popularity of antireflux surgery. This study confirms the high prevalence of weak peristalsis and highlights the importance of addressing its pathophysiology and management. The finding of achalasia in 50% of our patients with dysphagia is consistent with recent reports regarding the rising incidence of this disorder and underscores the need of prompt motility testing in this population.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the location of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion on recanalization, complications and outcome after endovascular therapy. METHODS Four-hundred sixty-four patients with acute MCA occlusions were treated with endovascular therapy. RESULTS Two-hundred ninety-three patients had M1 occlusions, 116 had M2, and 55 had M3/4 occlusions. Partial or complete recanalization was more frequently achieved in M1 (76.8%) than in M2 (59.1%) or M3/4 (47.3%, p < 0.001) occlusions, but favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was less frequent in M1 (50.9%) than M2 (63.7%) or M3/4 (72.7%, p = 0.018) occlusions. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) did not differ between occlusion sites, but asymptomatic ICH was more common in M1 (22.6%) than in M2 occlusions (8.6%, p = 0.003). Recanalization was associated with favorable outcome in M1 (p < 0.001) and proximal M2 (p = 0.003) but not in distal M2 or M3/4 occlusions. CONCLUSIONS Recanalization with endovascular therapy was more frequently achieved in patients with proximal than distal MCA occlusions, but recanalization was associated with favorable outcome only in M1 and proximal M2 occlusions. Outcome was better with distal than proximal occlusions. This study shows that recanalization can be used as a surrogate marker for clinical outcome only in patients with proximal occlusions.

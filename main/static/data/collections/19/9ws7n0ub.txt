BACKGROUND Obesity and diabetes usually co-exist. Obesity surgery seems to offer solutions for both. The objective of this study was to show the effect of obesity surgery on the diabetic profile. METHODS Data on obesity surgery in Germany (2005-2011) were collected from the Institute of Quality Assurance at the research university. Follow-up of the diabetic profile at 1, 2, and up to 6 years after surgery was done. RESULTS Among 17,670 patients, 5,506 (31.2%) were diabetics. Follow-up was accomplished in 87.4%, 82.5%, and 68.9% of eligible patients at 1, 2, and up to 6 years, respectively, after surgery. Of the study participants, 38.2% were insulin-treated (IT) patients and 61.8% were noninsulin-treated patients (NIT). Of the patients' procedures, 2878 (52.3%) Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses (RYGB), 1711 (31.1%) sleeve gastrectomies (SG), 679 (12.3%) laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGB), 165 (3%) biliopancreatic diversions with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), and 68 (1.3%) biliopancreatic diversions (BPD) were performed. Female gender percentage and mean body mass index (BMI) were significantly higher in the RYGB and LAGB groups. Mean age was significantly higher in BPD/DS group. At 1 year, remission/improvement (RI) percentage was 83.5%, 82.5%, 67.8%, 93.4%, and 84.8% after RYGB, SG, LAGB, BPD, and BPD/DS, respectively. At 2 years, RI% was 84.9%, 79.5%, 67.7%, 94.5%, and 90.9% after RYGB, SG, LAGB, BPD, and BPD/DS, respectively. At late follow-up, RI% was 83.2%, 59.5%, 58.9%, 100%, and 86.4% after RYGB, SG, LAGB, BPD, and BPD/DS, respectively. IT patients showed insignificantly higher RI% than NIT patients at all follow-up points. Malabsorptive procedures (RYGB, BPD, and BPD/DS) showed a significantly higher RI% than restrictive procedures (LAGB and SG) at late follow-up. CONCLUSION Obesity surgery has promising antidiabetic efficacy, especially in IT patients. Malabsorptive procedures show higher, gradually descending, but durable antidiabetic efficacy.

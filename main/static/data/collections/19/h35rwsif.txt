What is ‘human’ is modulated by inhuman (inorganic) and nonhuman (organic) forces, which provides an understanding of the posthuman. This is the process of technogenesis. In this chapter, I draw on Deleuze and Guattari’s understanding of control societies to question Big Data, and how it impacts art|education, especially the field of design in ‘designer capitalism.’ The chapter ends by arguing that the hylomorphic tradition that has shaped design studies can be overcome through only certain forms of biomimicry that recognizes the ‘vibrancy’ of matter that utilize ‘technologies of Lassen.’ This is a twenty-first-century competency needed in the era of the Anthropocene, or euphemistically called climate change.

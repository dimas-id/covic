In a far‐reaching clarion call for attention to addiction in the midst of the COVID‐19 pandemic, Pete Nielsen, CEO of the California Consortium of Addiction Professionals and Programs (CCAPP), urges policymakers to recognize that the isolation required in shelter‐in‐place will fuel even more deaths from alcohol, drugs, and suicide. In The Disease of Addiction Thrives on Isolation, released this month, Nielsen warns that these deaths were already “on track to break records in the number of victims in our state this year,” and goes on to say that those “who survive this year will face a second wave of death due to tobacco related diseases and or relapse to drug of choice unless tobacco is routinely treated in substance use disorder.”

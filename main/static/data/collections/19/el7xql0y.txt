Summary From 35 patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and belonging to various risk groups, 60 stool specimens were examined for the presence of Coronavirus-like particles (CVLP) using electron microscopy. CVLP were detected in 5 (8%) stool samples from 5 different patients (14%). Only one of the patients had diarrhoea. The five patients with CVLP-positive stools were all at advanced stages of HIV infection. The remarkable discrepancy between our data and another study, reporting a rate of 50% CVLP-positive HIV patients, most of them persistently shedding the virus, is discussed.

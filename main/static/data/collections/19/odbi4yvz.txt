UV (ultraviolet) light is an important factor should be considered to predict coronavirus epidemic growth pace. UV is different from weather temperature since UV is electromagnetic wavelength from 10 nm to 400 nm in size, shorter than of visible lights. For some people, UV light can lead to cancer from unprotected sun exposure, however, for tropical people, which have been used to live in such condition, have resisted from negative effect high UV index. Moreover, UV has the capability to inactivate virus. This conclusion has been discussed deeply with biological experts. Although UV light has the ability to inactivate viruses, it may be meaningless in areas with high air pollution where UV light turns into heat.

Acute pulmonary embolism is an uncharacteristic presentation in patients with COVID-19. Here we describe the case of a young woman presenting with severe pulmonary embolism, without any associated symptoms of infections. A clot in a patent foramen ovale was noted. Despite emergency surgical embolectomy, her clinical conditions continued to deteriorate. She was put on extracorporeal life support and tested positive for COVID-19. She died of multiorgan failure on day 10. COVID-19 may have a thrombogenic effect and it may need to be considered in cases of pulmonary embolism and in absence of any obvious risk factor.

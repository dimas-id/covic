We have read with great attention the article by Van Damme et al. considering urticarial lesions as a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) associated skin manifestation(1). They observed two patients with erythemato‐edematous lesions surrounded by whitish halo, thus similar to hives but without additional data on their evolution(1). A previous report of COVID19‐related urticarial lesions had also been first published by Recalcati(2). However, none of these two published articles detailed if the lesions where evanescent, as it is mandatory for urticaria, nor did a pathological study.

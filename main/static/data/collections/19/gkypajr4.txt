We present here a case of severe digital necrosis in a patient with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The concomitant presence of two autoimmune conditions such as cryoglobulinemia and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were diagnosed. To best of our knowledge, this is the first case of the coexistence of RA, cryoglobulinemia, and APS in a single patient. An aggressive treatment was needed including hallux amputation, methylprednisolone pulses followed by rituximab with favorable outcome.

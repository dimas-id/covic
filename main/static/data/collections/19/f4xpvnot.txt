Traditional phylogenetic analysis is based on multiple sequence alignment. With the development of worldwide genome sequencing project, more and more completely sequenced genomes become available. However, traditional sequence alignment tools are impossible to deal with large-scale genome sequence. So, the development of new algorithms to infer phylogenetic relationship without alignment from whole genome information represents a new direction of phylogenetic study in the post-genome era. In the present study, a novel algorithm based on BBC (base-base correlation) is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of HEV (Hepatitis E virus). When 48 HEV genome sequences are analyzed, the phylogenetic tree that is constructed based on BBC algorithm is well consistent with that of previous study. When compared with methods of sequence alignment, the merit of BBC algorithm appears to be more rapid in calculating evolutionary distances of whole genome sequence and not requires any human intervention, such as gene identification, parameter selection. BBC algorithm can serve as an alternative to rapidly construct phylogenetic trees and infer evolutionary relationships.

AIM: Infants hospitalised for bronchiolitis undergo examinations and treatments not supported by current research evidence and we investigated practice variations with regard to Finnish children under the age of two. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted in paediatric units in three university hospitals in Finland from 2008 to 2010. Hospital medical records were reviewed to collect data on clinical course, testing and treatment. Data were analysed separately for children meeting our strict definition of bronchiolitis, aged under 12 months without a history of wheezing, and a loose definition, aged 12–23 months or with a history of wheezing. RESULTS: The median age of the 408 children was 8.1 months. Clinical management varied between the three hospitals when stratified by strict and loose bronchiolitis subgroup definitions: complete blood counts ranged from 15–95% vs 16–94%, respectively, and the other measures were chest x‐ray (16–91% vs 14–72%), intravenous fluids (2–47% vs 2–41%), use of nebulised epinephrine (10–84% vs 7–50%), use of salbutamol (18–21% vs 13–84%) and use of corticosteroids (6–23% vs 60–76%). CONCLUSION: The clinical management of bronchiolitis varied considerably with regard to the three hospitals and the two definitions of bronchiolitis. A stronger commitment to evidence‐based bronchiolitis guidelines is needed in Finland.

BACKGROUND The aim of this series is to determine the clinical utility of routine ultrasound (US) of the contralateral, clinically normal groin when a unilateral inguinal hernia is referred for hernia repair-specifically assessing the morbidity and short-term change in quality-of-life (QoL) due to repair of this occult contralateral hernia when also repairing the symptomatic side. TEP inguinal hernia repair affords the opportunity to repair any groin hernia through the same small incisions. US detects 96.6% of groin hernias with 84.4% specificity. METHODS 234 consecutive male patients with clinically unilateral and clinically bilateral hernia were enrolled; those with a clinically unilateral hernia were sent for groin US and if positive, a bilateral TEP groin hernia repair was performed (USBH). If negative, a unilateral TEP groin hernia repair was performed (UNIH). Carolina's comfort scales (CCS) and visual analogue scores (VAS) were recorded at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively, while a modified CCS (MCCS) was recorded for all patients preoperatively. RESULTS Bilateral TEP repair resulted in higher VAS scores than unilateral repair at 2 weeks but not 6 weeks. CCS were worse in the USBH group than UNIH group at 2 weeks but were similar by 6 weeks. Complications' rates were similar amongst all 3 groups. Factors contributing to worse scores were: smaller hernia, complications, worse preoperative MCCS results, recurrent hernia and bilateral rather than unilateral repair. CONCLUSION Bilateral TEP for the clinically unilateral groin hernia with an occult contralateral groin hernia can be performed without increased morbidity, accepting a minor and very temporary impairment of QoL.

Human-to-human SARS-COV2 transmission has been established with more than 3300 clinicians reported to be infected in China and more than 1116 clinicians infected in Italy where 13 882 cases were confirmed by 13 March 2020. Room surfaces in the vicinity of COVID-19 symptomatic patients and clinician's protection equipment were found to be contaminated [1]. The primary strategy for COVID-19 patients is supportive care, including oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients, in which high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was reported as effective in improving oxygenation. Among patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNC was proven to avoid intubation compared to conventional oxygen device [2, 3].

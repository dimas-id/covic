BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has radically shifted healthcare operations within hospitals and universities across the globe. However, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on research endeavors and clinical trials is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on basic science and clinical research within the rhinology community. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed utilizing an 8-question survey to identify changes to rhinology research. Questions evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on administrative research support and staffing, basic science research, clinical trials and resident research involvement. RESULTS: Seventy-one participants responded to the survey (8.5% response rate). Most respondents noted changes in IACUC/IRB approval (faster, 33%; slower, 31%). Of those who employed laboratory personnel, 64% were able to continue staff employment with full salary. The majority of animal research and in vitro studies were halted (64% and 56%, respectively), but animal care and cell line maintenance were allowed to continue. Clinical trial enrollment was most commonly limited to COVID derived studies (51%). Forty-seven percent of respondents noted increased resident research participation. CONCLUSION: The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has markedly impacted rhinology-related research. Maintaining safe workplace practices as restrictions are lifted will hopefully mitigate the spread of the virus and allow research productivity to resume.

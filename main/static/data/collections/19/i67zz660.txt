As poultry becomes more important in the world economy, it is increasingly important to fully understand the mechanisms of disease and poor production that affect the industry. To more accurately and reasonably treat these diseases, a more sophisticated understanding of interrelatedness is required. This review focuses on avian astroviruses (AAstVs), in particular the recent advances in our understanding of AAstV molecular biology, and also history, diagnosis, treatment and control. The known AastVs comprise duck astrovirus 1, turkey astrovirus 1 and 2, and avian nephritis virus of chickens. Nucleotide and amino acid identities between the avian and mammalian (human, ovine, bovine) astroviruses is very low (e.g. 20 to 25% and 12 to 15%, respectively) in open reading frame (ORF) 1a. There is also variation among the avian astroviruses, including between the two known types of turkey astrovirus. The ORF 1b sequence contains a number of conserved amino acid motifs; these could be the basis of degnerate oligonucleotide primers. A nomenclature for astroviruses is also proposed, based on: host species-astrovirus-type number/country(state)/reference number/year of isolation. For example, turkey astrovirus 2/North Carolina/034/1999.

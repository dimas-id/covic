BACKGROUND: Lessons from previous pandemics emphasise the importance of consistent information and advice for healthcare workers (HCWs), particularly in relation to their use of personal protective equipment (PPE). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to review the consistency of advice regarding HCW use of PPE among Australian states and territories and 10 key Australian professional and advocacy organisations, against the Australian Government's national guidelines. DISCUSSION: While some recommendations expand on the national guidelines, the Australian Government's efforts to work in concert with states, territories and peak professional and advocacy organisations are evident in the broadly consistent recommendations for the use of PPE by HCWs and other people working in healthcare settings across the country. The overall consistency of recommendations for the use of PPE shows a nationwide attempt to support and protect the healthcare workforce and the Australian community during the COVID-19 pandemic.

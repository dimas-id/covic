BACKGROUND Abdominoplasty is one of the most common procedures in plastic surgery, and energy-based tissue dissection techniques have become the gold standard. Despite its frequency, abdominoplasty is still associated with high complication rates. OBJECTIVES The authors compared clinical and economic data of 4 methods of energy-based tissue dissection in a randomized, open-label study. METHODS A total of 57 patients were preoperatively randomized into 4 groups: electrocautery, Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel, argon plasma coagulation, and PEAK-Plasmablade. Demographic and operational data as well as information on the postoperative course and complications were collected. For economic analysis, quotes were obtained from the device companies or official suppliers. RESULTS Duration of surgery, drainage quantity, and wound healing complications did not differ significantly between groups. The Ultracision method caused significantly greater blood loss compared with all other techniques (P < 0.01). PEAK and Ultracision devices entailed greater surgical costs compared with APC and electrocautery. CONCLUSIONS All methods evaluated can be applied safely and effectively in abdominoplasty procedures. However, these data demonstrate a significantly higher blood loss for the Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel. Considering the clinical data, the higher costs of PEAK and Ultracision methods appear unjustified. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2

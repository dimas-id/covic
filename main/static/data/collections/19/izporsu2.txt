The chapter begins with a general overview of how GIS has evolved in the health and human services over the last several decades providing readers with important definitions and descriptions (Sects. 29.1, 29.2). Sections 29.3, 29.4 uncovers how GIS became an important tool for epidemiologists in the work of tracking infectious diseases and perfecting the study of population health.

The importance of the legendary work of the Dartmouth Health Care Atlas Project and its founder Jack Wennberg. In areas where high GIS adoption rates occurred, such as in public health, we feature key applications such as immunization management, disease tracking, outbreak analysis, disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, emergency preparedness and response, community health assessment, environmental health, chronic disease prevention, and animal and veterinary health. The final Sect. 29.5 describes how GIS education has expanded across the academic fields of public health, healthcare administration, and social services. It is pointed out that the material presented in this chapter is not intended to be an exhaustive examination of the history of GIS, but rather, a brief introduction and overview which will generate further interest and self-discovery.

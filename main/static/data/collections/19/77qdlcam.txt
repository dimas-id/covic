PURPOSE The aim of this study was to validate our laparoscopic management strategy for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with prenatally diagnosed choledochal cysts (CCs). METHODS Thirteen prenatally diagnosed CC patients from 1997 to 2015 were included. Seven patients (1997-2008) underwent open surgery (OS group), and 6 (2009-2015) underwent laparoscopic surgery (LS group). In the asymptomatic patients, LS was performed when the patients weighed over 5 kg. When the patient had clinical manifestations, early LS was performed irrespective of body weight. A retrospective comparison was conducted between the LS and OS groups in terms of the operative time, blood loss, postoperative fasting period, hospital stay, and intra- and postoperative complications. RESULTS There was no difference between the demographics of both groups. The operative time was significantly longer (380 vs. 288 min) and blood loss was significantly lower (4 vs. 30 mL) in the LS group. Additionally, the postoperative fasting period (3 vs. 6 days) and hospital stay (11 vs. 20 days) were significantly shorter in the LS group. Intraoperative events and early postoperative complications were not encountered in either group. Small bowel obstruction requiring surgery occurred in two patients, 10 and 13 years after OS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LS is as safe and feasible as OS in small children with prenatally diagnosed CC, although sufficient pediatric laparoscopic expertise is mandatory.

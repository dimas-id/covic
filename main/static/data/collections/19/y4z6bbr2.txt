I am most grateful to Dr Stein for his thoughtful and considered response to my recent letter(1) . However, completely as he predicted, his answers only raised more questions. I was struck by the analysis of the known mortality data from COVID-19. It is interesting that for a respiratory pathogen, risk of mortality seems to be lower for those with underlying respiratory disease than with pre-existing cardiac pathology.

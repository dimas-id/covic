Complete dislocation at the thoracolumbar junction is a rare occurrence, with only 4 previously reported cases in 3 separate series. Surgical procedures in the reported cases of spondyloptosis at the thoracolumbar junction have been described using instrumentation, reduction, decompression, and stabilization techniques. In this report the authors' patient presented with spondyloptosis at the thoracolumbar junction, resulting in a T-11 American Spinal Injury Association Grade A injury. The authors corrected the patient's thoracolumbar spondyloptosis with surgical reconstruction without the use of leveraged instrumented reduction. They describe a single-stage, posterior-only spinal realignment, reconstruction, and stabilization. Within months of beginning postoperative therapy, the patient enrolled and attended courses at a local college and regained personal independence by learning to drive a motor vehicle with a hand control. Two-year radiographic and clinical follow-up confirms solid fusion across the reconstruction.

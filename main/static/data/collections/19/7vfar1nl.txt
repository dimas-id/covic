INTRODUCTION Staples and subcuticular suture are commonly used wound closure techniques after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). To date, only a few studies have investigated the differences between these two wound closure methods in TKA. Accordingly, this study aimed to compare cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction between staples and subcuticular suture for post-TKA wound closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients scheduled to undergo TKA at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during June 2018-March 2019. Patients were randomized into the staples or subcuticular suture groups. Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale (HWES), cosmetic-visual analogue scale (VAS), and patient satisfaction-VAS were evaluated at the 6-week and 3-month follow-ups. Functional outcome by the modified Knee Society Knee Scoring System and wound complications were also assessed. RESULTS Sixty-two patients (31 per group) were included. There were no significant differences in the HWES, cosmetic-VAS, patient satisfaction-VAS, or wound complication rate between groups at the 6-week or 3-month follow-ups. Wound closure time was significantly shorter in the staples group (p < 0.001), but the total operative time was not significantly different between groups. Modified knee score was significantly better in the suture group at 6 weeks (p = 0.024), but there was no significant difference between groups at 3 months. Significant association was observed between patient satisfaction-VAS and cosmetic-VAS at the 6-week (p = 0.03) and 3-month (p = 0.021) follow-ups. CONCLUSION Subcuticular suture and staples were found to be comparable wound-closure options after TKA relative to cosmetic outcome, patient satisfaction, functional outcome, and wound complication rate at 3-months post-operation.

A large part of the world is presently in the grip of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus), declared a pandemic in March 2020. This document is a brief commentary of the imaging modalities used in the screening, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia. Chest x-rays, especially portable, still form a part of majority of official guidelines, with reports of the suggestive radiologic features. The potential of CT scan and ultrasound is also realised, with earlier detection rate. Typical radiologic findings of bilateral, asymmetrical, crazy-paved ground glass opacification, consolidation, reverse halo sign, opacities, progressing to fibrosis are well described for both the X-ray and CT scan. Atypical findings include airway changes, pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules and acute pulmonary embolism. Absence of lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion and pneumothorax is notable. The role of portable lung ultrasound, reported to be useful in emergency, is yet to be established in the guidelines. Disinfection of the equipment is a major concern. Governmental guidelines still advocate X-ray despite professional societies increasingly recommending CT scan.

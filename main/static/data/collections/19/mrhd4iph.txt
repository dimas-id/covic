The COVID-19 global pandemic is in many ways unchartered mental health territory, but history would suggest that long-term resilience will be the most common outcome, even for those most directly impacted by the outbreak.

Actively cultivating social support, adaptive meaning, and direct prosocial behaviors to reach the most vulnerable can have powerful resilience promoting effects.

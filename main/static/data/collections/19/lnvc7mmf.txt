Abstract Outbreaks of infection transmission due to contaminated flexible endoscopes have focused the attention of health care personnel, senior management, device manufacturers, and regulators on the need to improve the approach used to offer this valuable service. This chapter presents the principles of flexible endoscope reprocessing along with a pragmatic approach to the judicious selection and proper reprocessing of endoscopic equipment, as well as guidance for prevention and management of infection transmission inclusive of newer sterilization (e.g., hydrogen peroxide vapor) and disinfection (e.g., improved hydrogen peroxide) technologies. It also provides an outline of the Quality Systems approach that is applicable to flexible endoscope reprocessing and the need for ongoing staff competency and audits of endoscope cleaning, disinfection, and storage practices. Furthermore, the most current regulatory, expert organization, and manufacturer's recommendations are reviewed.

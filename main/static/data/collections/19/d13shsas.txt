Subclinical immunosuppression in chickens is an important but often underestimated factor in the subsequent development of clinical disease. Immunosuppression can be caused by pathogens such as chicken infectious anemia virus, infectious bursal disease virus, reovirus, and some retroviruses (e.g., reticuloendotheliosis virus). Mycotoxins and stress, often caused by poor management practices, can also cause immunosuppression. The effects on the innate and acquired immune responses and the mechanisms by which mycotoxins, stress and infectious agents cause immunosuppression are discussed. Immunoevasion is a common ploy by which viruses neutralize or evade immune responses. DNA viruses such as herpesvirus and poxvirus have multiple genes, some of them host-derived, which interfere with effective innate or acquired immune responses. RNA viruses may escape acquired humoral and cellular immune responses by mutations in protective antigenic epitopes (e.g., avian influenza viruses), while accessory non-structural proteins or multi-functional structural proteins interfere with the interferon system (e.g., Newcastle disease virus).

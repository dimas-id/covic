Respiratory diseases like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) have been held accountable for major losses for poultry production. Nevertheless, scarce information was present dealing with the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of these infections in Greece and the efficacy of currently applied control strategies. To fill this gap, a specific epidemiological study was designed. A total of 106 broiler and layer farms, including 10 backyard and 96 commercial flocks, were sampled between March 2016 and May 2017, and the obtained tracheal swabs were tested for IBV and aMPV using RT-PCR based techniques followed by sequencing. For each farm, data regarding production type, flock features, clinical signs, and vaccination program were also recorded. Different associations between vaccination protocol, production type, animal category, birds density, age, presence of clinical signs, and IBV and/or aMPV infection were tested. Both IBV and aMPV field strain prevalence were proven high, approximately 20 and 30%, respectively, being the GI-19 lineage (14 out of 19; 73.6%) and B subtype (30 out of 30; 100%), the most commonly detected IBV and aMPV genetic types. Infection with IBV field strains was significantly associated with clinical sign presence (odds ratio = 8.55 [95CI = 2.17–42.90]). Remarkably, only the vaccination protocol involving a double vaccination at 1 D of age was proven protective against IBV-induced symptomatology, with the odds of developing disease being 4.14 [95CI = 1.34–14.51] times lower. No association was demonstrated between aMPV infection and clinical outbreaks or between aMPV and IBV detection, suggesting the marginal role of the former pathogen in poultry farming. Globally, the present study provides the first detailed investigation of the epidemiological scenario of 2 viruses traditionally considered of pivotal relevance in poultry farming and demonstrates that remarkable benefits could be obtained with just minor adjustments in vaccination protocols.

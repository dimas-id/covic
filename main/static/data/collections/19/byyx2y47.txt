Abstract This chapter provides the reader with an understanding and appreciation for the scope and importance of biological threats and the opportunity to see where they may be and have become the desire of terrorist groups and the makings of weapons of mass destruction. The history of biological warfare is covered in depth. These major events are important in helping us understand the issues related to using biological substances against an adversary. The difference between biosecurity and biodefense are explained and then related to homeland security and homeland defense, respectively. This chapter also details how expensive these programs are, with nearly $80billion having been spent on civilian biodefense since fiscal year 2001 in the United States alone. As discussed herein, there is a significant difference in the reality and the potential of bioterrorism. Bioterrorism on a large scale is a low-probability event. Bioterrorism on a small scale is a fairly routine occurrence with little potential. Biological threats remain very much in the news. Recent examples, such as laboratory incidents, the Ebola outbreak of 2014, and other emerging threats, are covered in this chapter.

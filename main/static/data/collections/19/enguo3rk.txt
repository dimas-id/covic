The many needs that arise during and immediately following a disaster normally stretch local and national governments and humanitarian organisations to the limit. Both human and financial resources are often inadequate to meet the requirements of medical care, clean water, sufficient food and shelter for victims of the disaster. How, then, can one justify conducting research during or shortly after disaster strikes? People caught in the wake of a disaster are rendered vulnerable by a variety of factors, including injuries, fear, grief, inadequate food and water, loss of housing, and disease outbreaks that sometimes accompany disasters. In addition, an entire population or segments of the population may have been vulnerable to some extent before the disaster struck: they may have food insecurity, lack of potable water, inadequate health care, or be at risk from endemic diseases. Therefore, many people are rendered doubly or even triply vulnerable in the wake of a disaster. The ethical question that arises is whether the vulnerability of victims of a disaster militates against conducting research during or soon after the event.

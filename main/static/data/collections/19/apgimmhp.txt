A sign‚Äêon letter spearheaded by the National Alliance for Medication Assisted Recovery (NAMA), and harm reduction groups, including the Urban Survivors Union (USU) and the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) is calling for reducing restrictions on methadone and opioid treatment programs (OTPs), so that patients don't have to go to the clinics so often. Included in the over 100 signatories are Patty McCarthy Metcalf of Faces & Voices of Recovery, Ben Levenson of the Levenson Foundation (and former founder of Origins) and many addiction physicians, as well as drug user organizations. Many of the signers have said for months that OTPs should be eliminated entirely.

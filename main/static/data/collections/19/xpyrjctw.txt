Human bocavirus is frequently detected in immunocompetent as well as in immunocompromised children. However, the course of infection in immunocompromised children is still poorly investigated. In the present study, we describe 4 cases of repeat human bocavirus detection in the presence of severe immunodeficiency. In the view of homologous viral sequences identified in serial samples, possible persistence and reactivation in these patients are discussed.

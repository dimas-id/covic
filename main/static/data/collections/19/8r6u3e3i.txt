We sequenced four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from Malaysia during the second wave of infection and found unique mutations which suggest local evolution. Circulating Malaysian strains represent introductions from different countries, particularly during the first wave of infection. Genome sequencing is important for understanding local epidemiology.

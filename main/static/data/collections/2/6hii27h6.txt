BACKGROUND Occurrence of abdominal wall hernias during and before peritoneal dialysis constitutes a pivotal role in treatment discontinuation, failure, and exclusion from this dialysis method. We herein present a single-center experience regarding a one-stage surgical strategy, including hernia repair and simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Over a 4-year period, 123 patients underwent peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation and 23 patients (19%) had concomitant abdominal wall hernias and were enrolled in this monocentric prospective study. Data collection included recurrent and new-onset hernias, surgical site infection, 1-year and 2-year catheter survival. RESULTS In 23 patients, 27 hernia repairs combined with peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation were performed. Median age was 52 years (range, 30-85 years) and 18/23 (78%) patients were male. There were no recurrent hernias and no early surgical site infections. Daily flushing was regularly started on the 1st to 3rd postoperative day. Five patients (22%) developed hernias on other anatomical sites, which required hernia repair and perioperative discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis. After a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 28-87 months), 96% of all implanted catheters were still working. CONCLUSION Hernia repair and simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation are associated with no recurrent hernias, an early start of peritoneal dialysis, a very low postoperative morbidity and very high 1-year and 2-year catheter survival.

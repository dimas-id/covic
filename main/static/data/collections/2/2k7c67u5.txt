The inflammatory cell composition and the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens in the central nervous system (CNS) of 13 cats with a spontaneous, Borna disease-like meningoencephalomyelitis (staggering disease) was investigated by immunohistochemistry with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. T lymphocytes were the predominating inflammatory cells within the adventitial space. CD4(+) T cells were more abundant than CD8(+) T cells. Scattered IgG-, IgA- and IgM-containing cells were found in the adventitial space and surrounding neuropil, often adjacent to neurons. There was a markedly increased MHC class II expression in cells morphologically resembling microglia. In several cats, Borna disease virus specific antigen was detected, but only in a few cells, mainly of macrophage character. Our findings indicate a long-standing inflammatory reaction in the CNS of cats with staggering disease, possibly triggered and sustained by a persistent viral infection.

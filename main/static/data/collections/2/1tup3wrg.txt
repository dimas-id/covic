The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a tremendous health burden and impact on the world economy. As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood. Here we applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. We found that the basic reproduction number (R0) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the net reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands). This study enhances our understanding of the current outbreak and effectiveness of control measures in the UK.

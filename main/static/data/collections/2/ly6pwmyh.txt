BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has gained an interest and popularity in the recent years. Although minimally invasive adrenal surgery replaced the open adrenalectomy, SILS adrenalectomy is a step forward technique that improves the cosmesis, decreases acsess related morbidity, and increases the postoperative recovery. We report our first experience with single-incision transperitoneal left adrenalectomy in a patient with Conns' syndrome. CASE A 46-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Conns' syndrome underwent single-incision transperitoneal laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) was used through a 2-cm incision and additional one 5-mm trocar used through one of the holes of SILS port to solve the smoke problem. The operative time was ended in 50 minutes, and no peroperative complication was encountered. The patient was discharged at the second postoperative day. CONCLUSION SILS adrenalectomy is a safe procedure for a benign adrenal lesion in experienced hands. Further studies are needed to evaluate the special benefits of this technique.

In the recent years, the epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has changed worldwide. This is remarkably noticed with the significant increase in high-risk populations. Although surveillance of such infections is essential, data in the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) region remain scarce. In this paper, we reviewed the existing data on the epidemiology of different IFIs in the MENA region. Epidemiological surveillance is crucial to guide optimal healthcare practices. This study can help to guide appropriate interventions and to implement antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention and control programs in countries.

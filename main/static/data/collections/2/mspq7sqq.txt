A total of 1929 Ixodes uriae collected from RÃ¸st Islands, Lofoten, Norway, in July 1974, was divided into 204 pools and inoculated into suckling mice and chick embryo cell cultures for virus isolation. Virus was detected in 6.6% of the laboratory-molted female ticks, 5.4% of the males and 1.8% of the nymphs. No isolates were obtained from 149 unengorged adult ticks. Of 50 viral strains recovered, 30 belonged to the Uukuniemi group, 13 to the Kemerovo group, and I was a strain of Tyuleniy of Group B. Of 6 untyped strains, I was orbiviruslike and I resembled a coronavirus in a negative-staining electron microscopy. The infection rates of I. uria in Lofoten were similar to those reported in the Murmansk area in the northern USSR.

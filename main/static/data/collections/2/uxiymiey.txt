BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with COVID-19 require intensive respiratory care and tracheostomy. Several guidelines on tracheostomy procedures and care of tracheostomized patients have been introduced. In addition to these guidelines, further details of the procedure and perioperative care would be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience and tracheostomy protocol for patients with MERS or COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with MERS were admitted to the ICU, 9 (69.2%) of whom underwent surgical tracheostomy. During the COVID-19 outbreak, surgical tracheostomy was performed in one of seven patients with COVID-19. We reviewed related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers who had participated in designing a tracheostomy protocol. RESULTS: Compared with previous guidelines, our protocol consisted of enhanced PPE, simplified procedures (no limitation in the use of electrocautery and wound suction, no stay suture, and delayed cannula change) and a validated screening strategy for healthcare workers. Our protocol allowed for all associated healthcare workers to continue their routine clinical work and daily life. It guaranteed safe return to general patient care without any related complications or nosocomial transmission during the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Our protocol and experience with tracheostomies for MERS and COVID-19 may be helpful to other healthcare workers in building an institutional protocol optimized for their own COVID-19 situation.

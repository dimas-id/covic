BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently the leading bariatric procedure and targets, among other obesity classes, patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m2, which are reaching alarming proportions. METHODS Between February 2010 and August 2015, data on 541 consecutive patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m2 undergoing LSG were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Mean age was 32 ± 8 years (13-65) and 419 (77.4 %) were women. Preoperative weight was 92.0 ± 8.8 kg (65-121) and BMI was 32.6 ± 1.5 kg/m2 (30-35). Comorbidities were detected in 210 (39 %) patients. Operative time was 74 ± 12 min (40-110) and postoperative stay was 1.7 ± 0.22 days (1-3). There were no deaths, leaks, abscesses or strictures and the rate of hemorrhage was 1.2 %. At 1 year, 98 % were followed and BMI decreased to 24.7 ± 1.6, the percentage of total weight loss (% TWL) was 24.1 ± 4.7 while the percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) reached 106.1 ± 24.1. At 5 years, 76 % of followed patients achieved a ≥50 % EBMIL. CONCLUSION With appropriate surgical expertise, LSG in patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m2 achieved excellent outcomes with a zero fistula rate.

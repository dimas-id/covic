The pandemic influenza A 2009 virus led to new discussions about proper protection measures in hospitals and in the general population. To implement efficacious protection measures against the influenza A virus, we have to know its way of transmission. Influenza A transmission occurs primarily via droplets and contact. However, several experimental studies and observations of outbreaks indicate that influenza can also be transmitted through the airborne route (via aerosols). The possibility of airborne transmission of influenza should be taken in consideration for pandemic influenza planning and recommendations. In case of influenza epidemics with high (or not yet defined) mortality, exposed healthcare personnel should be protected using precautions against airborne transmission, including the use of FFP2 (N95) respirators.

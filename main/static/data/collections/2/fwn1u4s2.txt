INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) is a challenging procedure that requires quick and effective intracorporeal suturing, that could limit widespread adoption. Refinements of surgery have improved warm ischemia times and facilitated renal reconstruction. We present a technique that makes renorrhaphy easier using Self-Retaining Barbed Suture (SRBS) weaving two threads. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two patients with carcinoma of the kidney, 3.4 and 1.5 cm respectively, were subjected to the LPN. The SRBS is an absorbable polygluconate with small projections along its axis which are anchored in the tissue, distributing the tension of the suture line and eliminating the need for knots. Renorrhaphy was performed using the SRBS by two continuous suture lines without knots, setting the sutures with clips of Hem-o-lok(®) and adjusting it with the technique of «sliding clip», without placing «bolsters» inside the renal parenchymal defect. RESULTS Operative time was 156 minutes and 163 minutes, intraoperative bleeding was 50 ml and 850 ml, the warm ischemia time was 14.3 minutes and 23 minutes and follow-up time was 7 months and 3 months in the first and second cases respectively. The hospital stay was 5 days and there were no postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Simplified renorrhaphy using SRBS is effective, hemostatic, facilitates the renal reconstruction, and can help reduce the warn ischemia time.

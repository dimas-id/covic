INTRODUCTION We describe a patient with a large cystic adenomyosis of the uterus who was treated by a laparoscopic approach. CASE PRESENTATION A 38-year-old woman presented with dysmenorrhoea for 4 months. A 104 mm × 55 mm × 60 mm cystic mass was detected on the right side of the posterior wall of the uterus by ultrasound. Laparoscopy was performed, during which a bumpy mass was discovered protruding from the surface of the uterine myometrium. Both ovaries were normal. When the wall of the cystic mass was opened, chocolate-colored fluid was visible. The cyst was completely removed, and postoperative histopathology confirmed a cystic adenomyosis. One month later, the uterus was found to be normal on ultrasound. DISCUSSION Endometriosis is a common disease in women and is divided into ovarian endometrioid cysts, superficial endometriosis, deep infiltrating endometriosis and other special types according to pathological characteristics. As a special type of endometriosis, the incidence of cystic adenomyosis is low, and its specific incidence is unknown. Cystic adenomyosis is clinically characterized by the appearance of one or more cystic cavities between the walls of the uterine muscles. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery is an effective method for the diagnosis and treatment of large cystic masses in the uterine myometrium.

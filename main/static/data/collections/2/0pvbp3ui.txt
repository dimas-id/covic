The authors in this article explore the experiences of eight South Korean nurses during an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which took place in the fall of 2015. These nurses were mandated to remain in isolation in an intensive care unit (ICU) dedicated to the treatment of the patients with the MERS virus for 7 days. Parse's humanbecoming theory was used to frame the discussion. Three themes found in the nurse's stories are discussed: feeling hopeless and cut off, feeling shame and overworked, and feeling pride in fulfilling a duty. The nurses discuss how they overcame the difficulties of their situation, which ultimately reinforced their identities as nurses.

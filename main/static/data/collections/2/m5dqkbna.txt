The biceps pulley or "sling" is a capsuloligamentous complex that acts to stabilize the long head of the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove. The pulley complex is composed of the superior glenohumeral ligament, the coracohumeral ligament, and the distal attachment of the subscapularis tendon, and is located within the rotator interval between the anterior edge of the supraspinatus tendon and the superior edge of the subscapularis tendon. Because of its superior depiction of the capsular components, direct magnetic resonance arthrography is the imaging modality of choice for demonstrating both the normal anatomy and associated lesions of the biceps pulley. Oblique sagittal images and axial images obtained with a high image matrix are valuable for identifying individual components of the pulley system. Various pathologic processes occur in the biceps pulley as well as the rotator interval. These processes can be traumatic, degenerative, congenital, or secondary to injuries to the surrounding structures. The term hidden lesion refers to an injury of the biceps pulley mechanism and is derived from the difficulty in making clinical and arthroscopic identification. Pathologic conditions associated with pulley lesions include anterosuperior impingement, instability of the biceps tendon, biceps tendinopathy or tendinosis, superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions, and adhesive capsulitis. It is important to be familiar with the normal appearance of the biceps pulley so that abnormalities can be correctly assessed and effectively managed.

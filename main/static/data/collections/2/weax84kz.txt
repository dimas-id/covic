BACKGROUND The components separation technique (CST) is frequently used for reconstructing large ventral hernias. Unfortunately, it is associated with a high wound complication rate up to 50 %, caused by large wound surface and inherent trauma to abdominal skin vascularization. An endoscopically assisted modification of the original technique (ECST) spares skin vascularization and reduces wound surface, supposedly reducing wound complications. This study accurately describes ECST step by step with detailed illustrations and report the results of a 27 patient cohort. METHODS Since September 2012 patients with midline hernias without previous subcutaneous dissection and a maximum diameter of approximately 10-15 cm underwent ECST in an expert centre for abdominal wall reconstructions. Prospective data was gathered during inpatient care and 3-6 monthly follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients (17 male/10 female) with median age of 60 years (range 35-77), average BMI 27 (SD ±2) kg/m(2) and median ASA classification 2 (range 1-3) underwent ECST. Two patients were excluded due to bilateral conversion to conventional CST and finding of peritoneal metastases. Median defect size was 116 ± 48 cm(2). Median length of stay was 5 days (range 3-15). Wound complication rate was 11 %. Recurrence rate was 29 % after a median follow-up of 13 months. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopically assisted modification of the original technique can be used for reconstructing large and complex ventral hernias up to 15 cm in diameter. The results of this small sized cohort study showed that ECST is feasible in patients with a uro-, or enterostomy and suggest that ECST reduces wound complication rate when compared to CST.

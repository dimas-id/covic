Background Flow-diverter stents have been successfully used in the treatment of complex aneurysms with limited therapeutic alternatives. We report our experience using the Silk flow diverter (SFD; Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France) for the treatment of complex aneurysms in four Argentine centers. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 246 consecutive patients who were treated with the SFD at four Argentine centers between January 2009 and January 2017. The patient and aneurysm characteristics, as well as the details of the procedure, were analyzed. The angiographic and clinical findings were recorded during and immediately after the procedure and at 12-month follow-up. Results Angiography follow-up at 12 months was possible in 235 patients (95.5%) with 282 aneurysms. A total of 265 aneurysms (93.9%) presented with complete occlusion of the aneurysmal sac (class 1) and 17 aneurysms (6.1%) presented with partial occlusion (class 2). The 12-month clinical follow-up showed 11 patients with major events (seven, scale 2; five, scale 3; and two, scale 4). The morbidity and mortality rates were 4.2% (11/289) and 2.1% (5/289), respectively. Conclusions The treatment of aneurysms with the SFD was associated with a low rate of complications and a high percentage of aneurysmal occlusion. These findings suggest that SFD is an effective and safe alternative in the endovascular treatment of complex aneurysms.

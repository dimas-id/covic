BACKGROUND Coronaviruses have drawn attention since the beginning of the 21st century. Over the past 17 years, coronaviruses have triggered several outbreaks of epidemic in people, which brought great threats to global public health security. We analyzed the publications on coronavirus with bibliometrics software and qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the knowledge base and hot topics of coronavirus research from 2003 to 2020. METHODS We explored the publications on coronavirus in the Web of Science core collection (WOSCC) from 2003 to 2020. Bibliometric analysis, evaluating knowledge base, and research hotspots were performed based on CiteSpace V (Drexel University, Chaomei Chen). RESULTS There were a total of 8433 publications of coronavirus. The research on coronavirus boomed when a novel coronavirus triggered outbreaks in people. The leading country was the United States, and the leading institution was the University of Hong Kong. The most productive researchers were: Yuen KY, Drosten C, Baric RS. The keywords analysis showed that SARS-CoV, infection, acute respiratory syndrome, antibody, receptor, and spike protein were research hotspots. The research categories analysis showed that virology, microbiology, veterinary sciences, infectious diseases, and biochemistry and molecular biology were hot research categories. CONCLUSIONS Bibliometric analysis of the literature shows the research on coronavirus boomed when a novel coronavirus triggered outbreaks in people. With the end of the epidemic, the research tended to be cooling. Virus identification, pathogenesis, and coronavirus-mediated diseases attracted much attention. We must continue studying the viruses after an outbreak ended.

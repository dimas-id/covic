There are conflicting views regarding techniques for repair of small umbilical hernias (UHs). Here, we compare the recurrence rate in primary repair with that reported for mesh repair by examining a single surgeon's practice at a large medical center with a comprehensive electronic medical record. A six-year retrospective review of primary UH repairs between January 2012 and December 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center was undertaken. Patients were identified through a database search of the electronic medical record. The primary endpoint of UH recurrence was examined; median follow-up was 3.4 years. Primary, elective UH repair was performed in 244 patients; 71 per cent of hernias were small (<2 cm). The total number of recurrences was seven (3%). The t test analysis showed significant differences in the average size of hernia defects between those with recurrences (2 cm) and those without (1.4 cm), P < 0.05. Primary repair affords low infection and recurrence rates, comparable to those reported for mesh repair. Our single-surgeon/large-volume study contributes to the evidence that primary UH repair is a safe and durable method, with low risk of recurrence. The use of absorbable monofilament suture, and selection for lower BMI and smaller hernia sizes proved to be effective.

BACKGROUND To compare the clinical results of two types of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH): LH with some vaginal component [LH(a)] versus laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). SUBJECTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective comparative study. A single surgeon performed 50 LESS-LAVH procedures consecutively between March 2009 and October 2009 and 50 LESS-LH(a) procedures consecutively between January 2011 and July 2011. RESULTS Most LESS-LH(a)s/LAVH procedures were successful. Of 50 LESS-LH(a) procedures, 2 were converted to LESS-LAVH. Of 50 LESS-LAVHs, 1 required additional ports. The LESS-LH(a) group had a shorter operative time and less postoperative pain compared with the LESS-LAVH group. Operative complications were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS LESS-LH(a) and LESS-LAVH are both feasible and safe methods, with similar surgical outcomes. In terms of operative time and postoperative pain, LESS-LH(a) is superior to LESS-LAVH.

The novel coronavirus known to have brought the world to a standstill is responsible for many deaths throughout the globe as of now. The causative agent (SARS-CoV-2) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a zoonotic transfer. Although, the medium of animal-human transmission is still unknown, bats maybe a potential reservoir of this novel strain. Due to its high rate of transmission the most favorable way of limiting the outbreakâ€™s extent is by early diagnosis followed by isolation of the infected individuals. So far, the most widely used diagnosis methods are RT-qPCR which detects specific sequences of the viral RNA. Some other methods include serological tests and the recently introduced CRISPR-CAS-12 based assays. As of now, no specific therapeutic treatments are known for COVID-19 however the use of some broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and convalescent plasma therapy have demonstrated positive outcomes. Apart from these treatments, vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 is also in progress by 17 known companies. This article provides a comprehensive insight on the recently emerged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) including its origin, transmission mechanism, pathophysiology and updated treatment methods.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, monocentric observational study. OBJECTIVE: Investigation of incidence and complication rate of cannula changes in long-term tracheotomized patients suffering spinal cord injury. SETTING: University hospital in Bochum, Germany. METHODS: Prospective data collection of all cannula changes between September 2016 and September 2017. Physicians recorded mechanical complications and techniques to solve them, and/or complications resulting in patient-threatening condition. RESULTS: There were 149 cannula changes during 3191 observation days. Overall, urgent cannula changes occurred 2.1 times per 100 observation days. Within the first 8 weeks after tracheostomy, urgent cannula changes were necessary four times per 100 observation days, and were mandatory less than two times per 100 observation days thereafter. Overall, mechanical complications occurred in 12% of cannula changes, and 8% of cannula changes were accompanied by patient-threatening complications. Accidental decannulation (AD) occurred in 0.97 of 100 observation days. Recannulation after AD was accompanied by 29% of mechanical complications during reinsertion, and 16% led to patient-threatening complications. The major risk factors for mechanical complications were the time lag between cannula change and tracheostomy, and the urgency of the procedure while the thyroid cartilageâ€“jugular distance was significantly associated with patient-threatening complications. CONCLUSION: AD and the requirement for urgent cannula changes are common and often related with mechanical and patient-threatening complications. Even weeks after tracheostomy, caregivers need to be aware of serious events, and therefore provide monitoring, knowledge, and appropriate resources to handle these events.

Abstract Easy and early detection of infection and inflammation is essential for early and effective treatment. In this study, PEGylated micelles were designed and both micelles and Levofloxacin were radiolabeled with 99mTcO4 - to develop potential radiotracers for detection of infection/inflammation. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability and bacterial binding of 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles were compared. The aim of this study is to formulate and compare 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles as infection and inflammation agents having different mechanisms for the accumulation at infection and inflammation site. PEGylated micelles were designed with a particle size of 80 ± 0.7 nm and proper characterization properties. High radiolabeling efficiency was achieved for 99mTc-Levofloxacin (96%) and 99mTc-micelles (87%). The radiolabeling efficiency was remained stable with some insignificant alterations for both radiotracers at 25 °C for 24 h. Although in vitro bacterial binding of 99mTc-levofloxacine was higher than 99mTc-micelles, 99mTc-micelles may also be evaluated potential agent due to long circulation and passive accumulation mechanisms at infection/inflammation site. Both radiopharmaceutical agents exhibit potential results in design, characterization, radiolabeling efficiency and in vitro bacterial binding point of view.

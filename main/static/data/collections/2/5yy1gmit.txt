OBJECTIVE A new double-lumen balloon catheter was being developed for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. The purpose of this study is to report our initial experience of a double-lumen balloon catheter for the treatment of wide-necked aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen patients (mean age, 63 years; range, 45-80 years) with wide-necked, with or without a branch-incorporated aneurysms, (10 ruptured and 9 unruptured) were treated with balloon-assisted coil embolization using a double-lumen balloon catheter (Scepter C™ or Scepter XC™) for 7 months after being introduced to our country. Locations of the aneurysms were posterior communicating artery (n = 7), anterior communicating artery or A2 (n = 7), middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation (n = 3), basilar artery tip (n = 1) and anterior choroidal artery (n = 1). The initial clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS Coil embolization was successfully completed in all 19 aneurysms, resulting in complete occlusions (n = 18) or residual neck (n = 1). In one procedure, a thrombus formation was detected at the neck portion of the ruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysm near to the end of the procedure. It was completely resolved with an intra-arterial infusion of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Tirofiban, 1.0 mg) without any clinical sequela. There were no treatment-related events in the remaining 18 aneurysms. At discharge, functional neurological state improved in 11 patients (10 patients with ruptured aneurysm and 1 with unruptured aneurysm presenting with mass symptoms) and 6 patients with unruptured aneurysms had no newly developed symptoms. CONCLUSION In this preliminary case series, the newly developed double-lumen Scepter balloon appears to be a safe and convenient device for coil embolization of wide-necked aneurysms.

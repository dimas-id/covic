BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a new coronavirus, and results in respiratory failure. Acute renal failure (ARF) may also occur and/or complicate the disease course, however, its incidence, causes and impact in SARS patients are not known. METHODS ARF patients were identified from a total of 78 (33 men and 45 women) probable SARS cases admitted to a single hospital. The clinical features of patients with ARF were characterized, and the etiologies analyzed. RESULTS Patients were assigned to ARF (n = 13; 17%) and non-ARF groups (n = 65). Patients with ARF were older than their non-ARF counterparts. ARF developed 7.2 +/- 4.3 days after admission. The incidence of ARF was higher in males (77% vs 35%; p < 0.05). Comorbidities of diabetes and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (38% vs 6%, p < 0.01 and 38% vs 2%, p < 0.001, respectively) and the incidence of respiratory failure (85% vs 26%, p < 0.001) and mortality (77% vs 8%, p < 0.001) were also higher. Multiple organ system failure usually accompanied ARF. Hypotension (77%) caused by nosocomial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, or SARS per se, and rhabdomyolysis (43%) was associated with ARF in addition to pre-renal factors. Five patients in the ARF group and 1 female patient with end-stage renal failure underwent renal replacement therapy during hospitalization; however, both eventually died. Of the 16 medical staff performing renal replacement therapy, none was subsequently infected with SARS coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS Development of ARF during the disease course in SARS patients is associated with catastrophic outcome. The cause of ARF in SARS patients is often associated with pre-renal factors, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, and previous comorbidities including diabetes and old age. Universal precautions to prevent viral transmission are mandatory for medical staff performing renal replacement therapy.

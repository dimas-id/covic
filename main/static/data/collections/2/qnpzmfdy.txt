Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia was first detected in Wuhan, such cases had been subsequently discovered in other cities. The disease caused by the novel coronavirus was officially named COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019) by the world health organization. National Health Commission of China and other provinces and cities have successively performed syndrome differentiation of COVID-19 and provided corresponding Chinese medicine treatment programs. In this epidemic, the disease is a “dampness toxin”. The best principle for treatment is early detection and early treatment. Both Chinese and Western medicine have their own advantages. The advantages could be complementary and could not be replaced each other. Therefore, we collected the Chinese medicine treatment programs for the treatment of COVID-19 comprehensively, conducted a systematic analysis, and especially analyzed the pharmacological basis of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of COVID-19, which provided a basis for the rationality of Chinese medicine prescription for the treatment of COVID-19, and provided a reference of updating the diagnosis and treatment plan for provinces and cities.

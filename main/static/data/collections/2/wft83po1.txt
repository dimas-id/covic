The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the effectiveness of QuikClot Combat Gauze (QCG) compared to a control group and (2) investigate the effect of movement on hemorrhage control when QCG is employed. This was a prospective, experimental design employing an established porcine model of uncontrolled hemorrhage. The minimum number of animals (n = 11 per group) was used to obtain a statistically valid result. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05) indicating that the groups were equivalent on the following parameters: activating clotting time, the subject weights, core body temperatures, amount of 1 minute hemorrhage, arterial blood pressures, and the amount and percentage of total blood volume. There were significant differences in the amount of hemorrhage (p = 0.018) and the number of movements (p = 0.000) between the QCG and control. QCG is statistically and clinically superior at controlling hemorrhage compared to the standard pressure dressing control group. Furthermore, it produces a more robust clot that can withstand significant movement. In conclusion, QCG is an effective hemostatic agent for use in civilian and military trauma management.

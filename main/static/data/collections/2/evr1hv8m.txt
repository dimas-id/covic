To investigate the impact of a vendor-specific motion-correction algorithm on morphological assessment of coronary arteries using coronary CT angiography (cCTA) and to evaluate the influence of heart rate (HR) on the motion-correction effect of this algorithm. Eighty-four patients (mean age 56.3 ± 11.4 years; 53 males) were divided into two groups with a HR of ≥65 and <65 bpm during cCTA, respectively. Images were assigned quality scores (graded 1-4) on coronary segments. Interpretability was defined as a grade >1. Catheter angiography was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of cCTA for detecting significant stenosis (≥50 %). We compared the image quality, interpretability and diagnostic accuracy between the standard and motion-correction reconstructions in both groups. The motion-correction reconstructions showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher image quality in the proximal and middle right coronary artery (RCA) in the low HR group (57.2 ± 5.0 bpm; n = 51) and proximal-to-distal RCA, posterior descending artery, and proximal and distal left circumflex artery in the high HR group (71.1 ± 4.6 bpm; n = 33). The per-segment interpretability was significantly higher using motion-correction algorithm in the middle RCA in the low HR group and in the proximal and middle RCA in high HR group. Overall, the image quality and interpretability were improved using motion-correction reconstructions in both groups (p < 0.05). Motion-correction reconstruction demonstrated higher (p < 0.05) diagnostic accuracy in 25 patients from both groups. Use of the motion-correction algorithm improves the overall image quality and interpretability of cCTA in both groups. However, it may be more beneficial to the patients with a higher HR.

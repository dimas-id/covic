A flow diverter (FD) is a flexible, densely braided stent-mesh device placed endoluminally across an intracranial aneurysm to induce its thrombotic occlusion. FD treatment planning using computational virtual stenting and flow simulation requires accurate representation of the expanded FD geometry. We have recently developed a high fidelity virtual stenting (HiFiVS) technique based on finite element analysis to simulate detailed FD deployment processes in patient-specific aneurysms (Ma et al. J. Biomech. 45:2256-2263,(2012)). This study tests if HiFiVS simulation can recapitulate real-life FD implantation. We deployed two identical FDs (Pipeline Embolization Device) into phantoms of a wide-necked segmental aneurysm using a clinical push-pull technique with different delivery wire advancements. We then simulated these deployment processes using HiFiVS and compared results against experimental recording. Stepwise comparison shows that the simulations precisely reproduced the FD deployment processes recorded in vitro. The local metal coverage rate and pore density quantifications demonstrated that simulations reproduced detailed FD mesh geometry. These results provide validation of the HiFiVS technique, highlighting its unique capability of accurately representing stent intervention in silico.

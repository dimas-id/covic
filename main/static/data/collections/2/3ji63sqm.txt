In a paper of August 2013, I discussed the so-called SuperSpreader (SS) epidemic model and emphasized that it has dynamics differing greatly from the more-familiar uniform (or Poisson) textbook model. In that paper, SARS in 2003 was the representative instance and it was suggested that MERS may be another. In April 2014, MERS incident cases showed a spectacular spike (going from a handful in the previous April to more than 260 in that month of 2014) reminiscent of a figure I published nine months earlier. Here I refit the two-level and several variant SS models to incident data from January 1, 2013--April 30, 2014 and conclude that MERS will go pandemic (all other factors remaining the same). In addition, I discuss a number of model-realism and fitting methodology issues relevant to analysing SS epidemics.

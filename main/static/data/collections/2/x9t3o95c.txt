People with epilepsy (PWE) are neither more likely to be infected by the coronavirus nor are they more likely to have severe COVID-19 manifestations because they suffer from epilepsy. However, management of COVID-19 in PWE may be more complicated than that in other individuals. Drug-drug interactions could pose significant challenges and cardiac, hepatic, or renal problems, which may happen in patients with severe COVID-19, may require adjustment to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In this review, we first summarize the potential drug-drug interactions between AEDs and drugs currently used in the management of COVID-19. We then summarize other challenging issues that may happen in PWE, who have COVID-19 and are receiving treatment.

COVID‐19 presents many pressing challenges to the global dermatological community and our patients with ongoing skin needs, which must be considered by every dermatology provider. Many of these are logistical and administrative, distinct from physical manifestations, and could be summarized by the acronym COVID (Consultations, Operations, Videoconferencing, Immunosuppressive medications, Drug and equipment shortages). While the pandemic may represent a threat to many parts of our existence, dermatologists can help the patients we care for by considering noncutaneous implications of COVID‐19 upon our practice.

Objectives To examine the current studies about the impacts of faculty caring on nursing students' intent to graduate and provide recommendations. The nursing profession continues to face nursing shortages. One of the solutions recognized to alleviate the shortage is increasing the number of students graduating from nursing schools. It lacks a literature review synthesizing the current research about the impacts of faculty caring on nursing students' intent to graduate and indicate areas for future research. Methods This is a systematic literature review. The search of the literature was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Databases searched included MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Search. Search terms included 'attrition,' 'dropouts,' 'graduation rate,' 'faculty,' 'instructor,' 'professor,' 'nursing,' and 'caring.' Results Ten articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were conducted in the Associate Degree of Nursing and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. Nursing faculties played a significant role in students' intent to graduate by building students' confidence, creating a compassionate learning environment, and promoting students' competence. Faculties' caring behaviors, including respecting students, showing empathy, and using caring communication skills, were essential characteristics to affect students' learning environments. Conclusions The findings indicate that students' perceptions of faculty caring can affect their perceptions of the learning environment and sense of belonging, and therefore, impact their intent to graduate. Students' perceptions of their instructors' caring behaviors are instrumental in motivating them to continue learning. The capacity of faculty caring plays a significant role in students' success.

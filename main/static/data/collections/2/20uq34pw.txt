Objective@#To analyze the CT manifestations of the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) combined with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) literature review, and to summarize the characteristics of CT imaging, so as to improve the ability of rapid and accurate diagnosis.@*Methods@#CT manifestations of two confirmed cases of NCP were reported, meanwhile the literatures on SARS and MERS imaging performance were reviewed and summarized.@*Results@#The two cases of NCP were both in acute stage, the CT imaging showed multiple and scattered ground-glass opacity (GGO) in both lungs, which is similar to the CT performance of SARS and MERS in acute stage.@*Conclusions@#The CT features of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia are similar to SARS and MERS. It has certain characteristics and changes rapidly with the course of the disease. In the acute stage, GGO and paving stone sign were the main manifestations. In the acute phase, GGO and crazy paving are the main manifestations. In the progress stage, the interlobular septal thickening and consolidation appeared. During the absorption period, the lesions disappeared or fibrosis was left behind, with lung structure distortion and bronchiectasis. Lymphadenopathy and hydrothorax were rare.

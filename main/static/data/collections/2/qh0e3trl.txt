OBJECTIVE To report the clinical findings, outcome, and complications associated with urethrotomy performed in combination with or after temporary tube cystostomy for treatment of obstructive urolithiasis in male goats. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SAMPLE POPULATION Castrated male goats (n = 15). METHODS The medical records of male goats admitted for obstructive urolithiasis were reviewed. Goats that underwent aurethrotomy performed in combination with or after a temporary tube cystostomy were included in the study population. Follow-up information was obtained through hospital records and telephone communication. RESULTS Thirteen of 15 goats were discharged from the hospital a median of 13 days (range, 7-25) after urethrotomy. Complications related to the urinary system occurred in 5 goats and included recurrent obstruction, urination from open urethrotomy, uroabdomen and intra-abdominal adhesions after removal of the Foley catheter, and incisional infection. Five of 7 goats with long-term follow-up (2-24 months after surgery) were healthy, with normal urinary function. The remaining 2 goats returned to the hospital with signs of reobstruction that were attributed to uroliths at necropsy in 1 goat. CONCLUSION Goats treated with urethrotomy for persistent urethral obstruction after temporary tube cystostomy generally survived the procedure. Normal long-term urinary function was obtained in some goats, although recurrence was the most common complication. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Urethrotomy is a surgical option for male goats with persistent urethral obstruction due to urethral calculi after temporary tube cystostomy.

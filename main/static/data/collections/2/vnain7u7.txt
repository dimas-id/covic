BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Geldanamycin and licochalcone A induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, whether the combination of geldanamycin and licochalcone A-induced apoptosis in epithelial ovarian cancer cells is mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species, leading to the activation of apoptotic caspase, has not been studied. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using the human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3, we investigated the promoting effect of licochalcone A on geldanamycin-induced apoptosis. RESULTS Geldanamycin induced changes in apoptosis-related protein levels, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases, cleavage of PARP-1, formation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of glutathione (GSH). Licochalcone A enhanced geldanamycin-induced apoptosis-related protein activation, formation of reactive oxygen species, caspase activation and cell death. The combined effect was inhibited by the addition of oxidant scavengers. CONCLUSIONS Licochalcone A may potentiate the apoptotic effect of geldanamycin on ovarian carcinoma cell lines by the activation of the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathways and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. The apoptosis-promoting effect of licochalcone A may be mediated by its stimulatory action on the formation of reactive oxygen species and the depletion of GSH, which results in the activation of caspases.

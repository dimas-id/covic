There is no consensus on the timing and management of emergency overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Emergency capsule endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have a high diagnostic and therapeutic yield in these situations. Most lesions detected by small bowel endoscopy are amenable to endoscopic haemostasis, although some lesions still require surgery or interventional radiology. The management of these patients is varied, and doubt persists about which technique should be preferred as first-line treatment. This narrative review analyses the usefulness and impact of small bowel endoscopic techniques in the emergency setting for severe overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

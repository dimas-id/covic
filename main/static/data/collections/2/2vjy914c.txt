Abstract Background Over 300 million people carry a diagnosis of asthma with data to suggest they are at higher risk for infection or adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2. Asthma is remarkably heterogenous and it is currently unclear how patient intrinsic factors may relate to COVID-19. Objective Identify and characterize subsets of asthmatics at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Participants from 2 large asthma cohorts were stratified using clinically relevant parameters to identify factors related to ACE2 expression within bronchial epithelium. ACE-2 correlated gene signatures were used to interrogate publicly available databases to identify upstream signaling events and novel therapeutic targets. Results Stratifying by Type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, we identified subjects who demonstrated low peripheral blood eosinophils accompanied by increased expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in bronchial epithelium. Genes highly correlated with ACE2 overlapped with Type 1 and 2 interferon signatures, normally induced by viral infections. T cell recruitment and activation within bronchoalveolar lavage cells of ACE2-high subjects was reciprocally increased. These patients demonstrated characteristics corresponding to risk factors for severe COVID-19, including male sex, history of hypertension, low peripheral blood and elevated BAL lymphocytes. Conclusion ACE2 expression is linked to upregulation of viral response genes in a subset of Type-2 low asthmatics with characteristics resembling known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Therapies targeting the interferon family and T cell activating factors may therefore be of benefit in a subset of patients. Clinical Implication Type-2 low asthmatics may be at increased risk for adverse outcome from COVID-19 and deserve increased vigilance upon developing symptoms.

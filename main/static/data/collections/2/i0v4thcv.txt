AIMS: The aim of this study was to verify the suitable use of candidate ‘probiotics’ selected by in vitro tests and the importance of in vivo assays to nominate micro‐organisms as probiotics and alternative prophylactic treatments for Salmonella Typhimurium infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty‐three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from foal's faeces were assessed based on the main desirable functional in vitro criteria. Based on these results, Pediococcus pentosaceus strain 40 was chosen to evaluate its putative probiotic features in a mouse model of Salmonella infection. Daily intragastric doses of Ped. pentosaceus 40 for 10 days before and 10 days after Salmonella challenge (10(6) CFU of Salm. Typhimurium per mouse) led to a significant aggravation in mouse health by increasing weight loss, worsening clinical symptoms and anticipating the time and the number of deaths by Salmonella. Pediococcus pentosaceus modulated cell‐mediated immune responses by up‐regulation of the gene expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α in the small intestine. CONCLUSION: The usual criteria were used for in vitro screening of a large number of LAB for desirable probiotic functional properties. However, the best candidate probiotic strain identified, Ped. pentosaceus #40, aggravated the experimental disease in mice. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These findings emphasize the need for prophylactic or therapeutic effectiveness to be demonstrated in in vivo models to make precise health claims.

Influenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population each year. The often subtle clinical manifestations in the frail geriatric patients may not be recognized initially, impeding timely administration of antiviral treatment. The effectiveness of current influenza vaccines in the elderly population is often diminished by immune senescence. Increasing immunization rates among health-care workers and elderly caregivers, and finding more effective vaccines for the elderly people are likely to significantly improve disease prevention in this population at risk.

Zoonosis is an infectious disease and a potential bioterrorism agent. Bioterrorism aimed at a society, government, and/or its citizens is meant to cause destabilization, fear, anxiety, illness, and death in people, animals, or plants using biological agents. A bioterrorism attack is the intentional release of biological agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, rickettsial or chlamydial organisms, toxins, or other harmful agents. This chapter focuses on the induction, monitoring, and prevention of some zoonotic diseases that have potential as bioterrorism agents. The etiology, clinical manifestations, transmission routes, and treatment of these zoonotic agents are briefly discussed.

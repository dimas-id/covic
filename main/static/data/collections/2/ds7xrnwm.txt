This survey aimed to assess the concerns of students of health-related higher education in Brazil regarding distance learning during the coronavirus pandemic. A Google Forms anonymous questionnaire was sent by WhatsApp Messenger to students at a private university. Seven hundred and four students answered the questionnaire (566 female, 138 male, mean age = 23.09 years), reflecting approximately a third of the students in health-related disciplines. Students reported feeling anxious due to the pandemic. Most of the students agreed with having the ability to continue education through distance learning, but relatively few of them enjoyed it. Also, students were concerned that learning of clinical material and professional training would be impaired, and they were afraid of failing the year of education. Health-related higher education private institutions in Brazil should focus on reassessing and prioritizing their policies and protocols and include a detailed plan for the future.

Laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of benign disorders of bile ducts, for example, symptomatic cholelithiasis. Nowadays, laparoscopic surgery is becoming less invasive by means of the advanced technologic capabilities. In this article, the authors present a 65-year-old patient with situs inversus totalis who was examined because of abdominal pain and dyspeptic symptoms. Ultrasonography and tomography revealed cholecystitis with gallstones (calculous cholecystitis), besides, it was observed that the liver and the gall bladder were on the left side and the heart, the stomach and the spleen were located on the right side of the patient. The patient was performed single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient was discharged on the postoperative day 1. In the present article, the authors described how easily the single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy could resolve the technical difficulties encountered in the patients with situs inversus totalis during the conventional laparoscopic surgery.

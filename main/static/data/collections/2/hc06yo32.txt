This review highlights the clinical scoring tools used for the management of acute pharyngotonsillitis in primary care clinics. It will include the prevalence of group A pharyngotonsillitis among children and adults worldwide and the selective tests employed for diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. Pharyngotonsillitis is one of the common reasons for visits to primary care clinics worldwide, and physicians tend to prescribe antibiotics according to the clinical symptoms, which leads to overprescribing antibiotics. This in turn may lead to serious health impacts and severe reactions and may promote antibiotic resistance. These significantly add on to the health care costs. The available information from health organisations and previous studies has indicated the need to manage the diagnosis of pharyngotonsillitis to improve prescribing habits in primary care clinics.

Objective: COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms occur in both adults and children. To date, however, no large sample size study focusing on gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric cases has been published. We analyzed COVID-19 infected children in Wuhan who presented with initial GI symptoms to determine the GI characteristics and epidemiological trend of the disease. Design: We retrospectively analyzed 244 children patients confirmed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital from 21 Jan to 20 Mar 2020. Symptomatic cases were divided into two groups according to whether the patients presented with or without GI symptoms on admission. Demographic, epidemiological, symptoms, and laboratory data were compared. We also analyzed the respective trends of case number changes of GI cases and asymptomatic cases. Results: 34 out of 193 symptomatic children had GI symptoms. They had lower median age and weight, a higher rate of fever, a longer length of stay and more hematological and biochemical abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in chest CT findings or stool SARS-CoV-2 test positive percentages between the two groups. The number of patients admitted with GI symptoms showed an overall downward trend with time. At the time of writing, 242 patients were discharged, one died, and one critically ill patient was still in the intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 infected children with GI symptoms are prone to presenting with more clinical and laboratory abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. More attention and timely hospital admission are needed for these patients.

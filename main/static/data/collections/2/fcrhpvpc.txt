There is an explosive interest in the immediate and cost-effective analysis of field-collected biological samples, as many advanced biodetection tools are highly sensitive, yet immobile. On-site biosensors are portable and convenient sensors that provide detection results at the point of care. They are designed to secure precision in highly ionic and heterogeneous solutions with minimal hardware. Among various methods that are capable of such analysis, field-effect biosensors are promising candidates due to their unique sensitivity, manufacturing scalability, and integrability with computational circuitry. Recent developments in nanotechnological surface modification show promising results in sensing from blood, serum, and urine. This report gives a particular emphasis on the on-site efficacy of recently published field-effect biosensors, specifically, detection limits in physiological solutions, response times, and scalability. The survey of the properties and existing detection methods of four promising biotargets, exosomes, bacteria, viruses, and metabolites, aims at providing a roadmap for future field-effect and other on-site biosensors.

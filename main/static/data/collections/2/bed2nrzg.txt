A graphical representation of DNA sequences in which the distribution of a particular base B=A,C,G,T is represented by a set of discrete lines has been formulated. The methodology of this approach has been borrowed from two areas of physics: spectroscopy and dynamics. Consequently, the set of discrete lines is referred to as the B-spectrum. Next, the B-spectrum is transformed to a rigid body composed of material points. In this way a dynamic representation of the DNA sequence has been obtained. The centers of mass of these rigid bodies, divided by their moments of inertia, have been taken as the descriptors of the spectra and, thus, of the DNA sequences. The performance of this method on a standard set of data commonly applied by authors introducing new approaches to bioinformatics (the first exons of Î²-globin genes of different species) proved to be very good.

OBJECTIVE To compare the biomechanical strength and histologic features of 3-0 Glycomer™ 631 barbed suture (V-LOC™ 90 Absorbable Wound Closure Device, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to non-barbed 3-0 Glycomer™ 631 suture (Biosyn™, Covidien) for intradermal skin wound closure in the dog. STUDY DESIGN Randomized, factorial, in vivo. ANIMALS Eighteen purpose-bred, mature male, and female hound dogs. METHODS Eighteen adult hound dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups designated by postoperative day of assessment. Six skin incisions were made along the dorsum in the thoracolumbar region of each dog with an equal number (n=3) randomly assigned to closure with barbed or non-barbed suture. Six dogs were euthanatized on postoperative days 3, 10, and 14, respectively. Two additional incisions were made on each dog after euthanasia for baseline data (Day 0). The skin incision specimens were harvested for biomechanical testing and histologic evaluation. RESULTS Non-barbed closure had significantly higher maximum load at failure (P<.001) and stiffness (P<.001) than barbed closure regardless of day. The average tissue reaction score was significantly higher for barbed closure (P=.008), regardless of day. Suturing time for barbed closures was significantly shorter. There was no significant difference in frequency of complications between closures. CONCLUSION Barbed Glycomer™ 631 closures had a significantly lower maximum load at failure and stiffness, and higher average tissue reaction scores, but showed no difference in short term outcome for intradermal closure of dorsally located skin incisions in dogs.

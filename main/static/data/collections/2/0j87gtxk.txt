Lung ultrasound has recently been suggested by the Chinese Critical Care Ultrasound Study Group and Italian Academy of Thoracic Ultrasound as an accurate tool to detect lung involvement during COVID‐19. Although chest Computer Tomography (CT) represents the gold standard to assess lung involvement, with a specificity even superior to the nasal/pharyngeal swab for diagnosis, lung ultrasound examination can be a valid alternative to CT scan, with some advantages, particularly desirable for pregnant women. Indeed, ultrasound can be performed directly at bed side by a single operator, reducing the risk of spreading the outbreak among health professionals, as well as it is a radiation free exam making to be easier monitoring those patients who require serial exams. In the present study, we reported four cases of pregnant women affectd by COVID‐19 infection who have been monitoring with lung ultrasound examination. All patients showed ultrasound features indicative of COVID‐19 pneumonia at admission: irregular pleural lines and vertical artifacts (B‐lines) were observed in all four cases, whereas patchy areas of white lung in two cases. LUS was more sensitive than chest X‐ray in detecting COVID‐19. Three patients had resolution of lung pathology at ultrasound after 96 h of admission. Two pregnancies are ongoing, whereas two patients had cesarean delivery with no fetal complications. PCR testing of both cord blood and newborn swabs were negative in both cases.

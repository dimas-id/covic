Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in leukemic children undergoing intensive chemotherapy should be promptly recognized so that specific therapy can be started. Our experience with the two cases reported here has led us to propose guidelines for the treatment of initial PTE in a pediatric hematology unit. Two children with leukemia developed PTE, the first during the relapse for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the second at the onset of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In both cases, the diagnosis of PTE was based on clinical assessment of sudden acute respiratory failure with positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy in spite of a negative chest X-ray. The subintensive supervision consisted of instrumental monitoring with the assistance of an intensive care anesthetist. The clinical monitoring was based on the serial registration of respiratory rate, cardiac rate, SaO(2) and body temperature. The thrombolytic therapy, together with heparin prophylaxis, was successfully administered in the hematology ward without the need for intensive care support (i.e. mechanical ventilation). The success of the treatment was documented by the criterion of a return to the normal cardiorespiratory parameters a few hours after the start of the thrombolytic treatment. Furthermore, a chest CT scan in case 1 and an arteriography in case 2 confirmed the PTE-related hypoperfusion. On the basis of this experience, the authors point out that in the course of acute respiratory failure in leukemic children, the combination of a negative chest X-ray and a positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy (compared whenever possible with ventilatory scintigraphy) in the presence of a negative CT scan could be a reliable diagnostic tool for PTE. This pathology should be treated promptly and with specific therapy to avoid progression to a severe, massive PTE.

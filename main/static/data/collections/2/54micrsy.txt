Some fossils, such as crinoid stems, are not widely appreciated by collectors and researchers, yet can provide unique data regarding taphonomy and palaeoecology. A long crinoid pluricolumnal showing a distinctive pattern of preservation was collected from the Clare Shale Formation (Upper Carboniferous) at Fisherstreet Bay, Doolin, County Clare, western Ireland. The specimen is partly disarticulated and represents the mesistele to mesistele/dististele transition; attachment was by unbranched long, slender radices; pluricolumnal heteromorphic; fragments of pluricolumnal are of multiples of a unit length. This specimen, cladid? sp. indet., slumped to the seafloor after death and started to disarticulate as ligaments rotted. By reference to the broken stick model, the pattern of disarticulation suggests that the noditaxis of the heteromorphic stem was N212.

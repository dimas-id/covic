OBJECTIVE: Operating duties for orthopaedic surgeons decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, while Emergency Department (ED) cases surged. Orthopaedic Walk-In Clinics (OWICs) were implemented to manage urgent musculoskeletal cases. METHODS: OWICs, organized in three days, were staffed by one orthopaedic surgeon, one triage person, three medical assistants, and a physician assistant/nurse practitioner. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal non-emergency ED referrals decreased by 40.6% (p < 0.001) after initiation of the OWICs, allowing optimal use of resources to address the COVID-19 surge. CONCLUSION: This paper describes the OWIC model and its preliminary impact. The OWICs could serve as a template for other orthopaedic departments during the pandemic.

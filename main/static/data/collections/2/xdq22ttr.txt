BACKGROUND Animal models suggest that neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after perinatal asphyxia are reduced in infants with early-onset sepsis. OBJECTIVES To assess the outcome of infants with perinatal asphyxia, neonatal encephalopathy, and TH in the presence of early-onset sepsis. METHODS In a retrospective cohort of 1,084 infants with perinatal asphyxia and TH, the outcome of 42 infants (gestational age 36.1-42.6 weeks and birth weight 2,280-5,240 g) with proven sepsis (n = 14) and probable sepsis (n = 28) was analyzed. Death, cerebral palsy, or a delayed development at 2 years was considered an adverse outcome. RESULTS Sepsis was caused mostly by group B streptococci (n = 17), other Gram-positive bacteria (n = 5), and Candida albicans (n = 1). Of the 42 infants, 9 (21.4%) died, and 5 (11.9%) showed impairments on follow-up. The outcome is comparable to the previously reported outcome of infants with TH without early-onset sepsis. CONCLUSION A good outcome was reported in the majority of infants with perinatal asphyxia, TH, and early-onset sepsis. Cooling should not be withheld from these infants.

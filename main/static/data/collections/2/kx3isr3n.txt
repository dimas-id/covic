Human locomotion results from interactions between feedforward (central commands from voluntary and automatic drive) and feedback (peripheral commands from sensory inputs) mechanisms. Recent studies have shown that locomotion can be adapted when an external force is applied to the lower limb. To better understand the neural control of this adaptation, the present study investigated gait modifications resulting from exposure to a position-dependent force field. Ten subjects walked on a treadmill before, during, and after exposure to a force field generated by elastic tubing that pulled the foot forward and up during swing. Lower limb kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded during each walking period. During force field exposure, peak foot velocity was initially increased by 38%. As subjects adapted, peak foot velocity gradually returned to baseline in <or=125 strides. In the adapted state, hamstring EMG activity started earlier (16% before toe off) and remained elevated throughout swing. After force field exposure, foot velocity was initially reduced by 22% and returned to baseline in 9-51 strides. Aftereffects in hamstring EMGs consisted of increased activity around toe off. Contrary to the adapted state, this increase was not maintained during the rest of swing. Together, these results suggest that while the neural control of human locomotion can adapt to force field exposure, the mechanisms underlying this adaptation may vary according to the timing in the gait cycle. Adapted hamstring EMG activity may rely more on feedforward mechanisms around toe off and more on feedback mechanisms during the rest of swing.

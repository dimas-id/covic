BACKGROUND: Quantitative and semi-quantitative indicators to evaluate the severity of lung inflammation in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) could provide an objective approach to rapidly identify patients in need of hospital admission. PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of chest computed tomography severity score (CT-SS) in differentiating clinical forms of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion of 102 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on throat swabs underwent chest CT (53 men and 49 women, 15-79 years old, 84 cases with mild and 18 cases with severe disease). The CT-SS was defined by summing up individual scores from 20 lung regions; scores of 0, 1, and 2 were respectively assigned for each region if parenchymal opacification involved 0%, less than 50%, or equal or more than 50% of each region (theoretical range of CT-SS from 0 to 40). The clinical and laboratory data were collected, and patients were clinically subdivided according to disease severity by the Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. RESULTS: The posterior segment of upper lobe (left, 68/102; right, 68/102), superior segment of lower lobe (left, 79/102; right, 79/102), lateral basal segment (left, 79/102; right, 70/102) and posterior basal segment of lower lobe (left, 81/102; right, 83/102) were the most frequently involved sites in COVID-19. Lung opacification mainly involved the lower lobes, in comparison with middle-upper lobes. No significant differences in distribution of the disease were seen between right and left lungs. The individual scores of in each lung, as well as the total CT-SS were higher in severe COVID-19 when compared with mild cases (P<0.05. The optimal CT-SS threshold for identifying severe COVID-19 was 19.5 (area under curve, 0.892), with 83.3% sensitivity and 94% specificity. CONCLUSION: CT-SS could be used to quickly and objectively evaluate the severity of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV2, started in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China and then has rapidly spread to the whole world becoming a pandemic. In February 2020, COVID-19 has reached Europe and, in particular, it has roughly hit Italy and, subsequently, other countries and continents. Consequently, hospitals have started to intensively reduce elective activities to face the high numbers of COVID-19 patients' admissions. In Italy, all the non-urgent clinical appointments (such as primary prevention visits and elective surgeries) have been postponed. We describe the reorganization of our Northern Italy dermatology department during COVID-19 pandemic, including teledermatology strategies. Considering the unknown duration of this emergency scenario we wonder if this is just a temporary measure or the beginning of a new era in dermatology departments' organization?

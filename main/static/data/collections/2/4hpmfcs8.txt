Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating hypoxemic respiratory failure, characterized by disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane barrier. Current management for ARDS remains supportive, including lung-protective ventilation and a conservative fluid strategy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a potentially attractive candidate for the management of ARDS through facilitating lung tissue regeneration and repair by releasing paracrine soluble factors. Over the last decade, a variety of strategies have emerged to optimize MSC-based therapy. Among these, the strategy using genetically modified MSCs has received increased attention recently due to its distinct advantage, in conferring incremental migratory capacity and, enhancing the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, angiogenic, and antifibrotic effects of these cells in numerous preclinical ARDS models, which may in turn provide additional benefits in the management of ARDS. Here, we provide an overview of recent studies testing the efficacy of genetically modified MSCs using preclinical models of ARDS.

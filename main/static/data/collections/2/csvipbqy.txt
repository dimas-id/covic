The authors report a Japanese boy with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009-associated pneumonia and deteriorating oxygenation. He dramatically recovered after the use of Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode. There was no improvement by using any conventional ventilation, however, APRV immediately led to an improvement of his clinical symptoms and laboratory findings.

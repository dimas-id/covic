The resilience of the food supply chain is a matter of critical importance, both for national security and broader societal well bring. COVID19 has presented a test to the current system, as well as means by which to explore whether the UK's food supply chain will be resilient to future disruptions. In the face of a growing need to ensure that food supply is more environmentally sustainable and socially just, COVOD19 also represents an opportunity to consider the ability of the system to innovative, and its capacity for change. The purpose of this case based study is to explore the response and resilience of the UK fruit and vegetable food supply chain to COVID19, and to assess this empirical evidence in the context of a resilience framework based on the adaptive cycle. To achieve this we reviewed secondary data associated with changes to retail demand, conducted interviews with 23 organisations associated with supply to this market, and conducted four video workshops with 80 organisations representing half of the UK fresh produce community. The results highlight that, despite significant disruption, the retail dominated fresh food supply chain has demonstrated a high degree of resilience. In the context of the adaptive cycle, the system has shown signs of being stuck in a rigidity trap, as yet unable to exploit more radical innovations that may also assist in addressing other drivers for change. This has highlighted the significant role that innovation and R&D communities will need to play in enabling the supply chain to imagine and implement alternative future states post COVID.

Since late April 2020, data regarding Kawasaki-like syndrome and hyperinflammatory response in children associated with COVID-19 has rapidly emerged. Much remains unknown about the risk factors, pathogenesis, prognosis, and specific therapy for this emerging manifestation of COVID-19 known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). MIS-C is rare and early recognition is crucial though no standardized treatment guideline have been established. Worldwide collaboration will be important as more cases are recognized going forward.

OBJECTIVES To examine bone formation in dehiscence defects using biphasic hydroxyapatite/β-tricalcium phosphate plus biphasic calcium sulfate (BCP/BCS). MATERIAL After extractions, 24 mandibular buccal dehiscence defects (3 × 3 mm) were treated with BCP/BCS (E), membrane (MC), or control (NC). Histology and histomorphometric analysis were performed. RESULTS After 6 weeks, bone formation was noticeable in most sites. In subsequent phases, the woven bone was gradually remodeled into lamellar bone and marrow. Vertical new bone height in the E and MC groups (1.06 and 0.85 mm.) was substantially greater than that in the NC group (-0.28 mm). For all groups, there was an overall increase in the height of the newly formed bone through the observation. At week 12, the vertical bone height was 1.95, 2.07, and 0.29 mm, respectively. The mean new bone area in the E and MC groups was much greater than that in the NC group (2.85, 2.80, and -0.20 mm, respectively). Percent new bone in all 3 groups was similar (36.25%, 34.84%, and 28.34%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the efficacy of BCP/BCS graft for bone augmentation in dehiscence-type extraction socket defect.

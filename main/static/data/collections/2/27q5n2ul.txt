During the period June 1983 â€“ May 1984, faecal specimens from 797 patients with acute enteritis were examined for the presence of bacterial, viral and parasitic agents; 209 (26.2%) enteritic pathogens were identified, of whom 118 (35.4%) in 333 samples from the pediatrics wards. Bacterial agents were detected in 122 (15.3%), viruses in 63 (7.9%) and parasites in 25 (3.1%) of the 797 specimens. LT-producing E. coli, Salmonella and Rotavirus were the most frequent pathogens. Bacterial agents occurred most frequently in the summer and autumnal months, whereas viruses showed two peaks, the first one in summer due to cultivable agents, the second in winter to Rotavirus mainly.

Abstract The chemoprophylactic effects of paromomycin sulfate against natural cryptosporidiosis in young kids were investigated. Two studies were carried out using two groups of 18 and 12 animals in two pens. In each pen, kids were allocated to treated or control groups. The treatment consisted of oral paromomycin given at 100 mg kg−1 body weight day−1 for 11 consecutive days from 2 days of age. All kids were weighed at 2, 6 and 10 days of age. Infection was monitored by collecting fecal samples and staining fecal smears every 3–4 days from days 4 or 5 to days 15 or 19. The results clearly showed the efficacy of paromomycin in reducing cryptosporidial oocyst output. Moreover, paromomycin prevented clinical signs and mortality.

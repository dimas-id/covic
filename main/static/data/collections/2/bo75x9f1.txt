SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading rapidly since its outbreak in December 2019.Understanding its epidemiological characteristics, especially cutting off transmission routes, is crucial to controlling the spread of the disease. In the study of transmission pathway, the issue of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through ocular surface tissue has also aroused concerns, but there are still no clinically confirmed cases and laboratory evidence of its infection through ocular surface tissue. New research suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same genus as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and that it enters cells in the same way as SARS-CoV. This paper reviews the research on SARS-CoV to investigate the possible mechanism of eye transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

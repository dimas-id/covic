Detection of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the sera of individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) can indicate both a high infectivity of the disease and a poor prognosis of disease treatment. Most of monoclonal antibodies raised against HBV e proteins interact with immuno-dominant epitopes, such as HBeAg-beta. In order to raise antibodies against non-dominant epitopes of HBV e protein, in this study, mice were immunized with both recombinant HBeAg (rHBeAg) and an anti-HBeAg antibody (EWB) recognizing a dominant antigenic epitope of HBeAg (HBeAg-beta epitope). With this strategy, we successfully selected two monoclonal antibodies, S-29-3 and S-72-3. Both S-29-3 and S-72-3 bind to recombinant HBeAg with a high affinity. The epitope mapping assay determined that the S-73-2 recognizes the N-terminal of HBeAg (1-118 aa) and the S-29-3 recognizes the C-terminal of HBeAg (91-149 aa). Further experiment showed that these two antibodies could be formed a pair-Abs that is used in detecting native HBeAg from the sera of HBV patients. The conclusion is that the developed method is useful to raise mAb against non-dominant epitopes in given Ag.

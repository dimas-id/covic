Extracellular DNA trap formation is a cellular function of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils that facilitates the immobilization and killing of invading microorganisms in the extracellular milieu. To form extracellular traps, granulocytes release a scaffold consisting of mitochondrial DNA in association with granule proteins. As we understand more about the molecular mechanism for the formation of extracellular DNA traps, the in vivo function of this phenomenon under pathological conditions remains an enigma. In this article, we critically review the literature to summarize the evidence for extracellular DNA trap formation under in vivo conditions. Extracellular DNA traps have not only been detected in infectious diseases but also in chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as in cancer. While on the one hand, extracellular DNA traps clearly exhibit an important function in host defense, it appears that they can also contribute to the maintenance of inflammation and metastasis, suggesting that they may represent an interesting drug target for such pathological conditions.

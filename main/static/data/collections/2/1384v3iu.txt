Antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are key candidates for therapeutic agents. However, the availability of a suitable screening system for antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) is limited in humans. Here we present a unique method for detecting individual ASCs using microwell array chips, which enables the analysis of live cells on a single-cell basis and offers a rapid, efficient and high-throughput (up to 234,000 individual cells) system for identifying and recovering objective ASCs. We applied the system to detect and retrieve ASCs for hepatitis B virus and influenza viruses from human peripheral blood lymphocytes and produced human mAbs with virus-neutralizing activities within a week. Furthermore, we show that the system is useful for detecting ASCs for multiple antigens as well as for selection of ASCs secreting high-affinity antibodies on a chip. Our method can open the way for the generation of therapeutic antibodies for individual patients.

RATIONALE Much of the total disease burden and cost of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a novel candidate exacerbation biomarker identified by proteomic screening. OBJECTIVES To assess SAA as a biomarker of AECOPD. METHODS Biomarkers were assessed (1) cross-sectionally (stable vs. AECOPD; 62 individuals) and (2) longitudinally with repeated measures (baseline vs. AECOPD vs. convalescence; 78 episodes in 37 individuals). Event severity was graded (I, ambulatory; II, hospitalized; III, respiratory failure) based on consensus guidelines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Presumptively newly acquired pathogens were associated with onset of symptomatic AECOPD. In the cross-sectional study, both SAA and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at AECOPD onset compared with stable disease (SAA median, 7.7 vs. 57.6 mg/L; P < 0.01; CRP median, 4.6 vs. 12.5 mg/L; P < 0.01). Receiver operator characteristics analysis was used to generate area-under-curve values for event severity. SAA discriminated level II/III events (SAA, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.94 vs. CRP, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.87; P = 0.05). Combining SAA or CRP with major symptoms (Anthonisen criteria, dyspnea) did not further improve the prediction model for severe episodes. IL-6 and procalcitonin were not informative. CONCLUSIONS SAA is a novel blood biomarker of AECOPD that is more sensitive than CRP alone or in combination with dyspnea. SAA may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of AECOPD.

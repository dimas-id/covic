The rapid proliferation and miniaturization of the wireless and embedded devices has led to the invasion of the Internet of Things in many domains and has reached the healthcare sector to form what is called the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) . The growing number of the applications in the Internet of Healthcare Things as well as the overwhelming number of heterogeneous medical devices that should interact in this network has put the researchers and developers in front of lot of challenges: How to facilitate the implementation of the various healthcare applications? And how to ease the integration of new devices and make their interoperation a transparent task for the developers? To fulfill these requirements, lot of middleware have been proposed. In this paper we provide a complete study on the existing middleware for IoHT and specify their applications, we propose a taxonomy for them and we present their main advantages and drawbacks.

We read with interest the correspondence from Montagud‐Marrahi et al. putting forward that solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are not at higher risk of severe COVID‐19 infection despite their immunosuppression and the mild or atypical nature of their symptoms in their Spanish cohort. In the recent literature, this population achieves a mortality rate between 20% and 52% when they become critically ill. Moreover, as innate immunity is altered by the infection, decreased doses of immunosuppressive drugs should be considered.

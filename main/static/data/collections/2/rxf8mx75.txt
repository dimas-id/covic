Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, significantly affects the performance of both the egg-laying and meat-type birds causing the foremost of economic loss in poultry industry. This paper aims to develop a rapid, low-cost, and sensitive biosensor for IBV detection by using molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)). MoS(2) is a 2-D nanosheet which has strong high fluorescence-quenching ability when applied to a dye-labeled antibody (Ab). In this paper, we developed an Ab-functionalized MoS(2)-based fluorescent immunosensor, which utilized the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the MoS(2) and fluorescence dye during the Ab–antigen interaction. The assay was performed on a low-cost cotton thread-based microfluidic platform due to the good wicking property and flexibility. Upon the optimization of assay conditions, the immunosensor demonstrated remarkable sensitivity of [Formula: see text] EID(50) per mL and specificity with a dynamic linear response range of 10(2)–10(6) EID(50) per mL for IBV standard solutions. The developed immunoassay successfully detected the IBV spiked chicken serum with satisfactory results. The foregoing presents its potential application for on-farm detection.

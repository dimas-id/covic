Violence against women by partners (VAWP) has been systematically studied in Mexico in the past 15 years. The aim of this paper is to reflect on the contributions on this topic in Mexico. The discussion focuses on the magnitude of this phenomenon, stressing its theoretical, methodological, and technical implications; the relationship between violence and a variety of factors; and the outcomes of VAWP on women themselves. The manuscript features the main contributions from quantitative and qualitative studies.

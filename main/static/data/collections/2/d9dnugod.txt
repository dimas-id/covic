Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated that operating room procedures be modified to ensure the safety of staff and patients. Specifically, procedures that have the potential to create aerosolization must be reassessed, given the risk of viral transmission via aerosolization. We present the use of a non-sealed endoscopic vessel harvesting(EVH) approach during coronary surgery that does not necessitate the use of CO2 insufflation and utilizes suction through an ultra low particulate filter, thus mitigating the risk of possible viral transmission via aerosolization or surgical smoke production. This approach is technically feasible and can minimize the risk of viral transmission during EVH.

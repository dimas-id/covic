This review aims to highlight the differences in the management of flexor tendon injuries between children and adults. These include differences in epidemiology, anatomy, classification, diagnosis, incisions and skin closure, the size of the flexor tendons, technical aspects of zones I and II repairs, core suture purchase length, rehabilitation, results, and complications of primary flexor tendon repair. Finally, one- versus two-stage flexor tendon reconstruction in children is reviewed.

OBJECTIVE The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa remains the most deadly in history. Emergency departments (EDs) are more likely to come into contact with potential EVD patients. It is important for EDs to be prepared to care for suspected EVD patients. Our objective was to understand the perceived challenges experienced by Washington State ED medical directors in EVD preparedness. METHODS An anonymous, electronic survey was sent to a convenience sample of ED medical directors across Washington State between November and February of 2014-2015. The perceived challenges of and attitudes toward EVD preparations were assessed and reported as stratified proportions. RESULTS Of 85 medical directors contacted, 59 responses (69%) were received. This included EDs with annual patient volumes of 60,000 (12 hospitals, 20%). Among the perceived challenges in EVD preparations were spatial modifications (eg, building an anteroom for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment) and waste management planning. Ninety-five percent of respondents moderately or strongly agreed that it is important to have a predesignated hospital to care for EVD patients. CONCLUSIONS Washington State ED medical directors have faced significant challenges in ensuring their EDs are prepared to safely care for suspected EVD patients. Attitudes toward EVD preparations are mixed. Varying levels of perceived importance may represent an additional barrier to statewide EVD preparedness.

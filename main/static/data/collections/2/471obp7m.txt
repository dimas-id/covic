Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may be a relevant cause of morbidity in patients displaying various inflammatory diseases. In this study, it was investigated whether CMV DNA is detected in the lower respiratory tract and the systemic compartment in pediatric patients with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases. A total of 42 lower respiratory tract specimens and 11 paired plasma samples from 42 patients were analyzed for the presence of CMV DNA by real‐time PCR. The respiratory specimens were also screened for the presence of respiratory viruses and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV‐6) and 7 (HHV‐7) by PCR methods. Quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures were performed. IL‐6 levels in the respiratory specimens were quantified using ELISA. CMV DNA was detected either in the lower respiratory airways, in plasma, or both in 54.5% of CMV‐seropositive patients. The levels of IL‐6 were significantly higher in these patients than in those with no detectable levels of CMV DNA. HHV‐6 and HHV‐7 DNA were detected in three and one patients, respectively. Respiratory viruses were detected in 13 of the 42 patients. Significant growth of one or more bacterial species was observed in 17 patients. No significant association was found between the presence of CMV DNA and the detection of other microorganisms. The data indicated that the presence of CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract is a frequent finding in children with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases. Further, prospective observational studies are needed to assess the impact of this phenomenon, if any, on the clinical course of these patients. J. Med.

BACKGROUND This retrospective study was designed to assess the feasibility of laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) in clinical stage I gastric cancer patients, and validate the appropriateness of the widespread adoption of LTG for experienced open surgeons. METHODS Eighty-eight patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer underwent LTG in our hospitals (n = 55) and affiliated hospitals (n = 33). Esophagojejunostomy was performed intracoporeally using a circular stapler with an incision in the left upper abdomen. We investigated the patients' clinicopathologic factor, and evaluated the effect of hospital volume on short-term outcomes. RESULTS Fixed insertion of the anvil head was successfully achieved in all patients (lift-up method in 58 patients and transoral method in 28 patients), although 2 patients were converted to open surgery. The approach using a circular stapler through a small incision from the upper left quadrant of the abdomen facilitated a good laparoscopic visual field for the plane of the esophagojejunostomy. Fourteen patients developed Clavien-Dindo classification grade II or more postoperative complications, and the overall operative morbidity rate was 15.9 %. No anastomotic leakage was encountered in this series. No significant difference was observed in clinical outcomes between patients in the high- and low-volume hospital groups. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic total gastrectomy can be performed safely on clinical stage I gastric cancer patients by surgeons with sufficient experience in open gastrectomy and therefore represents a feasible procedure that is not clinically impacted by hospital volume.

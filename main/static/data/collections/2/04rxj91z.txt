Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in China. National Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and local departments have released a number of diagnosis and treatment plans for COVID-19. Some plans recommend Xiyanping Injection for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. The active component of the drug is the total sulfonate of andrographolide, which is a derivative of andrographolide. This paper summarized the pharmacological action and clinical application of andrographolide, and proposed that it has the functions of clearing heat and detoxification, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory, and definite therapeutic effect on respiratory system diseases including viral pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection, and a large number of clinical data have been accumulated. Andrographolide has a potential antiviral effect on the treatment of COVID-19, and can reduce the level of inflammation in patients, improve respiratory symptoms, inhibit concurrent bacterial infection, and improve the body immunity. At the same time, it will not bring the immunosuppressive effect of hormone drugs, and the incidence of adverse reactions is low. In addition, Andrographolide has certain hepatoprotective effects and clinical value for treating cardiovascular diseases in clinical experience, suggesting that it may have some protective effects on drug-induced liver injury, heart injury and liver injury caused by durgs against COVID-19, but further clinical verification is needed. The pharmacological action and clinical application of andrographolide are summarized. This paper also analyzes the etiology, pathogenesis and dialectical treatment of COVID-19 from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, and points out that the treatment of COVID-19 with andrographolide is consistent with the theory of traditional Chinese medicine.

PURPOSE: Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a rare but serious complication among premature babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. The causes of PHH are still not entirely understood, and its prevention and treatment are controversial. We tried to analyze the risk factors for such complication in our cohort. METHODS: We reviewed our neonatology data bank and included all preterms below 28 weeks who were born in the period between 1999 and 2014 and suffered from an intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). We reviewed gestational age, gender, birth weight, type of birth, IVH degree, comorbidities, therapy, complications, time to event, protein content of cerebrospinal fluid, and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 180 patients, divided into two subgroups, “B1” with 37 cases (IVH + PHH) and “B2” with 143 cases (IVH − PHH). In group B1, the presence of IVH grades I, II, III, or IV was in 11%, 19%, and 70% respectively. Nineteen patients were treated with a ventricular access device (VAD) or external ventricular drain (EVD). A total of 20 shunts were implanted, with 11 revisions (55%). One patient suffered from thrombocytopenia. In subgroup B2, 51% showed IVH grade I, whereas severe IVH grades were only present in 22%. 25.9% suffered from thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was significantly higher in patients who did not develop PHH (p value: 0.002). CONCLUSION: According to our results, thrombocytopenia could play a decisive role in avoiding development of PHH as a sequel of IVH. We recommend a randomized controlled trial to assess the possible efficacy of antiplatelet drugs in avoiding PHH in this vulnerable group.

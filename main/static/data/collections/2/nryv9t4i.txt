This chapter develops a model for dynamic integrated scheduling of information services and logistics flows in the omnichannel system. The proposed service-oriented description makes it possible to coordinate the information services and material process schedules simultaneously. It also becomes possible to determine the volume of information services needed for physical supply processes. In addition, impact of disruptions in information services on the schedule execution in the physical structure is analyzed. The results provide a base for information service scheduling according to actual physical process execution.

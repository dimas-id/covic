An immunochromatographic test strip was developed for the detection of antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in porcine serum. In this test, the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of PEDV was expressed in soluble form and purified by using Ni-NTA resin and gel filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant N protein conjugated with colloidal gold was dispensed on a conjugate pad as the detector. Staphylococcal protein A and rabbit anti-N protein IgG were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane for the test and control lines, respectively. The immunochromatographic test strip specifically detected PEDV antibodies within 10 min and had higher sensitivity (96.0%) and specificity (90.8%) than those of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Our newly developed strip has great potential for the early diagnosis of PEDV infection.

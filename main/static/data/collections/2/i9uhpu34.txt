Abstract The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has left a lasting mark on medicine globally. Here we outline the steps that the Lenox Hill Hospital/Northwell Health Neurosurgery Department—located within the epicenter of the pandemic in New York City—is currently taking to recover our neurosurgical efforts in the age of COVID-19. We outline measurable milestones to identify the transition to the recovery period and hope these recommendations may serve as a framework for an effective path forward. We believe that recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic offers unique opportunities to disrupt and rebuild the historical patient and office experience as we evolve with modern medicine in a post-COVID-19 world.

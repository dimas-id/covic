Hydrogen exchange is a powerful method to examine macromolecules. In membrane proteins, exchange can distinguish between solvent-accessible and -inaccessible residues due to shielding by the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer. Herein, rather than examining which residues undergo hydrogen exchange, we employ a protocol that enables the full deuteration of all polar hydrogens in a membrane protein. We then measure the impact of hydrogen exchange on the shift of the amide I vibrational mode of individually labeled sites. The results enable us to correlate polarity with vibrational shifts, thereby providing a powerful tool to examine specific locations within a membrane protein in its native membrane environment.

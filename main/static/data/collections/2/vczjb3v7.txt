Abstract There is an urgent need of effective treatments for COVID-19. Amiodarone, like hydroxychloroquine, exerts antiviral actions by interfering with endocytosis and viral replication. Here we report the first case of a patient affected by respiratory failure related to COVID-19, and recovering after only supportive measures and a short amiodarone course.

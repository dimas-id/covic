Abstract Cupressus sempervirens L. (Cupressaceae), known as Mediterranean cypress, is a medicinal and aromatic plant with decorative uses. It is widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean region, including Syria, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine, and some Greek Islands, as well as the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea in Iran. The plant has a long history of utilization in folk medicine in many countries, mainly for cough and flu treatment, and the research has consistently shown that C. sempervirens has antimicrobial, antiviral, insecticidal, antihyperlipidemic, cytotoxic, antioxidant, antiplatelet, hepatoprotective, and neurobiological activities to varying extents. The mentioned biological activities of the plant are strongly associated with its phytochemical content, which is particularly rich in phenolic constituents and essential oils that could be responsible for most of its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiviral activities. This chapter covers botanical information, brief phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities related to C. sempervirens.

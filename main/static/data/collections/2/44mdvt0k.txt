As Mendlowitz and colleagues mentioned in a recent commentary, the World Health Organization set a goal for the elimination of viral hepatitis until 2030. This means that the number of newly infected persons and related mortality should be decreased by 90% and 65%, respectively. The elimination programs focus on different parts such as testing, treatment, immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV), preventing mother to child transmission, blood safety, and harm reduction. Now, COVID-19 is spreading fast throughout the world and more than one million people have been affected by this virus so far. While all attentions are now on providing effective medicines and vaccines for COVID-19, we should not forget other viruses and diseases.

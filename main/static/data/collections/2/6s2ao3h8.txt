We describe the awake fibreoptic intubation followed by awake prone positioning of a woman weighing 180 kg with body mass index of 62 kg.m(-2) requiring emergency lumbar discectomy for cauda equina syndrome. This approach was taken to overcome difficulties in transfering an anaesthetised patient on to the operating table. Following topical anaesthesia with lidocaine and low-dose remifentanil infusion, oral intubation was performed using a split oral airway to guide the fibrescope. The patient positioned herself on the Jackson operating table, following which general anaesthesia was induced. This technique optimised protection of the patient's eyes and other pressure areas while preventing undue cardiorespiratory compromise. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and later confirmed that she would consent to undergoing the same procedure again if further surgery became necessary.

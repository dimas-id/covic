AIM Recently, more SARS-CoV virus genome sequences are released to the GenBank database. The aim of this study is to reveal the evolution forces of SARS-CoV virus by analyzing the nucleotide mutations in these sequences. METHODS We obtained 20 SARS-CoV virus genome sequences from NCBI database, and calculated the ratio of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per non-synonymous site (Ka) and synonymous nucleotide substitution per synonymous site (Ks) for SARS-CoV virus genes. RESULTS The Ka/Ks ratios for replicase polyprotein ORF1a, ORF1b, and spike protein gene are 1.09 (P=0.6501), 0.38 (P=0.0074), 0.65 (P=0.0685) respectively. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV virus replicase polyprotein ORF1b is undergoing negative selection; negative selection force is also probably operating on spike protein gene. These results provide basis for future developing a new drug and vaccine against SARS.

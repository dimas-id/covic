Abstract COVID-19 disease is a pandemic disease caused by a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the coronavirus family known as 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is highly contagious and transmitted mainly by droplets or close contact. As the global incidence of COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, health systems worldwide started to suffer in terms of its capability to manage affected people and the ability to provide standard treatment for critically ill patients in a safe environment. As Medical staff has extensive contact with patients, families as well as other health care providers, they are very likely to cause cross-infection.

The Covid-19 crisis has caused devastation around the world, where face-to-face (F2F) teaching in universities has been abandoned and anatomy education courses shifted to the virtual mode (Evans et al., 2020; Ravi et al., 2020). In fact, e-learning platforms have become increasingly popular in teaching practices in tertiary institutions, in particular health professional education (Lewis et al., 2014), and mainly ascribed to observed learning benefits through verbal, visual, and auditory stimulations (Selim, 2007; Jelonek, 2015). E-learning is a way of teaching supported by digital technologies as underlined by the definition that e-learning is "the use of new multimedia technologies and the internet to improve the quality of learning by facilitating access to resources and services, as well as remote exchange and collaboration" (Alonso et al., 2005).

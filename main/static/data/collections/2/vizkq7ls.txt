Venous thromboembolism is defined as an acute venous thrombotic event that targets two disease entities: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, or both. The most common site of DVT origin is in the lower extremities, with 50% of patients exhibiting no symptoms. Although anticoagulation is the gold standard for DVT, early clot removal, especially of proximal iliofemoral DVT, is felt to reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) by preserving valve function. Up to one-half of all patients with an iliofemoral DVT treated only with anticoagulation subsequently develop long-term complications, including PTS. Beside anticoagulation, DVT treatment options may include pharmaceutical and/or mechanical therapies. Mechanical therapies consist of either endovascular percutaneous catheter-directed (PCD) interventions or open operative thrombectomy. There are several different PCD procedures available, consisting of catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, combination pharmacomechanical devices, and postthrombus extraction (angioplasty and/or stenting). Endovascular therapies in the management of acute iliofemoral DVT are evolving with a variety of devices available to treat this disease entity. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the PCD therapies used when treating patients experiencing an acute iliofemoral DVT along with associated nursing considerations. Off-label device use is not included.

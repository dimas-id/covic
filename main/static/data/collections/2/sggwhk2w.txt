Inferior vena cava filters are effective for preventing the passage of thrombi into the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. These filters are indicated in patients with contraindications to anticoagulant therapy or in patients with recurrent acute pulmonary embolism despite the administration of anticoagulant therapy. However, the occurrence of filter-related complications, such as filter migration to the heart, has been increasing. Herein, we report a case of OptEase inferior vena cava filter misplacement in the right atrium. Although the filter migrated to the right ventricle, it was successfully removed and repositioned in the inferior vena cava using endovascular techniques. Unfortunately, moderate tricuspid regurgitation developed, due to the damage to the tricuspid valve that was caused by the procedure. We have also reviewed the relevant literature and discussed the possible strategies for managing cases of filter migration to the heart and preventing filter misplacement.

Formal concept analysis and rough set theory are two of the most important mathematical tools for the treatment of information collected on relational systems. In particular, the idea of reducing the size of a database is widely studied in both theories separately. There are some papers that studied the reduction of a formal context by means of reducts from rough set. In this paper, we are focused in the reduction obtained in an information system considering the FCA reduction mechanism.

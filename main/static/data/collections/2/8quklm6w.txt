While substantial information is available on organ anlage and the primary formation of nephrons, molecular mechanisms acting during the late development of the human kidney have received an astonishing lack of attention. In healthy newborn babies, nephrogenesis takes place unnoticed until birth. Upon delivery, morphogenetic activity in the nephrogenic zone decreases, and the stem cell niches aligned beyond the organ capsule vanish by an unknown signal. However, this signal also plays a key role in preterm and low birth weight babies. Although they are born in a phase of active nephrogenesis, pathological findings illustrate that they evolve to a high incidence oligonephropathy and prematurity of renal parenchyma. Different extra- and intrauterine influences seem to be responsible, but independent from chemical nature, all of them culminate in the nephrogenic zone. One assumes that the marred development is caused either by an overshoot of metabolites, misleading signaling of morphogens, unbalanced synthesis of extracellular matrix or restricted contact between mesenchymal and epithelial stem cells. Even more surprising is that there is only a few vague morphological information of the nephrogenic zone in the human fetal kidney available and ultrastructural data is severely lacking. On this account, the first coordinates were determined by optical microscopy and morphometry. Without claiming to be complete, generated results made it possible to create schematic illustrations true to scale for orientation. It will help graduating students, young pediatricians, pathologists, and scientists working in the field of biomedicine to interpret professionally the nephrogenic zone and contained niches.

Interparietal hernias are rare abdominal defects where intraabdominal contents protrude between layers of the abdominal wall. There is limited experience using laparoscopic technique for repairing substantially large interparietal hernias. Computed tomography scans of both cases herein demonstrated intact external oblique, but the internal oblique and transversus abdominis were widely detached from the linea semilunaris. Our experience demonstrates the largest interparietal hernias treated entirely with laparoscopic repair, which successfully resolved symptoms and abdominal wall irregularity, as well as allowed discharge on the first postoperative day without complication.

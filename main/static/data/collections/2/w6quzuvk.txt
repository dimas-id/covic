The present study describes the prevalence of haematological and electrophoretic changes consistent with the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in cats without FIP living in six multicat environments with different prevalence of FIP and of other diseases. The results allow designing haematological and electrophoretic profiles typical of each group, most likely depending on the management and on the health status of the group rather than on the prevalence of FIP. In fact, many cats from the colonies with open management and frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases other than FIP had one or more haematological and/or electrophoretical changes consistent with FIP, compared with the reference ranges. In the case of non‐specific clinical signs such as fever or neurological signs because of diseases other than FIP, these cats would be erroneously considered as affected by FIP and euthanasized. The use of internal ranges designed on the basis of repeated samplings from non‐symptomatic cats allows avoiding these misinterpretations. Results from cats with symptoms consistent with FIP living in the same colonies were also compared with both the reference ranges and the internal ones: such a comparison demonstrated that the use of internal ranges rarely affected the possibility to correctly diagnose the disease in cats with symptoms suggestive of FIP.

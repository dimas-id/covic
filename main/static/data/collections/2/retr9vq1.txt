BACKGROUND Transplantation of hepatocytes is considered a promising technology for the cell therapy of liver diseases. Cells are isolated from donor livers, which are not allocated for organ transplantation and transplanted into the liver of a suitable recipient. Ideally, the transplanted cells functionally replace the hepatocytes of the diseased organ and restore its metabolic capacity either permanently or for a period of bridging to organ transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS Although about 50 cases of clinical hepatocyte transplantation have been documented, therapeutic benefit is doubtful, and the reasons for this are largely unknown. Minor quality of the transplanted cells isolated from marginal donor livers may be a major cause. Therefore, animal models have been established, which enable scientists to develop novel procedures of hepatocyte transplantation and to specifically study the mechanisms of hepatocyte integration in the host liver. Hopefully, results generated in animal models will set the basis for the design of novel procedures of hepatocyte transplantation individualized to the underlying disease in order to provide a growth advantage for donor over host cells. PERSPECTIVES The plasticity of stem cells and their proliferative potential is the basis for current efforts to generate stem cell-derived hepatocytes of transplantation quality for the treatment of liver diseases.

INTRODUCTION Within this report, we present a patient with difficulty of swallowing caused by an aberrant right subclavian artery. DISCUSSION This is a congenital anomaly with the right subclavian artery originating from the dorsal part of the aortic arch and coursing through the mediastinum between the esophagus and the vertebral column. The diagnosis and treatment of this disorder is discussed based on the findings from the literature.

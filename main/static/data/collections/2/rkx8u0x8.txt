A group of 47 children with coeliac disease, born between 1973 and 1978 in the Swedish county of Västmanland, participated in a controlled questionnaire study. Health, self‐esteem, knowledge of the disease and dietary compliance were investigated. The children with coeliac disease were otherwise just as healthy as the control children. Growth and self‐esteem were normal. Good knowledge of coeliac disease and dietary treatment was found in 87% of children and dietary compliance was 81%. Girls and younger children (12–14 years) were more compliant than boys and older children (15–17 years). Compliance correlated positively to knowledge.

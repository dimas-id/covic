BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy be offered for patients with acute cholecystitis except those deemed as high risk. Few studies have examined the impact of frailty on outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association of frailty with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. METHODS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystectomy were identified from 2005 to 2010 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP). The Modified Frailty Index (mFI) was used a surrogate for frailty, and patients were stratified as non-frail (mFI 0), low frailty (mFI 1–2), intermediate frailty (mFI 3–4) and high frailty (mFI ≥ 5). Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Receiver operator curves (ROC) and an area under the curve (AUC) were generated to determine accuracy of mFI in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 6898 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3245 (47%) patients were non-frail. There were 2913 (42%) patients with low-frailty, 649 (9%) patients with intermediate frailty, and 91 (2%) with high frailty. Clavien IV complications were higher for intermediate frail patients (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.00–3.28, p = 0.050) and high-frail patients (OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.98–10.7, p < 0.001). Additionally, mortality was higher for patients with intermediate frailty (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.37–16.0, p = 0.014) and high frailty (OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.67–55.5, p = 0.001). The mFI had excellent accuracy for mortality (AUC = 0.83) and Clavien IV complications (AUC = 0.73). CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.

BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is aimed at improving the cosmetic outcome following surgery. If the incision is made through the umbilicus, the surgery is almost 'scarless.' This is increasingly being used for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with good cosmetic results without compromising the safety of the operation. The challenge of this surgery lies in manipulating instruments within the limitations of the closely inserted ports. METHODS We describe the first case of SILS hernia repair via the trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal approach (TAPP) in a 39-year-old male as a day-case procedure. RESULTS The patient was discharged without any complications. CONCLUSIONS This novel surgical technique is feasible and improves cosmetic outcome without additional risk. The advantage of such an approach above and beyond cosmesis remains to be evaluated.

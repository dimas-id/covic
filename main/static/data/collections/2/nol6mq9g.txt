A previously unknown beta coronavirus, SARS‐CoV‐2, was discovered from a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan since the end of 2019. Ever since the start of COVID‐19, government administrations, academic institutions, and technology enterprises are under unprecedented cooperation in controlling this outbreak from pathogen identification, epidemic situation assessment, to outbreak containment. Timely identification, isolation, and whole‐genome sequencing of SARS‐CoV‐2 have laid the foundation for effective control of this novel infection. With the increasing case numbers worldwide, more real‐time information is emerging, changing our understandings to SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak, and nonetheless refining the outbreak control responses. The efficient management of COVID‐19 requires global collaboration and an efficient share of information.

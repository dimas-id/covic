Coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis have been recently identified as sequelae of severe infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report a case of severe coagulopathy manifesting with right upper limb arterial and deep vein thrombosis in an 80-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia. He clinically deteriorated and received care in the intensive care unit where he was intubated. At that point, his coagulation laboratory tests were deranged, and he eventually developed dry gangrene in his right thumb and index finger, as well as a deep venous thromboembolism in his right axillary vein. Despite receiving treatment dose anticoagulation and undergoing arterial embolectomy, revascularization was unsuccessful. Amputation of the right arm at the level of the elbow was considered, but the patient died from respiratory failure.

BACKGROUND Simulation offers recognised training benefits, but the cost of high-fidelity contextualised simulation is prohibitive and its accessibility limited to specialised Distributed Simulation centres. Distributed simulation (DS) is an innovative concept of low-cost, portable and high-fidelity contextualised simulation. However, it has previously only been trialled at a central London teaching hospital. AIMS (1) To explore the off-site feasibility of DS. (2) To determine the response of end-users to DS. METHODS A DS naive researcher recreated a standardised porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomy scenario at a District General Hospital using DS. A research diary detailed the logistical feasibility of the project, whilst mixed methods were used to determine the response of the 10 surgeons who completed the full-team simulation. RESULTS DS is feasible off-site with end-users comparing it favourably to their previous simulation experiences. Surgeons perceived DS as being most useful for building the operative confidence of juniors between learning the basics on a bench top model and before entering the operating theatre. CONCLUSIONS DS has the potential to provide high-fidelity contextualised simulation as an adjunct to, and not a replacement for, surgical training. Unlike other modalities, it is low cost and portable, thereby addressing concerns over affordability and accessibility.

Delirium is a common symptom in patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19, and in cases of hyperactive delirium we have frequently observed behaviors that pose a significant risk of disease transmission to health care providers. Managing this symptom has emerged as an important challenge, as our local health care system has been strained by providers becoming sick or quarantined. Preventative and non-pharmacologic interventions remain critical for managing delirium in such patients, though occasionally pharmacologic treatment is required. When use of an antipsychotic medication is indicated, we recommend that providers consider foregoing the lowest common dose and instead start with the next incrementally higher dose to more quickly and reliably ensure the safety of both patients and providers. We do not recommend initiating prophylactic treatment or escalating doses in a manner that conflicts with currently accepted guidelines without carefully considering the risks and benefits

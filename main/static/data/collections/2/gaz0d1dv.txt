OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine if critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation could reactivate latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) in either lung or blood. DESIGN: Prospective study in critically ill patients. SETTING: The study was performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: 23 non-immunocompromised, mechanically ventilated patients who were anti-CMV immunoglobulin G-positive. Ten immunocompromised patients with active CMV infection and 16 asymptomatic CMV seropositive non-immunocompromised patients constituted the positive and negative control groups. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The presence of CMV in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was evaluated by both viral cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirty-seven blood and 22 BAL samples were investigated. Sequential samples were evaluated in 8 patients. For PCR, a 290 bp fragment in the first exon of the immediate early 1 gene was amplified. In order to exclude inhibitors of PCR amplification, a 268 bp fragment of the β-globin gene was concurrently amplified in all samples. Viral cultures of blood and BAL were negative in all 23 non-immunocompromised, mechanically ventilated patients. Moreover, no CMV DNA could be amplified in blood or BAL samples, whereas a β-globin amplification was observed in all samples. CONCLUSION: In a series of 23 critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation who were seropositive for CMV, no reactivation of CMV in blood or lung was demonstrated.

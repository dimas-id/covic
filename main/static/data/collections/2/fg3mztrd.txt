OBJECTIVES Previous comparisons between single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (SPLA) and multi-port laparoscopic appendectomy have been conflicting and limited. We compare our single-surgeon, SPLA experience with multi-port cases performed during the same time. METHODS A retrospective chart review of 128 single-surgeon single-port and 941 multi-port laparoscopic appendectomy cases from April 2009 to December 2014 was conducted. RESULTS Patient demographics and preoperative laboratory values were comparable. SPLA was associated with shorter operative time (P=0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in length of hospitalization, postoperative pain medication use, cost, postoperative complication rates (ileus, urinary retention, deep space infection), or readmission between the 2 groups. There were no postoperative incisional hernias in the single-port group. The single-port group had more postoperative oxycodone use (P=0.0110). CONCLUSIONS Our study supports recently published metaanalyses that fail to support older studies demonstrating longer operative times, and higher hernia rates with SPLA.

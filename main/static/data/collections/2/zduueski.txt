The severity assessment of COVID-19 and transmissibility of newly emerged novel-Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can effectively help and support to quantify the ongoing pandemic risks. Among several epidemiological measures against COVID-19 severity, the case fatality risk (CFR) assessment is an important measure to track record the overall proportion/ratio of the cumulative number of infected patients with the known outcome (confirmed, recovered, or deceased). Considering the ongoing fatality rate, several case-based preventive measures, Coronavirus protein visualization, and approaches to viral vaccine development are discussed herein. The prompt identification of high-risk entities to confront the uncertainty in the risk of death using the approaches highlighted, herein, is of utmost requirement to tackle the current COVID-19 severity. Moreover, the protein visualization available at the viral surface/ body can give further insight into the appropriate vaccine development.

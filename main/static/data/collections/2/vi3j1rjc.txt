PURPOSE Aim of the study is to compare macroporous (> 1 mm2) polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (LP-PTFE) versus microporous (< 1 mm2) polypropylene mesh (SP-PPL) in terms of postoperative acute and chronic discomfort and pain, difficulty in mesh handling and long-term recurrence rate. METHODS Fifty-two patients with bilateral hernia were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT02023203). Each hernia, in the same patient, was randomized to implant LP-PTFE or SP-PPL mesh during totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair. Patients were followed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 60 months after surgery. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was employed to evaluate the outcomes. Student's t test was used in case of normally distributed continuous variables, while the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used in case of not normally distributed variables. Chi square test was used for analysis of categorical variables. RESULTS Median VAS discomfort score with SP-PPL was significantly higher than LP-PTFE at 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.003 in both cases). LP-PTFE showed significantly lower median score than SP-PPL at 7 days after surgery (p = 0.025) regarding pain at movement. Testicular pain was lower in case of LP-PTFE than SP-PPL at 7 days, 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.005, p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively). LP-PTFE was significantly more difficult to handle (p = 0.001). At 60 months, one recurrence was observed in the LP-PTFE group (p = 1.0000). CONCLUSIONS LP-PTFE has less postoperative discomfort and pain up to 3 months after surgery, without differences after that period, although it shows more difficulty in handling and recurrences occur even if not statistically significant.

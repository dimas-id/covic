We evaluated the mental health burden of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on physical therapists, including their stress and anxiety levels, who were at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. A questionnaire survey was conducted with physical therapists of three university hospitals in South Korea on 10 April 2020. The questionnaires evaluated the presence of anxiety and depression in the respondents. Among the 65 physical therapists who completed our survey, 21 (32.3%) and 12 (18.5%) physical therapists reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. If a physical therapist was living with a &#8804;6-year-old infant or child, the possibility of the presence of anxiety was significantly higher. The risk of depression among those who were in their 30 s and 50 s was significantly higher than among those in their 20 s. Thus, physical therapists living with a &#8804;6-year-old infant or child and those in their 30 s and 50 s need special attention.

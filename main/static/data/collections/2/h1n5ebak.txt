OBJECTIVE To report a single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) for a patient with cholecystitis that required endoscopic nasogallbladder drainage (ENGBD). CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION A 75-year-old man was diagnosed with moderate acute cholecystitis and underwent antiplatelet therapy for a history of brain infarction. An ENGBD was performed as an initial treatment for his cholecystitis. After recovery from the cholecystitis, a SILC was performed using a SILS Port with an additional forceps. Because neither Rouviere's sulcus nor Calot's triangle could be identified with a favorable laparoscopic view, the fundus-first procedure was selected. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 3 after surgery. CONCLUSION In this case of a patient who had cholecystitis that required ENGBD, a SILC was successful performed using a combination of SILS Port with additional forceps and fundus-first procedure.

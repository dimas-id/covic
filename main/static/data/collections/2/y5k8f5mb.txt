Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by a protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani mainly influencing the population of tropical and subtropical regions across the globe. The arsenal of drugs available is limited, and prolonged use of such drugs makes parasite to become resistant. Therefore, it is very imperative to develop a safe, cost-effective and inexpensive vaccine against VL. Although in recent years many strategies have been pursued by researchers, but so far only some of the vaccine candidates reached for clinical trial and more than half of them are still in pipeline. There is now a broad consent among Leishmania researchers that the perseverance of parasite is very essential for eliciting a protective immune response and may perhaps be attained by live attenuated parasite vaccination. For making a live attenuated parasite it is very essential to ensure that the parasite is deficient of virulence and should further study genetically modified parasites to perceive the mechanism of pathogenesis. So it is believed that in the near future, a complete understanding of the Leishmania genome will explore clear strategies to discover a novel vaccine. This review describes the need for a genetically modified live attenuated vaccine against VL, and obstacles associated with its development.

BACKGROUND This article reported the experience of endovascular treatment in giant middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms with parent artery occlusion or stent-assisted coiling. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eleven consecutive patients with giant MCA aneurysms were included. The aneurysms predominantly involved the M1 segment in two cases, bifurcation in four cases, and M2 in five cases. Four M2 fusiform aneurysms were treated with parent artery sacrifice after balloon occlusion test. The seven unruptured aneurysms and one ruptured one were treated with stent-assisted coiling. The post-operation and long-term follow-up angiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Endovascular coiling was performed successfully in all 11 cases. All four M2 fusiform cases using parent artery occlusion strategy achieved complete occlusion of aneurysms. In the seven cases with stent-assisted coiling, four were completely occluded, two were partially occluded and one remained small residue. Mild perioperative complications occurred in six patients. The follow-up angiography taken at a mean of 13.5 months of eight patients showed that seven aneurysms remained stable or improved and one M1 aneurysms relapsed and needed further treatment. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling or parent artery occlusion of selected giant MCA aneurysms is an option to consider.

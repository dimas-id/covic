Treatment of an enterocutaneous fistula is complex and may require multidisciplinary management, especially when associated with a neoplastic process. Here, we describe the case of a 59-year-old patient with a squamous cell carcinoma that had invaded the abdominal wall through a chronic enterocutaneous fistula identified 30 years ago. We combined parietectomy with small intestine and colon resection and inguinal lymphadenectomy in order to obtain clear surgical margins. At the same time, plastic surgery involved the implementation of a large bioprosthesis and coverage with a vastus lateralis muscle free flap.

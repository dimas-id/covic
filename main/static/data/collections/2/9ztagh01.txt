Abstract Pandemic virus infections, such as seasonal influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, pose a major public health threat globally. 1 , 2 Much effort has been devoted to suppress the virus, including vaccine prevention, autoimmunity enhancement, and anti-virus drugs treatment. Among these strategies, development of novel and improved vaccine technologies attracts broad attention as they can nip the virus outbreak in the bud and avoid the appearance of public health emergency. Therefore, Wang et al. 1 recently offer a promising means: they develop universal viral vaccine through biomimetic nanoparticles.

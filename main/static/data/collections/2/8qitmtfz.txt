We present the case of a six-year-old girl with severe COVID-19, in whom SARS-CoV-2 was successfully eliminated after convalescent plasma transfusion. Children show a variable clinical course of COVID-19, from asymptomatic to critical. In our patient, we diagnosed COVID-19-associated aplastic anemia with severe pancytopenia. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection with aplastic anemia remains unclear. At the beginning of the disease, we used antiviral drugs and immune modulators as therapy but without any positive results. After providing a transfusion of convalescent plasma, the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 was observed. We did not observe any adverse events of this treatment. The girl still has a diagnosis of aplastic anemia and requires specialist therapy.

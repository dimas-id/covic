Infectious diseases of humans continue to present a significant burden to our health, disproportionately so in the developing world. Infectious diseases of livestock affect their health and welfare, are themselves important causes of human disease and, exceptionally, can threaten our food security. Wildlife infections again present a zoonotic risk to humans, but additionally, such diseases may threaten vulnerable populations and be a cause of extinction and biodiversity loss. Wild populations are inherently more susceptible to environmental change, largely lacking any human protective influence that domesticated species and human populations may benefit from.

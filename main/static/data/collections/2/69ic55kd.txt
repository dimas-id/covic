BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has required a rapid and evolving response in order to enable the continued delivery of radiotherapy, whilst effectively managing the risk of infection to patients and staff. In early March 2020, we were presented with the challenge of achieving safe delivery of care in clinical practice for a group of patients that are already at higher risk of morbidity from COVID-19 with only limited guidance. PURPOSE: This article outlines the adjustments made at The Christie at Oldham satellite centre in order to promote optimal care to our patients receiving radiotherapy, and to mitigate infection risk at the department for both patients and staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We share insight into some of the evolving processes that our team have developed since March 2020 in promoting optimal care to patients receiving radiotherapy at The Christie at Oldham satellite centre. These include changes to the department floor, paper flow, supportive care and staffing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As we continue to progress through this pandemic, we accept that there will be an ongoing journey of learning with adjustments to practice and evolving ‘new norm’, thereby ensuring we keep our patients and team safe and well. We also hoped that our experience would support radiotherapy-related practices in surges of the pandemic in other parts of the world or in case of the second wave.

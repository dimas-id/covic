The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound guidance for excision of symptomatic deep intramural myomas that are not otherwise visible at laparoscopy. Seventeen patients with symptomatic deep intramural myomas who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound guidance were followed up and reported. All myomas were removed successfully. The endometrium was breached in one patient. All patients were relieved of their symptoms and three patients presenting with infertility conceived. There were no short- or long-term complications associated with the procedure. One patient who had multiple myomas necessitated intravenous iron treatment prior to discharge. Laparoscopic removal of small symptomatic deep intramural myomas is facilitated by the use of intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound that enables exact localisation and correct placement of the serosal incision. Impact statement What is already known on this subject: When the myoma is symptomatic, compressing the endometrium, does not show serosal protrusion and is not amenable to hysteroscopic resection, laparoscopic surgery may become challenging. What do the results of this study add: The use of intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound under these circumstances may facilitate the procedure by accurate identification of the myoma and correct placement of the serosal incision. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: Intraoperative ultrasound should be more oftenly used to accurately locate deep intramural myomas to the end of making laparoscopy feasible and possibly decreasing recurrence by facilitating removal of otherwise unidentifiable disease.

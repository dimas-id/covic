OBJECTIVES As periodontal disease preponderates in adults, early detection and interventional regime is urgently needed. However, there is lack of evidence-based data on evaluation of population-based intervention programme related to periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of intervention regime on early periodontal disease identified from a community-based periodontal survey. METHOD By randomization, 60 subjects were allocated to the intervention group and 49 to the control group respectively. Status on periodontal disease of participants was evaluated at entry and re-evaluated after intervention at 1-month and 18-month follow-up respectively. Primary outcome evaluated was based on Community Periodontal Index and Loss of Attachment on sextant level. RESULTS The efficacy of intervention was significant in Community Periodontal Index (P<0.001) but not in Loss of Attachment (P=0.53) at 1-month and 18-month follow-up. CONCLUSION The improvement of periodontal disease owing to intervention regime was seen in Community Periodontal Index but not Loss of Attachment as yet at 18-month follow-up after intervention.

Little is known about the neutralizing epitopes in turkey coronavirus (TCoV). The spike (S) protein gene of TCoV was divided into 10 fragments to identify the antigenic region containing neutralizing epitopes. The expression and antigenicity of S fragments was confirmed by immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay using an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody or anti-TCoV serum. Polyclonal antibodies raised against expressed S1 (amino acid position 1 to 573 from start codon of S protein), 4F/4R (482-678), 6F/6R (830-1071), or Mod4F/Epi4R (476-520) S fragment recognized native S1 protein and TCoV in the intestines of TCoV-infected turkey embryos. Anti-TCoV serum reacted with recombinant 4F/4R, 6F/6R, and Mod4F/Epi4R in a western blot. The results of a virus neutralization assay indicated that the carboxyl terminal region of the S1 protein (Mod4F/Epi4R) or the combined carboxyl terminal S1 and amino terminal S2 protein (4F/4R) possesses the neutralizing epitopes, while the S2 fragment (6F/6R) contains antigenic epitopes but not neutralizing epitopes.

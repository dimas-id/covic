INTRODUCTION Carotid sacrifice is a valuable tool in the treatment of select vascular lesions. Traditional coil embolization as the primary means of carotid sacrifice can be expensive, with high radiation exposure. We investigated the feasibility of a novel hybrid coil, the Penumbra occlusion device (POD), for carotid sacrifice in a swine model. METHODS A total of eight common carotid artery sacrifices were performed in fully heparinized pigs under fluoroscopic guidance. A single POD device was deployed within each vessel, and intermittent follow-up angiography was performed to assess flow. RESULTS Complete carotid occlusion was achieved in all cases with a single POD (time range 2-15 min) without any coil migration or intraprocedural complications. Once the anchor zone was stable, no distal migrations were observed during either proximal soft coil packing or during hand injected angiography. Complete occlusion was verified between 2 and 15 min following POD deployment. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery sacrifice using a novel POD device is safe and effective, allowing for reduced radiation and material costs compared with any other described endovascular technique.

The present study reports the synthesis, characterization, and crystal structure of a novel bioactive metal-organic framework, [Ag(4)(µ-PTA)(2)(µ(3)-PTA)(2)(µ(4)-pma)(H(2)O)(2)](n)·6nH(2)O (bioMOF 1), which was assembled from silver(I) oxide, 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA), and pyromellitic acid (H(4)pma). This product was isolated as a stable microcrystalline solid and characterized by standard methods, including elemental analysis, (1)H and (31)P{(1)H} NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure of 1 disclosed a very complex ribbon-pillared 3D metal-organic framework driven by three different types of bridging ligands (µ-PTA, µ(3)-PTA, and µ(4)-pma(4−)). Various bioactivity characteristics of bioMOF 1 were investigated, revealing that this compound acts as a potent antimicrobial against pathogenic strains of standard Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria, as well as a yeast (Candida albicans). Further, 1 showed significant antiviral activity against human adenovirus 36 (HAdV-36). Finally, bioMOF 1 revealed high cytotoxicity toward an abnormal epithelioid cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cell line with low toxicity toward a normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cell line. This study not only broadens the family of PTA-based coordination polymers but also highlights their promising multifaceted bioactivity.

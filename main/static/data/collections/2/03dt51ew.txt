we read with interest the editorial by Prof. Ioannidis [1], expressing concern on the exaggerated information regarding the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 [2]. Certainly, Clinicians worldwide are facing new and enormous challenges when considering patients with suspected COVID-19; unfortunately, while the situation in China and Eastern Asia has shown a reduction in the number of new diagnosis in the last couple of weeks, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Europe, and in particular in Italy, has seen a dramatic increase, with more than 160'000 cases and '20'000 deaths as of April 14, 2020 [3]. Even in this pandemic phase, however, it should not be forgotten that the diagnosis of COVID-19 does not imply the exclusion of other concomitant diseases.

ABSTRACT The outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a major health hazard across the globe. The rapid escalation of the COVID-19 and the considerable associated illness leading to death has transformed it into a critical global public health issue. The current clinical investigation in patients with COVID-19 has showed strong upregulation of cytokine and interferon production after critical infection with SARS-CoV2- induced pneumonia. The current research suggests that few groups of patients with COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome. Thus, identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality. To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been discovered to treat this COVID-19. Intensive research is in progress to identify a promising drug therapy. Hence, several options were proposed to control this fast-emerging pandemic, including antiviral drugs, vaccines, small-molecules, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotides, peptides, and interferons (IFNs).

We consider a population evolving due to mutation, selection, genetic drift and recombination, where selection is only two-loci terms (pairwise epistatic fitness). We further consider the problem of inferring fitness in the evolutionary dynamics from one or several snap-shots of the distribution of genotypes in the population. We show that this is possible using a recently developed theory that relates parameters of such a distribution to parameters of the evolutionary dynamics. This extends classical results on the Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) regime first obtained by Kimura, and more recently studied by Neher and Shraiman. In particular, the new theory outperforms the Kimura-Neher-Shraiman theory in the interesting regime where the effects of mutations are comparable to or larger than recombination. Additionally, it can work when recombination is absent. The findings are validated through numerical simulations.

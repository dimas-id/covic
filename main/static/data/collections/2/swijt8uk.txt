Bacterial infections are currently a major concern to human health. Amino acid-based supramolecular polymer hydrogels, which boast intrinsic antibacterial activity, are an important solution due to their good biocompatibility, cost effectiveness, and tunable structural properties. Herein, we reported three types of transparent supramolecular hydrogel with intrinsic antibacterial activity from self-assembly of commercially available Fmoc-tryptophan (Fmoc-W), Fmoc-methionine (Fmoc-M), and Fmoc-tyrosine (Fmoc-Y). The resulting hydrogels selectively inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the order of antibacterial activity was Fmoc-W hydrogel > Fmoc-M hydrogel > Fmoc-Y hydrogel. The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) values were found at concentrations of approximately 0.0293, 0.1172, and 0.4688 mM for Fmoc-W, Fmoc-M, and Fmoc-Y, respectively. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images revealed rigid and aligned nanofibers for Fmoc-W hydrogel, while flexible nanofibers for Fmoc-M hydrogel and Fmoc-Y hydrogel. The results indicated that stronger aggregation capability of the gelator and the synergistic nanostructural morphology with more rigid and aligned nanofibers can lead to higher antibacterial activity of its corresponding hydrogel. In addition, the molecular arrangements of Fmoc-amino acids in the hydrogels may also contribute to their antibacterial activity. These results can guide the rational design, fabrication, and future application of other self-assembled amino acid-based hydrogels with excellent antibacterial activity.

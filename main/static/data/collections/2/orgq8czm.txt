The 3D block matching (BM3D) method is among the state-of-art methods for denoising images corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise. With the help of a novel inter-frame connectivity strategy, we propose an extension of the BM3D method for the scenario where we have multiple images of the same scene. Our proposed extension outperforms all the existing trivial and non-trivial extensions of patch-based denoising methods for multi-frame images. We can achieve a quality difference of as high as 28% over the next best method without using any additional parameters. Our method can also be easily generalised to other similar existing patch-based methods.

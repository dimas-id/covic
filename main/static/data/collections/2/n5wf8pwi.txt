Abstract This chapter discusses the likely future of bioweapons development and the research that is needed to counter them. Methods for creating customized pathogens that can evade an immune system or work around a conventional antibiotic are discussed. In addition, emerging trends in synthetic biology are discussed. Biological warfare and bioterrorism are multifaceted problems requiring multifaceted solutions. Fortunately, the same advances in genomic biotechnologies that can be used to create bioweapons can also be used to set up countermeasures against them. We currently have in place sophisticated and well-developed biosecurity and biodefense programs. These programs are essential to countering the asymmetric warfare threat, but they are costly and perishable. Future directions in biosecurity and biodefense may very well be determined by the “next event.” However, the most likely events are those that naturally and accidentally threaten human and animal health through the emergence of novel pathogens and the reemergence of others in light of new environmental or societal factors.

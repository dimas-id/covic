This paper introduces a novel definition, called representative set of objects of a decision class, in the framework of decision systems based on rough sets. The idea behind such a notion is to consider subsets of objects that characterize the different classes given by a decision system. Besides the formal definition of representative set of objects of a decision class, we present different mathematical properties of such sets and a relationship with classification tasks based on rough sets.

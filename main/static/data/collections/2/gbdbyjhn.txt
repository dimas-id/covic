Replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus vectors are emerging as a promising new class of genetic vaccine carriers. Chimpanzee adenovirus vectors have now reached the clinical stage and appear to be endowed with all the properties needed for human vaccine development, including high quality and magnitude of the immune response induced against the encoded antigens, good safety and ease of manufacturing on a large-scale basis. Here the authors review the recent findings of this novel class of adenovirus vectors and compare their properties to other clinical stage vaccine vectors derived from poxvirus, alphavirus and human adenovirus.

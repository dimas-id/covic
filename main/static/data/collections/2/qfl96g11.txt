Arytenoid cartilage dislocation is not a common complication, but its delayed diagnosis reduces the therapeutic effect of treatment. A male patient underwent reversed total shoulder replacement surgery in the beach chair position under general anesthesia. The patient experienced postoperative hoarseness, and it was revealed that he had right arytenoid dislocation. Voice restoration was accomplished with closed reduction. We discussed changes in patient position during the operation and how they may contribute to the arytenoid dislocation. Flexion and a slight rotation of the neck during the operation can lead to an increase in intracuff pressure of the endotracheal tube. It is necessary to check neck position and monitor intracuff pressure in patients undergoing operations in the beach chair position. Also, the anesthesiologist should suspect arytenoid dislocation in the case of persistent hoarseness after surgery in the beach chair position.

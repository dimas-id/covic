We give a significantly simplified proof of the exponential separation between regular and general resolution of Alekhnovich et al. (2007) as a consequence of a general theorem lifting proof depth to regular proof length in resolution. This simpler proof then allows us to strengthen the separation further, and to construct families of theoretically very easy benchmarks that are surprisingly hard for SAT solvers in practice.

This brief communication describes the diagnosis and surgical treatment of bilateral perineal hernias in a 1-yr-old, intact female, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) that was evaluated for chronic intermittent constipation, following early age, bilateral anal sacculectomy for descenting. Complete blood count and biochemistry results were within the reference ranges. Diagnosis was based on history, physical exam, clinical signs, and diagnostic imaging. A two-stage surgical approach for treatment was performed. First, colopexy and cystopexy were performed via celiotomy, which was followed by unilateral perineal herniorrhaphy by using an internal obturator muscle flap augmented with porcine small intestinal submucosa biomaterial. Long-term resolution of clinical signs was achieved without evidence of recurrence. This is the first description of bilateral perineal hernia in a skunk following routine anal sacculectomy for descenting.

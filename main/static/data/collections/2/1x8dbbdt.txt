In this study, an integrated system of siphon-driven self-agitated anaerobic reactor (SDSAR) and anaerobic fixed bed reactor (AFBR) was conducted for the treatment of wastewater from food waste disposer (FWD), and the effect of influent total solids (TS) concentration on the process performance was evaluated. When the influent TS concentration increased from 7.04 to 15.5 g/L, the methane gas production rate increased from 0.45 to 0.92 L-CH4/L/day. However, with the influent TS concentration of food waste (FW) further increased to 23.5 g/L, a large amount of scum formed and accumulated in the SDSAR. According to the result of chemical oxygen demand (COD) recovery, the proportion of COD remained in the effluent at different TS concentrations was only around 2%. On the other hand, with an increase in TS concentration, the proportion of COD remained in the reactors increased significantly. Our results demonstrated that effluent from the integrated system can meet the water quality requirements recommended by Japan Sewage Works Association (JSWA) for wastewater from FWD. In addition, to enhance the process stability, the influent TS concentration should be maintained below 15.5 g/L.

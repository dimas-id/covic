This study examines the influence of building envelope features on interunit dispersion around multi-story buildings, when the presence of an upstream interfering building is also considered. Validated CFD methods in the steady-state RANS framework are employed. In general, the reentry ratios of pollutant from a source unit to adjacent units are mostly in the order of 0.1%, but there are still many cases being in the order of 1%. The influence of envelope features is dependent strongly on the interaction between local wind direction and envelope feature. In a downward dominated near-facade flow field, the presence of vertical envelope features forms dispersion channels to intensify the unidirectional spread. Horizontal envelope features help induce the dilution of pollutant to the main stream and weakens largely the vertical interunit dispersion. The large influences caused by the presence of envelope features extend the existing understanding of interunit dispersion based on flat-facade buildings.

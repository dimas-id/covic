The Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing how we deliver expert palliative care. We can expect many to die prematurely secondary to COVID-19 across the United States. We present a case of how several hospital systems-based interventions, intended to slow viral spread and to protect health care workers, have inadvertently created barriers to routine palliative interventions in this patient population. Isolation of patients, limitation of visitors and interdisciplinary support, and changes in nursing and provider assessment have all had their impact on how we deliver palliative care. These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring. These challenges required real-time solutions such as technology utilization, proposing a change in medical delivery systems, and reducing redundancy to preserve personal protective equipment. To continue to deliver quality care for this patient population, palliative medicine must adapt quickly.

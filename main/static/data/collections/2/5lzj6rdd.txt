Improvement in survival rates of low birth-weight infants particularly in the neonatal intensive care units of India appears to be accompanied by frequent recognition of Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among early survivors. As the philosophy and practice of advanced care for tiny infants becomes more acceptable and affordable in the country, a steady increase in survival of such infants is predictable. However there is growing concern in India that NEC could become a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the future. NEC is currently regarded as the most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency in the newborn period, and the outcome of this disease is universally poor. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of this condition is required for formulating optimal principles of prevention and management.

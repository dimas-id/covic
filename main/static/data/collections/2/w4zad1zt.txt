An increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) infected with 2019-nCoV have been identified in Wuhan and other cities in China, since December 2019. We analyzed data on the 17 confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably, all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal computed tomography images. This study provided some information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of 2019-nCoV may contributed to faster recovery and better therapeutic outcome.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus, has spread worldwide causing high fatality rates. Neither a vaccine nor specific therapeutic approaches are available, hindering the fight against this disease and making better understanding of its pathogenesis essential. Despite similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the former has unique characteristics which represent a great challenge to physicians. The mechanism of COVID-19 infection and pathogenesis is still poorly understood. In the present review, we highlight possible pathways involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, focusing on the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

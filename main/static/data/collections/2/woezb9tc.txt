Female sexual dysfunction or dissatisfaction is a common complaint among obstetric-gynecology patients. These complaints may result from medical treatments and procedures, or may secondarily complicate the management and patient compliance of treatment for other medical issues. Therefore, it is important that clinicians treating females obtain basic information regarding human sexual function and dysfunction. This chapter presents an integration of the clinical research as well as the authorâ€™s experience regarding sexual function and the management of sexual problems often presented in an obstetricgynecology practice.

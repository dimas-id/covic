BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic surgery can be performed via one incision hidden in the umbilicus. Herein, we report a patient with a sigmoid colon cancer undergoing single-port laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. METHODS Laparoscopic single-port sigmoid colectomy through a 3-cm umbilical incision was performed on a patient with a diagnosis of sigmoid cancer. Patient was 54-year-old female with a body mass index of 25.8 kg/m(2). Preoperatively, a CAT scan in the metastasis evaluation did not show any lesion. RESULTS The total operative time was 198 min. Estimated blood loss was 300 ml. Length of hospital stay was 3 days. Patient had no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Examination of pathological specimen showed a specimen containing a circumferential lesion measuring 5 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm with adequate surgical margins (10 and 5.5 cm), and no regional lymph node metastases in 14 lymph nodes collected. Patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Colonoscopy performed 1 year after surgery showed no neoplasm or polyp identified. Abdomen and pelvis CT also found no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery may allow common benign procedures via an incision in the umbilicus. It can also be performed with good surgical and oncologic results in selected patients with a colorectal cancer.

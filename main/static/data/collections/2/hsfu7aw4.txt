We illustrate and study the evolution of reported infections over the month from March 1st to April 1st in the New York State as a whole, as well as in each individual county. We search for exponential trends, and try to understand whether there is any correlation of the timing and dynamics of these trends with state mandated measures on social distancing and testing. We conclude that the reports on April 1st may be dramatically under-representing the actual number of state-wide infections, and we propose reassessment of the data over the coming weeks, to monitor for effects of the PAUSE directive, and for the increasing number of casualties as a validating measure.

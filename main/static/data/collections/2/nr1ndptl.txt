BACKGROUND Red blood cell transfusions have been widely associated with the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) especially prior to 1985 when testing for HIV was not available. Currently the blood supply is much safer because of very sensitive testing for HIV as well as hepatitis C. However, new infectious agents emerge constantly and pose a threat to our blood supply. Current and potential threats are reviewed in this manuscript. METHODS Review of pertinent English language literature. RESULTS Transmission of infectious agents from blood transfusion is rare. Protozoans pose one the greatest threats because there are no assays available that can reliably detect their presence and because of worldwide travel. Viruses potentially pose a significant threat to the blood supply. The West Nile virus has recently been transmitted by a blood transfusion that was negative by assay for WNV. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) poses a threat to the blood supply but has never been transmitted in a transfusion. Prions also have been transmitted by a blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS Several infectious agents pose potential threats. The current risk of a blood transfusion is very low but the potential threat is ever present.

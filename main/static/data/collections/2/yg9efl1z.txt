INTRODUCTION The authors compared the oncologic outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RPN) for the treatment of T1 stage renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective data analysis of a high-volume single tertiary centre. Patients were treated with RFA or RPN following multidisciplinary decision making. Only histologically proven RCCs were included. Baseline demographics were collected, and PADUA scores of tumour features were calculated to standardize baseline anatomy. Peri-operative complications, kidney function and oncological outcomes were compared. RESULTS Sixty-three cases were included in each group. Baseline renal function was poorer in RFA, and 16/63 RFA patients had tumours in single kidneys compared to 1/63 RPN cases (p < 0.001). Length of stay was shorter in RFA (1 vs. 3 days, p < 0.0001). Post-procedure renal function decline at 30 days was significantly less in RFA [(-0.8) ± 9.6 vs. (-16.1) ± 19.5 mls/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.0001]. More minor complications were recorded in RPN (10/63 vs. 4/63, p = 0.15), but local recurrence was numerically higher in RFA (6/63 vs. 1/63, p = 0.11). Disease-free survival (DFS) was not significantly different (adjusted HR = 0.6, 95 % Cl 0.1-3.7; p = 0.60). Increasing tumour size was an independent predictor of local recurrence (adjusted HR = 1.7; 95 % Cl 1.1-2.6 per cm; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Both RPN and RFA offer very good oncological outcomes for the treatment of T1 RCC with low peri-operative morbidity and similar oncologic outcomes. RFA demonstrated fewer peri-operative complications and better preservation of renal function, whereas RPN had an insignificantly lower local recurrence rate. RFA should be offered alongside RPN for selected cases.

Two enteroviruses, designated W1 and W6, were isolated from intestinal contents of Australian brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand. The genomic sequences of W1 and W6 were 7390 and 7391 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Genetically, possum isolates W1 and W6 were related to bovine enterovirus serotype 2 (BEV-2) strains, especially to the strain PS87/Belfast, based on the capsid protein sequence. However, W1 and W6 formed a clade that was distinct from PS87Belfast based on nucleotide sequences of the 3′ and 5′-non-translated region and in the amino acid sequences of 2A, 3C and 3D. Possum isolates W1 and W6 grew more readily in possum kidney cells than in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, suggesting that co-evolution of W1 and W6 with possums has made them more adapted to possum cells.

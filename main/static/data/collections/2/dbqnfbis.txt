BACKGROUND Surgical stress index (SSI) is an established indicator for intraoperative nociception. Opioids are used to block stimulus of cranial pinning in neurosurgery. We investigated the effect of different infusion rates of sufentanil on SSI during cranial pinning in children under general anaesthesia. METHODS Forty-nine children (2-12 years of age) underwent neurosurgery with pinning. The children were randomized into three groups based on the rate of sufentanil infusion: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 μg·kg-1·hr.-1. Continuous sufentanil infusion began following neuromuscular blockade administration, at a rate determined by each patient's assigned treatment group. Following preparation for surgery, cranial pinning was performed. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, along with heart rate and photoplethysmographic data, were continuously recorded from 1 min prior to cranial pinning through 5 min after cranial pinning, in 1-min intervals. SSI was calculated following the completion of surgery. Differences in measured outcomes over time among the three groups were evaluated using a generalized estimation equation. Differences in pinning outcomes in the same group were evaluated with Freidman test. RESULTS We found no statistical differences in long-term SSI that were associated with different infusion rates of sufentanil during cranial pinning. Blood pressures in all groups increased for 2 min after cranial pinning, and then decreased; we found no statistical difference in long-term blood pressure values among the groups. Heart rate increased after pinning in the group that received a low-dose infusion of sufentanil. CONCLUSIONS Since SSI was intended to measure the blunting effects of sufentanil towards the noxious stimulus of cranial pinning, our results suggest that SSI might not be sufficiently sensitive to monitor the nociceptive response in children.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGBP) is a novel bariatric procedure which is restrictive and reversible. The aim of this study were to compare two LAGBP techniques and analyze its postoperative outcomes, in order to standardize the procedure. METHODS Eighty patients who underwent LAGBP were enrolled in this study. Forty patients who underwent LAGBP (group 1) from December 2011 to June 2012 were compared with 40 patients (group 2) who underwent a modified LAGBP technique, which included preserving the right gastroepiploic vessels and uniform plication volume between July 2012 and January 2013. Relevant patient's data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Both groups were similar in age, gender, preoperative body mass index (BMI), and hospital stay. The median total operative time was shorter in group 2 (100.5 min; range 41-189) compared to group 1 (124 min; range 63-192), p = 0.048. There were two major complications involving gastric fold herniation (GFH) in group 1, while none was seen in group 2, p = 0.07. The minor complications encountered in both groups were similar, p = 0.37. At 6-month follow-up, there was no difference in mean frequency of band adjustments, weight, and BMI reduction in both groups. No mortality was seen in our series. CONCLUSIONS A standardized LAGBP procedure which includes uniform plication volume and preservation of right gastroepiploic vessels could potentially avoid early GFH. However, larger comparative studies with longer follow-up would be needed to evaluate the late outcomes of this procedure and its efficacy in weight loss.

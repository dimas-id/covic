Residency education has been disrupted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. Programs in pandemic status, as designated by the "Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in the US, have substantially modified or suspended traditional educational activities to adhere to physical distancing practices and allow residents to focus on patient care. This lapse in educational events is especially challenging now, as residents and other healthcare professionals are facing a previously undocumented illness and must stay current with the deluge of new information on the disease. Hence, there is a need for simple, digestible, up‐to‐date, and accurate information on COVID‐19 that is electronically disseminated and easy to obtain.

Pathogens have presented a major challenge to individuals and populations of living organisms, probably as long as there has been life on earth. They are a prime object of study for at least three reasons: (1) Understanding the way of pathogens affords the basis for preventing and treating the diseases they cause. (2) The interactions of pathogens with their hosts afford valuable insights into the working of the hosts’ cells, in general, and of the host’s immune system, in particular. (3) The co-evolution of pathogens and their hosts allows for transferring knowledge across the two interacting species and affords valuable insights into how evolution works, in general. In the past decade computational biology has started to contribute to the understanding of host-pathogen interaction in at least three ways which are summarized in the subsequent sections of this chapter.

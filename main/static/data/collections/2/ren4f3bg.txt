BACKGROUND Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was introduced into Australia in 1997 by this unit. However, some donors may be considered unsuitable, and few modifications to the existing technique can tailor this procedure for an individual donor. Recently, further changes including clustering of ports and single-port methods have been investigated. METHODS The laparoscopic method was offered to all but 3 donors from May 1997 to October 2009. Data were collected on all 289 donors who underwent laparoscopic procedures. RESULTS All but 5 donor procedures were completed laparoscopically, and in 4 of them conversion to open was necessary due to hemorrhage. The fifth was a planned conversion in our first right LDN. Delayed graft function was seen in 7 recipients and 5 required dialysis postoperatively. Two kidneys were lost due to arterial thrombosis, and 5 patients underwent segmental infarction with decreased renal function. Mean hospital stay was 2.35Â±1.67 days. There were no donor deaths or serious morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Although the benefits to the donor of the laparoscopic method are well recognized, our modifications will benefit those who may be precluded from this method.

[Image: see text] A series of novel mono- and binuclear arene–ruthenium(II) complexes [(p-cym)Ru(L)Cl] containing 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one derivatives or tryptanthrin-6-oxime were synthesized and characterized by X-ray crystallography, IR, NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and elemental analysis. Theoretical calculations invoking singlet state geometry optimization, solvation effects, and noncovalent interactions were done using density functional theory (DFT). DFT calculations were also applied to evaluate the electronic properties, and time-dependent DFT was applied to clarify experimental UV–vis results. Cytotoxicity for cancerous and noncancerous human cell lines was evaluated with cell viability MTT assay. Complexes demonstrated a moderate cytotoxic effect toward cancerous human cell line PANC-1. The catalytic activity of the complexes was evaluated in transfer hydrogenation of aryl ketones. All complexes exhibited good catalytic activity and functional group tolerance.

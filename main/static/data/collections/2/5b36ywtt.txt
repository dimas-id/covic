The majority of infections initiate their departure from a mucosal surface, such as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a sexually transmitted virus. Therefore, the induction of mucosal immunity is a high priority in the development of vaccines against mucosal pathogens. The selection of an appropriate antigen delivery system is necessary to induce an efficient mucosal immune response. Poxvirus vectors have been the most intensively studied live recombinant vector, and numerous studies have demonstrated their ability to induce mucosal immune responses against foreign expressed antigens. Previous studies have demonstrated that recombinants based on the attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector were effective in inducing protective responses against different respiratory viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, following immunization via mucosal routes. Recent studies performed in the murine and macaque models have shown that recombinant MVA (rMVA) does not only stimulate HIV-specific immunity in the genital and rectal tracts following mucosal delivery, but can also control simian/human immunodeficiency viraemia and disease progression. In addition, a prime-boost vaccination approach against tuberculosis emphasized the importance of the intranasal rMVA antigen delivery to induce protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of this review is to summarize the studies employing recombinant poxviruses, specifically rMVA as a mucosal delivery vector. The results demonstrate that rMVAs can activate specific immune responses at mucosal surfaces, and encourage further studies to characterize and improve the MVA mucosal immunogenicity of poxvirus vectors.

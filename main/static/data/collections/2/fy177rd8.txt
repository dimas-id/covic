We identified porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in stool samples from sick piglets in the Belgorod region of Russia. The complete coding genome sequence of 28,295 nucleotides (nt) of PEDV was generated. Compared to a prototype PEDV strain (DR13), an extreme number of mismatches in the S gene were revealed.

Photofunctionalization of implant materials with ultraviolet radiation (UV) have been subject of study in the last two decades, and previous research on CoCrMo discs have showed good results in terms of bioactivity and the findings of apatite-like crystals in vitro. In the current study, CoCrMo domes were photofunctionalized with UV radiation of 254 nm on their internal faces during 24 hours; they were implanted in rabbit tibia and remained for 3, 4 and 6 weeks. The potential to induce bone formation beneath the dome-shaped membranes was evaluated through morphometric, histologic and density measurements; and the results were compared with those obtained under control untreated domes. Higher density values were observed for irradiated domes at 3 weeks, while higher volumes were obtained under photofunctionalized domes for longer periods (4 and 6 weeks). Histologically, woven bone was formed by endochondral ossification in all cases; differences in the architecture and size of the trabeculae and in the number of osteoblasts were noted between irradiated and non-irradiated samples. The UV radiation of 254 nm generated a larger bone volume fraction compared to that found in the absence of UVC radiation, and induced an increase of density in the early stages of healing, leading to a better initial bone quality and improved osseointegration.

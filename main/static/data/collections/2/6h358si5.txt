Summary The harrowing picture of emaciated terminally ill AIDS patients is a reminder of our lack of understanding of immunological mechanisms that normally control opportunistic infections.

Although knowledge of the pathogenesis and clinical significance of weight loss has improved considerably, this has not yet led to a sustained effort to improve nutritional status during early stages of disease.

[Image: see text] The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is posing serious global public health problems. Facing the emergence of this pandemic, we established a portable microfluidic immunoassay system for easy-to-use, sensitive, rapid (<15 min), multiple, and on-site detection of IgG/IgM/Antigen of SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously. This integrated method was successfully applied for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in clinical human serum as well as SARS-CoV-2 antigen in pharyngeal swabs from 26 patients with COVID-19 infection and 28 uninfected people. The assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, which is promising for the diagnosis and monitoring as well as control of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.

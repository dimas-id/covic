PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To briefly review epidemiology and pathophysiology of SICM and provide a more extensive review of the data on diagnostic and management strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: SICM is likely underdiagnosed and that has mortality implications. Current evidence supports speckle tracking echocardiography to identify decreased contractility irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction for the diagnosis of SICM. There continues to be a dearth of large clinical trials evaluating the treatment of SICM and current consensus focuses on supportive measures such as vasopressors and inotropes. SUMMARY: Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality, and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy has both prognostic and management implications for these patients. Individualized work-up and management of these patients is crucial to improving outcomes.

Vaccination represents one of the major advances in the field of health. The first vaccines were produced on a rather empirical concept based on the so-called 3I strategy: isolation, inactivation, injection. More recently, protein vaccines have emerged. However, the emergence of new pathogens, the inefficiency of these vaccine strategies to protect against several infections, the need to be able to develop new vaccines quickly and at low cost have led to the development of new types of vaccines. In this context vaccines based on the use of the nucleic acid coding sequences of the antigens of interest (viral vectors, DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines) have been developed in order to improve the efficiency of the currently available vaccines and to propose generic platforms potentially usable against a large number of different pathogens. In addition to the use of these new vaccines, ongoing vaccine research is benefiting from technological developments aimed at optimally delivering vaccines, targeting, for example, dendritic cells, and better characterizing the antigens of interest through the use of vaccines of reverse vaccinology.

Terrorist attacks of November 13, 2015 resulted in a massive rallying in hospitals. The Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital group, particularly involved in the nursing of victims, activated its “Plan Blanc” during that tragic night and applied all previously set principles to provide logistical support to the medical care. The crisis unit gathered around the managing director of the establishment managed this implementation in various dimensions: human resources mobilization, activation of all necessary support functions (security of the site, supply of provisions, opening of reception areas for families and staff) and finally, the management of families. Retrospectively, this implementation was globally in accordance with the pre-established dispositions and efficient in terms of support to the emergency medical activity. However, it suggests a critical analysis of weak points in order to improve the procedures of the “Plan Blanc” in a particularly risky current context, as we know.

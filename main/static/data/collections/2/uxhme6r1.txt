Emerging technologies are set to play an important role in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper explores three prominent initiatives: COVID-19 focused datasets (e.g., CORD-19); Artificial intelligence-powered search tools (e.g., WellAI, SciSight); and contact tracing based on mobile communication technology. We believe that increasing awareness of these tools will be important in future research into the disease, COVID-19, and the virus, SARS-CoV-2.

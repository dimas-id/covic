This chapter discusses the zinc-containing metalloendoproteinases. These enzymes remodel the stroma during development and around tissues that have been injured or stressed. Section 1 describes the three major classes of metalloproteases, their metal ion cofactors, their functions in biology, and the metzincin catalytic mechanism in procollagen and stromal protein processing. Section 2 describes the astacin and adamalysin metzincin subclasses and how they process procollagen to tropocollagen. Section 3 describes the matrilysin metzincin subclass and their roles in collagen and stromal tissue degradation and in enamel synthesis.

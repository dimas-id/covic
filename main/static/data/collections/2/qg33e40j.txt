BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been highly epidemic in China since January 2020. Rapid detection of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is very important due to its high rate of infectivity. This study aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, China, and to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19 in attempts to contain spread of the virus. METHODS: This retrospective study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hunan Provincial People's Hospital (Changsha, China) between January 22 and February 15, 2020. All cases were detected using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The epidemiology and clinical characteristic of these cases were investigated according to outcome in attempts to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 24 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the fever outpatient department of Hunan Provincial People's Hospital. Three patients were asymptomatic, and 3 exhibited mild and 3 moderate disease. There was a family cluster phenomenon. CONCLUSION: Individuals with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or exhibit mild manifestations of disease. Close monitoring and an optimized screening strategy for COVID-19 could help deter spread of the virus.

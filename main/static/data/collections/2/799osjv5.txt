PURPOSE OF REVIEW New and emerging diseases, combined with the rapid spread of pathogens resistant to antibiotics and of disease-carrying insects resistant to insecticides, are daunting challenges to human health. RECENT FINDINGS The new diseases of recent months are West Nile virus conquering the American continent, the introduction of monkeypox in the USA, the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome worldwide, and avian influenza which crossed the species barrier again to claim several victims. SUMMARY Emerging infectious diseases are almost instantaneously a global concern because of the speed with which people, animals and products move around the world. In order to adapt to these new threats, there is a need for timely identification and reporting, the need to consider health problems from a global perspective, and the need to incorporate practising physicians in the process as much as possible.

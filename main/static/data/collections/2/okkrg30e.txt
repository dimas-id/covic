Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, many individuals have noted acute loss of smell and/or taste, although not all patients with these symptoms are tested for COVID-19. To better characterize all patients with these rare symptoms, a national survey was created. Over 13 days in April 2020, a total of 220 people completed the survey in its entirety, representing a wide geographic distribution across the United States. Of the 220 respondents, 93 (42%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 127 (58%) were not. A total of 37.7% of respondents reported changes in smell/taste as the initial or sole presentation of their condition. Most but not all patients had other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 at the time of chemosensory loss. Despite its inclusion as a major symptom of COVID-19 by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), respondents with additional CDC-defined symptoms associated with COVID-19 were statistically more likely to be tested/diagnosed than those without.

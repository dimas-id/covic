Bronchopleural fistula presents an important and challenging management problem after lung parenchymal resection. The mainstay of treatment has been surgical revision of the bronchial stump, however increasingly endobronchial therapies are being employed. We report the novel use of a liquid embolic agent with an Amplatzer vascular plug to seal a chronic bronchopleural fistula. Using rigid bronchoscopy, fluoroscopy, radio opaque liquid embolic agent, and the Amplatzer vascular plug, we were able to demonstrate not only feasibility but also safety and a marked reduction in symptoms consistent with successful closure of the bronchopleural fistula.

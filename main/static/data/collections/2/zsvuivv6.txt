To determine effects of PMEE occurring during the first 3 yrs. of life, we administered tests of S&L to 218 3 y.o., white, English-speaking children with normal developmental histories. All had been followed prospectively since birth; we stratified according to duration of PMEE, sex, type of health-care, and socio-economic status (SES). Below are selected results for children with PMEE (130+ days) and those without PMEE (<30 days) in a suburban, private practice (I) and an urban clinic (II). These data suggest that PMEE early in life is associated with significant impairment of S&L; children from higher SES appear at greater risk. This study does not show if such effects are permanent or transient.

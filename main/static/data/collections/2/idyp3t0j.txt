Abstract To examine the genetic control of acute and late disease induced by a murine coronavirus, strain JHM (JHMV), BALB/cHeA, STS/A, F1 hybrids and 13 recombinant inbred (RI) strains between BALB/cHeA and STS/A mouse strains were inoculated intracerebrally with 100 pfu of JHMV. All the BALB/cHeA mice died within 2 weeks from acute encephalitis. In contrast, STS/A mice were shown to be partially resistant, with a mortality rate of 30%, longer survival times and lower rates of viral production. The mortality rates, survival times and viral titers of F1 hybrids and the RI strains varied, suggesting involvement of multiple genes. STS/A, F1 hybrid and RI mice surviving the acute infection occasionally developed severe paraparesis about 1 month post-infection. In these mice, vacuolar degeneration, astrocytosis, the absence of perivascular cuffing and minimal demyelination were found in the central nervous system. No infectious virus could be recovered from these mice. Although the paralysis of delayed onset was limited to STS/A, F1 hybrid and eight of the 13 RI strains, the incidence varied significantly among the RI strains. These results may suggest that JHMV-induced late disease is also under multifactorial control. The pathogenesis of JHMV infection is discussed.

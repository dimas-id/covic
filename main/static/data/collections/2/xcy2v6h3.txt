BACKGROUND: Sesamin and sesamolin are two typical and major lignans isolated from sesame oil. Various researches have shown the bioactivity, physiological activity and potential health benefits of the two components. In this study, a simultaneous and rapid method for determination of sesamin and sesamolin in sesame oils was proposed. The excitation-emission fluorescence spectra of the oils were obtained after a simple pretreatment method, then the self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition were adopted to extract the quantitative information from the highly overlapped spectra. RESULTS: It was found that reasonable quantification results can be obtained with the limits of detection for the two lignans were 0.05 mg/g and 0.24 mg/g, while limits of quantitation were 0.14 mg/g and 0.74 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the average recoveries for sesamin and sesamolin were 99.05% and 94.97%. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that with simple sample pretreatment, the application for combining excitation-emission fluorescence spectra and self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition can be a useful and sensitive tool for the determination of lignans in sesame oil.

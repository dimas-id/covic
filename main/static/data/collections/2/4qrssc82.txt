The goal of this work is to analyse the effects of control policies for the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Brazil. This is done by considering an age-structured SEIR model with a quarantine class and two types of controls. The first one studies the sensitivity with regard to the parameters of the basic reproductive number R0 which is calculated by the next generation method. The second one evaluates different quarantine strategies by comparing their relative total number of deaths.

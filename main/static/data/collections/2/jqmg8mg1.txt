BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS Post-lobectomy bronchopleural fistula is a rare complication of lung resection surgery, and proper management is crucial for the successful resolution. Most published papers deal with surgical treatment. We report our experience with a new interventional management, endobronchial naso-bronchial lavage (ENBL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the continuing efficacy and safety of this innovative procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 2002 to 2012, 17 patients who suffered from post-lobectomy bronchopleural fistula were recruited. An ENBL tube was inserted form nostril through the trachea, bronchus and the fistula into the pleural cavity with bronchoscope. Lavage of the pleural cavity was proceeded form the ENBL tube and drained form thoracostomy drainage tube. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. RESULT All patients received total recovery from the post-lobectomy bronchopleural fistula. The ENBL procedure could be finished in 10-15 min. No blooding without control, pneumonia or damage of trachea associated with this procedure occurred. With an at least 6 months' follow-up of the patients, no further intervention was performed. CONCLUSIONS It suggested that the ENBL may be an alternative interventional treatment for bronchopleural fistula treating other than surgical procedure.

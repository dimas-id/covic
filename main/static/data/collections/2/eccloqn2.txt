INTRODUCTION This study assessed the feasibility, performance, and safety of Mirasol®-treated platelet concentrates (M-PC) stored for up to 7 days. METHODS This prospective observational study was approved by the ethical committee of the University Clinic of Santiago de Compostela. Informed consent was asked from patients receiving M-PC. M-PCs were treated with the Mirasol system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thrombocytopenic patients were transfused according to the Spanish transfusion guidelines. Post-transfusion platelet counts were measured at 1 h and/or 24 h after transfusion. Post-transfusion surveillance of patients was maintained during the study. RESULTS Data from 54 evaluable patients and 135 transfusions were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years. The mean age of M-PC at transfusion was 3.6 days. The mean platelet dose was 3.7 × 1011. The transfusion responses measured as mean corrected count increment 1 h after transfusion (CCI1h) and CCI24h were 9,659 and 4,751, respectively. 65% of transfusions resulted in CCI1h values ≥ 7,500. 51% of transfusions resulted in CCI24h values ≥ 4,500. CONCLUSION The use of M-PC in the supportive treatment proved to be safe and effective for this cohort of thrombocytopenic patients.

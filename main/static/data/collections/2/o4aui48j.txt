Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare genetic anomaly characterized by arrangement of the abdominal and thoracic organs in a perfect mirror image reversal of the normal positioning. Transposition of the organs causes difficulty in diagnosis and treatment of the diseases related to abdomen and thorax. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a new technique and it is increasingly used with better cosmetic results. In this paper, a single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) performed in a patient with SIT is presented. SILC can be performed safely in the patients with SIT with better cosmetic results.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical profile and outcome of neonates with non-immune hydrops (NIH). METHODS: Data of all the NIH cases admitted to neonatal intensive care unit at our center, New Delhi from January, 2010 to October, 2017 were extracted from hospital records, which included clinical profile and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 17,299 total births, 27 neonates were identified to have NIH. Antenatal interventions were undertaken in five (18.5%) cases. The most common etiology of NIH was cardiac (n=5; 18.5%). Two babies with chylothorax were successfully managed with octreotide infusions. Overall survival rate of NIH was 70.3% (n=19). All neonates with a suspected genetic syndrome died. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary team including obstetricians, pediatric surgeons, geneticists and neonatologists can improve outcome in neonates with NIH.

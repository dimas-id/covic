Two cattle farms, with a ten year history of BHV4 related postpartum metritis accompanied by fertility problems, were monitored during the winter season 1985â€“1986. BHV4 was isolated from the lochia from 55% of the animals on farm A and 66% of those on farm B. Respectively 59% and 30% of the animals presented postpartum metritis. In some animals virus multiplication was followed by severe leucopenia lasting several weeks. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) BHV4 seropositive as well as IIF seronegative animals were affected. The latter responded with a rapid or late IIF antibody reaction. No BHV4 seroneutralizing antibodies could be detected. The authors also suggest a possible role of BHV4 in the respiratory problems observed during the study.

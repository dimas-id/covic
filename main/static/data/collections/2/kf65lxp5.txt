The increasing availability of scholarly metadata in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KG) offers opportunities for studying the structure of scholarly communication and evolution of science. Such KGs build the foundation for knowledge-driven tasks e.g., link discovery, prediction and entity classification which allow to provide recommendation services. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been investigated for such knowledge-driven tasks in different application domains. One of the applications of KGE models is to provide link predictions, which can also be viewed as a foundation for recommendation service, e.g. high confidence “co-author” links in a scholarly knowledge graph can be seen as suggested collaborations. In this paper, KGEs are reconciled with a specific loss function (Soft Margin) and examined with respect to their performance for co-authorship link prediction task on scholarly KGs. The results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of the experimented KGE models on the considered scholarly KGs using this specific loss. TransE with Soft Margin (TransE-SM) obtains a score of 79.5% Hits@10 for co-authorship link prediction task while the original TransE obtains 77.2%, on the same task. In terms of accuracy and Hits@10, TransE-SM also outperforms other state-of-the-art embedding models such as ComplEx, ConvE and RotatE in this setting. The predicted co-authorship links have been validated by evaluating profile of scholars.

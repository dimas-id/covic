C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) is one of the critical negative regulators of the Src family of kinases. The Src family of kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulate inflammation, cell proliferation, motility, and adhesion. To investigate potential histologic lesions associated with systemic loss of Csk gene activity in adult mice, conditional Csk-knockout mice were examined. Cre-mediated systemic excision of Csk induced by tamoxifen treatment resulted in multiorgan inflammation. Specifically, induction of Csk gene excision with three days of tamoxifen treatment resulted in greater than 90% gene excision. Strikingly, these mice developed enteritis that ranged from minimal and suppurative to severe, fibrinonecrosuppurative and hemorrhagic. Other inflammatory lesions included suppurative pneumonia, gastritis, and myocarditis, and increased numbers of inflammatory cells within the hepatic parenchyma. When tamoxifen treatment was reduced from three days to one day in an effort to lower the level of Csk gene excision and limit lesion development, the mice developed severe suppurative to pyogranulomatous pneumonia and minimal to mild suppurative enteritis. Lesions observed secondary to Csk gene excision suggest important roles for Csk in downregulating the proinflammatory activity of the Src family of kinases and limiting neutrophil-mediated inflammation.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE This study provides the contemporary causes and prognosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke in Asians and the direct comparisons with non-Asians. METHODS The TIAregistry.org enrolled 4789 patients (1149 Asians and 3640 non-Asians) with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke within 7 days of onset. Every participating facility had systems dedicated to urgent intervention of TIA/stroke patients by specialists. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal acute coronary syndrome. RESULTS Approximately 80% of patients were evaluated within 24 hours of symptom onset. At 1 year, there were no differences in the rates of composite cardiovascular events (6.8% versus 6.0%; P=0.38) and stroke (6.0% versus 4.8%; P=0.11) between Asians and non-Asians. Asians had a lower risk of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or TIA) than non-Asians (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.98; P=0.03); the difference was primarily driven by a lower rate of TIA in Asians (4.2% versus 8.3%; P<0.001). Moderately severe bleeding was more frequent in Asians (0.8% versus 0.3%; P=0.02). In multivariable analysis, multiple acute infarcts (P=0.005) and alcohol consumption (P=0.02) were independent predictors of stroke recurrence in Asians, whereas intracranial stenosis (P<0.001), ABCD2 score (P<0.001), atrial fibrillation (P=0.008), extracranial stenosis (P=0.03), and previous stroke or TIA (P=0.03) were independent predictors in non-Asians. CONCLUSIONS The short-term stroke risk after a TIA or minor stroke was lower than expected when urgent evidence-based care was delivered, irrespective of race/ethnicity or region. However, the predictors of stroke were different for Asians and non-Asians.

This contribution draws from the experience of intensive care unit psychologists at 2 frontline hospitals in Milan, Italy, during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this contribution, we describe the main psychological needs observed in clinicians and in the families of COVID-19 patients and illustrate some psychological interventions implemented to respond to these needs. Containing emotions and promoting resilience were the aims of our interventions. In the future, psychological interventions should focus on the elaboration of traumatic experiences and losses.

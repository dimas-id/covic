Proteases are “protein-cleaving” enzymes, which, in addition to their non-specific degrading function, also catalyze the highly specific and regulated process of proteolytic processing, thus regulating multiple biological functions. Alterations in proteolytic activity occur during pathological conditions such as cancer. One of the major deregulated classes of proteases in cancer is caspases, the proteolytic initiators and mediators of the apoptotic machinery. The ability to image apoptosis noninvasively in living cells and animal models of cancer can not only provide new insight into the biological basis of the disease but can also be used as a quantitative tool to screen and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies. Optical molecular imaging such as bioluminescence-based genetically engineered biosensors has been developed in our laboratory and exploited to study protease activity in animal models with a high signal to noise. Using the circularly permuted form of firefly luciferase, we have developed a reporter for Caspase 3/7, referred to as Caspase 3/7 GloSensor. Here, we discuss the use of the Caspase 3/7 GloSensor for imaging apoptotic activity in mouse xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer and present the potential of this powerful platform technology to image the proteolytic activity of numerous other proteases.

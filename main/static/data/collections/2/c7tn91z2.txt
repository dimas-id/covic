Final-year medical students in the UK have been allowed to voluntarily apply for early provisional registration in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing these foundation interim year-1 (FiY1) doctors to assist in service provision in hospitals where resources and staffing may be strained. The authors, as recently qualified foundation year-1 (FY1) doctors, use this article to draw on their own experiences, and those of their colleagues, to provide advice on key topics that may not have been covered, or not covered sufficiently, in medical education, such as prescribing, rotas, wellbeing, and useful apps and websites.

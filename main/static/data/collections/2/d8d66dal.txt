Objective The aim of this study was to determine outcome of ischemic stroke patients in the anterior circulation treated with endovascular treatment (EVT) with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) versus EVT alone group. Methods A systemic literature review was performed using online database from January 2004 to January 2017. Primary outcomes were successful recanalization seen on finial angiography and good outcome at three months. Secondary outcomes were mortality and the development of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (S-ICH) after the procedure. A fixed effect model was used when heterogeneity was less than 50%. Egger's regression test was used to assess publication bias. Results Five studies were included for final analysis. Between EVT with IVT and EVT alone group, successful recanalization (odds ratio [OR] 1.467, p=0.216), good clinical outcome at three months (OR 1.199, p=0.385), mortality (OR 0.776, p=0.371), and S-ICH (OR 1.820, p=0.280) did not differ significantly. Egger's regression intercept with 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.99 (95% CI -2.91 to 6.89) in successful recanalization and -0.27 (95% CI -6.35 to 5.80) in good clinical outcome, respectively. Conclusion The two treatment modalities, EVT with IVT and EVT alone, could be comparable in treating acute anterior circulation stroke. Studies to find specific beneficiary group for EVT alone, without primary IVT, are needed further.

Recipients of solid organ transplants (SOT) need primary care providers (PCPs) who are familiar with their unique needs and understand the lifelong infectious risks faced by SOT patients because of their need for lifelong immunosuppressive medications. SOT recipients can present with atypical and muted manifestations of infections, for which the knowledgable PCP will initiate a comprehensive evaluation. The goal of this article is to familiarize PCPs with the infectious challenges facing SOT patients. General concepts are reviewed, and a series of patient cases described that illustrate the specific learning points based on common presenting clinical symptoms.

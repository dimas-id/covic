Infection caused by novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with coagulopathy. We present a case of a previously healthy 49-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and later found to have extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in all four extremities. This was accompanied by a steep rise in D-dimer levels and positive antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) on further testing. She clinically improved on hydroxychloroquine and therapeutic anticoagulation. This is one of the first case reports describing APLA-associated DVT in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. Transient elevation of APLA from the viral illness may play a role in thrombosis associated with COVID-19.

Abstract Background Mechanisms influencing severity of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children are not established. We aimed to assess the role of inflammatory markers and respiratory viruses in ALRI severity. Methods Concentrations of interleukin(IL)-33, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST)2, IL-1ß, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-4, IL-6 and IL- 8 and types of respiratory viruses were evaluated in children at the first and fifth days after hospital admission. Disease severity was defined as need for mechanical ventilation. Results Seventy-nine children <5 years-old were included; 33(41.8%) received mechanical ventilation. No associations between virus type, viral load or co-detections and severity of disease were observed. Detection of IL-33 and sST2 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) on admission were associated with higher risk for mechanical ventilation (RR = 2.89 and RR = 4.57, respectively). IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were higher on Day 5 in mechanically ventilated children. IL-6 NPA concentrations decreased from Day 1 to Day 5 in children who did not receive mechanical ventilation. Increase in sST2 NPA concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 was associated with longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.01). Conclusions An exacerbated local activation of the IL-33/ST2 axis and persistently high sST2 concentrations over time were associated with severity of viral ALRI in children.

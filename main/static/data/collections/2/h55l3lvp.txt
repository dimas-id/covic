Virus contamination in human therapeutics is of growing concern as more therapeutic products from animal or human sources come into the market. All biopharmaceutical processes are required to have at least two distinct viral clearance steps to remove viruses. Most of these steps work well for enveloped viruses and large viruses, whether enveloped or not. That leaves a class of small non‐enveloped viruses, like parvoviruses and hepatitis A, which are not easily removed by these typical steps. In this study, we report the identification of trimeric peptides that bind specifically to porcine parvovirus (PPV) and their potential use to remove this virus from process solutions. All of the trimeric peptides isolated completely removed all detectable PPV from buffer in the first nine column volumes, corresponding to a clearance of 4.5–5.5 log of infectious virus. When the virus was spiked into a more complex matrix consisting of 7.5% human blood plasma, one of the trimers, WRW, was able to remove all detectable PPV in the first three column volumes, after which human blood plasma began to interfere with the binding of the virus to the peptide resin. These trimer resins removed considerably more virus than weak ion exchange resins. The results of this work indicate that small peptide ligand resins have the potential to be used in virus removal processes where removal of contaminating virus is necessary to ensure product safety.

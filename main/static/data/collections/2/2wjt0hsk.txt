Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is of utmost importance to establish an early diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infections and to start appropriate therapy. The CSF white cell count, lactate concentration and total protein levels are usually available very quickly even from non-specialized laboratories and the combination of these parameters often provides sufficient information for decision-making in emergency cases. It is, however, not always possible to identify the underlying infective agent despite further CSF analyses, such as bacterial and fungal staining, evaluation of the blood-CSF barrier function, intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis and oligoclonal IgG bands. Therefore, close communication between the laboratory and the clinician is an important prerequisite to specify additional pathogen-related diagnostic measures for successful confirmation of the diagnosis.

We present a preterm infant who developed a fever and mild respiratory disease on the second day of life. Infant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal testing was positive at 24 and 48 hours of life. Placenta histopathology revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Further understanding of the risk factors that lead to in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed.

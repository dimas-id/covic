Zika virus continues to pose a significant global health threat. While the outbreak pattern may seemingly mirror those of other arboviruses, unique transmission characteristics and clinical outcomes warrant a different approach to traditional public health practices. Sexual transmission and virus-associated fetal and nonfetal neurologic disorders specifically challenge conventional methods of disease protection and prevention with regard to vector control, disease surveillance, and health risk communication. The protocols for outbreak and case limitation led by the World Health Organization (in accordance with Public Health Emergency of International Concern declaration) may be augmented by localized risk categorization and assignment for Zika and future emergent outbreaks. There is currently a great deal of "behind the scenes" discussion about modifications to the formal process described in the International Health Regulations. A scalable, adaptable, and flexible process is needed that can be customized to a specific threat. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2017;11:279-284).

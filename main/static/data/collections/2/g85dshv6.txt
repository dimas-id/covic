BACKGROUND Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) may further reduce the trauma of surgery leading to reduced port site complications and postoperative pain. The improved cosmetic result also may lead to improved patient satisfaction with surgery. METHODS Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed for all patients who underwent SILS appendicectomy at our institution and were compared with those who had undergone conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy during the same time period. This included patient demographic data, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Thirty-three patients underwent conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy and 40 patients underwent SILS appendicectomy between January 26, 2008 and July 14, 2009. Operative time was shorter with SILS appendicectomy compared with conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy (p < 0.05). No patients in the SILS appendicectomy group required conversion to open surgery compared with two patients in the conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy group. Patients stayed an average of 1.36 days after SILS appendicectomy, and 2.36 days after conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy. DISCUSSION SILS appendicectomy seems to be a safe and efficacious technique. Further work in the form of randomized studies is required to investigate any significant advantages of this new and attractive technique.

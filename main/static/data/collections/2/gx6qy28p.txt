The outbreak of the novel COVID-19 has dominated the world stage, and its consequences, both direct and indirect, are expected to prove to be even more pervasive over time. The COVID-19 pandemic has struck the renewable energy manufacturing facilities, supply chains, and companies and slowed down the transition to the sustainable energy world. The global decline in economy-driven demand could damage the positive trend of green and low-carbon energy progress. Although it is too early to judge how profound the negative effects of the pandemic on the global renewable and sustainable energy systems will be, a significant short-run contraction to the development of renewables is inevitable. Therefore, the energy and climate policies may require to be restructured based on the new circumstances. In this context, several beneficial stimuluses should be offered by the governments to persuade the private sectors and society to invest on renewables. Undoubtedly, intelligent policies could convert the menaces of COVID-19 to the great opportunities for renewables and ultimately the worldâ€™s sustainable energy scenario could return to its long-term trajectory toward green power generation and utilization over the next few years.

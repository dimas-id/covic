BACKGROUND Single-port access (SPA) is an emerging concept in minimally invasive colorectal surgery. The authors report their experience using SPA sigmoidectomy as an early-elective approach to complicated diverticulitis with paracolic abscess. METHODS Between September 2009 und April 2010, 4 patients underwent SPA sigmoidectomy for Hinchey-I diverticulitis using the reusable X-Cone device. RESULTS After a median time of antibiotic treatment of 8 days, SPA sigmoidectomy was performed successfully in all patients. The median operative time was 200 minutes (range, 187-221 minutes). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded; the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range, 5-7 days). No incisional hernias were observed at midterm follow-up (median, 11.5 months; range, 8-14 months). CONCLUSIONS When performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon, early-elective SPA sigmoidectomy is a feasible and safe approach to complicated diverticulitis. The reusability of the X-Cone device ensures that the costs of the procedure are not high.

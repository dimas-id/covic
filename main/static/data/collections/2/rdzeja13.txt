Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic of respiratory illness, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[1] The risk of developing COVID-19 from a SARS-CoV-2 infected organ donor is unknown. Therefore, extreme caution is necessary when considering transplantation. Transmission is affected by epidemiological risk factors, incubation period, degree of viraemia, and viability of SARS-CoV-2 in blood and organ compartments. Recent guidelines from NHSBT[2] recommend that all potential donors be tested for SARS-CoV-2 and donation suspended from those who test positive. Donation is discouraged for asymptomatic individuals who have been in a COVID-19-affected area in the last 28 days.

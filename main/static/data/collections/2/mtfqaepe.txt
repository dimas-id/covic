Taiwan is a small, densely populated island with unique experiences in the construction and operation of incinerators. In such a small area, Taiwan has built 22 incinerators over a short span of time, combusting large amount of municipal solid waste as much as 23,250 tons per day. This study focuses on the history of construction and development of incinerators in Taiwan as well as the characteristics of pollutants, such as heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Hg), acid gases (NO(x), SO(x), CO, and HCl), and dioxins emitted from the incinerators. Furthermore, the study also covers the generation and composition of municipal solid waste (MSW), and the production of energy in Taiwan. According to Taiwan’s data on pollutant emissions, the emission level of pollutants is under control and meets the stringent regulations of Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). Researches have shown that using air pollution control devices (APCDs) in the operation of incinerators provides effective measures for air pollutant control in Taiwan. The main advantage of using incinerators is the generation of electricity (waste-to-energy) during the incineration of municipal solid waste, producing energy that can be consumed by the general public and the industry. Taiwan’s extensive experience in incinerator construction and operation may serve as an example for developing countries in devising waste treatment technology, energy recovery, and the control of contagious viral diseases.

Respiratory viral infections are very common in young children. They sometimes occur as primary infections (and sometimes re-infections) by influenza and parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (VRS), adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus. The clinical pictures are very varied and without strict clinico-virological correlation. In adults the role of the site (frail lung, aged persons) and the type of virus play an important part. Many viral infections develop in an epidemiological way (influenza, VRS bronchiolitis, rhinovirus infections...) and several epidemics by different viruses overlap from September-October to March-April making it very difficult to decide the precise cause. Epidemics are followed thanks to networks of medical practitioners (GROG, SENTINELLE...) and by data from hospitalised patients, but precise identification of epidemic viruses is only possible and validated by virological analysis of samples taken from patients.

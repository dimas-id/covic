Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is considered as the primary pathogen of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), which results in significant economic losses worldwide. Clinically, PCV2 often causes disease through coinfection with other bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus suis (S. suis), and especially the highly prevalent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2). The present study determined that continuous PCV2 infection in piglets down-regulates tight junction proteins (TJ) ZO-1 and occludin in the lungs. Swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) were used to explore the mechanisms and consequences of disruption of TJ, and an in vitro tracheal epithelial barrier model was established. Our results show that PCV2 infection in STEC decreases the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin and increases the permeability of the tracheal epithelial barrier, resulting in easier translocation of SS2. Moreover, Western blot analysis indicates that PCV2 infection activates the JNK/MAPK pathway. The disruption of TJ in SETC and increased permeability of the epithelial barrier induced by PCV2 could be alleviated by inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, which indicates that the JNK/MAPK pathway regulates the expression of ZO-1 and occludin during PCV2 infection. This study allows us to better understand the mechanisms of PCV2 coinfection with bacterial pathogens and provides new insight into controlling the occurrence of PCVAD.

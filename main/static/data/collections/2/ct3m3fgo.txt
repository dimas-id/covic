A postal survey of the techniques being used for the treatment and control of footrot in sheep flocks between November 1999 and October 2000 was conducted in England and Wales in November 2000. Of the 392 questionnaires circulated, 251 (64 per cent) were returned, and 209 of these were usable. Negative binomial regression analysis indicated that the isolation of bought-in sheep, and the separation and individual treatment of diseased sheep with parenteral antibiotics, foot trimming and topical foot sprays were associated with a significantly lower prevalence of footrot in a flock. In contrast, ewe flocks which were routinely foot trimmed more than once a year had a significantly higher prevalence of footrot. No evidence was found that footbathing a flock reduced the level of footrot, except on the 14 per cent of farms where the penning and race facilities for footbathing were reported by the farmer to be excellent. Vaccination had no significant beneficial effect on the level of footrot in a flock

From December 2019 to March 2020, China was the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic, but from that moment on, Europe surpassed China in the number of new cases and deaths related to this novel viral respiratory infection. The emergence of this world pandemic is particularly important for solid organ transplant recipients, who might have an increased risk of mortality, not only due to their chronic immunosuppression status, but also to the cardiovascular risk that correlates with several years of chronic kidney disease. To the extent that there is still a lack of knowledge about the clinical characteristics, evolution and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients, we will report the first 5 cases diagnosed and followed in our transplant unit, as well as share the therapeutic strategies adopted.

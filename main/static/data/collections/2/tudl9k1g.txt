Abstract To determine differences in infection kinetics of two temporally and genetically different type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates in vivo with and without concurrent porcine circovirus (PCV) type 2a or 2b infection, 62 pigs were randomly assigned to one of seven groups: negative controls (n =8); pigs coinfected with a 1992 PRRSV strain (VR-2385) and PCV2a (CoI-92-2a; n =9), pigs coinfected with VR-2385 and PCV2b (CoI-92-2b; n =9), pigs coinfected with a 2006 PRRSV strain (NC16845b) and PCV2a (CoI-06-2a; n =9), pigs coinfected with NC16845b and PCV2b (CoI-06-2b; n =9), pigs infected with VR-2385 (n =9), and pigs infected with NC16845b (n =9). Blood samples were collected before inoculation and at day post-inoculation (dpi) 3, 6, 9 and 12 and tested for the presence of PRRSV antibody and RNA, PCV2 antibody and DNA, complete blood counts, and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) levels. Regardless of concurrent PCV2 infection, VR-2385 initially replicated at higher levels and reached peak replication levels at dpi 6. Pigs infected with VR-2385 had significantly higher amounts of viral RNA in serum on both dpi 3 and dpi 6, compared to pigs infected with NC16845b. The peak of NC16845b virus replication occurred between dpi 9 and dpi 12 and was associated with a delayed anti-PRRSV antibody response in these pigs. PCV2 coinfection resulted in significantly more severe macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions and a stronger anti-PRRSV IgG response compared to pigs infected with PRRSV alone. This work further emphasizes in vivo replication differences among PRRSV strains and the importance of coinfecting pathogens.

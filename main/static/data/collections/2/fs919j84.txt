In the present study, a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction combined with a chip hybridization assay (ProDect BCS RV CHIP) was evaluated as an alternative to the combination of immunofluorescent antibody test and shell vial cell culture considered as gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses. Among 100 specimens, 40 were positive using the combination of immunofluorescent antibody test and shell vial cell culture assay in which 9 of them were infected by two different viruses (27 parainfluenza virus type 3, 10 adenovirus, 9 respiratory syncytial virus, 2 influenza type B, and 1 influenza type A). ProDect BCS RV CHIP detected only 10 positive specimens in which one of them was infected by two different viruses (5 respiratory syncytial virus, 3 parainfluenza virus type 3, 2 adenovirus, and 1 influenza virus type B). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of ProDect BCS RV CHIP were 25.0%, 100%, 100%, 66.6%, and 70.0%, respectively, compared to the combination of shell vial cell culture and immunofluorescent antibody test. As a result, the specificity of ProDect BCS RV CHIP is high, however, the sensitivity (25%) of the assay is not sufficient for routine laboratory use.

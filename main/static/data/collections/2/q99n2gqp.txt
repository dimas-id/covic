The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has altered our economy, society and healthcare system. While this crisis has presented the US healthcare delivery system with unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has catalyzed rapid adoption of telehealth or the entire spectrum of activities used to deliver care at a distance. Using examples reported by US healthcare organizations including ours, we describe the role telehealth has played in transforming healthcare delivery during the three phases of the US COVID-19 pandemic: 1) Stay-at-Home Outpatient Care; 2) Initial COVID-19 Hospital Surge, and 3) Post-Pandemic Recovery. Within each of these three phases, we examine how people, process and technology work together to support a successful telehealth transformation. Whether healthcare enterprises are ready or not, the new reality is that virtual care has arrived.

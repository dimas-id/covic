Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has spread to more than 200 other countries around the world. COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease with continuous human-to-human transmission. The origin of the virus is unknown. Airway manipulations and intubations, which are common during anesthesia procedures may increasingly expose anesthesia providers and intensive care unit team members to SARS-CoV-2. Through a comprehensive review of existing studies on COVID-19, this article presents the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, reviews current medical management, and suggests ways to improve the safety of anesthetic procedures. Owing to the highly contagious nature of the virus and the lack of therapeutic drugs or vaccines, precautions should be taken to prevent medical staff from COVID-19.

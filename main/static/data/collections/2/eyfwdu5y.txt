Falsified and substandard (SF) medications are a large and growing global public health threat affecting developed and developing markets. The need for scalable, easy-to-use, accurate methods to detect SF medications continues to grow. We conducted a proof-of-principle laboratory and field-sample evaluation of MedSnap in Vientiane, Lao PDR. Over three days, MedSnap models were created from trusted and authentic medications and tested against samples of authentic/trusted or falsified artesunate, artemether-lumefantrine, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. Across 49 tests of authentic/trusted and falsified samples, MedSnap was 100% sensitive and specific. On the final day of the study, a convenience sample of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin was collected from local pharmacies and tested. Each purchased sample matched an authentic or trusted model. The speed and ease of data collection, reference model building, and sample testing suggest scalable use cases for the system.

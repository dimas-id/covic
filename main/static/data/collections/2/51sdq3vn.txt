Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a life-threatening condition that usually occurs in immunocompromised hosts. However, according to recent reports it can affect immunocompetent hosts with severe influenza infection due to viral-dependent disruption of respiratory immune defenses. We present the case of a 61-year-old Caucasian man admitted to the Emergency Department with respiratory failure and fever, who was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and IPA. Because of his poor general conditions, he was treated with a double antifungal scheme, although this lies outside the suggested treatment guidelines. This choice turned out to be extremely effective. He was discharged after one month and his clinical conditions showed rapid improvement, with nearly complete normalization of the radiological pattern in three months. IPA remains a life-threatening condition, even in immunocompetent hosts, and should therefore always be suspected; if necessary, a combined treatment should rapidly be started. We report this case as the interest in influenza-associated IPA is high, both due to the clinical severity of this condition, which is treatable if identified early, and the emerging importance of respiratory infections caused by viruses belonging to the SARS family, such as SARS-CoV-2.

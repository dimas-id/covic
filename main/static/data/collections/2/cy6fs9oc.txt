Different airway devices can be used by paediatrician anaesthesiologists for difficult airway management in infant younger than 2 years. The four devices analyzed (Airtraq® [Prodol Meditec]; Glidescope® Cobalt [Verathon]; Vidéolaryngoscope [Storz]; laryngoscope Truview® [Truphatek]) increase the Cormack and Lehane grade against direct laryngoscopy and optimized external larynx movements. They need training, on manikin then in vivo, for an optimal use. The needed number of in vivo successful intubations is not determined. It is probably between 10 and 20. The choice between these devices, in accordance with the published studies, which compared the devices, is difficult. The manikin studies allow to standardize airway, but the results are not transposable in vivo. Concerning the airway devices with disposable blade, the Glidescope®, for oral intubation, seems to be better than Airtraq® if we take into account the oropharyngeal volume needed.

A 70-year-old woman was diagnosed with cT2N2M0 left triple negative breast cancer. She received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Around 30 months after the surgery, she developed carcinomatous pericardial tamponade, carcinomatous pleurisy, and metastatic thyroid cancer due to the breast cancer. Around the same time, a BRCA2 mutation was confirmed. Thus, olaparib therapy was started. Around 45 days after the start of olaparib administration, the therapeutic effect was cPR. The treatment remains effective even after approximately 1 year.

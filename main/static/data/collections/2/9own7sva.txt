BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Collagen solder is capable of fixation of surgical meshes during laparoscopic herniorrhaphy without compromising tissue integration, increasing adhesions or inflammation. This pilot study describes development of instrumentation and techniques for transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) herniorrhaphy using laser-assisted soldering technology. METHODS Anesthetized 20-kg to 25-kg female Yorkshire pigs underwent laparoscopy performed using a 3-trocar technique. Peritoneal incisions were made and pockets created in the preperitoneal space for mesh placement. Parietex TEC mesh segments embedded in 60% collagen-solder were soldered to the muscle surface by using a prototype laser (1.45micro, 4.5W CW, 5mm spot, and 55 degrees C set temperature) and custom laparoscopic handpiece. Parietex TEC mesh segments (Control) were affixed to the muscle with fibrin sealant (Tisseel). Peritoneal closure was with staples (Control) or by soldering collagen embedded Vicryl mesh segments over the peritoneal incision (Mesh/TAPP). Segments were inserted using a specially designed introducer. Animals were recovered and underwent second-look laparoscopy at 6 weeks postimplantation. Mesh sites were harvested after animals were euthanized. RESULTS The mesh-solder constructs were easily inserted and affixed in the TAPP approach. Tisseel tended to drip during application, particularly in vertical and ventral locations. Postoperative healing was similar to Control segments in all cases. Mesh/TAPP closures healed without scarring or adhesion formation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Collagen-based tissue soldering permits normal wound healing and may mitigate or reduce use of staples for laparoscopic mesh fixation and peritoneal closure. Laser-assisted mesh fixation and peritoneal closure is a promising alternative for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. Further development of this strategy is warranted.

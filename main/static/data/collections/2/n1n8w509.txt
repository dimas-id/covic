Enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion of their own membrane with a cellular membrane. Incorporation of inverted-cone-shaped lipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the outer leaflet of target membranes has been shown previously to impair fusion mediated by class I viral fusion proteins, e.g., the influenza virus hemagglutinin. It has been suggested that these results provide evidence for the stalk-pore model of fusion, which involves a hemifusion intermediate (stalk) with highly bent outer membrane leaflets. Here, we investigated the effect of inverted-cone-shaped LPCs and the cone-shaped oleic acid (OA) on the membrane fusion activity of a virus with a class II fusion protein, the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). This study included an analysis of lipid mixing, as well as of the steps preceding or accompanying fusion, i.e., binding to the target membrane and lipid-induced conformational changes in the fusion protein E. We show that the presence of LPC in the outer leaflet of target liposomes strongly inhibited TBEV-mediated fusion, whereas OA caused a very slight enhancement, consistent with a fusion mechanism involving a lipid stalk. However, LPC also impaired the low-pH-induced binding of a soluble form of the E protein to liposomes and its conversion into a trimeric postfusion structure that requires membrane binding at low pH. Because inhibition is already observed before the lipid-mixing step, it cannot be determined whether impairment of stalk formation is a contributing factor in the inhibition of fusion by LPC. These data emphasize, however, the importance of the composition of the target membrane in its interactions with the fusion peptide that are crucial for the initiation of fusion.

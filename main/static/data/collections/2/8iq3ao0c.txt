Targeting older at-risk patients with decision-making algorithms is a priority at a time when hospitals are receiving an influx of Covid-19 patients that may exceed their capacity. Such screening could likely be extended to primary care settings in order to identify older community dwellers with Covid-19, but also those experiencing the adverse consequences of prolonged home confinement. The Centre of Excellence on Longevity of McGill University (Quebec, Canada) designed a short assessment for Montrealâ€™s housebound community-dwelling older adults. It acts as the first step in connecting older community dwellers who are housebound during the Covid-19 outbreak to telemedicine.

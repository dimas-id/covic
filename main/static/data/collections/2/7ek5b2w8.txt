In this article, we examine the essential role of law in achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Following the World Health Organizationâ€™s broad definition of health, all SDGs can be seen to impact on human health and hence the health goal (SDG3) should be right at the centre of the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We note recent research on the contribution of law, including international human rights law, to achieving health for all and discuss the role of law in addressing seven emerging health challenges. Law can and should play an important role in achieving all health-related SDGs, by respecting, protecting and fulfilling the right to health, ensuring that no one is left behind.

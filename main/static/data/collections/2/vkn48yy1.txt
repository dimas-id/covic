Abstract Natural ventilation enables personal control, and occupant behaviors in window opening play a decisive role on natural ventilation performance, indoor air quality (IAQ), and/or airborne infection risk in a hospital setting. The occupant behaviors differ significantly from different building types with different functions and living habits. Based on a one-year field measurement in two general hospital wards in Nanjing, China, the effects of air quality (i.e. indoor CO2 concentration and outdoor PM2.5 concentration) and the climatic parameters (i.e. indoor/outdoor temperature, relative humidity, and outdoor wind speed, wind direction and rainfall) on window opening/closing behaviors are analyzed. Indoor air temperature or relative humidity is found to be a dominant factor for window opening behaviors. Seasonal differences are observed for the different influences of physical factors. The outdoor temperature is found to be associated with the window opening probability negatively during the cooling season, but positively during the transition and heating seasons. The indoor relative humidity positively affects the window opening probability during the transition season while a negative impact appears during the cooling and heating seasons. Based on the seasonal variation of window opening behaviors, Logistic regression models in different seasons (cooling, transition and heating seasons) are developed to predict the window opening/closing state and are verified to be promisingly adaptable with results of accuracy bigger than 70%.

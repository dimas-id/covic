Autologous stem cell transplantation(ASCT)for newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma(NDMM)has underwent recent improvements in combination with novel agents-containing induction and post-ASCT therapy. Since the approval of bortezomib for NDMM in Japan, we conducted the following regimen(BD arm)in transplant-eligible patients with NDMM: BD (bortezomib and dexamethasone)induction, ASCT, VRD consolidation, and maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory drugs(IMIDs). The efficacy and safety of the BD arm were compared to those of patients treated with vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone(VAD)induction followed by ASCT(VAD arm)retrospectively. Thirty-three patients were treated with the BD arm, and 92 patients with the VAD arm. Thirty-one patients in the BD arm proceeded to ASCT. Thereafter, 23 and 17 patients received VRD consolidation and IMIDs maintenance therapy, respectively. The rates of complete response/Bvery good partial response after ASCT, consolidation, and maintenance therapy were 43%/61%, 76%/90% and 87%/93%, respectively. The response rates after ASCT did not differ between BD and VAD arms. The median PFS was 46.2 months(BD arm)and 30.6 months(VAD arm)(HR 0.48[0.27-0.85], p=0.0106). The median OS was not-reached(BD arm)and 90.6 months(VAD arm)(HR 0.21[0.05-0.87], p=0.0172). VRD consolidation and IMIDs maintenance therapies improved disease status after ASCT and prolonged PFS and OS.

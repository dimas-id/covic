OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation to treat metastatic retroperitoneal disease in patients with gynecologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with retroperitoneal metastatic disease due to gynecologic malignancies were evaluated for imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in this study. Efficacy of treatment was assessed by post-radiofrequency ablation activity on PET/CT scans. RESULTS Eight patients were considered for imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of retroperitoneal metastatic disease. Radiofrequency ablation was successfully completed in five patients with six metastatic tumors. All procedures were performed with the use of hydrodissection as an adjunct maneuver to displace adjacent structures. All patients showed absence of FDG activity on post-radiofrequency ablation PET/CT scans. Three (60%) of the five patients showed absence of FDG activity of the treated disease at 23.5 months after radiofrequency ablation. CONCLUSION Imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation may be considered as an alternative to currently available therapies to treat recurrent metastatic disease due to endometrial carcinoma.

BACKGROUND Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) experience female sexual dysfunction (FSD). The purpose of this study was to compare FSD in different types of renal replacement therapy and control patients. METHODS The study was consisted of 47 renal transplantation (RT), 46 hemodialysis (HD), and 28 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and 36 healthy control subjects. All groups were evaluated with the following scales: Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Demographic data, laboratory values, and hormone levels were obtained. The patients with FSFI score <26.55 were accepted as experiencing sexual dysfunction. RESULTS Overall, total FSFI scores in RT, HD, CAPD, and control were 22 (range, 2-35), 22.4 (4-34), 18.35 (2-34), and 29.6 (2-35), respectively. The mean total FSFI score was not different in patients receiving different kinds of renal replacement therapy (P > .05) although they were significantly worse then the control group (P < .001). On regression analysis, age was significantly associated with FSD (Î² = -0.14; P = .001). In addition, the physiologic health domain of SF-36 was significantly better in control groups (P < .001). The difference in terms of mean of BDI score did not reach statistical significance among patient groups (P > .05). Female sexual dysfunction score was negatively correlated with BDI (r = -0.371; P < .001) and positively correlated with the mental-physical components score of SF-36 (r = 0.423 [P < .001] and r = 0.494 [P < .001], respectively) in all patients groups. Regarding the hormones of the patients, there was a significant difference between RT and the HD and CAPD groups in dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS; P < .001), RT and HD in prolactin (P < .001), and RT and CAPD in free testesterone (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Renal transplantation, hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis patients were at more risk of developing sexual dysfunction and lower quality of life scores than healthy subjects. Notably, the mode of renal replacement therapy had no impact on female sexual function.

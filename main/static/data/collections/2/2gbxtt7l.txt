OBJECTIVE To explore the epidemiological characters of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Sichuan province in order to provide evidence for prevention and control. METHODS To generate data on SARS in Sichuan province through descriptive and analytical studies on time, geographic distribution, population, source of infection, the way of case finding, symptom, diagnosis and treatment of the cases. RESULTS The peak of the epidemic last from April 16 to May 7. The number of cases in Luzhou and Guangyuan cities took up 60% of the total. Mobile population occupied 68% of the cases. Most of the patients were above the age of 20 with a sex ratio of 1.5:1 (m/f). 80% of the cases had a history of working in Guangdong province and recently returned to their hometowns. The main symptoms and signs of the SARS patients would include fever, cough and chest X-ray changes. CONCLUSION All cases were imported. Fluctuation of the epidemics was mainly affected by the mobility of working population who recently returned to their hometowns. Measures concerning the prevention and control of the epidemics would mainly target on the isolation of confirmed and suspected patients who might serve as the sources of infection through setting up quarantine station, assigned hospitals and special 'fever-clinics'.

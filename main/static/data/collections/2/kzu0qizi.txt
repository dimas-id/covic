Clinical application of siRNA-based therapeutics outside of the liver has been hindered by the inefficient delivery of siRNA effector molecules into extra-hepatic organs and cells of interest. To understand the parameters that enable RNAi activity in vivo, it is necessary to develop a systematic approach to identify which cells within a tissue are permissive to oligonucleotide internalization and activity. In the present study, we evaluate the distribution and activity within the lung of chemically stabilized siRNA to characterize cell-type tropism and structure-activity relationship. We demonstrate intratracheal delivery of fully modified siRNA for RNAi-mediated target knockdown in lung CD11c(+) cells (dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages) and alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, we use an allergen-induced model of lung inflammation to demonstrate the capacity of inhaled siRNA to induce target knockdown in dendritic cells and ameliorate lung pathology.

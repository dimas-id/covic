Infection of rats with sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) or rat coronavirus (RCV) is acute and self-limiting, and elimination and control of either virus is based on the assumption that recovered rats are immune to reinfection. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether SDAV-immune rats could be infected with RCV or reinfected with SDAV. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were inoculated intranasally with SDAV or with culture medium alone and serial SDAV antibody titers were obtained. Eleven months after inoculation, when antibody titers had stabilized, SDAV-immune and nonimmune rats were challenged with SDAV or RCV, and euthanatized 3 or 6 days later. SDAV-immune rats challenged with SDAV or RCV manifested acute rhinitis associated with virus antigen by 3 days after inoculation, but no lesions or antigen were subsequently found in the lower respiratory tract, salivary glands or lacrimal glands. There was also a marked anamnestic increase in antibody titer by 6 days after challenge. SDAV-immune rats challenged with SDAV or RCV also transmitted infection to nonimmune cage mates. This study indicates that 11 months after primary infection with SDAV, rats can be infected with SDAV or RCV, but that the severity of disease is significantly reduced.

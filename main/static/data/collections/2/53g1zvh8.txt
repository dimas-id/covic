Abstract Eosinophils have been traditionally understood as end-stage, primarily cytotoxic effector cells. Recent studies have had profound impact on this limited view and have led to new research on the functions and capabilities of this unique leukocyte lineage. Novel insights into eosinophil development, localization, modes of degranulation, and the nature of their granule contents have provided a better understanding of these cells as immunomodulatory mediators in health and disease.

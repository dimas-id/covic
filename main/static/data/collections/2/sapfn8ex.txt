In order to study the effect of glycosylation on its biological activities and to develop tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) with less deleterious effects, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) with a C9 spacer was chemically coupled to human recombinant TNFα. NeuAc-coupled TNFα (NeuAc-TNFα) exhibited reduced activities in vitro by about threefold compared to native TNFα. In this study, we examined a variety of TNFα activities in vivo. NeuAc-TNFα reduced activities in the up-regulation of serum levels of IL-6 and NOx, but comparable activity as native TNFα in the down-regulation of the serum level of glucose. However, NeuAc-TNFα was more potent than TNFα in the up-regulation of the serum level of serum amyloid A (SAA). NeuAc-TNFα was less toxic to mice. In addition, NeuAc-TNFα exhibited an augmented anti-tumor activity against Meth-A fibrosarcoma without hemorrhagic necrosis. These results indicate that coupling with NeuAc enabled us to develop neoglycoTNFα with selective activities in vivo, including enhanced anti-tumor activity but reduced toxicity.

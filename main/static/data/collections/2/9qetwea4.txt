Protein-protein interactions play a central role in biological processes and thus are an appealing target for innovative drug design and development. They can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, peptides and peptidomimetics, which represent an alternative to protein therapeutics that carry many disadvantages. In this chapter, I describe specific protein-protein interactions suggested by a novel model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoO Ligomerization (SCHOOL) model, to be critical for cell activation mediated by multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) expressed on different cells of the hematopoietic system. Unraveling a long-standing mystery of MIRR triggering and transmembrane signaling, the SCHOOL model reveals the intrareceptor transmembrane interactions and interreceptor cytoplasmic homointeractions as universal therapeutic targets for a diverse variety of disorders mediated by immune cells. Further, assuming that the general principles underlying MIRR-mediated transmembrane signaling mechanisms are similar, the SCHOOL model can be applied to any particular receptor of the MIRR family. Thus, an important application of the SCHOOL model is that global therapeutic strategies targeting key protein-protein interactions involved in MIRR triggering and transmembrane signal transduction may be used to treat a diverse set of immune-mediated diseases. This assumes that clinical knowledge and therapeutic strategies can be transferred between seemingly disparate disorders, such as T-cell-mediated skin diseases and platelet disorders, or combined to develop novel pharmacological approaches. Intriguingly, the SCHOOL model unravels the molecular mechanisms underlying ability of different human viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus to modulate and/or escape the host immune response. It also demonstrates how the lessons learned from viral pathogenesis can be used practically for rational drug design. Application of this model to platelet collagen receptor signaling has already led to the development of a novel concept of platelet inhibition and the invention of new platelet inhibitors, thus proving the suggested hypothesis and highlighting the importance and broad perspectives of the SCHOOL model in the development of new targeting strategies.

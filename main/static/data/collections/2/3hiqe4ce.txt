COVID-19 has brought the world into uncharted waters. Many countries are under lockdown, the economy has ground to a halt, and almost everyone is afraid of dire consequences. The unprecedented changes that came on so quickly due to the pandemic and stay-at-home confinement to accomplish social distancing and mitigate risk for infection pose many challenges. These include compromised health, well-being, and sleep as a consequence of disruption of the daily life routine, anxiety, worry, isolation, greater family and work stress, and excessive screen time. Our study of 203 corporate sector professionals performing '9-5' work from home during this phase of the pandemic and of 325 undergraduate and postgraduate university students substantiates, relative to the before lockdown condition, more extensive feelings of sleepiness, with significantly (p < .05) increased daytime nap duration, and depressive symptomatology (p < .001) that is a matter of concern. Moreover, the chronic stress of living through a pandemic led to a host of physical symptoms, like headaches, insomnia, digestive problems, hormonal imbalances, and fatigue.

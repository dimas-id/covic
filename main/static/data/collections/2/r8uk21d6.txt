The battle lines that have been drawn between climate change believers and deniers could not be more distinct. However, outside of the halls of power and beyond diplomatic chatter there is a subtle, if imperceptible shift heralding a potentially more impactful climate awakening. Those favoring grandiose solutions to the very real challenges posed by climate change will find no victory with the advent of true market-based solutions to climate risk. These shifts in the market are brought forth without presidential decree and signing ceremonies. Rather, they are brought about the same way each economic revolution occursâ€”with the inexorable drive among entrepreneurs, engineers, planners and risk managers tackling the immediacy of problems, with practical solutions for which the market is willing to pay.

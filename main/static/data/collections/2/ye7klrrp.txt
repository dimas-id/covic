In December 2019, highly lethal cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (COVID-19). This disease has spread rapidly around the world with thousands of confirmed cases and deaths, becoming a pandemic and challenging public health systems. There is no vaccine or scientifically proven treatment yet, but the exact behaviours that can prevent transmission and spread have been identified. This article systematizes initial available information on psychology and COVID-19. It is discussed that much of the problem of the disease can be avoided by changing peopleâ€™s behaviors and that psychology can help explain, prevent and intervene to solve it. Psychology has scientific evidence available that explains all these phenomena, evidence that should be highlighted by the same actors in the disciplines available to other areas of knowledge and especially for decision makers.

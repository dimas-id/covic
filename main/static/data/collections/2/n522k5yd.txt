One of the main problems in healthcare is the loss of tissues resulting from diseases, post-surgery complications or trauma. As a result there is a need for biomaterials designed to promote tissue regeneration and improve wound healing. This study assessed the effect of crosslinking of a porcine dermal collagen matrix with regard to strength of implant/host tissue integration, implant biocompatibility and general healing in a rodent model. Permacolâ„¢, a crosslinked acellular collagenous biomaterial was compared with its noncrosslinked equivalent at 3, 6, and 12 months postsubcutaneous implantation. Both matrices were well tolerated and showed no evidence of inflammation or adverse responses either in the host tissue or implants. Progressive integration of the implants with the surrounding tissue was observed. Cellular response was similar for both collagenous matrices although, at 3 and 6 months, noncrosslinked implants showed a significantly higher level of cellular penetration than crosslinked implants. However, at 12 months crosslinked implants showed significantly higher levels of cellular density, neo-vascularisation and integration with host tissue. Additionally, at long term, noncrosslinked implants lost volume suggesting some absorption. The crosslinking process does not seem to be detrimental to cellular response and biocompatibility.

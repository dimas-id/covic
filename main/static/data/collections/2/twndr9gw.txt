Since the long-term patency of axillofemoral (AXF) grafts is inferior to aorto-bifemoral (ABF) grafts, limb salvage procedures are crucial in this group of patients. Emerging endovascular devices have helped in the successful restoration of flow for acute limb ischemia in both native arteries as well as bypass grafts. One such device, the Trellis thrombectomy system is being used more frequently in this setting. The device has previously been used in veins, native arteries, and rarely in aortofemoral grafts. We present its first successful use for the treatment of occluded AXF bypass graft. The use of this device helped to isolate the treatment zone in the occluded graft, which allowed the use of a lower dose of thrombolytics, less systemic release of thrombolytics, and less distal embolization. Resolution of extensive clot burden was achieved and, with subsequent stenting of the graft at the distal anastomotic site, arterial flow to the leg through the AXF graft was restored and a revision surgery was avoided.

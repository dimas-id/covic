The diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 forced the Italian population to restrictive measures that modified the patientsâ€™ response to non-SARS-CoV-2 medical conditions. We evaluated all ACS-patients admitted in three high-volume hospitals during the first month of SARS-CoV-2 Italian-outbreak and compared them to ACS-patients admitted during the same period 1-year before. Hospitalization for ACS decreased from 162 patients in 2019 vs 2020:84 patients in 2020. In 2020 both door-to-balloon and symptoms-to-PCI were longer and admission levels of hs-cTnI were higher. They had a lower discharged residual LV-function and an increased predicted late cardiovascular mortality based on their GRACE score.

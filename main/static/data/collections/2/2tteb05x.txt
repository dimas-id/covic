Translational frameshifting is a ubiquitous, if rare, form of alternative decoding in which ribosomes spontaneously shift reading frames during translation elongation. In studying +1 frameshifting in Ty retrotransposons of the yeast S. cerevisiae, we previously showed that unusual P site tRNAs induce frameshifting. The frameshift-inducing tRNAs we show here are near-cognates for the P site codon. Their abnormal decoding induces frameshifting in either of two ways: weak codon-anticodon pairing allows the tRNA to disengage from the mRNA and slip +1, or an unusual codon-anticodon structure interferes with cognate in-frame decoding allowing out-of-frame decoding in the A site. We draw parallels between this mechanism and a proposed mechanism of frameshift suppression by mutant tRNAs.

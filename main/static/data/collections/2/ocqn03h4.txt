Molecular biological techniques have evolved expeditiously and in turn have been applied to the detection of infectious disease. Maturation of these technologies and their coupling with related technological advancement in fluorescence, electronics, digitization, nanodynamics, and sensors among others have afforded clinical medicine additional tools toward expedient identification of infectious organisms at concentrations and sensitivities previously unattainable. These advancements have been adapted in select settings toward addressing clinical demands for more timely and effective patient management.

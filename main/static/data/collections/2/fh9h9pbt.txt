Currently, there is no effective antiviral therapy or immune-based treatments for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the urgent challenge is to prevent the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe. In this paper, we provide nocturnal oxygen therapy as a new option for the patients with COVID-19 under home quarantine, and suggest that nocturnal oxygen therapy at the early stage may be helpful to prevent the disease from mild to worse by inhibiting the rapid replication of the virus and improving the body's antiviral ability.

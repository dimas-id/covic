BACKGROUND Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double-flap technique (LPG-DFT) and laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy (LSTG) may replace laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for proximal early gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes after LPG-DFT and LSTG. METHODS Patients who underwent LPG-DFT or LSTG at the Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo between January 2006 and April 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Operative procedures were selected based on the distance from the cardia to the proximal boundary of the tumour, tumour location and predicted remnant stomach volume. Patient characteristics, surgical data, markers of postoperative nutritional status, such as blood chemistry and bodyweight loss, and endoscopic findings were compared between procedures. The main study outcome was nutritional status. RESULTS A total of 161 patients (LPG-DFT 51, LSTG 110) were included. Types of postoperative complication occurring more than 30 days after surgery differed between the two procedures. Remnant stomach ulcers, including anastomotic ulcers, were observed only after LPG-DFT, whereas complications involving the small intestine, such as internal hernia or small bowel obstruction, occurred more frequently after LSTG. Values for total protein, albumin, prealbumin and bodyweight loss were comparable between the two procedures at 36 months after surgery. Haemoglobin concentrations were higher after LPG-DFT than after LSTG at 24 months (13·4 versus 12·8 g/dl respectively; P = 0·045) and 36 months (13·5 versus 12·8 g/dl; P = 0·007) after surgery. The rate of Los Angeles grade B or more severe reflux oesophagitis was comparable. CONCLUSION LPG-DFT and LSTG for proximal early gastric cancer have similar outcomes, but different types of complication.

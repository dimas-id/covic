BACKGROUND Proper defect closure during abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) is a key to improving cosmetic and functional results, and reducing morbidity. We have completed the initial prospective evaluation of a technique we previously described and published: endoscopic subcutaneous anterior component separation (ACS) as an adjunct to mainly laparoscopic AWR. We now present the long-term clinical and imaging follow-up results. STUDY DESIGN Data were prospectively collected over a 3-year period (2012-2015) on patients who underwent AWR with endoscopic ACS. Inclusion criteria included the following: defects of 6-15 cm that are longer than wider; no skin dystrophy; no loss of domain; no active infection; no previous multiple, complex repairs; no previous multiple mesh repairs; and no high probability of severe adhesions. All patients were followed up clinically at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and then annually. All patients underwent CT scanning of the abdominal wall (sagittal, axial, coronal, and 3D reconstruction) at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively and then annually. RESULTS Twenty consecutive patients underwent adjunctive endoscopic ACS: 17 laparoscopic AWRs, 2 open repairs, and 1 hybrid repair. Up to 38 months (mean 21 months) of follow-up, there were no ventral hernia recurrences or de novo hernias at the ACS site. One patient experienced partial primary closure failure. Morbidity consisted in one case each of hematoma, seroma, and transient neuralgia. Cosmetic results and patient satisfaction were excellent. CONCLUSION We confirmed that endoscopic subcutaneous ACS is a safe, effective, reliable, reproducible technique that facilitates primary closure of defects during AWR in selected patients.

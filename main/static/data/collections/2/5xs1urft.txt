Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was recently identified as a cause of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection in children and adults. The epidemiology is similar to that exhibited by respiratory syncytial virus, with most episodes occurring during the winter months. The virus likely has a worldwide distribution. Almost all children have been infected by five years of age. The suspicion of hMPV infection should be higher in infants or children presenting with symptoms compatible with a viral etiology and in whom screening tests for other common viral pathogens have been negative. Clinical manifestations may be subtle or severe, including life-threatening bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Fever, rhinorrhea, cough, retractions, tachypnea and wheezing are common findings. Bronchiolitis is perhaps the most common manifestation among hospitalized children. Currently, there is no antiviral treatment or vaccine available and management is simply supportive.

Robotic thyroidectomy (RT) is a new gasless, scarless technique which utilises the da Vinci™ surgical robot to excise thyroid tumours. Anaesthetic management must be modified according to the patient position and robotic surgery equipment. Anaesthesiologists need to be geared up to face the new challenges posed by advancements in surgical techniques in order to maintain patient safety. Another vital aspect of this surgery is documenting possible recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, for which a C-Mac D-Blade™ video laryngoscope serves as a valuable tool. Post-operative pain management in RT also merits special attention.

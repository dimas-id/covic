The aim of our study is to propose a remote patient monitoring solution through a smart phone application (Smart Patient) collecting health data to support diagnosis, monitoring and predicting poor outcome in asymptomatic/mild cases of COVID-19, including signs and symptoms, risk factors, comorbidities, medications and vital signs such as body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation. By continuous daily recording of suspected cases and patients, family doctors in the community will be able to follow up cases and intervene promptly when deterioration in vital signs and symptoms takes place referring the patient to the hospital.

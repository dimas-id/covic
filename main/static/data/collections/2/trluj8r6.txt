An antigen detection assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was established in this study by an indirect immunofluorescence test, which utilized cells derived from throat wash samples of patients with SARS and a rabbit serum that recognized the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but not that of other human coronavirus tested. It detected SARS-CoV in 11 of 17 (65%) samples from SARS patients as early as day 2 of illness but in none of the 10 samples from healthy controls. Compared with other diagnostic modalities for detecting SARS-CoV, this assay is simpler, more convenient, and economical. It could be an alternative for early and rapid diagnosis, should SARS return in the future.

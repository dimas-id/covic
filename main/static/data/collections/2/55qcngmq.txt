PURPOSE We report our experience with bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease. MATERIALS & METHODS Between November 2009 and November 2010, 3 patients with adult polycystic kidney disease underwent bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in our institution. Indications for bilateral nephrectomy included recurrent cyst hemorrhage, impaired gastrointestinal function and early satiety due to direct intestinal compression by large polycystic kidneys, and anatomical lack of space for future renal transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed the records of these patients and we are reporting our experience. RESULTS All three patients successfully underwent bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy with a mean operating time of 208 minutes (range 195 to 220). There were no conversions to open procedure. Blood loss was less than 100 ml in all cases. Mean renal unit size was of 2037 g (range 1798 to 2214). Hospital stay ranged from 10 to 12 days. One patient developed a chest infection postoperatively and suffered from a prolonged ileus. Another patient developed a retroperitoneal hematoma, which was treated conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy is a feasible and safe procedure in adult polycystic kidney disease patients, which has potential benefits of a shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and mortality in comparison to open procedure.

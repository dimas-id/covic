H2O2 is a reactive oxygen species that has drawn much interest because of its role as a second messenger in receptor-mediated signaling. Mammalian 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have been shown to eliminate efficiently the H2O2 generated in response to receptor stimulation. 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are members of a novel peroxidase family that catalyze the H2O2 reduction reaction in the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. Several lines of evidence suggest that 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have dual roles as regulators of the H2O2 signal and as defenders of oxidative stress. In particular, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin appears to provide selective, specific and localized control of receptor-mediated signal transduction. Thus, the therapeutic potential of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins is clear for diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, that involve reactive oxygen species.

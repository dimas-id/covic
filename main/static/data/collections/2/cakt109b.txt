BACKGROUND Robotic surgery is gaining popularity for digestive surgery; however, its use for liver surgery is reported scarcely. This article reviews a surgeon's experience with the use of robotic surgery for liver resections. METHODS From March 2002 to March 2009, 70 robotic liver resections were performed at 2 different centers by a single surgeon. The surgical procedure and postoperative outcome data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Malignant tumors were indications for resections in 42 (60%) patients, whereas benign tumors were indications in 28 (40%) patients. The median age was 60 years (range, 21-84) and 57% of patients were female. Major liver resections (â‰¥ 3 liver segments) were performed in 27 (38.5%) patients. There were 4 conversions to open surgery (5.7%). The median operative time for a major resection was 313 min (range, 220-480) and 198 min (range, 90-459) for minor resection. The median blood loss was 150 mL (range, 20-1,800) for minor resection and 300 mL (range, 100-2,000) for major resection. The mortality rate was 0%, and the overall rate of complications was 21%. Major morbidity occurred in 4 patients in the major hepatectomies group (14.8%) and in 4 patients in the minor hepatectomies group (9.3%). All complications were managed conservatively and none required reoperation. CONCLUSION This preliminary experience shows that robotic surgery can be used safely for liver resections with a limited conversion rate, blood loss, and postoperative morbidity. Robotics offers a new technical option for minimally invasive liver surgery.

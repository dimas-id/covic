Nanoparticles may be used in vaccinology as an antigen delivery and/or an immunostimulant to enhance immunity. Porous silica has been identified as an effective adjuvant for more than a decade, and we have therefore investigated the take up rate by an immortalized macrophage-like cell line of a number of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) with differing diameter and pore size. The MSNPs were synthesized using a sol-gel reaction and post-synthesis removal of the template. The MSNPs showed a clear distribution in take up rate peaking at 217 nm, whereas a comparison with solid spherical nanoparticles showed a similar distribution peaking at 377 nm. The MSNPs were investigated before and after loading with antigen. Diphtheria toxoid was used as a proof-of-concept antigen and showed a peak macrophage internalization of 53.42% for loaded LP3 particles which had a diameter of 217.75 ± 5.44 nm and large 16.5 nm pores. Optimal MSNP sizes appeared to be in the 200–400 nm range, and larger pores showed better antigen loading. The mesoporous silica particles were shown to be generally biocompatible, and cell viability was not altered by the loading of particles with or without antigen. [Figure: see text]

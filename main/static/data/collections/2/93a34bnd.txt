Background: The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 remains poorly understood by clinicians. Identifying biologic markers associated with prognosis can help clinicians recognize disease severity. Objective: To describe the association between D-dimer, CRP, IL-6, ferritin, LDH, and clinical outcomes in a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated on the inpatient medical service at a university hospital in Washington, DC. Design: In this retrospective study, we included all adults admitted to the inpatient medicine service at George Washington University Hospital between March 12, 2020 and May 9, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors not requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring intubation, and non-survivors. Key Results: 299 patients were included in our study, of whom 69 required transfer to the ICU, 39 required intubation, and 71 died. Threshold values for IL-6 (>50 pg/mL), D-dimer (>3 mcg/mL), ferritin (>450 ng/mL), CRP (>100 mg/L), and LDH (1,200 u/L) were found to be statistically significant and independently associated with higher odd of clinical deterioration and death. Hypertension, CVA and heart disease independently had an increased risk of all three outcomes, while CKD had only an increased risk of death. Patient co-morbidities had no effect on the different biomarkers' significant association with poor patient clinical outcomes, except cancer. Conclusion: Laboratory markers of inflammation and coagulopathy can help clinicians identify patients who are at high risk for clinical deterioration, independent of clinically significant medical comorbidities

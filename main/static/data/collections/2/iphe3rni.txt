Whipple’s disease is one of the rare maladies in terms of spread but very fatal one as it is linked with many disorders (like Gastroenteritis, Endocarditis etc.). Also, current regimens include less effective drugs which require long duration follows up. This exploratory study was conducted to commence the investigation for crafting multi target epitope vaccine against its bacterial pathogen Tropheryma whipplei. The modern bioinformatics tools like VaxiJen, NETMHCII PAN 3.2, ALLERGEN-FP, PATCH-DOCK, TOXIC-PRED, MHCPRED and IEDB were deployed, which makes the study more intensive in analyzing proteome of T. whipplei as these methods are based on robust result generating statistical algorithms ANN, HMM, and ML. This Immuno-Informatics approach leads us in the prediction of two epitopes: VLMVSAFPL and IRYLAALHL interacting with 4 and 6 HLA DRB1 alleles of MHC Class II respectively. VLMVSAFPL epitope is a part of DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta, and IRYLAALHL epitope is a part of membranous protein insertase YidC of this bacterium. Molecular-Docking and Molecular-Simulation analysis yields the perfect interaction based on Atomic contact energy, binding scores along with RMSD values (0 to 1.5 Ǻ) in selection zone. The IEDB (Immune epitope database) population coverage analysis exhibits satisfactory relevance with respect to world population.

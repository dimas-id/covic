The American College of Radiology recommends minimizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in COVID‐19 patients, postponing non‐urgent exams, and using alternative imaging.(1)Sedation/anesthesia are aerosol generating procedures (AGP) due to requirement of bag‐mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation with consequent risk of exposure to healthcare workers. This is complicated by limitation in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the magnet zone (Zone IV).We describe our experience for children requiring anesthesia for emergency MRI during the COVID‐19 outbreak in Philadelphia.

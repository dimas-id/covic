In this paper the characterization of a canine-coronavirus (CCV) strain isolated in Spain is reported. The CCV cellular-infection cycle on A-72 cells was studied using electron-microscopy techniques. The isolate was found to have similar electrophoretic profile and antigenic properties to an American reference strain. Sera samples were obtained from several canine populations and tested for viral antibodies using two immunoenzymatic methods. Sera specificity was confirmed using immunoblot analysis. The agreement between both ELISA tests produced adequate results (kappa value = 0.64).

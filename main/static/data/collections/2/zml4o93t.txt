The SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and associated COVID‐19 disease are straining healthcare systems around the world with large numbers of patients becoming ill in a very short period of time, overwhelming healthcare systems in many countries. Several drugs are being repurposed into clinical trials in COVID‐19 patients, ranging from drugs already well established in other diseases, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ ritonavir, azithromycin and tocilizumab/sarilumab, to those such as remdesivir still in development for their initial indication (1). The opportunities for clinical pharmacology to contribute to the development of new treatments have already been described by others in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2).

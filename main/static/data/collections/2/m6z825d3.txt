AIMS OF THE STUDY To evaluate post-operative complications and the recurrence rate after repair of large ventral incisional hernia with an open technique using intraperitoneal composite mesh and an associated aponeurotic overlay. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective study included a total of 280 patients who underwent repair of large incisional hernia using Parietex(®) composite mesh. RESULTS The post-operative mortality rate was 0.35%. Six patients (2%) developed subcutaneous surgical site infection without infection of the prosthesis. Six other patients (2%) developed a deep-seated infection; in three cases, the mesh had to be removed. Nine patients (3.2%) developed recurrent incisional hernia. CONCLUSION Large ventral incisional hernias can be effectively treated by the intraperitoneal placement of Parietex(®) composite mesh overlaid by an aponeurotic graft; the incidence of complications in this prospective study was very low.

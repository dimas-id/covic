Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been widely used in the resection of small pulmonary lesions in the clinical practice. The accurate preoperative localization of small pulmonary lesions is significant to guide the operation. We report a thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) guided injection of methylene blue combined with hookwire to localize the small pulmonary lesion in a 50-year-old woman. We successfully performed VATS followed by the combined localization of these two methods. This localization method has a higher accuracy and fewer complications, which can effectively guide the surgical resection.

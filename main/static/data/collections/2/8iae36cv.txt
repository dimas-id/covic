The mortality and severity in COVID-19 is increased in patients with comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with underlying kidney and liver diseases. We retrieved data on the clinical features and primary composite end point of COVID-19 patients from Medline and Embase which had been released from inception by the April 16, 2020. The data on two comorbidities, liver diseases and chronic kidney disease, were pooled and statistically analysed to explain the associated severity and mortality rate. One hundred and forty-two abstracts were screened, and 41 full articles were then read. In total, 22 studies including 5595 COVID-19 patients were included in this study with case fatality rate of 16%. The prevalence of liver diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were 3% (95% CI; 2–3%) and 1% (95% CI; 1–2%), respectively. In patients with COVID-19 and underlying liver diseases, 57.33% (43/75) of cases were severe, with 17.65% mortality, while in CKD patients, 83.93% (47/56) of cases were severe and 53.33% (8/15) mortality was reported. This study found an increased risk of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with liver diseases or CKD. This will lead to better clinical management and inform the process of implementing more stringent preventative measures for this group of patients.

We present three patients with dissecting and saccular aneurysms affecting the cervical carotid and vertebral arteries treated with flow diversion using the Pipeline Embolization Device (ev3 Endovascular Inc/Covidien, Plymouth, Minn). The device was successfully deployed in all three patients without complication. Follow-up imaging studies at 8 to 18 months revealed complete occlusion of all three aneurysms. This device may be a valuable alternative to stent-graft devices in the treatment of cervical aneurysms since it is delivered through a microcatheter that is better able to negotiate tortuous anatomy of cervical carotid and vertebral arteries.

BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment of large and giant intracranial aneurysms and long-term results of angiographic follow-up of these aneurysms treated endovascularly are not known currently. PURPOSE To investigate the outcome of endovascular treatment of large and giant aneurysms and the long-term angiographic follow-up results. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients with endovascular treatment of large and giant aneurysms between 1998 and 2009 was performed. There were 90 large or giant aneurysms treated with coiling alone, stent-assisted coiling, covered-stent deployment, or parent artery occlusion (PAO) in 88 patients (female/male, 54/34; age range, 23-92 years; mean age, 56 years). RESULTS Immediately after the initial endovascular embolization procedure, complete occlusion was achieved in 56.7%, near complete occlusion in 37.8%, and incomplete occlusion in 5.5%. The total periprocedural complication rate excluding subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm was 10.2% with a mortality rate of 2.3%. Follow-up angiography was performed in all of the aneurysms with the longest follow-up duration of 131 months. Among 38 aneurysms initially treated with coiling alone and 17 initially treated with stent-assisted coiling, 22 (57.9%) and four (23.5%) recurred, respectively, during follow-up. No recurrence occurred in aneurysms initially treated with covered-stent deployment or PAO. Aneurysm recurrence was predominantly seen in older and female patients, in larger aneurysms, and in aneurysms treated with coiling alone. Twenty-three aneurysms were successfully retreated endovascularly. CONCLUSION Endovascular intervention with coiling alone or stent-assisted coiling for large and giant cerebral aneurysms is not very effective, while covered stents are more promising. Better endovascular devices are needed to obtain more secure closure.

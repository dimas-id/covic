OBJECTIVES To discuss the feasibility, safety and superiority of novel approaches in single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection in different genders. METHODS The clinical data of patients who underwent thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection were analysed. A total of 197 consecutive male patients from January 2012 to December 2014, and 72 female patients from June 2013 to December 2014 were included retrospectively. Of the males, 65 received a transareolar single-port procedure (TASP Group) and 132 received a standard two-port procedure (Standard Group A). Among the females, 18 were treated with a subxiphoid single-port procedure (SXSP Group), and 54 were treated with the standard procedure (Standard Group B). The general clinical materials and surgical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS All patients underwent total thoracoscopic wedge resection successfully, and no severe complications were observed. In men, there were no significant differences in operation time, blood loss, postoperative drainage amount, chest drainage duration, postoperative hospital stay or pain score on the first postoperative day (P = 0.827; 0.423; 0.174; 0.440; 0.115; 0.159, respectively). The pain scores of the TASP Group on the day before and after removal of the chest tube were lower (P = 0.006; 0.023, respectively) than those of Standard Group A, and the incision-associated paraesthesia in the third and sixth month after operation was reduced (P = 0.041; 0.026, respectively). The incision satisfaction degree was significantly improved in the TASP Group (P = 0.001). In women, there were no significant differences in blood loss, drainage amount, chest drainage duration or postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.680; 0.757; 0.651; 0.608, respectively). The operation time of the SXSP Group was longer (P = 0.000), and the pain scores on the first postoperative day and the days before and after removal were all significantly lower (P = 0.000; 0.000; 0.000, respectively) than those of the Standard Group B. Furthermore, the incision paraesthesia 3 and 6 months after surgery was greatly reduced (P = 0.001; 0.001, respectively), although the patients were not very satisfied with the cosmetic results (P = 0.577). CONCLUSIONS In single-port thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection, we performed 'individualized' procedures based on gender, namely, the transareolar approach in males and the subxiphoid approach in females. These procedures were considered feasible and safe, and showed superiority in reducing postoperative pain. However, the cosmetic results of the subxiphoid approach require further improvement.

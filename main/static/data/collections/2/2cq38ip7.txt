BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Hybrid-natural orifice surgery combines the advantages of traditional transabdominal laparoscopic surgery, while limiting surgical trauma to the abdominal wall. Among various routes of intra-abdominal access, the transvaginal method is most appealing because of its utility and proven safety. We describe a series of 4 colonic resections performed with this approach, combined with minilaparoscopy and needlescopic approaches, and discuss the technical aspects, efficacy, and applicability of this technique. METHODS Three patients were selected to undergo hybrid transvaginal natural-orifice right hemicolectomy. A fourth patient, who underwent a segmental resection of a splenic flexure carcinoma, was included. Transvaginal port access was obtained via posterior colpotomy, and was used for dissection, vascular ligation, bowel division, and anastomosis. We used a combination of standard laparoscopic, minilaparoscopic, and needlescopic instruments transabdominally, focusing on reduced size and number of access points. RESULTS Duration of laparoscopy, oncologic outcomes and rate of operative morbidity were comparable to the published literature. Early return of gastrointestinal function and low analgesic requirements was observed in all patients. No morbidity related to transvaginal access was observed and the procedure was performed without difficulty in all cases. CONCLUSION Colonic resection performed by hybrid natural-orifice technique offers several advantages over purely transabdominal laparoscopic procedures. Transvaginal access is easy to perform and offers excellent safety, efficacy, and versatility, especially for right hemicolectomy. Techniques to reduce abdominal wall surgical trauma, such as minilaparoscopy and needlescopic graspers, can be combined effectively in colonic resections, and may act synergistically to reduce postoperative pain and improve outcomes.

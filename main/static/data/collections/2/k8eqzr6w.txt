By many expert opinions, the COVID 19 epidemic is still much in its developing stages. While awaiting for effective clinical answers for the outbreak, the best approach remains that of social distancing. This raises a few crucial questions related to the extent to which social distancing measures were (1) well timed, (2) necessary and (3) efficient. By investigating correlations between epidemic measures such as daily infection rate, and social mobility measures (as reported by Apple and Google), our study aims to establish whether data identifies social distancing measures as a primary player in controlling the outbreak in New York State.

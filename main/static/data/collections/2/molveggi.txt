BACKGROUND The current situation in obesity and metabolic surgery since January 2005 has been investigated with the help of the quality assurance study on surgical therapy for obesity = German Bariatric Surgery Registry (GBSR). The data were acquired and analysed in cooperation with the Institute for Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine at the Otto-von-Guericke University. METHODS Data acquisition was done with the help of an online database. On a voluntary basis, all obesity and metabolic surgical interventions since 2005 have been recorded. In addition to the surgical data, the findings of the yearly follow-up investigations were recorded. RESULTS Since 2005 there have been 1,263 gastric balloon procedures, 11,840 sleeve gastrectomies, 13,722 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses and 3999 gastric banding operations. The average age of the male patients in all interventions was significantly higher. The average BMI of female patients who received a gastric banding or a gastric balloon procedure was significantly lower than that of the male patients. Men exhibited a higher incidence of comorbidities than women. CONCLUSION The number of obesity and metabolic surgical interventions in Germany is continuously increasing. The results of the study on surgical therapy for obesity (GBSR) reveal significant differences in the gender-specific incidence of preoperative comorbidities. postoperative complications and mortality. Further studies on gender-specific aspects are necessary in order to optimise patient selection and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications.

Recent evidence has confirmed that a mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene occurs early in gliomagenesis and contributes to suppressed immunity. The present study aimed to determine the candidate genes associated with IDH mutation status that could serve as biomarkers of immune suppression for improved prognosis prediction. Clinical information and RNA-seq gene expression data were collected for 932 glioma samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases, and differentially expressed genes in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) samples were identified according to IDH mutation status. Only one gene, interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), with reduced expression in IDH mutant tumors, demonstrated significant prognostic value. ISG20 expression level significantly increased with increasing tumor grade, and its high expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, increased ISG20 expression was associated with increased infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, and suppressed adaptive immune response. ISG20 expression was also positively correlated with PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 expression, along with the levels of several chemokines. We conclude that ISG20 is a useful biomarker to identify IDH-mediated immune processes in glioma and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

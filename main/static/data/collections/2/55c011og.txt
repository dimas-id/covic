Codon usage bias (CUB) arises from the preference for a codon over codons for the same amino acid. The major factors contributing to CUB are evolutionary forces, compositional properties, gene expression, and protein properties. The present analysis was performed to investigate the compositional properties and the extent of CUB across the genomes of members of the family Hepadnaviridae, as previously no work using bioinformatic tools has been reported. The viral genes were found to be AT rich with low CUB. Analysis of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) was used to identify overrepresented and underrepresented codons for each amino acid. Correlation analysis of overall nucleotide composition and its composition at the third codon position suggested that mutation pressure might influence the CUB. A highly significant correlation was observed between GC12 and GC3 (r = 0.910, p < 0.01), indicating that directional mutation affected all three codon positions across the genome. Translational selection (P2) and mutational responsive index (MRI) values of genes suggested that mutation plays a more important role than translational selection in members of the family Hepadnaviridae.

BACKGROUND: Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus discovered in 2005 from individuals suffering gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infections. Numerous studies related to the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HBoV have been conducted worldwide. This review reports on HBoV studies in individuals with acute gastroenteritis, with and without respiratory tract infections in Africa between 2005 and 2016. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The search engines of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase database for published articles of HBoV were used to obtain data between 2005 and 2016. The search words included were as follows: studies performed in Africa or/other developing countries or/worldwide; studies for the detection of HBoV in patients with/without diarrhea and respiratory tract infection; studies using standardized laboratory techniques for detection. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 756 publications with 70 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies included children and individuals of all age groups. HBoV prevalence in Africa was 13% in individuals suffering gastroenteritis with/without respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSION: Reports suggest that HBoV infections are increasingly being recognized worldwide. Therefore, surveillance of individuals suffering from infections in Africa is required to monitor the prevalence of HBoV and help understand the role of HBoV in individuals suffering from gastroenteritis with/without respiratory tract infection.

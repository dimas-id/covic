Rapid serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been questioned by scientists and the public because of unexplored effects of negative test results on behaviour and attitudes, that could lower the level of adherence to protective measures. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the changes in personal attitudes and behaviour before and after negative serological test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We conducted a survey questionnaire on 200 industry workers (69% males and 31% females) that have been previously tested negative. The survey examined participants' self-reported general attitudes towards COVID-19, sense of fear, as well as their behaviour related to protective measures before and after the testing. The participants perceived the disease as a severe health threat and acknowledged the protective measures as appropriate. They reported a high level of adherence to measures and low level of fear both before and after the testing. Although those indicators were statistically significantly reduced after the test (P < 0.004), they did not result in risk behaviour. Therefore, the serological tests are not an additional threat regarding the risk behaviour in an environment where protective measures are efficient. In contrast, they might contribute to reducing the fear in the society and working environment.

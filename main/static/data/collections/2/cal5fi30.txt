We report a case of acute viral pericarditis and cardiac tamponade in a patient with COVID-19 to highlight the associated treatment challenges, especially given the uncertainty associated with the safety of standard treatment We also discuss complications associated with delayed diagnosis in patients who potentially may need mechanical ventilation LEARNING POINTS: Large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade should be considered in patients with COVID-19 who decompensate further after intubation and mechanical ventilation The characteristics of pericardial effusion in patients with COVID-19 are described A successful treatment approach for acute pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 in light of differing opinions over the safety of NSAID use is described

BACKGROUND Liver volumetry is a critical component of safe hepatic surgery, in order to minimize the risk of postoperative liver failure. Liver volumes can be calculated routinely using the time-consuming gold standard method of manual volumetry. The current work sought to evaluate an alternative automatic technique based on a novel 3D virtual planning software, and to compare it to the manual technique. METHODS A prospective study of patients undergoing liver resection was conducted. Every patient had a pre and 2-day postoperative CT-scan. For each patient, total, remnant and resected volumes were calculated manually and automatically. Planes of resection were verified by a hepatobiliary surgeon and compared with postoperative volumes. Paired t-tests and correlation coefficients were calculated. RESULTS A major hepatectomy was carried out in 36/43 patients. The automatic TLV (1,759 mL) and the manual TLV (1,832 mL) were significantly different (p < 0.001), but extremely highly correlated (r = 0.989). The percentages of preoperative RLV (manual 58.5%, automatic 58.9%) were similar, with an excellent correlation of 0.917. The preoperative RLV were matched with the 2-day postoperative RLV showing a significant difference (p = 0.0301). The resected volumes using both techniques (871 and 832 mL) were compared with the resected specimen volume (670 mL), showing a significant difference (p < 0.001) but a high degree of correlation (r = 0.874). CONCLUSION The 3D virtual surgical planning software is accurate and reliable in determining the total liver and future remnant liver volumes. This technique demonstrates a good correlation with the manual technique. Future work will be required to confirm these findings and to evaluate the clinical value of the three-dimensional planning platform.

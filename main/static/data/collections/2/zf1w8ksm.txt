OBJECTIVE: To describe the radiographic and ultrasonographic characteristics of the spleen and abdominal lymph nodes in clinically healthy ferrets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty‐five clinically healthy ferrets were prospectively recruited for this cross‐sectional study. Three‐view whole body radiographs and abdominal ultrasonography were performed on awake (23 out of 55) or sedated (32 out of 55) ferrets. On radiographs splenic and abdominal lymph node visibility was assessed. Splenic thickness and echogenicity and lymph node length, thickness, echogenicity, number and presence of cyst‐like changes were recorded. RESULTS: The spleen was radiographically detectable in all ferrets. On ultrasound the spleen was hyperechoic to the liver (55 out of 55) and mildly hyperechoic (28 out of 55), isoechoic (15 out of 55) or mildly hypoechoic (12 out of 55) to the renal cortices. Mean splenic thickness was 11.80 ±0.34 mm. Lymph nodes were radiographically discernible in 28 out of 55 ferrets and included caudal mesenteric and sublumbar nodes. An average of 9 ±2 lymph nodes (mean± standard deviation; mode 10) were identified in each ferret using ultrasound. A single large jejunal lymph node was identified in all ferrets and had a mean thickness of 5.28 ± 1.66 mm. For other lymph nodes the mean thickness measurements plus one standard deviation were less than 4.4 mm (95% confidence interval: ≤ 3.72 mm). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The information provided in this study may act as a baseline for evaluation of the spleen and lymph nodes in ferrets.

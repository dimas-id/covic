Every year, 50,000 people die with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). At least 5.3 million Americans live with long-term disabilities related to TBI. Through its TBI-associated research and programs, CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) seeks to reduce the adverse consequences of TBIs by ensuring that data, data systems, and public awareness about TBI are in place. The public health model provides a useful framework for identifying important efforts needed to reduce the impact of this potentially disabling injury.

Abstract Background Influenza (FLUV) and human respiratory syncytial (HRSV) viruses are etiological agents of respiratory infections that cause a significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. A rapid and accurate diagnosis of these respiratory viruses is essential for an appropriate patient management. Molecular tests are the best detection option due to their high sensitivity and specificity. Seegene’s Allplex™ Respiratory Panel 1 (Allplex RP1) is a real-time one-step RT-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV-A and HRSV-B. In addition, it allows the determination of FLUAV subtype (H1, H3 and H1pdm09). Objectives This study aims to evaluate Allplex RP1 as a rapid molecular test for the detection of FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV-A and HRSV-B viruses. Study design The Allplex RP1 assay will be compared with other two commercial molecular assays, Prodesse ProFlu+ and ProFAST+ (Hologic, Madison, WI, USA), and GeneXpert Flu/RSV XC (Cepheid, USA). Results Allplex RP1, ProFlu+ and GeneXpert tests showed 95%, 91% and 96% of accuracy; and 94%, 88% and 95% of sensitivity, respectively. Moreover, Allplex RP1 showed a FLUAV subtype sensitivity of 91% and 88% for FLUAV-H1pdm09 and FLUAV-H3 respectively, and ProFAST+ assay showed sensitivities of 100% for both targets. The three assays showed a 100% of specificity and PPV, while the NPV were 84%, 73% and 86% for Allplex RP1, Prodesse and GeneXpert, respectively. Conclusions In this study, Seegene’s Allplex RP1 assay showed to be highly sensitive, specific, and suitable for detection of FLUV and HRSV, including FLUAV subtyping. In addition, it is also a hands-on-time saving assay due to the automated nucleic acid extraction and PCR setup.

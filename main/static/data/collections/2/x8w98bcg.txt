During coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there continues to be a need to utilize cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories for emergent and urgent procedures. Per infection prevention guidelines and hospital codes, catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories are usually built as positive-pressure ventilation rooms to minimize the infection risk. However, patients with highly transmissible airborne diseases such as COVID-19 are best caredfor in negative ventilation rooms to minimize the risk of transmission. From a mechanical and engineering perspective, positive-pressure ventilation rooms cannot be readily converted to negative-pressure ventilation rooms. In this report, we describe a novel, quick, readily implantable, and resource-friendly approach on how to secure air quality in catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories by converting a positive-pressure ventilation room to a two-zone negative ventilation system to minimize the risk of transmission.

The complications of tattoos are multiple and known for many years. However, their success explains their exponential multiplication in all countries. This confirmed the development of two new complications: a localized or remote skin sarcoidosis reaction, as well as the development of clinical and histological uveitis. This is in the context of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, or a granulomatous reaction. Their prevention remains rather poorly known. It requires that each tattoo-carrying subject perform a systemic sarcoidosis check-up as well as an ophthalmological investigation in search of possible uveitis. If confirmed, preventive and therapeutic measures will be carried out in emergencies to avoid blindness. These new complications confirm the extreme severity of the use of uncontrolled inks, real toxic and sensitizing mixtures, especially apparently during extensive colorful tattoos. These particularly aggressive colored inks release multiple substances and nanoparticles into the body, not all of which are measured in the medium and long term.

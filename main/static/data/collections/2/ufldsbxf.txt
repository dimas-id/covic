Here we present a pediatric case of human papilloma virus associated with dermatopathic lymphadenitis (DL). A 5-year-old boy presented to the pediatric oncology clinic with swelling of the neck and warts on his lower jaw. His blood chemistry and complete blood count were normal, as was chest x-ray. HIV, EBV, CMV, and parvovirus serologies were negative. The patient was investigated for malignancy and lymphoma but no association was found. Histopathologic examination of the lymph node and the lesion revealed DL and verruca vulgaris, respectively. DL represents a benign form of reactive lymph node hyperplasia and described in patients with HIV and EBV infections. It is a rare entity described in patients with human papilloma virus infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of DL in a patient with human papilloma virus infection.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2 ) infection is usually diagnosed by a positive PCR test in respiratory samples. While the respiratory PCR may remain positive for 2-3 weeks in the general population there have been occasional reports of persistent and recurrent positive SARS-COV2 PCR beyond 4 weeks despite clinical resolution 1-6 .

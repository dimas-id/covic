My first call was a 56 y/o male with hepatitis C-induced cirrhosis. He successfully cleared the virus with treatment and was very compliant with his surveillance ultrasounds for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Exactly the first day our institution, as most in the state, chose to close elective clinics due to the COVID-19 pandemic I received the results from his magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confirming that the lesion in the previous week's ultrasound was indeed HCC. Video-visits were in the horizon but not yet available, so I had the task of explaining to him over the phone that this time the test showed he had cancer. I have gone through this process countless times, face to face in a ritual that involves silent moments while sensing the subtle feeling of fear in my patient's faces being covered by stoicism.

Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 encodes a papain-like cysteine proteinase (PLP-1) that, during translation of ORF1a, cleaves p28 from the amino terminus of the growing polypeptide chain. In order to determine the amino acid sequences surrounding the p28 cleavage site, the first 4.6 kb of murine hepatitis virus strain A59 ORF1a was expressed in a cell-free transcription-translation system. Amino-terminal radiosequencing of the resulting downstream cleavage product demonstrated that cleavage occurs between Gly-247 and Val-248. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids surrounding the p28 cleavage site revealed that substitutions of Arg-246 (P2) and Gly-247 (P1) nearly eliminated cleavage of p28. Single-amino-acid substitutions of other residues between P7 and P2' were generally permissive for cleavage, although a few changes did greatly reduce proteolysis. The relationship between the p28 cleavage site and other viral and cellular papain proteinase cleavage sites is discussed.

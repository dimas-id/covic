Excessive autophagic activity of alveolar type II epithelial (AT-II) cells is one of the main causes of acute lung injury (ALI); however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be determined. The microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved with autophagy in many diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the relationship between the miRNA expression and the autophagic activity of the AT-II cells in the pathogenesis of ALI and its molecular mechanism. A mouse model of ALI and AT-II cell injury was induced using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo and in vitro, and the expression of miR-34a and the autophagy-related proteins LC3 II/I and p62 were determined. Moreover, the autophagic activity was investigated after miR-34a overexpression and inhibition. The effects of miR-34a on its target gene, FoxO3, in regulating autophagic activity in AT-II cells were also determined. LPS induced autophagic activity and increased the expression of miR-34a in lung tissues and in AT-II cells. The in vitro results showed that the upregulation of miR-34a suppressed, whereas the inhibition of miR-34a promoted, autophagy in AT-II cells. Moreover, miR-34a could directly bind to the 3â€²-untranslated region of the autophagy-related gene, FoxO3, to decrease its expression. In addition, the knockdown of FoxO3 expression inhibited the autophagic activity in AT-II cells. Together, this study suggested that miR-34a might suppress the excessive autophagic activity in AT-II cells via targeting FoxO3 to reduce the damage of LPS-induced ALI.

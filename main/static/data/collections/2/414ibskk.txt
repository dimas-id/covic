BACKGROUND Three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopy improves the surgical skills of novice surgeons and positively affects the learning curve in experimental settings. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 3D passive polarizing display (3DPPD) and a novel 3D head-mounted display (3DHMD; HMS-3000MT) on the performance of the first laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by novices and compare both systems with standard high-definition 2D (HD2D) laparoscopy. METHODS Patients with symptomatic inguinal hernia underwent transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach hernia repair using 3DHMD, 3DPPD, or a conventional HD2D laparoscopic system. All surgeries were performed for the first time by three laparoscopically novice surgeons. Operative performance was compared in terms of the time taken for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing under standardized conditions. Additionally, visual perception parameters and adverse effects were assessed. RESULTS The use of both 3D techniques shortened the time required for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing compared with the conventional HD2D approach. Generally, 3D laparoscopy was superior to HD2D laparoscopy in terms of visual perception parameters such as depth perception, sharpness, ghosting, and contrast. However, compared with the use of HD2D laparoscopy, the use of 3DHMD significantly impaired a surgeon's comfort, with the greatest impairment caused by ear discomfort, headaches, and facial and physical discomforts. CONCLUSIONS The 3DHMD and 3DPPD systems showed clear improvement in first hernia repair laparoscopy by novice surgeons in terms of surgical performance, as well as visual perception; however, the 3DHMD system was not superior to the 3DPPD system. The reduction in training time for new surgeons is obviously advantageous. In this respect, the 3D equipment may be a worthwhile investment.

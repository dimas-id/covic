Because they afflict mostly poor people in poor countries, killing relatively few compared to the many who suffer from severe chronic disabilities, a large cluster of infections deserve the label of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). That is changing as these diseases' enormous health, educational, and economic toll is better understood, including how they interact with HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other illnesses. Several NTDs could be controlled or even eliminated within a decade, using integrated, highly cost-effective mass drug administration programs together with nondrug interventions. Research is needed to provide additional means of control for these conditions and make elimination feasible for still others.

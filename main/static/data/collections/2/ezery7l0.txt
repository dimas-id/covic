Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is one of the most important viral agents affecting the gastrointestinal system of dogs. In this study virological and serological investigations were performed to demonstrate the existence and prevalence of CCoV infection in a Turkish dog population. A total of 269 animals were subjected to the study. Of 179 dogs tested for CCoV antibodies, 112 (62.5%) were found to be positive by serum neutralization test, while 133 (74.3%) were positive by ELISA. The highest prevalence (94.2%) was detected in kennel dogs. Detection of CCoV genome in faeces was performed in samples from 90 diarrhoeic puppies by reverse transcription‚Äêpolymerase chain reaction. Fourteen (15.5%) faeces were positive for CCoV RNA, five of which were characterized as CCoV type I. The widespread CCoV infection in the Turkish dog population may be attributed as an important cause of viral diarrhoea in dogs.

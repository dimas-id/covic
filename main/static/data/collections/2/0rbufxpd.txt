Mesh repair of incisional hernia is recommended to reduce recurrence. Recognized complications include mesh infection and fistula. Composite meshes with antiadhesive barriers were designed for intraperitoneal placement to reduce adhesion formation and fistulization to the viscera. Transmural mesh migration is a rare complication of hernia repair with composite mesh and can be present with a variety of symptoms. We report an interesting case of transmural mesh migration into the small bowel presenting with chronic microcytic anemia and abdominal pain 5 years after laparoscopic incisional hernia repair with a composite polypropylene/ePTFE mesh.

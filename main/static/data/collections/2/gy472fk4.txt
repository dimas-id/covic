Chikungunya fever is caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and is generally considered a self-limiting disease. However, severe clinical presentations with a high mortality rate have been reported in association with underlying medical conditions. This study reports the molecular characterization of the virus and an abnormal pattern of circulating cytokines in a unique lethal CHIKV case during the 2017 outbreak in Italy, which involved an elderly patient with underlying cardiac disease. Analysis of inflammatory cytokines revealed a strong increase of interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β, as well as interleukin-6, suggesting a possible role of type-I IFN in the cytokine storm, which may be correlated with unfavorable prognosis of CHIKV infection.

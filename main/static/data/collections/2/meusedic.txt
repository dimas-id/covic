OBJECTIVE Recent studies have shown the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. We sought to identify prognostic parameters for clinical and radiological outcome after mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS In 34 patients (age 72 ± 13 years, 64.7% women) with acute occlusion of the distal ICA and/or M1 segment who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy, the Spearman correlation was performed to assess potential prognostic outcome parameters (age, NIHSS, ASPECT, thrombus length (TL), clot burden score (CBS), relative filling time delay (rFTD), time to recanalization (TTR) and TICI score). The modified Rankin scale (mRS) and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score were used for clinical and radiological outcome, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess parameters predicting favorable clinical (ΔmRS ≤ 2) and radiological outcome (ΔASPECT ≤ 2). RESULTS Variables associated with favorable clinical outcome included NIHSS, TL, TTR and TICI score (p ≤ 0.01) with NIHSS ≤ 15 (p = 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.87), TL ≤ 2 cm (p = 0.017, AUC 0.75), TTR ≤ 231 min (p = 0.001 AUC 0.88) and TICI ≥ 2b (p = 0.050, AUC 0.70). Shorter TTR and higher TICI scores were associated with favorable radiological outcome (p < 0.001) with TTR ≤ 224 min (p = 0.023, AUC 0.77) and TICI ≥ 2b (p = 0.000, AUC 0.86). CONCLUSION Fast and complete recanalization is essential to achieve a favorable radiological and functional outcome after mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. Age, CBS and collateral supply play a subordinate role.

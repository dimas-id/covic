OBJECTIVE: To determine health perceptions of patients with rheumatic diseases in the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. METHODS: Rheumatology patients at a single centre received via text message the national Rheumatology Association COVID‐19 information sheet and an invitation to participate in a de‐identified survey. Patient concerns regarding risks conferred by their rheumatological disease or medications, impact of receiving the information sheet on the likelihood of staying on medication, and acceptance of telehealth, were ascertained. RESULTS: 2,630 patients received the message and the survey response rate was 21% (n=550). Mean (±SD) age was 52 (±15.2) years and 75% were female. Participants’ highest ranked concern was that their medications would increase their severity of COVID‐19 (76.1%). The highest levels of concern were seen in patients on combination conventional synthetic disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and/or a biologic/targeted synthetic disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD). There was no association between prednisolone dose and concern. While 63% of patients planned to continue their anti‐rheumatic medications, a further 30% were more likely to stay on their medications as a result of receiving the information. Telehealth was acceptable to 98.4% of patients, but 28.1% felt this was only appropriate while infection control measures were in place. CONCLUSION: Concerns regarding the risk of COVID‐19 among patients on anti‐rheumatic drugs are common. Proactive dissemination of information is needed to address misconceptions relating to medication risk, improve medication adherence and minimise the risk of flares. Telehealth is acceptable to a majority of patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

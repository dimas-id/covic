The term "interventional pulmonology" (IP) supersedes the previously used term "thoracic endoscopy," a change that reflects the evolution of a specialty devoted to performing highly sophisticated and technologically advanced procedures in the lungs and chest. Continuing advances in technology promise to further expand IP's diagnostic and therapeutic frontiers. However, standardized educational programs to train and test IP physicians will be essential to maintain a high standard of practice in the field.

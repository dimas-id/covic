We studied the distribution, in human sera, of non antibody serum inhibitor active towards human OC43 and bovine NCDCV coronaviruses. Antibodies to coronaviruses, present with high prevalence in human sera, were filtered by Protein A Sepharose CL 4B column. In the present work we tested sera of newborns, infants, young children and adults. Inhibitory activity was revealed in all sera except these from newborns. This non antibody inhibitor was tested by a plaque-reduction assay.

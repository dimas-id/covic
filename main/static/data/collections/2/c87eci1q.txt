Claims that hospital admissions for heart attack and stroke have declined over the COVID-19 pandemic have been made in at least 16 newspaper articles in the UK (Table 1). In contrast, data from the West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS) have not reported any reduction in call-outs for patients with stroke or ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).1 However, not all admissions with these diseases arrive via the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. Furthermore, a study from Italy showed around a 30% reduction in acute coronary syndrome related hospital admission during the COVID-19 crisis.2 We therefore examined admissions to University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which is the UK's largest hospital group and lies within the WMAS footprint.

An ovine group B rotavirus (GBR) isolate, KB63, was isolated from faeces of a young goat with diarrhoea in Xinjiang, People's Republic of China. Sequence determination and comparison of genes 6 and 11 with the corresponding sequences of GBR strains ADRV and IDIR showed that they were the cognate genes encoding NSP1 and NSP5, respectively. While the overall identities of nucleotide sequences between these two genes and the corresponding genes of strains ADRV and IDIR were in the range 52.6-57.2%, the identities of deduced amino acid sequences were only 34.9-46.3%. These results demonstrate that the substantial diversity of NSP1 observed among group A rotaviruses (GAR) also exists within GBRs and that a high degree of diversity also exists among NSP5 of GBRs, in contrast to GAR NSP5. The NSP1 gene of KB63 contains three ORFs, whereas the NSP1 genes of other GBR strains contain only two. ORFs 2 and 3 of the KB63 gene may be derived from a single ORF corresponding to ORF2 of other GBR strains by the usage of a stop codon created by an upstream single base deletion and single point mutations. In vitro expression studies showed that ORFs 1 and 2, but not 3, of gene 6 can be translated, suggesting that ORF2 may encode a C-terminally truncated, potentially functional product. It may play a role, together with the product of ORF1, in virus replication, as the virus can be passaged further in kids. Similarly, gene 11 can be translated in vitro. Like its counterpart in GARs, the protein encoded by gene 11 was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro.

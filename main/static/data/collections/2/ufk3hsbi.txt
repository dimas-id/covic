In principle, PCR generates large quantities of DNA from a minute amount of nucleic acid starting material using a methodology similar to (but much simpler than) that seen in living cells. For living cells, in vivo DNA synthesis is dependent upon a well defined but complex set of enzymes and co-factors, which have evolved to act in a concerted fashion during the synthetic phase (S-phase) of the cell cycle. In comparison, PCR facilitates in vitro DNA synthesis in a much simpler fashion, making use of a smaller set of defined ingredients and reaction conditions involving relatively high temperatures. The range of factors contributing to successful PCR amplification is reviewed below.

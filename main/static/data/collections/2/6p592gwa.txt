We propose a simple model for understanding the kinetics of corona virus transmission. Our model assume spreading of corona virus can happen from one to another only, if someone without enough protection comes close contact to a person carrying the corona virus. Therefore this virus spreads on a large scale within a short time through chains of such events. Using our model we provide an estimation of the number of people affected by this virus within reasonable duration of time. We choose values of different parameters of our model by non-linear least square fit of the real time data and we predict fate of this corona virus transmission using our model.

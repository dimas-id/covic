OBJECTIVE On April 25, 2012, the first laparoscopic cordless ultrasonic device (Sonicision, Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) was used in a clinical setting. We describe our initial experience. METHODS The cordless device is assembled with a reusable battery and generator on a base hand-piece. It has a minimum and maximum power setting controlled by a single trigger for both coagulation and cutting. A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed on a 56-year-old man with a 7-cm right renal mass. A laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in a 51-year-old man with high-risk prostate cancer. Data on surgical team satisfaction, operative time, number of activations, and times the laparoscope was removed as a result of plume were collected. RESULTS The surgical technician successfully assembled the device at the beginning of the cases with verbal instructions from the surgeon. Operative time for nephrectomy was 77 minutes, with 143 total activations (minimum = 86, maximum = 57). The operative time for the pelvic lymphadenectomy was 27 minutes, with 38 total activations (minimum = 27, maximum = 11). One battery was used in each case. The laparoscope was removed twice during the nephrectomy and once during the lymphadenectomy. Surgical staff satisfaction survey results revealed easier and faster assembly, more space in the operating room, ergonomic handle, and comparable cutting/coagulation, weight, and plume generation with other devices (Table 1). [Table: see text]. CONCLUSION The first clinical application of the pioneering cordless dissector was successfully performed, resulting in surgeons' perceptions of comparable results with other devices of easier and safer use and faster assembly.

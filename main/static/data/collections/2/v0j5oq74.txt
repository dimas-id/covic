BACKGROUND Paraesophageal hernia patients are often elderly with complicating medical comorbidities, making surgical management complex in formulating a management strategy. METHODS Between January 2005 and July 2009, 93 patients underwent surgical treatment of paraesophageal hernia, including 8 recurrent cases after multiple repairs. Open transabdominal surgeries were performed in 14 (15%) patients, and combined thoracotomy was performed in 1 (1%). Laparoscopic surgeries were performed in 78 (84%) patients with 4 (5%) conversions. Artificial prosthetics were used in 27 (29%) patients. Fundoplication was performed in 82 (88%) patients. Gastropexy or feeding tube gastrostomy was performed in 10 (11%) patients. RESULTS The average length of the surgery was 125 minutes (range, 51-304 min). The mean blood loss was 100 mL. The average length of stay was 4 days (range, 1-14 d). There were 2 mortalities (2%) and 4 re-operations, with a recurrence rate of 2%. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair can be performed safely with acceptable results when following a standard approach.

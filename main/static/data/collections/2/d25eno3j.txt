INTRODUCTION Our recent prospective randomized controlled trial (NCT01660048) comparing single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) totally extraperitoneal (TEP) and multi-incision inguinal herniorraphy confirmed safety, efficacy and benefits of single-incision approach. This study (NCT01883115) aimed to assess safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of telescopic extraperitoneal dissection. METHODS Patients with inguinal/femoral hernias from February 2013 to February 2014 undergoing SILTEP herniorraphy with telescopic dissection were compared with patients who had previously undergone SILTEP herniorraphy with balloon dissection. Costs of different ports/trocars were analysed. RESULTS There were 102 patients in telescopic compared to 51 in balloon dissection group; these had no significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists and pre-op visual analogue scores. Telescopic vs. balloon showed: post-operative pain-day one 2.5 vs. 2.5; p = 0.90, day seven 0 vs. 0; p = 0.02 (0 vs. 1; p < 0.01 for bilateral hernias); operation times-unilateral 48.0 vs. 48.0 min; p = 0.88 and bilateral 70.0 vs. 65.0 min; p = 0.66, length of hospital stay 1.0 vs. 1.0 day, analgesic intake (dextropropoxyphene) 6.0 vs. 6.0 tablets; p = 0.95, return to work/normal physical activities 7.0 vs. 7.0 days; p = 0.46 and cosmetic scar scores 24.0 vs. 24.0, respectively. There was no conversion to open surgery/need for additional ports in either group. Median scar length for telescopic group was 13.0 mm. Costs of disposable ports/trocars for telescopic and balloon groups were US$480 and $720, respectively. There were no morbidities/recurrences with follow-up of 2-36 months. CONCLUSIONS Telescopic extraperitoneal dissection during SILTEP inguinal herniorraphy represents a safe and efficient alternative with potential cost savings compared to balloon dissection.

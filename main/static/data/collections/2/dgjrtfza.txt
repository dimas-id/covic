BACKGROUND The optimal prophylaxis for prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) after revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether aspirin, known to be effective for prevention of VTEs after primary arthroplasty, is also effective after revision TJA. METHODS We studied 2997 consecutive patients who underwent revision TJA between 2005 and 2013 and were treated with intermittent pneumatic compression devices and either aspirin (534 patients) or warfarin (2463 patients) for VTE prophylaxis. Pertinent data including the incidence of symptomatic VTEs, bleeding events, infection, and mortality were retrieved from our prospectively collected database. RESULTS The incidence of symptomatic VTEs was significantly higher in the warfarin group at 1.75% (43 of 2463) compared with 0.56% (3 of 534) in the aspirin group (odds ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.03-16.3; P = .03). There was a higher rate of bleeding events with administration of warfarin (1.5%) compared with aspirin (0.4%; P = .02; odds ratio: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.2-34.0). The rate of surgical site infection was similar between the aspirin group and the warfarin group (1.61% and 1.70%, respectively). CONCLUSION Administration of aspirin as prophylaxis against VTEs after revision arthroplasty may be a viable option as it appears to be more effective than warfarin in prevention of symptomatic VTEs and is associated with a lower rate of complications.

The establishment of cell culture‐derived vaccine production requires the development of appropriate downstream processes. Until today, many of the downstream methods applied originate from egg‐derived production processes. These methods have often been slightly modified in order to account for the new demands. However, efforts are currently underway to optimize these processes focusing, for example, on ion exchange or affinity based membrane adsorption chromatography. This review covers the main aspects relevant for the downstream processing of egg and mammalian cell culture‐derived whole influenza viruses.

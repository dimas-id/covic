The severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has permanently impacted our everyday normality. Since the outbreak of this pandemic, our e-mail inboxes, social media feeds and even general news outlets have become saturated with new guidelines, revisions of guidelines, new protocols and updated protocols, all subject to constant amendments. This constant stream of information has added uncertainty and cognitive fatigue to a workforce that is under pressure. While we adapt our practice and learn how to best manage our COVID-19 patients, a second pandemic - information overload - has become our Achilles' heel.

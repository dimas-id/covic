Influenza A viruses are spherical particles that attach to cells through bonds between hemagglutinin and specific cellular receptors. Numerous studies performed have recently revealed that Sialic acid (SA) is a crucial component of influenza A virus receptors. This brief review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of influenza A virus receptors. The introduction describes the classification of influenza A virus receptors and the review continues with a survey of the distribution of SA in different tissue and host. This is followed by research applications of influenza A virus receptors, and explanation of why receptor studies are so important on a world-wide scale.

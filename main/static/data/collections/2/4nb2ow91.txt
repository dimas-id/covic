Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are emerging as important regulators of many pathways germane to cancer. They may regulate the stability of key oncogenes, exemplified by USP28 stabilisation of c‐Myc. Alternatively they can negatively regulate ubiquitin‐dependent signalling cascades such as the NF‐κB activation pathway. We review the current literature that associates DUBs with cancer and discuss their suitability as drug targets of the future. © 2010 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 62(2): 140–157, 2010

Abstract In this paper, we study the bifurcations of an epidemic model with non-monotonic incidence rate of saturated mass action, which describes the psychological effects of the community on certain serious diseases when the number of infective is getting larger. By carrying out the bifurcation analysis of the model, we show that there exist some values of the model parameters such that numerous kinds of bifurcation occur for the model, such as Hopf bifurcation, Bogdanovâ€“Takens bifurcation.

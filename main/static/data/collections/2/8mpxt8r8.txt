Abstract COVID-19 is an interconnecting, cascading tsunami of up-rootedness and change on many levels. The global challenge we face is twofold: 1) how do we sustain our psychological, physical, social and economic capital and wellbeing in a time of great uncertainty; and 2) how do we adapt and create a new existence in an altered reality? Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a well-documented approach to helping individuals and systems move from a deficit-based paradigm to a strengths-based perspective. AI holds myriad potential benefits for individuals, communities, and macro systems to build resilience and promote growth during and after COVID-19. This article will provide an overview of AI and its relevance to the current situation, as well as provide specific strategies for how people and systems can use AI as they transition through the pandemic and afterward.

Previous studies have demonstrated paralemmin-3 (PALM3) participates in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. This study investigated the effect of PALM3 knockdown on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and its underlying mechanisms. We constructed a recombinant adenoviral vector containing short hairpin RNA for PALM3 to knockdown PALM3 expression. A transgene-free adenoviral vector was used as a negative control. The ALI rat model was established by LPS peritoneal injection at 48-h post-transfection. Results showed that downregulation of PALM3 improved the survival rate, attenuated lung pathological changes, alleviated pulmonary edema, lung vascular leakage and neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of nuclear factor κB and interferon β regulatory factor 3, and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in the ALI rat model. However, PALM3 knockdown had no effect on TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon β (TRIF) expression. Moreover, PALM3 knockdown reduced the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF induced by LPS in rat lungs. Therefore, the downregulation of PALM3 protected rats from LPS-induced ALI and its mechanisms were partially associated with the modulation of inflammatory responses and inhibition of TLR4/MyD88 and TLR4/TRIF complex formation.

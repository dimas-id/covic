Objectives: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of adult patients with rheumatic diseases. Material and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed, including clinical studies on adults (aged at least 18 years) with a verified diagnosis of rheumatic disease. Results: 26 out of 41 clinical studies including rheumatoid arthritis (RA, seven studies), systemic sclerosis (SSc, five), Sj√∂gren syndrome (SS, eight), Behcet disease (BD, four), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, one) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS, one) were found. In 15 studies, a healthy control group was recruited. The short form of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP 14) was most frequently applied. The majority of studies (14/15) reported worse OHRQoL in patients with rheumatic disease compared to healthy individuals. In particular, patients with SS (salivary flow and composition) or BD (oral ulcers) showed a relation between OHRQoL and disease-specific oral manifestations. Most studies investigating subscales of OHRQoL (5/6) found the subscale physical disability to be predominantly affected in patients with rheumatic diseases. About half of the studies reported impaired psychosocial aspects. Conclusion: Patients with rheumatic diseases exhibit reduced OHRQoL, especially in diseases with oral manifestations like SS and BD. Physical affections due to oral diseases and psychosocial impairments caused by disease-related parameters must be recognized within patient-centered dental care.

Hemoglobin-vesicles (Hb-V) are being developed as red blood cell (RBC) substitutes. In this study, we report on quantitative and qualitative alterations of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and the pharmacokinetics of CYP-metabolizing drugs, with a focus on four CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C11, CYP2E1 and CYP3A2), after Hb-V resuscitation from a massive hemorrhage. The results of proteome analysis and western blot data indicate that resuscitation with both Hb-V and packed RBC (PRBC) resulted in a decrease in the protein levels of CYPs. Along with a decrease in the protein expression of CYPs, pharmacokinetic studies showed that the elimination of CYP-metabolizing drugs was prolonged in the Hb-V and PRBC resuscitation groups. It is also noteworthy that the CYP-metabolizing drugs in the Hb-V resuscitation group was retained for a longer period compared to the PRBC resuscitation group, and this is attributed to the CYP isoforms having a lower metabolic activity in the Hb-V resuscitation group than that for the PRBC resuscitation group. These findings suggest that resuscitation with Hb-V after a massive hemorrhage has a slight but not clinically significant effect on drug metabolism via CYPs in the liver due to decreased protein levels and the metabolic activity with respect to the CYPs.

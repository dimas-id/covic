The global spread of COVID-19 has put increased pressure on the NHS. The Government has put in a number of strategies to cope with this pandemic, which includes increasing funding for the NHS. However, increased funding itself will not ease the workload. With a number of our staff isolating from work due to COVID-19, we as the workforce have to step out of comfort zones and work in unfamiliar specialties. These are unprecedented times and are placing strains on our health service. Nonetheless, we as healthcare professionals have taken oaths that we are honouring and will continue to do so, till this virus is put to rest.

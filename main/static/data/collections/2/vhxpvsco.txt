The serious coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. COVID‐19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2. Considering the critical roles of testicular cells for the transmission of genetic information between generations, we analyzed single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA‐seq) data of adult human testis. The mRNA expression of ACE2 was expressed in both germ cells and somatic cells. Moreover, the positive rate of ACE2 in testes of infertile men was higher than normal, which indicates that SARS‐CoV‐2 may cause reproductive disorders through pathway activated by ACE2 and the men with reproductive disorder may easily to be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2. The expression level of ACE2 was related to the age, and the mid‐aged with higher positive rate than young men testicular cells. Taken together, this research provides a biological background of the potential route for infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 and may enable rapid deciphering male‐related reproductive disorders induced by COVID‐19.

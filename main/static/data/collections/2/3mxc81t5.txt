One- to 21-day-old mice were examined pathologically after inoculated intracerebrally or subcutaneously with the Kakegawa strain of bovine coronavirus. In 1- to 4-day-old mice inoculated intracerebrally, the brain contained a small number of neutrophils and lymphocytes having infiltrated diffusely and perivascularly and some degenerative neurons. In mice inoculated intracerebrally at 7 to 21 days of age, severe necrosis of pyramidal cells was shown in Ammon's horn. Perivascular infiltrations of neutrophils and lymphocytes were moderate to severe. Some neurons were degenerative in the cerebral cortex, thalamus and midbrain. Degeneration of some neurons and mild infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes were observed in the brain of mice inoculated subcutaneously at 1 to 7 days of age. Perivascular infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was prominent in the cerebral cortex of mice inoculated subcutaneously at 14 days of age. Cellular infiltration was also seen in the thalamus, Ammon's horn, midbrain, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. All the mice, except one, inoculated subcutaneously at 21 days of age were free from neural changes. Electron-microscopically, virus particles were observed in and outside of the degenerative neurons. They had a core 70 nm in diameter and an envelope with spikes.

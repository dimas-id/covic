BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Giant intracavernous aneurysms (GICAs) are located in extradural space; their clinical manifestation and treatment are different from other intradural aneurysms. This study reports clinical outcomes of GICAs untolerate internal carotid artery occlusion tests. METHODS Between January 2012 and September 2017, 14 consecutive cases of GICAs untolerated internal carotid artery occlusion test were retrospectively reviewed. A total of nine patients were not treated and five patients were treated using a Pipeline Embolization Device. RESULTS Of the 14 patients, 12 had compression symptoms and 2 were incidental. In nine untreated patients, during 34 months' (range, 7-64 months) follow-up, four worsened to headaches or ablepsia (more than 34 months). One patient, who presented with ophthalmoplegia and diplopia, showed spontaneous resolution of symptoms at 32-month follow-up. Symptoms in four patients remained unchanged during less than 36-month follow-up period. In five (100%, 95% confidence interval 57% to 100%) treated patients, symptoms recovered completely during 11 months' follow-up after transient worsening of mass compression. CONCLUSIONS GICAs frequently result in intractable cranial neuropathy requiring treatment. The Pipeline Embolization Device is an effective option for these complex aneurysms in selective cases.

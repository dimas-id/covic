The humanized monoclonal antibody H27K15 specifically targets human CD115, a type III tyrosine kinase receptor involved in multiple cancers and inflammatory diseases. Binding of H27K15 to hCD115 expressing cells inhibits the functional effect of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), in a non-competitive manner. Both homology modeling and docking programs were used here to model the human CD115 extracellular domains, the H27K15 variable region and their interaction. The resulting predicted H27K15 epitope includes mainly the D1 domain in the N-terminal extracellular region of CD115 and some residues of the D2 domain. Sequence alignment with the non-binding murine CD115, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and affinity measurements by quartz crystal microbalance revealed critical residues of this epitope that are essential for H27K15 binding. A combination of computational simulations and biochemical experiments led to the design of a chimeric CD115 carrying the human epitope of H27K15 in a murine CD115 backbone that is able to bind both H27K15 as well as the murine ligands CSF-1 and IL-34. These results provide new possibilities to minutely study the functional effects of H27K15 in a transgenic mouse that would express this chimeric molecule.

Aminopeptidase N/CD13 and dipeptidyl peptidase IV/CD26 are widespread membrane-bound peptidases involved in fundamental biological processes. Using cryo-ultramicrotomy of cultured cells followed by indirect immunogold labelling, both enzymes appeared to be strongly and regularly labelled on the cell surfaces of human synovial fibroblasts, T-Iymphocytes and colon carcinoma cells Caco-2. In the cytoplasm of the synovial fibroblasts gold-labelled vesicle-like structures were found, which we consider to be potential transport vesicles. An abundant and regular expression of CD13 was detected on cultured renal parenchymal cells. On the renal carcinoma cell line Caki-l cells we found a low, non-homogeneous and clustered CD13-labelling. On cultured renal parenchymal cells and the Caki-l cells CD26 could not be observed. The expression pattern of CD26 on renal carcinoma cell line Caki-2 cells showed also a slightly clustered distribution. A low density CD26-labelling was present on the squamous cell carcinoma cell line UM-SCC-22B. CD13 was absent in Caki-2 and UMSCC-22B cells. The presence of both enzymes on the cultured cells enables their ultrastructural investigation under different growth conditions and their involvement in cell-cell interactions. For this purpose, however, further investigations are necessary.

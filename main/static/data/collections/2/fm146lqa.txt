Locoregional lymph nodes are routinely examined in order to define the spatial extent of neoplastic disease. As draining patterns of certain tumor types can be divergent from expected anatomical distribution, it is critical to sample the lymph nodes truly representing the draining area. The aim of this bicenter prospective pilot study was to describe the technique of computed tomographic (CT)-lymphography for primary draining lymph node mapping in tumor staging in dogs. Forty-five dogs with macro- or microscopic tumors in specified localizations were evaluated. Depending on body weight, 0.8-2 ml contrast agent (iohexol) was injected into four quadrants around the tumor, and CT-images were obtained at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 minutes post-injection. Attenuation of chosen regions of interest (Hounsfield units (HU)) and patterns of enhancement were assessed for 284 lymph nodes in the precontrast study with median HUs of 31.1 (Interquartile range (IQR) = 18.4) and for 275 in the intravenous postcontrast study with 104.3 HU (IQR = 31.2) (paired Wilcoxon test, P < 0.001). In the CT-lymphography study, 45 primary draining lymph nodes with a significantly higher median HU value of 348.5 (IQR = 591.4) (one-sample t-test, P < 0.001) were identified. Primary draining lymph nodes were found to be clearly visible after 1-3 minutes after local injection, often concurrent with a good visibility of the lymphatic vessel system. The herein described technique of peritumorally injected CT-contrast agent followed by subsequent CT-lymphography for primary draining lymph node mapping works well in a majority of cases in all investigated sites and warrants further validation for different tumor entities.

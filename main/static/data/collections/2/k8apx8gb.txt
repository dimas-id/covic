As the government's coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown starts to be eased and the NHS starts entering phase two of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, dental practices are expecting a sharp increase in the need for dental treatment. Dental care professionals will have legitimate concerns regarding the risk of transmission of COVID-19, particularly if required to respond to a medical emergency, such as a cardiac arrest. This article provides an overview on being prepared for, and responding to, such an emergency, with particular reference to recently published Resuscitation Council (UK) guidance. A suggested aide-memoire for managing a COVID-19 resuscitation situation is also included, which the authors hope will help dental practices to devise guidelines to meet their local needs, as well as promoting the team response to such a difficult and challenging event.

The aim of this study was to assess the differences in internalized-stigma, self-esteem, hope, and quality of life in individuals with mental illness from two diverse cultures (Bedouins and Jews) and to examine the relationships between self-stigma and self-esteem, hope, and quality of life in participants from both cultures. Two hundred participants with mental illness in Israel were assessed on the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale. The Arab Bedouin participants tended to internalize stigma to a greater extent than the Jewish participants. Overall, there was a significant negative correlation between self-stigma, self-esteem, and hope and between alienation and quality of life in both groups although the correlation was stronger among the Arab Bedouin participants. By contrast, the associations between self-stigma and quality of life were only significant for two of the self-stigma dimensions (alienation and discrimination) among the Jewish participants. These results contribute to a better understanding of the role internalized stigma may play in the life of people with mental illness from diverse cultures. They may help design culturally appropriate intervention programs for people with mental illness.

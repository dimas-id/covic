Abstract The complexes [Cu2(o-NO2–C6H4COO)4(PNO)2] (1), [Cu2(C6H5COO)4(2,2′-BPNO)] n (2), [Cu2(C6H5COO)4(4,4′-BPNO)] n (3), [Cu(p-OH–C6H4COO)2(4,4′-BPNO)2·H2O] n (4), (where PNO=pyridine N-oxide, 2,2′-BPNO=2,2′-bipyridyl-N,N′-dioxide, 4,4′-BPNO=4,4′-bipyridyl-N,N′-dioxide) are prepared and characterized and their magnetic properties are studied as a function of temperature. Complex 1 is a discrete dinuclear complex while complexes 2–4 are polymeric of which 2 and 3 have paddle wheel repeating units. Magnetic susceptibility measurements from polycrystalline samples of 1–4 revealed strong antiferromagnetic interactions within the {Cu2}4+ paddle wheel units and no discernible interactions between the units. The complex 5, [Cu(NicoNO)2·2H2O] n ·4nH2O, in which the bridging ligand to the adjacent copper(II) ions is nicotinate N-oxide (NicoNO) the transmitted interaction is very weakly antiferromagnetic.

This article provides a historical framework on food safety for more contemporary details to rest on, focusing primarily on the past 100 years or so (with a touch of ancient history) as particular issues that affect how the safety of the food we eat have been appreciated, have evolved or at times have been successfully dealt with, or have newly emerged or reemerged, in large part because of the impact of technology, trade, and travel.

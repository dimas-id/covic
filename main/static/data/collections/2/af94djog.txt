It is now well recognised that cardiac events occur relatively commonly in patients with acute community-acquired pneumonia. While these events are more frequent in patients with underlying risk factors—such as those with underlying chronic cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities, the elderly, and in nursing home residents—they also occur in patients with no underlying risks other than severe pneumonia. Recent research elucidating the underlying pathogenic mechanisms related to these cardiac events has indicated a probable role for platelet activation, which is possibly exacerbated by pneumolysin in the case of pneumococcal infections. This, in turn, has resulted in the identification of possible therapeutic strategies targeting platelet activation, as well as the cardio-toxic activity of pneumolysin. These issues represent the primary focus of the current review.

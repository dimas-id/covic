A 44-year-old woman underwent a sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer in March 2002. At 5 years after the primary surgery, she underwent 2 hepatectomies, 2 anastomotic resections, 1 lung resection, and 1 radiofrequency ablation. Computed tomography revealed a mass in the pancreatic tail in January 2008. We performed distal pancreatectomy. The specimen showed metastases ofthe sigmoid colon cancer. Computed tomography revealed metastases to the left iliac lymph node in September 2010. She underwent chemotherapy with IRIS for the lymph node metastases. After 16 chemotherapy sessions, the lymph node metastases disappeared. The patient is alive 11 years after the pancreatectomy. Resectable pancreatic metastasis from colorectal cancer is rare. Multimodal treatment that includes radical surgery may achieve long-term survival in some cases.

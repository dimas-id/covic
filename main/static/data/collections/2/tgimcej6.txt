Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) is the main active component of tea polyphenol and shows several biological activities, such as antimicrobial, antitumor‐promoting, anti‐inflammatory and anti‐oxidative activities. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of EGCg on bovine coronavirus (BCV) propagation in Madin‐Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells was investigated. EGCg at concentrations of less than 10 µg/mL did not show any cytotoxicity to MDBK cells. BCV propagation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the virus with EGCg (0.5–10 µg/mL) before virus inoculation in dose‐dependent, incubation time‐dependent and temperature‐dependent manners. The antiviral effect of pretreating MDBK cells with EGCg on BCV propagation was much weaker than that of pretreating BCV with EGCg. The hemagglutination activity of BCV was also reduced by EGCg in a dose‐dependent manner. These results demonstrate that EGCg possesses a distinct anti‐BCV activity and strongly suggest that EGCg interferes with the adsorption of BCV to MDBK cells by the interaction of EGCg with BCV particles. EGCg may therefore be a useful candidate for controlling BCV infection more effectively.

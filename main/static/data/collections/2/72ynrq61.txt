Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) is a pre‐malignant clonal plasma cell disorder, with 25 to 30% life‐long risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM).(1) It is usually asymptomatic, but infrequently associated with several serious conditions, such as neuropathies, glomerulonephritis, and acquired angioedema.(2) Moreover, a higher risk of infection and deep venous thrombosis has been reported in patients with MGUS.(3,4)

OPINION STATEMENT The acute treatment of major ischemic stroke has been revolutionized by strong and consistent evidence from multiple randomized trials. Endovascular treatment by mechanical thrombectomy will be increasingly chosen as an adjunctive or alternative to intravenous thrombolysis. To apply this form of stroke treatment is associated with the challenge of optimal periinterventional treatment. The patient has to be identified, counselled, prepared, monitored, cardiovascularly stabilized, possibly sedated and ventilated, and postprocedurally treated in the optimal way. However, most aspects of periinterventional treatment have as yet not been clarified and require prospective research. Among these, the question of general anesthesia vs conscious sedation has received most attention and may be the most crucial one. Based on a great amount of retrospective data, it appears reasonable to start the intervention under conscious sedation of the non-intubated patient with standby measures for emergent intubation, until prospective randomized trials have clarified that issue. Periinterventional management will significantly affect the success of recanalization.

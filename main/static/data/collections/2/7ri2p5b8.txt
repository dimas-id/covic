The main peptidase (Mpro) from the coronavirus (CoV) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is one of the most attractive molecular targets for the development of anti-SARS agents. We report the irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro by an aza-peptide epoxide (APE; k inact/K i=1900(±400)M−1 s−1). The crystal structures of the Mpro:APE complex in the space groups C2 and P212121 revealed the formation of a covalent bond between the catalytic Cys145 Sγ atom of the peptidase and the epoxide C3 atom of the inhibitor, substantiating the mode of action of this class of cysteine-peptidase inhibitors. The aza-peptide component of APE binds in the substrate-binding regions of Mpro in a substrate-like manner, with excellent structural and chemical complementarity. In addition, the crystal structure of unbound Mpro in the space group C2 revealed that the “N-fingers” (N-terminal residues 1 to 7) of both protomers of Mpro are well defined and the substrate-binding regions of both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation at the crystallization pH of 6.5, contrary to the previously determined crystal structures of unbound Mpro in the space group P21.

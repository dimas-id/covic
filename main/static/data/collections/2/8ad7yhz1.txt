BACKGROUND To evaluate vaginal cuff closure times of a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy using a newly developed Turkish-made laparoscopic needle holder (TMLNH) with a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy using a laparoscopic needle holder with pistol handle (LNHPH). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 68 patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy using a TMLNH (n = 38) or a LNHPH (n = 30). Patients' age, parity, body mass index, mean operating time, mean vaginal cuff suturing time, uterine weight, estimated blood loss, drop of hemoglobin level, return of bowel activity, hospital stay, conversion to multiport access, conversion to laparotomy, and postoperative and intraoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS The TMLNH group had a shorter operative time ( P < .001) and a shorter vaginal cuff suturing time ( P < .001) compared with the LNHPH group during a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy. There was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications. CONCLUSION The TMLNH facilitates vaginal cuff suturing and decreases operation time during a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy. We proposed that the TMLNH is a promising technique for suturing and vaginal cuff closure in a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy.

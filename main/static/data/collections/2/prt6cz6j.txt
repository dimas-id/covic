In this paper we report a study of a sample of foot-and-mouth disease virus carrying two polyribocytidylic acid [poly(C)] tracts of different lengths. By plaque purification in tissue culture, we isolated two populations of particles, one carrying the long poly(C) tract and the other carrying only the short homopolymer. The fingerprints of both viruses were indistinguishable from each other and from that of the virus present in the original sample, suggesting that the main difference between the two types of particles is limited to the poly(C) tracts of their genomic RNAs, to the flanking sequences of the poly(C) tract, or to both. In addition, some biological properties of these viruses are reported, such as stability upon serial passages in different cell lines, plaque size, and pathogenicity for cattle. The results indicate that the size of the poly(C) tract is not directly related to the virulence of these viruses. However, the size of the homopolymer could play a role in determining their efficiency of replication, and it appears that the particles with the short poly(C) tract might have some replicative advantage over those carrying the long one.

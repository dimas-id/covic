Using recombination analysis, we identified a recombinant dengue virus type 1 strain, namely, GD23/95, with three recombination regions, located within the sequences of the prM/E junction, NS1, and NS3, respectively. The recombinant dengue virus was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on its recombination and non-recombination regions. This appears to be the first study to confirm the existence of three recombination regions in a single dengue virus isolate and to report recombination between parent virus strains isolated from the same geographic area (Guangdong province, China). It is also the first to report breakpoints within the NS3 gene of dengue viruses.

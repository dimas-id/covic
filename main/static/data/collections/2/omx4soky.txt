The health crisis situation we have experienced caused by the SARSCoV-2 virus has changed our daily life in numerous aspects, including those related to training (undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing education, etc). Training activities, conferences, lectures, face-to-face workshops were suspended until the Health Situation was over. Alternatives to face-to-face training were needed to guarantee the continuity of these activities. Online training, teaching and evaluation emerged as a relatively fast, simple, operational and flexible solution. Universities and faculties promoted online teaching through virtual classes. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy supported this initiative by signing an agreement with the Board of Deans and Chancellors of Pharmacy to make it possible for undergraduate students to continue their studies and supervised practices in hospital pharmacy departments. Specialized training was affected. Pharmacy residency programs were significantly modified by hospital pharmacies to be able to provide the new clinical and research activities required, everyday, by the pandemic situation. Postgraduate and residency training were also negatively affected. Again, online activities made up for restrictions to face-to-face teaching and training. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy promoted continuing education and provided updated information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus through its website. Thus, numerous virtual sessions, lectures and webinars have been held, and high-quality material was offered to provide up-todate knowledge, on the pharmacological management of patients with COVID-19. Online teaching and education has demonstrated to be an invaluable tool for hard times. During the lockdown, technology has kept us closer and has emerged as an ally. Many of us have found a new means of communication, information, and training. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy has substantially contributed to make it possible.

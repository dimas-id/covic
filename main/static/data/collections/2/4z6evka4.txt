BACKGROUND Portable ventilators are increasingly utilized in the intra- and inter-hospital transport of patients. We evaluated 4 portable ventilators, Impact EMV, CareFusion LTV 1200, Newport HT70, and Hamilton T1, in terms of triggering, delivered tidal volume (V(T)) accuracy, battery duration, delivered F(IO(2)) accuracy, and gas consumption. METHODS Triggering was tested using a microprocessor controlled breathing simulator that simulated a weak, normal, and aggressive inspiratory effort using muscle pressures of -2, -4, and -8 cm H2O respectively. Delivered V(T) and F(IO(2)) accuracy were evaluated across a range of operation. To determine gas consumption, the ventilators were attached to an E type oxygen cylinder and operated at an F(IO(2)) of 1.0 until the tank was depleted. Battery duration was tested by operating each ventilator at an F(IO(2)) of 0.21 until the device ceased to operate. RESULTS Differences remain among devices in several aspects of the testing protocol. Gas consumption ranged from 9.2 to 16 L/min. Battery duration ranged from 101 to 640 min. Triggering performance varied among devices but was consistent breath to breath within the same device, using the fastest and slowest rise time settings. F(IO(2)) accuracy varied at the low range on the 50 mL V(T) setting with one device, and at the high range on both the 50 mL and 500 mL V(T) settings with another. CONCLUSIONS Manufacturers continue to improve the performance of portable ventilators. All the ventilators we tested performed well on V(T) delivery across a range of settings, using both the internal drive mechanism (F(IO(2)) 0.21) and compressed oxygen (F(IO(2)) 1.0). Two of the ventilators were unable to deliver accurate F(IO(2)) across the range of V(T). None of the devices was clearly superior to the others in all aspects of our evaluation.

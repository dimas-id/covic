One of the global topmost causes of death is Tuberculosis (TB) which is caused by mycobacterium bacillus. The increase rate of infected people and the recorded deaths from TB disease is as a result of its transmissibility, lack of early diagnosis, and inadequate professional radiologist in developing regions where TB is more prevalent. Tuberculosis is unquestionably curable but needs to be detected early for necessary treatment to be effective. Many screening techniques are available, but chest radiograph has proven to be valuable for screening pulmonary diseases but hugely dependent on the interpretational skill of an expert radiologist. We propose a Computer-Aided Detection model using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect TB from Montgomery County (MC) Tuberculosis radiographs. Our proposed model performed at 87.1% validation accuracy and evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy as metrics.

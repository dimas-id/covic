The pig is an omnivorous, monogastric species with many advantages to serve as an animal model for human diseases. There are very high similarities to humans in anatomy and functions of the immune system, e g., the presence of tonsils, which are absent in rodents. The porcine immune system resembles man for more than 80% of analyzed parameters in contrast to the mouse with only about 10%. The pig can easily be bred, and there are less emotional problems to use them as experimental animals than dogs or monkeys. Indwelling cannulas in a vein or lymphatic vessel enable repetitive stress-free sampling. Meanwhile, there are many markers available to characterize immune cells. Lymphoid organs, their function, and their role in lymphocyte kinetics (proliferation and migration) are reviewed. For long-term experiments, minipigs (e.g., GÃ¶ttingen minipig) are available. Pigs can be kept under gnotobiotic (germfree) conditions for some time after birth to study the effects of microbiota. The effects of probiotics can be tested on the gut immune system. The lung has been used for extracorporeal preservation and immune engineering. After genetic modifications are established, the pig is the best animal model for future xenotransplantation to reduce the problem of organ shortage for organ transplantation. Autotransplantation of particles of lymphnodes regenerates in the subcutaneous tissue. This is a model to treat secondary lymphedema patients. There are pigs with cystic fibrosis and severe combined immune deficiency available.

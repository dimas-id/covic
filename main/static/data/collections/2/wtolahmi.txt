Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, and Giardia duodena are causes of diarrhea of neonatal calves that may be treated by specific antimicrobial or antiprotozoal therapy. Treatment to correct physiologic abnormalities resulting from diarrhea is most successful because the causative agent does not have to be identified prior to treatment. Some agents, such as orally administered antimicrobials, kaolin-pectin, and parasympatholytic drugs, have detrimental effects that make them inappropriate for treatment of diarrheic calves.

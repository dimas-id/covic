The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the potential role of CT in the early diagnosis of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) pneumonia. We present a case of acute influenza-like illness in which the CT findings of peribronchovascular and subpleural ground-glass opacities and consolidation resembled organizing pneumonia, and lead the radiologist to prospectively and correctly suggest the diagnosis of S-OIV infection.

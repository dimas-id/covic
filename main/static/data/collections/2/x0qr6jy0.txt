ABSTRACT. Two new species of Korotnevella Goodkov, 1988, Korotnevella hemistylolepis n. sp. and Korotnevella monacantholepis n. sp., are described from mesohaline ecosystems. The amoebae are characterized on the basis of light and electron microscopy with special emphasis on the structure of the basket scales, which have species‚Äêspecific architecture. The two new species are the second and third ones recovered from environments other than freshwater. In terms of scale morphology they most closely resemble a freshwater species, Korotnevella bulla (Schaeffer, 1926) Goodkov, 1988. Two genus names, Dactylamoeba Korotnev, 1880 and Korotnevella Goodkov, 1988, are in current use. The latter name is preferred, pending rediscovery and characterization of Dactylamoeba elongata Korotnev, 1880, the type species of the genus. Korotnevella species can be divided into three groups on the basis of scale morphology, suggesting that the genus may not be monophyletic. A key to species is provided.

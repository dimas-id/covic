During the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has been observed that hepatic injury occurs in a significant proportion of patients, particularly in those with severe or critical illness. Mild increase in sinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration, sinusoidal dilatation, steatosis and multifocal hepatic necrosis are the pathologic changes reported. Direct viral-induced cellular injuries and potential hepatotoxicity from therapeutic drugs are two likely underlying mechanisms. In addition, the pre-existing chronic liver disease exacerbated during COVID-19, and COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory reactions may contribute to liver injury as well. Further studies of additional autopsy cases will help clarifying these possibilities.

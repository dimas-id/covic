Occupational pulmonary infectious diseases include tuberculosis (TB) and many viral pathogens, including influenza, coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS), varicella, respiratory syncytial virus, and hantavirus. This review focuses on TB, influenza, and SARS, because the published literature is extensive for these 3 infections. The lessons from these 3 are relevant for all nosocomial pulmonary infectious diseases.

In this personal reflection, as a Family Medicine resident at an Academic Center in Northeast Florida, as well as being a chronic illness patient myself, I explore the notion of dying alone and away from family. Although COVID-19 has changed the practice of medicine in many ways, prior to that, and before the instillation of hospital no-visitor policies and stay at home orders, I experienced a case of a patient dying alone in the hospital. These chronicles that case and the impact it had on me afterward in regard to my own family and how I hope the future of medicine can address this.

Infection by SARS-CoV is initiated by specific interactions between the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor ACE2. In this report, we screened a peptide library representing the SARS-CoV S protein sequence using an HIV-based pseudotyping system to identify specific regions that affect viral entry. One of the 169 peptides screened, peptide 9626 (S residues 217–234), inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry of the pseudotyped virions in 293T cells expressing a functional SARS-CoV receptor (hACE2) in a dose dependent manner (IC50 ~11 µM). Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to assess the roles of individual residues within this region of S, which was previously uncharacterized. The effects included significant reductions in expression (K223A), viral incorporation (L218A, I230A and N232A), and reduced viral entry (L224A, L226A, I228A, T231A and F233A). Taken together, these results reveal a new region of S protein that is crucial for SARS-CoV entry.

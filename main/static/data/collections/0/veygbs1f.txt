Researchers have focused on developing specific assays for conclusively identifying and measuring the levels of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses (microbes), and their associated products (biomarkers) that cause disease in humans and animals (Murray et al., 2003). Traditional methods using microscopy and chemical or immunological stains, test cultures with selective media or target cells, or serological assays have been used effectively to identify infectious agents in biological specimens or environmental samples. However, due to increasing veterinary, medical, and public health concerns, faster and more accurate diagnostic tools have been sought. Multiplex array-based assays allow for a range of biomarkers to be rapidly and simultaneously measured within specimens (Robertson and Nicholson, 2005). Recently, multiplex bead-based flow cytometric immunoassays have been developed and applied that show great promise for improving the study, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of infectious diseases (Alvarez-Barrientos et al., 2000; Jani et al., 2002).

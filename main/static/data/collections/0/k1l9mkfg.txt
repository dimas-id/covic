UNLABELLED Studies in rats showed that the pharmacokinetics of the tricarbonyl core radiopharmaceutical (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-nitrilotriacetic acid, (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA), were essentially identical to those of (131)I ortho-iodohippuran ((131)I-OIH), the clinical gold standard for the measurement of effective renal plasma flow. Our objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of these 2 tracers in healthy volunteers. METHODS (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) was prepared with commercially available NTA and a commercially available kit and isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 74 MBq (2 mCi) of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) were coinjected with 9.25 MBq (250 microCi) of (131)I-OIH in 9 volunteers, and simultaneous imaging of each tracer was performed for 24 min. Plasma clearances were determined from 8 blood samples obtained 3-90 min after injection using the single-injection, 2-compartment model. Plasma protein binding, red cell uptake, and percentage injected dose in the urine at 30 and 180 min were determined. RESULTS There was no difference in the plasma clearances of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) and (131)I-OIH, 475 +/- 105 mL/min versus 472 +/- 108 mL/min, respectively. The plasma protein binding and red cell uptake of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) were 43% +/- 5% and 9% +/- 6%, respectively; both values were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than the plasma protein binding (75% +/- 3%) and red cell uptake (17% +/- 5%) of (131)I-OIH. There was no significant difference in the percentage injected dose recovered in the urine at 30 min and at 3 h; for comparison, the percentage dose in the urine at 3 h was 91% +/- 4% for (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) and 91% +/- 6% for (131)I-OIH (P = 0.96). Image quality with (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) was excellent, and the renogram parameters were similar to those of (131)I-OIH. CONCLUSION Preliminary results in healthy volunteers suggest that the pharmacokinetic behavior of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) is comparable to that of (131)I-OIH.

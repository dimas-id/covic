Oxygenation failure recalcitrant to increasing positive end-expiratory pressure is a feature of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia [1]. A Chinese group [2] used prone positioning to improve oxygenation for intubated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. However, prone positioning in unconscious patients is labour-intensive and is associated with various complications [3, 4]. As the incidence of severe COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide increases rapidly, many countries are also facing the problem of diminishing intensive care resources.

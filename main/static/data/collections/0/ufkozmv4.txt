In this study, we present results after laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy for five patients with protracted superior mesenteric artery syndrome. The procedure can be performed with minimal perioperative risk and very short postoperative stay. It provides significant postoperative symptom relief for many patients with typical presentation of the syndrome.

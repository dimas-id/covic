Asthma is one of the most common diseases of the respiratory system, with typical pathogenesis and pathological changes. The current research shows that autophagy is mainly involved in the pathogenesis of asthma by regulating the bodyâ€™s innate and adaptive immune responses. At the same time, a large number of epidemiological studies have shown that multiple autophagy genes affect the risk of asthma at the level of genetic polymorphism. This chapter will explore the relationship between autophagy and asthma.

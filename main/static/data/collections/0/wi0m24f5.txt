Antibody direct cloning from single B cells is simple and efficient and has been successful in antibody identification of infectious diseases. However, although a recent whole-exome sequencing revealed abundant heterogeneic mutation accumulation in cancers, identification and synthesis of autoantibodies against specific cancer-associated antigens is still difficult in cancer patients owing to the very small number of B cells producing autoantibodies. In the present study, to identify autoantibodies targeting tumor antigens, we measured the titer of autoantibodies in high-grade glioma patients' plasma and identified two patients with elevated autoantibodies to a few transmembrane proteins. Specific B cells producing autoantibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2 were immunostained with labeled protein and anti-human IgG antibody, and then collected by a single cell sorter. Finally, 22 antibody genes were successfully identified using direct IgG cloning from single B cell mRNA, and two antibody clones were found to have significant VEGFR2-specific binding affinity. The current direct human IgG gene cloning technique for identifying human antibodies derived from IgG-memory B cells avoids time-consuming procedures such as phage display-based antibody-library screening, and therefore may be applicable to identifying human autoantibodies in a variety of disorders including cancers even when antibody elevation is not detected because of a very small number of memory B cells.

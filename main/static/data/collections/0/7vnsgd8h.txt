BACKGROUND Opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy is currently recommended to reduce the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. The vaginal route is least invasive, but surgeons sometimes may choose to perform this procedure laparoscopically or robotically when anticipating adnexal surgery as a result of limited visibility. TECHNIQUE We describe a surgical technique to make salpingectomy by the vaginal route easier and more feasible. Posterior rotation of the uterus provides excellent access to the tube, which can easily be removed before separation of the adnexa. EXPERIENCE We have performed more than 60 vaginal hysterectomies using this technique. Salpingectomy was always feasible. CONCLUSION We demonstrate a simple technique to safely perform opportunistic salpingectomy during a vaginal hysterectomy.

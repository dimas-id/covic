Severe tissue trauma leads to an early activation of several danger recognition systems, including the complement and the coagulation system, often resulting in an overwhelming almost synchronic pro- and anti-inflammatory response of the host. Although the immune response is associated with beneficial effects at the site of injury including the elimination of exogenous and endogenous danger molecules as well as the initiation of regenerative processes, an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response significantly contributes to posttraumatic complications such as multiple organ failure (MOF) and early death. Besides pre-existing physical conditions, age, gender, and underlying comorbidities, surgical and anesthesiological management after injury is decisive for outcome. Improvements in surgical intensive care have increased number of patients who survive the initial phase after trauma. However, instead of progressing to normal recovery, patients often pass into persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). The characterization and management of PICS will require new strategies for direct monitoring and therapeutic intervention into the patientâ€™s immune function. In this chapter, we describe various factors involved in the inflammatory changes after trauma and aim to understand how these factors interact to progress to systemic inflammation, MOF, and PICS.

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2) is the etiologic agent causing the disease COVID-19(Corona Virus Disease 19), resulting in a worldwide pandemic. Non emergent endoscopy services have been disrupted as incidence and hospitalizations were rising. It is anticipated that the peak incidence may be leveling off in many parts of the world, but there is a concern for resurgence of the virus activity. Thus, it is important for endoscopy units to have plans in place during peak times of the epidemic and when resuming endoscopic services as the pandemic wanes. The global endoscopy community is faced with the challenge of providing care during this time. The WEO-COVID guidance task force has provided this resource document based on the current evidence and consensus opinion. These WEO recommendations are meant to guide endoscopists worldwide, should be interpreted in light of specific clinical conditions and resource availability and may not apply in all situations. This guidance document does not supersede the need to check for all local regulations and legislations.

In metal-peptide interactions, cations form stable complexes through bonds with coordinating groups as side chains of amino acids. These compounds, among other things, exert a wide variety of antimicrobial activities through structural changes of peptides upon metal binding and redox chemistry. They exhibit different mechanisms of action (MOA), including the modification of DNA/RNA, protein and cell wall synthesis, permeabilization and modulation of gradients of cellular membranes. Nowadays, the large increase in antibiotic resistance represents a crucial problem to limit progression at the pandemic level of the diseases that seemed nearly eradicated, such as tuberculosis (Tb). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics due to chromosomal mutations which can lead to the onset of novel strains. Consequently, the maximum pharmaceutical effort should be focused on the development of new therapeutic agents and antimicrobial peptides can represent a valuable option as a copious source of potential bioactive compounds. The introduction of a metal center can improve chemical diversity and hence specificity and bioavailability while, in turn, the coordination to peptides of metal complexes can protect them and enhance their poor water solubility and air stability: the optimization of these parameters is strictly required for drug prioritization and to obtain potent inhibitors of Mtb infections with novel MOAs. Here, we present a panoramic review of the most recent findings in the field of metal complex-peptide conjugates and their delivery systems with the potential pharmaceutical application as novel antibiotics in Mtb infections.

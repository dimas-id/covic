Murine coronavirus (MHV) and rat coronavirus (RCV) are antigenically related viruses that have different natural rodent hosts. Both MHV and RCV can be propagated in the L2(Percy) and CMT-93 mouse cell lines. In these cell lines MHV uses the MHV receptor (MHVR or Bgp1a) and several related murine Bgp glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily as receptors. To determine whether RCV also uses these murine glycoproteins as receptors, we characterized the envelope glycoproteins of two strains of RCV and compared the effects of anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody on susceptibility of the mouse cells to MHV and RCV. The Parker (RCV-P) and sialodacryoadenitis (RCV-SDAV) strains of RCV expressed the spike glycoprotein S, but only RCV-P expressed a hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein that had acetylesterase activity. Therefore RCV-SDAV must bind to cellular receptors by the viral S glycoprotein, whereas RCV-P might bind to cells by its hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein as well as by S. Pretreatment of L2(Percy) 41.a or CMT-93 cells with anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody blocked infection with MHV-A59 but did not prevent infection of these murine cells with RCV-P or RCV-SDAV. Baby hamster kidney cells transfected with cDNAs encoding MHVR (Bgp1a) or Bgp2 were susceptible to MHV-A59 but not to RCV-P or RCV-SDAV. Thus the RCV strains cannot use these murine coronavirus receptors and must be infecting murine cells by another, as yet unknown, receptor.

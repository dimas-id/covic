BACKGROUND Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) following hiatus hernia surgery may affect a substantial number of patients with adverse clinical consequences. Here, we aim to evaluate the impact of DGE following laparoscopic repair of very large hiatus hernias on patients' quality of life, gastrointestinal symptomatology, and daily function. METHODS Analysis of data collected from a multicenter prospective randomised trial of patients who underwent laparoscopic mesh versus sutured repair of very large hiatus hernias (>50% of stomach in chest). DGE was defined as gastric food retention visualised at endoscopy after 6 h of fasting at 6 months post-surgery. Quality of life (QOL), gastrointestinal symptomatology, and daily function were assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire, Visick scoring and structured surveys administered prior to surgery and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS Nineteen of 102 (18.6%) patients had DGE 6 months after surgery. QOL questionnaires were completed in at least 80% of patients across all time points. Compared with controls, the DGE group demonstrated significantly lower SF-36 physical component scores, delayed improvement in health transition, more adverse gastrointestinal symptoms, higher Visick scores and a slower rate of return to normal daily activities. These differences were still present 12 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS DGE following large hiatus hernia repair is associated with a negative impact on quality of life at follow-up to 12 months after surgery.

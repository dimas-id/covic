Context awareness in complex business environments has been recognized as a major challenge for enterprise information systems. Although, the development of a context aware system in different application domains is convincingly documented in current literature, the design of such systems requires greater attention. Particularly, investigating the context of a context aware system. In this paper, we present a step-wise method to model a complex business environment. The method provides an approach for investigating a context and using the investigation results in subsequent design steps.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally performed using 4 ports by transperitoneal access. Recent developments regarding laparoscopic surgery have been directed toward reducing the size or number of ports to achieve the goal of minimally invasive surgery, by minilaparoscopy, natural orifice access, and the transumbilical approach. The aim of this article is to describe our laparoscopic transumbilical cholecystectomy technique using conventional laparoscopic instruments and ports. METHODS The Veress needle was placed through the umbilicus, which allowed carbon dioxide inflow. A 5-mm trocar was placed in the periumbilical site for the laparoscope followed by the placement of 2 additional 5-mm periumbilical trocars. The entire procedure was performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments. At the end of the surgery, trocars were removed, and all 3 periumbilical skin incisions were united for specimen retrieval. RESULTS Five transumbilical cholecystectomies were performed following this technique. The mean BMI was 26.6 kg/m(2). The mean operative time and blood loss were 46.2 minutes and 55 mL, respectively. No intraoperative complications occurred. Analgesia was performed using dipyrone (1g IV q6h) and ketoprofen (100 mg IV q12 h). Time to first oral intake was 8 hours. Mean hospital stay was 19.2 hours. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic transumbilical cholecystectomy seems to be feasible even using conventional laparoscopic instruments and can be considered a potential alternative for traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

BACKGROUND Extensive tearing of the gluteus muscles (spontaneous or subsequent to hip arthroplasty) is difficult to treat. We are carrying out osseous fixation with securement of the suture anchor by a nonresorbable collagen patch. The objective of this study is to examine the follow-up data of 30 patients and to assess whether the clinical outcomes depended on the extent of the fatty degeneration of the gluteus medius. METHODS Thirty patients (28 female and 2 male) with a mean age of 76.8 ± 4.3 years (68-83 years) were followed for a mean of 46.8 ± 23.1 months (24-101 months). RESULTS Pain improved significantly from a preoperative visual analog scale score of 7.0 ± 1.52 (6-10) to 0.83 ± 0.77 (0-3) 24-month postoperative. The gluteus medius muscle force increased from 2.09 ± 0.81 to 3.3 ± 0.78 using the British Medical Research Council Scale. All patients exhibited a severe limp before the operation. Postoperatively, only 5 patients had a severe limp, while 14 exhibited a mild limp and 11 no limp at all. The modified Harris Hip Score increased from a preoperative value of 44.5 ± 4.2 (26-66) to a value of 81.1 ± 7.79 (60-100) 24-month postoperative. The functional results were dependent on the level of fatty degeneration of the muscle. CONCLUSION The first results for this surgical technique appear to be very promising for the treatment of extensive tearing of the gluteus musculature that has a degree of fatty degeneration less than 75%.

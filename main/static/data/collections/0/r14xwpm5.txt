Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is associated with both severe systemic inflammation and a prothrombotic state, as reflected by significant increases in fibrinogen and D‐dimers levels that have been associated with poor prognosis and high rates of severe pulmonary embolism. A recent report suggested a role for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLA) in the thrombotic manifestations associated with severe COVID‐19. As we also recently noticed unexplained lengthening of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in some critically ill COVID‐19 patients, we explored our patients for aPLA positivity.

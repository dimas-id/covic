This paper documents the efforts in implementing lyric generation machine learning models in the Greek language for the genre of Ã‰ntekhno music. To accomplish this, we used three different Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network approaches. The first method utilizes word-level bi-directional network models, the second method expands on the first by learning the word embeddings on the initial layer of the network, while the last method is based on a char-level network model. Our experimental procedure, which utilized a high sample of human judges, shows that texts of lyrics generated by our models are of high quality and are not that easily distinguishable from actual lyrics.

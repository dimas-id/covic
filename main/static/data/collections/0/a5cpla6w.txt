BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) has gained wide acceptance by both surgeons and patients, but hernias that approach a bony prominence are more complex due to the difficulty of proper fixation. This study was conducted to evaluate the use of bone anchor mesh fixation for complex LVHR. METHODS A prospective study of patients having complex LVHR with bone anchors was conducted using patients from 2 academic institutions between July 2003 and December 2007. Patient demographic data, characteristics of the hernia, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS A total of 30 patients who had LVHR using bone anchors were evaluated (20 women, 10 men; mean age 60.9 years, range 41-83 years). In all, 17 suprapubic and 13 lateral hernias were included, requiring a mean of 2.8 and 3.2 bone anchors, respectively. The average hernia defect was 263 cm(2) (range 35-690 cm(2)), and the average mesh size was 663 cm(2) (range 255-1360 cm(2)). Mean operative time was 218 minutes (range 98-420 minutes), with an estimated blood loss of 46 mL (range 10-100 mL). The average length of stay was 5.2 days (range 1-26 days). Seven patients (23.3%) developed postoperative complications, and 1 patient in this study died (mortality 3.3%). During follow-up of 13.2 months (range 1-26 months), 2 patients (6.7%) developed a recurrent hernia. CONCLUSIONS Bone anchors can be used successfully in the laparoscopic repair of complex ventral hernias, particularly with suprapubic and lateral hernias that approach a bony prominence. The complication rate is acceptable, with a short hospital stay and low recurrence rate.

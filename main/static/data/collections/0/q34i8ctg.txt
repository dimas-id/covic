A chylothorax may be due to either direct trauma or occlusion of the thoracic duct. Treatments include antegrade or retrograde glue and coil embolization as well as thoracic duct stent graft placement. This report describes a patient with chylothorax secondary to venous outflow occlusion. Left upper extremity venography demonstrated multifocal left brachiocephalic and axillary vein occlusions with retrograde filling of an engorged and disrupted thoracic duct. Retrograde thoracic duct lymphangiography with embolization and left upper extremity venous reconstruction were performed with complete resolution of chylothorax.

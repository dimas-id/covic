The 7-chloro-4-(piperazin-1-yl)quinoline structure is an important scaffold in medicinal chemistry. It exhibited either alone or as hybrid with other active pharmacophores diverse pharmacological profiles such as: antimalarial, antiparasitic, anti-HIV, antidiabetic, anticancer, sirtuin Inhibitors, dopamine-3 ligands, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and serotonin antagonists. In the presented review, a comprehensive discussion of compounds having this structural core is surveyed and illustrated.

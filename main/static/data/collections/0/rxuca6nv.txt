Atanassovâ€™s intuitionistic fuzzy set theory is based on the lattice [Formula: see text] of intuitionistic values and their aggregation. There are lots of works dealing with this topic, but mostly considering some particular cases. In this contribution, we offer a rather general view on aggregation of intuitionistic values with transparent proofs of several properties which significantly shorten the related proofs for particular cases known from the literature.

The questionnaires included demographic and socioeconomic data, health status, the condition epidemic situation and EQ-5D scale. The relationships of all factors and the scores of EQ-5D were analyzed. Logistic regression model were used to the five health dimensions. RESULTS: The respondents obtained a mean EQ-5D index score of 0.949 and a mean VAS score of 85.52.The most frequently reported problem were pain/discomfort (19.0%) and anxiety/depression (17.6%). Logistic regression models showed that the risk of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression among people with aging, with chronic disease, lower income, epidemic effects, worry about get COVID-19 raised significantly.

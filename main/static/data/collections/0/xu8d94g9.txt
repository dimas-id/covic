An 18-month-old, spayed female, domestic shorthaired cat was presented with clinical signs of depression and reluctance to walk, which progressed to nonambulatory tetraparesis. Increased opacification of both frontal sinuses and a cyst-like abnormality causing compression and displacement of the right frontal lobe were seen on computed tomography. Bilateral frontal sinus trephination and right transfrontal craniotomy revealed clear, viscous fluid in the right frontal sinus and rostral fossa, compatible with an intracranial mucocele. At a 6-month follow-up examination, no signs of recurrence were appreciated.

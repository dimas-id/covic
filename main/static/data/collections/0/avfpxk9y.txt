We examined the dynamics of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) transmission within families. Our investigation demonstrated significantly lower rates of Covid-19 positivity in children compared with adults residing in the same household. Children of 5-17 years of age were 61% and children of 0-4 years of age were 47% less likely to have positive polymerase chain reaction results compared with adults residing in the same household.

STUDY DESIGN Systematic review of qualitative studies. OBJECTIVE To synthesise qualitative research exploring the experiences and perspectives of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), relatives and health professionals concerning goal setting in SCI rehabilitation. METHODS Five electronic databases were searched. A search strategy was constructed with key concepts identified using PICo (Population, phenomena of Interest and Context). Peer reviewed studies complying with the inclusion criteria were selected. Interpretive Description methodology guided analysis and synthesis of the findings. RESULTS The search yielded 427 records. Of 12 full text studies assessed for eligibility, four were included describing goal setting in SCI rehabilitation from the perspective of persons with SCI and health professionals. Persons with SCI described a need for goal setting to be related to their everyday life, whereas the health professionals tended to use the hospital setting as their point of reference. Persons with SCI emphasised the importance of being self-directed and taking an active role in goal setting and rehabilitation. No studies presented the perspective of relatives. CONCLUSIONS This review illuminates the divergence in the understanding of goal setting between persons with SCI and health professionals. Goal setting in SCI rehabilitation often directly reflects physical functioning goals set by the health professionals, which does not prepare persons with SCI for everyday life and emotional issues. There is lack of focus on goals addressing psychosocial components such as family issues and change of roles. A shared process with goal setting relevant to persons with SCI and their everyday life is needed.

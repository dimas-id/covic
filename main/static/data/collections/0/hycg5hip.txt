Abstract During 2013, a novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus (IAV) emerged in China and subsequently caused large economic and public health burdens. We experimentally infected three common peridomestic wild mammals with H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) IAV. Striped skunks exhibited the highest burden of disease followed by raccoons and cottontail rabbits. Striped skunks also produced the highest levels of viral shedding (up to 106.4 PFU/mL nasal flush) followed by cottontail rabbits (up to 105.8 PFU/mL nasal flush) and raccoons (up to 105.2 PFU/mL nasal flush). Thus, various mammalian species, especially those that are peridomestic, could play a role in the epidemiology of emergent H7N9 IAV. Mammals should be accounted for in biosecurity plans associated with H7N9 and their presence in wet markets, dependent on species, could lead to increased transmission among interspecific species aggregations and may also pose an elevated zoonotic disease risk to visitors and workers of such markets.

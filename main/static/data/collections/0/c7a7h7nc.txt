OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical diagnostic criteria for serious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong retrospectively discriminant with SARS database, and to screen out the sensitive warning factors in predicting the outcome. METHODS Four hundred and two SARS patients were selected based on the diagnostic criteria for SARS from Ministry of Health, China. Of them, 358 SARS patients were selected as their clinical manifestations conformed to the diagnostic criteria of serious SARS. The study subjects were divided into two groups. One group consisted of the patients with serious SARS (358 patients), and they either underwent invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation or died of the disease. The remaining 44 SARS patients constituted the non-serious SARS group. Taking the lowest value of oxygen index (OI) as the main index, the OI was categorized into 3 classes, namely< or =200 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) as 1,200-300 mm Hg as 2, and >300 mm Hg as 3. According to this index, the seriousness and the prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS OI less than 300 mm Hg were identified as the unequivocal serious SARS patients, and the mistake judgement rate was 6.800%. Furthermore mortality and complications were compared with Logistic regression, and questionable SARS patients were excluded. The results showed that the patients identified with OI less than 300 mm Hg had worse outcome than the original ones diagnosed with criteria of Ministry of Health. CONCLUSION OI less than 300 mm Hg in patients with ALI meet the diagnostic criteria of serious SARS better, and it can be taken as a prognostic criterion in clinic.

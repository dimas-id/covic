We determined and compared the humoral immune response in severe, hospitalized and mild, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Severe patients (n=38) develop a robust antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, including IgG and IgA antibodies. The geometric mean 50% virus neutralization titer is 1:240. SARS-CoV-2 infected hospital personnel (n=24), who developed mild symptoms necessitating leave of absence, self-isolation, but not hospitalization, 75 % develop antibodies, but with low/absent virus neutralization (60% < 1:20). While severe COVID-19 patients develop a strong antibody response, mild SARS-CoV-2 infections induce a modest antibody response. Long term monitoring will show whether these responses predict protection against future infections.

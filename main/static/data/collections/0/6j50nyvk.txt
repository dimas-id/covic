Genome databases are the locations, which permits storing, sharing, retrieving and comparison of the information related to the genomes of various individuals and organisms. Traditionally the databases were confined to the updated information of certain vital model organisms. Rapid development of technology and high speed internet facilities have created an explosion of databases resulting in the development of specific databases of almost all model organisms and a group of organisms with a common specificity. In the present chapter, details of the databases related to the genomes of viruses, archaea, bacteria, cell organelle, invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, and human beings are provided in a table format which provides an instant information, about different databases and their URLs.

We explored the emergence of disparities in COVID-19 testing and outcomes in NYC and Philadelphia, two large US cities at two different stages of the epidemic. We used zip code-level data from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. We linked this data to a deprivation index calculated using 2014-2018 American Community Survey data. We have documented a dynamic situation regarding disparities in COVID-19 testing in two US cities. There are wide disparities in testing availability for the most deprived neighborhoods in Philadelphia, a city early in the epidemic, while these disparities seemingly dissipated in NYC, a city with more widespread testing later in the epidemic. However, we consistently see a very strong positive correlation with the % of tests that are positive in both cities, and this disparity is widening over time.

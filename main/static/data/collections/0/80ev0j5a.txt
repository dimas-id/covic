It is shown that the evaporation rate of a liquid sample containing the culture of coronavirus affects its survival on a substrate. Possible mechanisms of such influence can be due to the appearance of large, about 140 bar, non comprehensive capillary pressures and the associated dynamic forces during the movement of the evaporation front in a sample with the virus. A simulation of isothermal evaporation of a thin liquid sample based on the Stefan problem was performed. The comparison of simulation data and recent experiments on the coronavirus survival on various surfaces showed that the rate of isothermal evaporation of aqueous samples, which is higher for heat-conducting materials, correlates well with the lifetime of the coronavirus on these surfaces.

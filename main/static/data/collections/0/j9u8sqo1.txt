The taxonomy of streptococci has undergone major changes during the last two decades. The present classification is based on both phenotypic and genotypic data. Phylogenetic classification of streptococci is based on 16S rRNA sequences [1], and it forms the backbone of the overall classification system of streptococci. Phenotypic properties are also important, especially for clinical microbiologists. The type of hemolysis on blood agar, reaction with Lancefield grouping antisera, resistance to optochin, and bile solubility remain important for grouping of clinical Streptococcus isolates and therefore treatment options [2]. In the following chapter, two phenotypic classification groups, viridans group streptococci (VGS) and beta-hemolytic streptococci, will be discussed.

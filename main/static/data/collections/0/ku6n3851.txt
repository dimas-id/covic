In October 2007, a joint ANRS-NIH workshop was held on “Mucosal immunity and HIV/AIDS vaccines” in Veyrier-du-Lac, France. Goal of the meeting was to discuss recent developments in the understanding of viral entry and dissemination at mucosal surfaces, rationale for designing vaccines to elicit mucosal immune responses by various routes of immunization, and the types of immune responses elicited. Lessons were drawn from existing vaccines against viral mucosal infections, from the recent failure of the Merck Ad5/HIV vaccine and from attempts at mucosal immunization against SIV. This report summarizes the main concepts and conclusions that came out of the meeting.

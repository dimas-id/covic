The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted extensive attention all around the world recently. Early screening, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment remain the most effective prevention and control measures. Computed tomography (CT) plays a vital role in the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of COVID-19, especially in the early screening, with a higher sensitivity than that of real-time fluorescence RT-PCR. The combination of CT and artificial intelligence has the potential to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency.

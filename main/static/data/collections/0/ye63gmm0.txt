Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan has been on the forefront of efforts to manage and mitigate the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since 20th January 2020. Despite having one of the largest and busiest emergency departments (EDs) in the world, we have managed to maintain a “zero-infection” rate among our ED healthcare workers through various systematic approaches. The measures implemented include establishing a clear flowchart with route planning, strict infection control policies and regulation of medical equipment, and team-based segregation in the workplace. These strategies, borne of our experience during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, can complement a network of well-trained personnel to enable EDs around the world in successfully mounting an effective defense against new airborne illness while minimizing healthcare personnel casualties.

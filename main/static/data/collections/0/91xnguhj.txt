BACKGROUND: CDH UK is a registered charity governed by a volunteer committee and providing informal support to patients, families and healthcare workers affected directly or indirectly with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) internationally. This is the first patient-led survey undertaken by CDH UK aiming for highlighting the feeding problems and their impact on the daily life of CDH survivors. METHODS: Answers from CDH survivors were collected through an online questionnaire (SurveyMonkey(Â®)) undertaken by CDH UK. The questionnaire contained questions about their feeding problems and support they were receiving for it. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 151 patients answered some parts of the survey and 102 patients completed the questionnaire. Overall, 116 (76.8%) responders reported suffering from any type of feeding issue. Gastric acid reflux (GER) and growth retardation were the commonest symptoms experienced by 97 (91.5%) and 72 (62.2%) responders, respectively. Only 18 (17.0%) responders have received any written information on feeding or details of patient/parent support. Eighty (75.5%) responders are satisfied with the level of support they are receiving, but 78 (76.4%) answered that the whole experience associated with the disease has been very or extremely stressful. CONCLUSIONS: CDH survivors frequently have various issues with feeding, which may not be adequately supported or discussed clinically. It is desirable to assist the patients to reliable resources of long-term support, including multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach.

A new form of atypical pneumonia was reported in the East Asian region beginning from early 2003. This was later termed by the World Health Organisation as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The diagnosis of SARS relies on a combination of clinical features and chest radiographic findings. A preliminary review of SARS in Singapore shows chest radiographic findings of patchy airspace shadowing with severe cases progressing to diffuse air-space shadowing. We illustrate these findings with temporal correlation in our case report. As SARS is a contagious, rapidly progressive and potentially fatal condition, early diagnosis is crucial for prompt management and isolation of patients. Recognition of chest radiographic findings aids in the early diagnosis and containment of SARS.

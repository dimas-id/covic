Addressing new challenges in global health and biosecurity requires responsive and accessible platforms for the manufacture of preventative or therapeutic interventions. Transient protein expression in plants has evolved into a technology that offers a unique combination of rapid expression, inherent scalability, and flexibility in gene stacking with the capability to produce complex proteins and protein assemblies. Technical developments that have driven the progress of transient expression in plants include advanced expression systems, protein engineering and synthetic biology approaches to transiently, or stably, modify host plants. The plasticity of transient expression in plants, speed of scalability and relatively low capital costs, highlight the great potential of this technology in the future of human and animal health.

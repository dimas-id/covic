Anastomosis in bronchoplasty is usually performed using interrupted sutures, which are considered safe, reliable, and secure. However, placing interrupted sutures can be complex and time-consuming. There have been recent reports of continuous suturing using standard suture materials in bronchoplasty. We have experienced four cases of sleeve lobectomy with bronchial anastomosis in continuous fashion using a novel absorbable barbed suture device, the V-Locâ„¢ wound closure device (Covidien, USA), which facilitates secure wound closure without knot-tying. Two patients underwent sleeve upper lobectomy and two underwent sleeve upper-middle lobectomy. Surgical approach was completely thoracoscopic in one patient and open in three. There were no intraoperative difficulties such as cutting or loosening, and a leak test was negative in all cases. One patient had pneumonia postoperatively and developed anastomotic stenosis 4 months after surgery, which did not require treatment. All patients were alive, without local recurrence, at a mean follow-up of 11.5 months postoperatively.

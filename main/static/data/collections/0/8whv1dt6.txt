The ridge regression-type (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970) and Liu-type (Liu, 1993) estimators are consistently attractive shrinkage methods to reduce the effects of multicollinearity for both linear and nonlinear regression models. This paper proposes a new estimator to solve the multicollinearity problem for the linear regression model. Theory and simulation results show that, under some conditions, it performs better than both Liu and ridge regression estimators in the smaller MSE sense. Two real-life (chemical and economic) data are analyzed to illustrate the findings of the paper.

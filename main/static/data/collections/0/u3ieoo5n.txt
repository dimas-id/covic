This paper explored experiences caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with a focus on the suffering between the "private" and "professional" selves, in order to describe the psychological impact and ethical practice of SARS events as related to nursing professionals. Eight small group interviews were conducted with a total of twenty-one nurses with experience caring for SARS patients. Group interviews were audio-taped and transcribed for analysis. Data, analyzed using the constant comparative method, revealed the following three ethical dilemmas: suffering in care giving, response to the calling, and distresses involved in decision making. In this study, the authors further addressed relationships between suffering and ethical practice, the calling and a nurse's professional responsibilities, and transcendence in intersubjectivity. The authors hope that the results of this study will lead to a new understanding of ethical practices nursing and help nurses develop reflected care that promotes personal and professional growth.

Abstract The emergence of viral infections is driven by multiple factors including changes in human behavior, population growth, reservoir host distribution, viral diversity and environmental changes. Effective surveillance methods, diagnostic assays and containment measures are pivotal to preventing widespread outbreak of a new viral infection. However, the limited understanding of some emerging viruses poses numerous challenges for effective intervention. In this chapter we discuss various genomics-based methods and strategies to overcome these inherent challenges of emerging and re-emerging viral infections with a focus on current viral threats. We also provide an outlook on the use of genomic tools in personalized medicine and potential solutions to current and foreseeable challenges.

The Feline coronavirus (FCoV) can lead to Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which the precise cause is still unknown. The theory of internal mutation suggests that a less virulent biotype of FCoV (FECV) would lead to another more pathogenic biotype (FIPV) capable of causing FIP. In this work, the 7b gene was amplified from 51 domestic cat plasma samples by semi-nested PCR and tested through phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. The 7b gene of Brazilian isolates displayed high conservation, a strong correlation between the geographic origin of the viral isolates and their genealogy, and its evolution was possibly shaped by a combination of high rates of nucleotide substitution and purifying selection.

BACKGROUND This report describes the techniques and outcomes of reduced port distal gastrectomy (RPDG) using a new oval multichannel port. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed reduced port distal gastrectomy through the E·Z Access™ oval type device with three trocars in the umbilical incision, plus the use of additional 5 mm and 2 mm ports. All routine procedures performed in conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (CLDG) were achieved in RPDG. RESULTS We employed this technique without the use of additional trocars or conversion to laparotomy in all 25 patients. The median length of the operation was 340 (range, 220-487) minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 30 (range, 5-440) ml. Neither major postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakage and stricture, nor postoperative mortality were observed. The mean length of the hospital stay was 11 days. The umbilical wound was indistinct. The patients were also highly satisfied with the cosmetic outcome. CONCLUSION Reduced port surgery using the E · Z Access™ oval type device was successfully applied for gastric cancer. This method is technically feasible, produces superior cosmetic results and thus could be an attractive surgical option for gastric cancer patients.

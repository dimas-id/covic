RECOMMENDATION Based on the hip and knee arthroplasty literature, measuring synovial biomarkers may play a role in the diagnosis of infected total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in the setting of a TAA can be confirmed with cultures, provided that a plausible pathogen is recovered in the context of a compatible clinical picture. In the absence of a positive culture, synovial biomarker analysis may help in establishing the diagnosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Moderate. DELEGATE VOTE Agree: 92%, Disagree: 8%, Abstain: 0% (Super Majority, Strong Consensus).

Molecular biology is the study of biology on molecular level. The field overlaps with areas of biology and chemistry, particularly genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (Ribonucleic acid) and protein biosynthesis as well as learning how these interactions are regulated([1]).

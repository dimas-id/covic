Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes major losses in the poultry industry. The safe and effective vaccine to control IBV spread is imperative. In the present study, we developed IBV S1 glycoprotein poly-epitope-based DNA vaccine pV-S1B+S1T consisting of SH1208 and Holte strain BF2-restricted T cell epitopes and Australian T strain dominant B cell neutralization epitopes. Specific pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with pV-S1B+S1T and control plasmids twice to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune response, as indicated by viral neutralization titers and results of CD8+ T cell proliferation assays. A lethal dose of IBV SH1208 strain used for protection and challenge experiments at two weeks post-booster immunization following challenge protection and virus shedding reverse transcription quantitative PCR assay, indicated that pV-S1B+S1T protected against IBV and significantly reduced viral excretion. These results demonstrated that the IBV poly-epitope-based vaccine effectively prevents infection and represents a potential IBV vaccine.

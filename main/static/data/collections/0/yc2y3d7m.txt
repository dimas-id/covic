Abstract Interferon-γ receptor deficiency is a recently described immunodeficiency that is associated with onset of severe mycobacterial infections in childhood. We describe the occurrence of symptomatic and often severe viral infections in 4 patients with interferon-γ receptor deficiency and mycobacterial disease. The viral pathogens included herpes viruses, parainfluenza virus type 3, and respiratory syncytial virus. We conclude that patients with interferon-γ receptor deficiency and mycobacterial disease have increased susceptibility to some viral pathogens. (J Pediatr 1999;135:640-3)

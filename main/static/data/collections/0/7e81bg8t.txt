Publisher Summary This chapter describes how real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performs and how it may be used to detect microbial pathogens and the relationship they form with their host. Research and diagnostic microbiology laboratories contain a mix of traditional and leading-edge, in-house and commercial assays for the detection of microbes and the effects they impart upon target tissues, organs, and systems. The PCR has undergone significant change over the last decade, to the extent that only a small proportion of scientists have been able or willing to keep abreast of the latest offerings. The chapter reviews these changes. It discusses the second-generation of PCR technologyâ€”kinetic or real-time PCR, a tool gaining widespread acceptance in many scientific disciplines but especially in the microbiology laboratory.

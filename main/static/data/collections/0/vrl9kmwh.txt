Adjuvants are common vaccine components. Novel adjuvants may improve the protective immunity conferred by vaccines against poultry diseases. Here, a less-hemolytic saponin, platycodin D (PD), isolated from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum was investigated as a potential alternative adjuvant. PD was tested as an adjuvant in the infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine, because the existing IB vaccine has often failed to induce effective immune responses. The adjuvant activity of PD in conjunction with IB vaccine was evaluated in this study. Compared to control treatment, PD treatment significantly increased the proliferation of chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells, concentration of interferon-Î³ in culture supernatants, and anti-IB antibody titer. In chickens pre-challenged with the Mass 41 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), PD administration resulted in fewer and less severe clinical signs, lower mortality rate, and higher protection compared to control treatment. Histopathological examination showed that the lungs and kidneys of PD-treated chickens displayed fewer pathological lesions than those of control chickens. Our results also demonstrated that this new vaccine adjuvant improved chicken humoral and cellular immune responses without any side effects. Hence, our findings suggest that PD might serve as an effective adjuvant in IBV vaccines.

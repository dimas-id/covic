The recent outbreak of COVID‐19 has brought elective surgeries including liver transplantation to a standstill. The concerns in Living Donor Liver Transplant (LDLT) were that immunosuppressed recipients and healthy donors would be exposed to nosocomial SARS‐ CoV‐2 infection.(1) However, as patients began to suffer and die, Liver Transplant Society of India (LTSI) revised its guidelines (2) and allowed LDLT for those who were very sick, or had just recovered from a life threatening decompensation (high MELD/ CTP score) or had malignancy. Over 90 % of transplants in India are from live donors as we have a very low donation rate.

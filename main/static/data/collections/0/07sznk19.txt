The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified loop snare technique for retrieval of difficult inferior vena cava (IVC) filters and migrated coils.A retrospective review of GÃ¼nther Tulip filter retrievals between January 2014 and February 2017 was performed. A total of 316 IVC filter retrievals were attempted. In 25 cases, the standard technique had failed and our modified loop snare technique was subsequently attempted in 21 of these patients.The retrievals were successful in 20 cases (mean dwell time, 42.6 days, range, 14-102 days). The dwell time of the one failure was 46 days. The retrieval rate increased from 92.1% with the standard technique to 98.4% with the combination of the standard and modified loop snare technique. Unsuccessful retrieval was due to migration and endothelialization of the filter. This technique can also be used to remove migrated coils which cannot be captured by standard techniques. There were no complications from the retrievals.Tilt and endothelialization of filters are the main factors resulting in unsuccessful retrievals with the standard technique. In the present study, we describe an alternative technique for difficult IVC filter retrievals, which can also be used to capture migrated coils and occluders in the aorta and heart.

We continue the study of computable embeddings for pairs of structures, i.e. for classes containing precisely two non-isomorphic structures. Surprisingly, even for some pairs of simple linear orders, computable embeddings induce a non-trivial degree structure. Our main result shows that although [Formula: see text] is computably embeddable in [Formula: see text], the class [Formula: see text] is not computably embeddable in [Formula: see text] for any natural number [Formula: see text].

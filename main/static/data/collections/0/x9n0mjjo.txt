Leading denoising methods such as 3D block matching (BM3D) are patch-based. However, they can suffer from frequency domain artefacts and require to specify explicit noise models. We present a patch-based method that avoids these drawbacks. It combines a simple and fast patch reordering with a non-linear smoothing. The smoothing rewards both patch and pixel similarities in a multiplicative way. We perform experiments on real world images with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and on electron microscopy data with a more general additive noise model. Our filter outperforms BM3D in 77% of the experiments, with improvements of up to 29% with respect to the mean squared error.

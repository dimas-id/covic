Abstract Lectin PFL binding high-mannose glycan derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens and other homologous lectins: PML derived from Pseudomonas mandelii and PTL derived from Pseudomonas taiwanensis were examined for antiviral activity. The cDNA of these lectin genes were synthesized, cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed lectins were purified by gel filtrations, and supplied to cultures infected with several strains of influenza virus. These three lectins have inhibited propagation of influenza viruses with a similar extent, 50% of inhibition-dose was around ten nanomolar concentration. An immunofluorescent microscopy, a microarray analysis, and several infection experiments with different time periods of lectin addition or using the competitor substrates indicated that binding of these lectins with high-mannose glycan on HA protein of influenza virus could block the virus entry into the host cells, thereby resulting in inhibition of the virus propagation. These Pseudomonas-derived lectins would be protential and attractive antiviral agents targeting glycoproteins of enveloped viruses including influenza virus.

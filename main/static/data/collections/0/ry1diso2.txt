Abstract Objective Evaluate adoption and outcomes of locally-designed reporting guidelines for patients with possible COVID-19. Methods We developed a departmental guideline for radiologists that specified reporting terminology and required communication for patients with imaging findings suggestive of COVID-19, based on patient test status and imaging indication. In this retrospective study, radiology reports completed 3/1/2020-5/3/2020 that mentioned COVID-19 were reviewed. Reports were divided into patients with known COVID-19, patients with “suspected” COVID-19 (having an order indication of respiratory or infectious signs or symptoms), and “unsuspected patients” (other order indications, e.g., trauma or non-chest pain). Primary outcome was percentage of COVID-19 reports using recommended terminology; secondary outcome was percentages of suspected and unsuspected patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Relationships between categorical variables were assessed with Fisher’s exact test. Results Among 77,400 total reports, 1,083 suggested COVID-19 based on imaging findings; 774 (71%) of COVID-19 reports used recommended terminology. Of 574 patients without known COVID-19 at time of interpretation, 345 (60%) were eventually diagnosed with COVID-19, including 61% (315/516) of suspected and 52% (30/58) of unsuspected patients. Nearly all (46/58) unsuspected patients were identified at CT. Discussion Radiologists rapidly adopted recommended reporting terminology for patients with suspected COVID-19. The majority of patients for whom radiologists raised concern for COVID-19 were subsequently diagnosed with the disease, including the majority of clinically unsuspected patients. Using unambiguous terminology and timely notification about previously unsuspected patients will become increasingly critical to facilitate COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as states begin to lift restrictions.

Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is an endogenous lipid mediator of inflammation derived from arachidonic acid by the sequential action of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase. This mediator was initially recognized for its involvement in the recruitment of neutrophils. However, in the last decade, LTB4 has been clearly demonstrated to play a significant role in the control of microbial infections through its ability to activate host innate defenses. In this review, we will focus on the modulator effects of LTB4 on the innate defenses and discuss its therapeutic potential against viral pathogens.

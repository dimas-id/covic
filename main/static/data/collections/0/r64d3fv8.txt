Perhaps for the first time in history, a single statistical measure is now dictating the entirety of UK government policy. The ‘basic reproduction number’, R0 value for Covid‐19 is more directly determining economic and social policy than has ever the inflation rate, interest rate, or exchange rate. It is encouraging to see political policy for once ‘rational’ but disappointing it took a pandemic to make it so. However, is R0 an appropriate and significant measure? Like many mathematics/statistical parameters, R0 is relatively easy to explain, more complicated to understand (even graphically), and very difficult to calculate, or use for modelling. Given its significance for all our lives, it is important to understand a little of its background. This article seeks to explain the issues in a non‐technical way, relegating all equations (used sparingly) to appendices.

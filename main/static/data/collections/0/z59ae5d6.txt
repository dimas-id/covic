A series of Î²-amino alcohol tethered 4-aminoquinoline-isatin conjugates were synthesized with the aim of probing their antimalarial structure activity relationship. Two of the most active conjugates (11b and 11f) exhibited antimalarial efficacy comparable to that of chloroquine, with IC(50) values of 11.8 and 13.5 nM, respectively against chloroquine resistant W2 strain of Plasmodium falciparum and are devoid of any cytotoxicity.

RNA viruses and retroviruses fix substitutions approximately 1 million-fold faster than their hosts. This diversification could represent an inevitable drift under purifying selection, the majority of substitutions being phenotypically neutral. The alternative is to suppose that most fixed mutations are beneficial to the virus, allowing it to keep ahead of the host and/or host population. Here, relative sequence diversification of different proteins encoded by viral genomes is found to be linear. The examples encompass a wide variety of retroviruses and RNA viruses. The smoothness of relative divergence spans quasispeciation following clonal infection, to variation among different isolates of the same virus, to viruses from different species or those associated with different diseases, indicating that the majority of fixed mutations likely reflects drift. This held for both mammalian and plant viruses, indicating that adaptive immunity doesn't necessarily shape the relative accumulation of amino acid substitutions. When compared to their hosts RNA viruses evolution appears conservative.

BACKGROUND In continued efforts to further improve the advantages of minimally invasive surgery to patients, surgeons have developed single-incision laparoscopic techniques. We report our initial experience in children with a variety of single-site procedures. METHOD A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who underwent a single-site procedure from April 2009 to April 2010. RESULTS There were 142 consecutive procedures: 24 cholecystectomies, 103 appendectomies for nonperforated appendicitis, 2 splenectomies, 1 combined splenectomy/cholecystectomy, 8 ileocecectomies, 2 Meckel diverticulectomies, 1 small bowel duplication resection, and 1 jejunal stricture resection. There were 12 conversions to conventional laparoscopy: 10 during appendectomy and 2 during cholecystectomy. Mean operative time was 34 minutes for appendectomy, 73 minutes for cholecystectomy, 90 minutes for splenectomy, 116 minutes for combined splenectomy/cholecystectomy, 86 minutes for ileocecectomy, and 43 minutes for the small bowel procedures. The only complications were umbilical surgical site infections after appendectomy in 6 patients. CONCLUSION This institution's preliminary experience suggests that single-incision laparoscopic surgery in children has at least comparable outcomes to conventional laparoscopic surgery. However, prospective data are needed to prove that single-incision laparoscopic surgery is superior to conventional laparoscopy.

The majority of fatalities thus far in the COVID-19 pandemic have been attributed to pneumonia. As expected, the fatality rate reported in China is higher in people with chronic pulmonary disease (6.3%) and those who have cancer (5.6%). According to the American College of Cardiology Clinical Bulletin “COVID-19 Clinical Guidance for the CV Care Team”, there is a significantly higher fatality rate in people who are elderly (8.0% 70-79 years; 14.8% ≥80 years), diabetic (7.3%), hypertensive (6.0%), or have known cardiovascular disease (CVD) (10.5%). We propose a biological reason for the higher mortality risk in these populations that is apparent. We further present a set of pathophysiological reasons for the heightened danger that could lead to therapies for enhanced management and prevention. MVD And COVID Abstract The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov2) results in COVID-19 which can lead to severe illness and death. The majority of fatalities thus far in the pandemic have been attributed to pneumonia. The overall mortality risk reported as of March 28, 2020 varies from 2.3% in China, 2.7% in Iran, and 0.5% in South Korea. As expected, the fatality rate reported in China is higher in people with chronic pulmonary disease (6.3%) and those who have cancer (5.6%). According to the American College of Cardiology Clinical Bulletin “COVID-19 Clinical Guidance for the CV Care Team”, there is a significantly higher fatality rate in people who are elderly (8.0% 70-79; 14.8% ≥80), diabetic (7.3%), hypertensive (6.0%), or have known cardiovascular disease (CVD) (10.5%). We propose a reason for the higher mortality risk in these populations that is not apparent. We further present a set of pathophysiological reasons for the heightened danger could lead to therapies for enhanced management and prevention.

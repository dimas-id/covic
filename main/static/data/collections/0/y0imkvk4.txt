This is a case report of a 55-year-old male patient, medically free presented to the emergency department at our hospital, King Fahd Armed Forces Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The patient presented with generalized abdominal pain and nausea only, without fever or any respiratory symptoms. On a computed tomography scan examination of the abdomen to rule out bowel ischemia, an incidental finding of a typical appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia was found at the visualized lung bases. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed afterward by laboratory testing. Conclusion: Typical COVID-19 findings can be suggested on lung bases at abdominal CT.

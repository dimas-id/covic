RATIONALE Radiation enteritis (RE) is one of the serious complications caused by the radiotherapy and it can occur in any segment of the intestine, including small intestine, colon, and rectum. It can cause a number of serious problems of the intestine, such as chronic ulcers, bleeding, intestinal stenosis, intestinal fistula, and perforation. At present, there is no standard treatment guideline for the RE. PATIENT CONCERNS A 54-year-old male patient received surgery and chemotherapy for rectal cancer and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for a single metastatic carcinoma of the liver. Three years later, he was diagnosed with recurrent lesion in the rectal anastomotic stoma and was treated with radiotherapy with a total dose of 70 Gy. Following this, he had persistent abdominal pain and diarrhea for 1 year. DIAGNOSES Colonoscopy confirmed a diagnosis of RE. INTERVENTIONS Since intestinal probiotics, intestinal mucosal protectants, antidiarrheal drugs, and other treatments were not effective; the patient was treated by RFA. OUTCOMES Clinical symptoms of the patient were gradually decreased after the RFA. Colonoscopy examination was performed 3 months later and intestinal mucosa was found to have healed well. LESSONS RFA is an effective treatment for patients with RE, and it is expected to be one of the standard treatments for the RE.

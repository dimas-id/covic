Attaching and effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) adhere to mucosal epithelium in both small and large intestine and induce a distinctive lesion characterized by an irregular scalloped appearance of the epithelial layer. Infection with attaching and effacing E. coli was detected in 14 calves, 7 pigs, 2 lambs, and 3 dogs. Affected animals were from farms and kennels in South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. Ages of affected animals were calves, 2 days to 4 months; pigs, 1-6 weeks; lambs, 1 week; and dogs, 7-8 weeks. Clinical signs included diarrhea in all animals, but other nonenteric disease problems were present in some animals. Concurrent infection with other enteropathogens was detected in 9 calves and 5 pigs. Infection with AEEC appeared to be the sole cause of illness and death in some animals. There was evidence of intestinal hemorrhage in 5 of the calves and in all 3 dogs. Attaching and effacing lesions varied from small scattered foci to widespread involvement of large areas of intestinal mucosa. Verotoxin was produced by E. coli strains isolated from 9 calves, but not by strains from pigs, lambs, or dogs.

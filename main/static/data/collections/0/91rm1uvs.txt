The study reported here investigated the efficacy of two commonly used modified-live virus vaccines to induce seroconversion against canine parvovirus (CPV) in 213 Rottweiler and Doberman pinscher pups with various titers of maternally derived CPV antibody. Beginning at 6 to 8 weeks of age, pups were given a subcutaneous vaccination every 21 days (range, 18-24 days) in the dorsal region of the neck or shoulder area. Pups vaccinated with vaccine A(a) received three vaccinations and completed the vaccination series by 12 to 14 weeks of age. Pups vaccinated with vaccine Bb received four vaccinations and completed the vaccination series by 15 to 17 weeks of age. Antibody titers against CPV in both vaccine groups were similar before vaccination. Pups in the vaccine-A group seroconverted significantly earlier than those in the vaccine-B group. After the first vaccination, more pups with a CPV-2b hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of < or = 1:80 responded to vaccine A than to vaccine B. In addition, CPV-2b HI titers after vaccination were also significantly (P < or = 0.05) higher for the pups in the vaccine-A group after first, second, and third vaccinations, compared with those of pups in the vaccine-B group.

The molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases is currently going through a revolution sustained by the regulatory approval of amplification tests that have been shown to be equivalent or superior to existing gold standard methods. The recent approval of a microarray system for the pharmacogenomic profiling of cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism is paving the way to novel, rapid, sensitive, robust and economical microfabricated systems for point-of-care diagnostics, which are utilized closer and closer to the patient's bedside. These systems will enable the multiparametric genetic evaluation of several medical conditions, including infectious diseases. This forecoming revolution will position molecular theranostics in a broader integrated view of personalized medicine, which exploits genetic information from microbes and human hosts to optimize patient management and disease treatment.

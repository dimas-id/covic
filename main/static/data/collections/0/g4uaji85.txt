BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare the rates for resolution and improvement of common comorbidities between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The comorbid conditions included were type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemias (LPD), degenerative joint disease (DJD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. METHODS A retrospective chart review of the patients who underwent LSG or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding at our institution from July 2004 to July 2007 was performed. The resolution of comorbidities was determined via patient-completed questionnaires and objective data. RESULTS Of the 123 patients (29 men and 94 women) reviewed, 49 had undergone LSG, and 74 had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 52 kg/m(2) for the LSG patients and 44 kg/m(2) for the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding patients. The overall percentages of excess weight loss (%EWL) were respectively 50.6 and 40.3% (P = 0.03) during mean follow-up periods of 15 and 17 months. There was a greater resolution or improvement of DM after LSG (100% vs 46%), HTN (78% vs 48%), and LPD (87% vs. 50%) than after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Other comorbidities resolved or improved at a similar rate. CONCLUSIONS Although both LSG and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding resulted in postoperative improvement or resolution of comorbidities associated with obesity, LSG statistically showed a significantly higher rate of resolution or improvement of DM, HTN, and LPD. There was no significant difference between the groups for DJD, GERD, OSA, or asthma.

The emergence of the novel betacoronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has raised serious concerns due to the virus's rapid dissemination worldwide. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS‐CoV‐2 circulating in Italy from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the SARS‐CoV‐2 introduction and establishment in the country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analyzed complete genomes of SARS‐CoV‐2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS‐CoV‐2. Continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and understanding of the current SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.

Over the last century, changes in land-use, modification of agriculture-livestock production systems, disruption of wildlife habitats, increase of human activities, higher frequency of international and intercontinental travels, wider circulation of animals and animal products have contributed to alter the distribution, presence and density of hosts and vectors. As a result, the number of emerging and reemerging diseases, including zoonoses, have greatly increased. Some infectious pathogens, originated in wild animals and/or maintained in sylvatic environments, have become increasingly important worldwide for their impact on wildlife, human health, livestock and agricultural production systems. In this paper, a synthesis of the information available on selected zoonoses of wildlife origin is given, with special reference to sylvatic tick-borne zoonoses in North-western Italy.

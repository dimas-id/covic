Blood serum lipase activity was determined in 48 young dogs with acute enteritis or gastroenteritis due to canine parvovirus (16 cases) and presumably to other infectious agents (32 cases). Elevated serum lipase activity (> 500 U/L) was found in 13 dogs (27.1%) with values ranging from 800 to 2,780 U/L. The hyperlipasemia of these cases may be attributed to acute pancreatitis secondary to acute gastroenteritis or to gastrointestinal upset.

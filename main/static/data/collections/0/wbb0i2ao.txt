The acetylesterase (AE) activity of DVIM (diarrhea virus of infant mice) was assigned to the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. The substrate specificity was examined using the natural substrate bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and/or synthetic substrates p-nitrophenylacetate (p-NiA) and α-naphthylacetate (α-NA) and compared with several strains of MHV and influenza viruses. The AE of DVIM hydrolyzed the O-acetylester bond of BSM, and the two synthetic substrates p-NiA and α-NA in vitro. MHV-S reacted efficiently with both p-NiA and α-NA but less with BSM. Influenza virus (C/Miyagi/77) reacted with BSM efficiently, however reacted with p-NiA weakly, but not with α-NA at all. Thus, the AE-reactivity of DVIM was distinctly different from that of MHV-S and influenza C virus, suggesting that the AE of HE may have a modified function. Isolation of HE by the treatment with non ionic detergent NP40, resulted in globules approximately 5 nm in diameter. DVIM-binding proteins were demonstrated in the plasma membrane of mouse intestinal brush-border cells and hepatocytes. The same protein was recognized by MHV-S and MHV-4. The cell membranes obtained from these target tissues were substrates for the AE of DVIM. The biological importance of the HE protein for DVIM is discussed.

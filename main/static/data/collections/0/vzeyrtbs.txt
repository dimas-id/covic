BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The utility of computed tomographic perfusion (CTP)-based patient selection for intra-arterial treatment of acute ischemic stroke has not been proven in randomized trials and requires further study in a cohort that was not selected based on CTP. Our objective was to study the relationship between CTP-derived parameters and outcome and treatment effect in patients with acute ischemic stroke because of a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. METHODS We included 175 patients who underwent CTP in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands (MR CLEAN). Association of CTP-derived parameters (ischemic-core volume, penumbra volume, and percentage ischemic core) with outcome was estimated with multivariable ordinal logistic regression as an adjusted odds ratio for a shift in the direction of a better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale. Interaction between CTP-derived parameters and treatment effect was determined using multivariable ordinal logistic regression. Interaction with treatment effect was also tested for mismatch (core <70 mL; penumbra core >1.2; penumbra core >10 mL). RESULTS The adjusted odds ratio for improved functional outcome for ischemic core, percentage ischemic core, and penumbra were 0.79 per 10 mL (95% confidence interval: 0.71-0.89; P<0.001), 0.82 per 10% (95% confidence interval: 0.66-0.90; P=0.002), and 0.97 per 10 mL (96% confidence interval: 0.92-1.01; P=0.15), respectively. No significant interaction between any of the CTP-derived parameters and treatment effect was observed. We observed no significant interaction between mismatch and treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS CTP seems useful for predicting functional outcome, but cannot reliably identify patients who will not benefit from intra-arterial therapy.

We present a case of prenatally diagnosed Wilms tumor, with subsequent operative approach and management. The patient was referred to our institution with an abnormal prenatal renal ultrasound. Computed tomography scan after delivery showed a multifocal enhancing left renal mass. The patient underwent an uncomplicated left laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node sampling using a novel hidden incision endoscopic surgery technique. Final pathology revealed favorable histology stage II Wilms tumor. The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine and dactinomycin based on the EE4A regimen. We highlight the diagnostic pathway, perioperative management, surgical approach, and early postoperative follow-up in this case report.

Primary vasculitis are commonly multifactorial disorders involving environmental, genetic and immunological factors. Several immune-based effector mechanisms are implicated in the vascular wall damage. These effector mechanisms commonly imply auto-antibodies or immune complexes - mediated cytotoxicity but the contribution of a T-cell mediated immune response has also been described, particularly in large vascular vasculitis. Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of vasculitis, the triggering events initiating the disease remain largely undefined in most cases. This review highlights the recent advances in the etiopathogenesis of primary vasculitis. A better understanding of the immunological aspects of these disorders may provide insight into the development of novel therapeutical strategies.

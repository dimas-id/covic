We identified the domains of CD26 involved in the binding of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) using distinct clones of anti-CD26 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). One clone, named 2F9, almost completely inhibited viral entry. The humanized anti-CD26 MAb YS110 also significantly inhibited infection. These findings indicate that both 2F9 and YS110 are potential therapeutic agents for MERS-CoV infection. YS110, in particular, is a good candidate for immediate testing as a therapeutic modality for MERS.

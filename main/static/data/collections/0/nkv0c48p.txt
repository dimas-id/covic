In infected cells, only the genomic RNA of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) is packaged into the virions. In this study, we show that a subgenomic (sg) defective interfering (DI) RNA can be packaged into virions when it contains the DI RNA packaging signal (DI RNA-Ps). However, the sg DI RNA is packaged less efficiently than the DI genomic RNA. Thus, while specificity of packaging of RNAs into MHV-A59 virions is determined by the DI RNA-Ps, efficiency of packaging is determined by additional factors.

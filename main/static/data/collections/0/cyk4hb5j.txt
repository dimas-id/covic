BACKGROUND It has been reported that early clot removal benefits patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by removing obstruction and preserving valve function. However, a substantial number of patients who had successful clot removal develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Residual thrombus and rethrombosis play a part in this phenomenon, but the role of coexisting primary chronic venous disease (PCVD) in these patients has not been studied. METHODS All patients who underwent catheter-based techniques of thrombus removal for symptomatic acute iliofemoral DVT during a 5-year period compose the study group. These patients were assessed for PTS by the Villalta scale, the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study on Quality of Life (VEINES-QOL) questionnaire. The presence of coexisting PCVD was determined by clinical and duplex ultrasound findings in the contralateral leg at the time of the initial DVT diagnosis. Patients who had coexisting PCVD were compared with those without PCVD. RESULTS Forty patients (40 limbs) were included in the study group. At initial diagnosis, 15 patients (38%) had coexisting symptomatic primary valve reflux in the unaffected limb. After thrombolysis, 9 of 40 limbs (22%) had complete lysis, 29 (73%) had â‰¥ 50% to 99% lysis, and 2 (5%) had <50% lysis. The mean percentage of lysis in patients with or without PCVD was similar (78% vs 86%; P = .13). Patients without coexisting PCVD had significantly better Villalta score and VCSS compared with those with coexisting PCVD (Villalta score, 2.52 vs 3.27, P = .014; VCSS, 2.96 vs 3.29, P = .005). Forty-five percent of patients (18 of 40) developed PTS. Patients who developed PTS had less clot lysis than those without PTS. This was true for patients with coexisting PCVD (60% vs 85%; P = .025) and in patients without PCVD (75% vs 89%; P = .013). There was no significant difference in the VEINES-QOL score between those with or without PCVD (79.5 vs 80.5; P = .9). Patients who had reflux in the treated limb after lysis had a five times greater chance for development of PTS compared with those who retained normal valve function during follow-up (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-17.045). However, in patients with normal veins in the contralateral leg, the chance of development of PTS was 1.5 times higher if reflux was present in the treated limb (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.043-10.253). CONCLUSIONS Coexisting PCVD is a contributing factor to development of PTS after treatment of iliofemoral DVT with thrombus removal techniques.

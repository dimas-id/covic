PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the current understanding of virus attenuation by large-scale recoding of viral genomes and discusses what would ultimately be necessary for construction of better and safer live modified virus vaccines. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been shown that codon and codon pair deoptimization are rapid and robust methods that can be used for the development of attenuated vaccine candidates. The viruses attenuated by large-scale recoding have the added value that they are extremely genetically stable. However, the exact mechanisms that lead to viral attenuation by recoding are yet to be determined. SUMMARY: While the advantages of large-scale recoding (speed, simplicity, potency, and universal applicability) have been known for more than a decade, this approach has been only inadequately explored and the attention was focused on a limited number of RNA viruses. Attenuation of viruses by large-scale recoding should be explored to combat known and future viral threats.

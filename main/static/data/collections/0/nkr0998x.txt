This case–control study investigated immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) risk following live, inactivated, and simultaneous vaccination, with a focus on infants aged < 2 years. We matched case patients with ITP to one or two control patients with other diseases by institution, hospital visit timing, sex, and age. We calculated McNemar’s pairwise odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) with 114 case–control pairs. The case group had 27 (44%) males and 22 (35%) infants, and the control group included 49 (43%) males and 42 (37%) infants. For all age groups, the McNemar’s OR for ITP occurrence was 1.80 (0.54–6.84, p = 0.64) for all vaccines. Among infants, these were 1.50 (0.17–18.0, p = 0.50) for all vaccines, 2.00 (0.29–22.1, p = 0.67) for live vaccines, and 1.00 (0.01–78.5, p = 0.50) for inactivated vaccines. Sex-adjusted common ORs for simultaneous vaccination were 1.52 (0.45–5.21, p = 0.71) for all vaccines, 1.83 (0.44–7.59, p = 0.40) for inactivated vaccines only, and 1.36 (0.29–6.30, p = 0.69) for mixed live and inactivated vaccines. In infants, these were 1.95 (0.44–8.72, p = 0.38), 1.41 (0.29–6.94, p = 0.67) and 2.85 (0.43–18.9, p = 0.28), respectively. These limited data suggest no significant ITP risk following vaccinations or simultaneous vaccination in any age group, including infants.

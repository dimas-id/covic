PURPOSE: Chlamydia psittaci infection in humans can lead to serious clinical manifestations, including severe pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and, rarely, death. Implementation of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) gives a promising new tool for diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of severe psittacosis pneumonia is described to provide physicians with a better understanding and to highlight the rarity and severity of severe psittacosis pneumonia. METHODS: Nine cases of severe psittacosis pneumonia were diagnosed using mNGS. Retrospective analysis of the data on disease progression, new diagnosis tool, treatments, and outcomes, and the findings were summarised. RESULTS: Frequent symptoms included chills and remittent fever (100%), cough and hypodynamia (100%), and headache and myalgia (77.8%). All patients were severe psittacosis pneumonia developed respiratory failure, accompanied by sepsis in 6/9 patients. mNGS takes 48â€“72 h to provide the results, and help to identify diagnosis of psittacosis. Laboratory data showed normal or slightly increased leucocytes, neutrophils, and procalcitonin but high C-reactive protein levels. Computed tomography revealed air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, which began in the upper lobe of one lung, and spread to both lungs, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. One patient died because of secondary infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the other eight patients experienced complete recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mNGS can improve accuracy and reduce the delay in diagnosis of psittacosis. Severe psittacosis pneumonia responds well to the timely use of appropriate antibiotics.

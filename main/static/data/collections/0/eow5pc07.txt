PURPOSE In our center, patients with anorectal malformation, including males with recto-vesical (RV)/recto-bladder neck (RBN)/recto-prostatic urethral (RU) fistulas, and females with recto-vaginal (RV) fistulas have been treated by posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) before 2000, and by laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) thereafter. We would like to compare the quality of life (QOL) and long-term defecative function between these two groups of patients 10 years after reconstructive surgery. METHODS Patients who underwent LAARP between 2001 and 2005 were compared with historical controls treated with PSARP between 1996 and 2000. Degrees of continence were graded by the Krickenbeck classification and Kelly's score. QOL was assessed by Hirschsprung's disease/Anorectal Malformation Quality of Life (HAQL) questionnaire. Results were compared using Chi-square test and t test. RESULTS There were 14 LAARP and 7 PSARP patients. All attained voluntary bowel movements. Moderate to severe soiling (Krickenbeck Grade 2 and 3) was found in 3/14 LAARP (21.4%) and 1/7 PSARP (14.3%) patients, p = 1.00. Constipation requiring use of laxatives was present in 3/14 LAARP (28.6%) and 1/7 PSARP (14.3%) patients, p = 0.62. Mean Kelly's scores were 3.79 ± 0.98 (LAARP) and 4.71 ± 1.25 (PSARP), p = 0.12. No patient required Malone antegrade continence enema (MACE). The QOL scores based on the HAQL questionnaire were comparable between the two groups in all areas except social functioning, in which the LAARP patients attained a significantly lower mean score (26.4 vs 71.7, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION The 10-year outcome between LAARP and PSARP patients in terms of QOL and defecative function is comparable. Impairment in social functioning in these patients is reflected by the self-reported lower level of functioning.

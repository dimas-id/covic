Colchicine is an alkaloid which was originally extracted from bulbs of a plant called Colchicum autumnale (meadow saffron). Its active pharmacological component was isolated in 1820 and in 1833 the active ingredient was purified and named colchicine. It consists of three hexameric rings termed A, B, and C. It was first recommended for the treatment of gout by Alexander of Tralles in the sixth century AD. Later it has been employed for suggested and approved indications including primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), alcohol induced hepatitis, psoriasis, Beh√ßet disease, Sweet syndrome, scleroderma, sarcoidosis and amyloidosis. Perhaps the most effective results have been obtained in the prophylaxis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Colchicine is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum and is trapped in the body tissues. It is metabolized in the liver and the intestine by cytochrome P (CYP) 450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PGY) 1. Colchicine is excreted mainly by the biliary system, intestines and the kidneys. It has a narrow therapeutic range, but with normal liver and kidney functions is relatively safe and can be used during pregnancy, nursing and in infants. The main mechanism of action of colchicine is probably through interaction with microtubules affecting leukocyte chemotaxis, thereby suppressing inflammation. The blood level of colchicine may be affected by concomitant drug administration and therefore, caution should be exercised when such medications are added.

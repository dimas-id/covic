The ECMO device is complex and requires a precise, thorough, and constant management. The aim of this chapter is to describe and explain the different aspects of managing ECMO patients at bedside after implantation. We will be discussing here only about centrifugal pumps. The monitoring of an ECMO patient starts first like the surveillance of any ICU patient starting with a head-to-toe assessment of the patient. In addition to these regular ICU rounds will be added the following: The monitoring of the ECMO device itself. The surveillance of all the potential risks linked to the ECMO. Some clues to troubleshoot the main adverse events.

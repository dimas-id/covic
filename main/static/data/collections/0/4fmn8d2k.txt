AIM: Review of studies on the psychological stress of healthcare workers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed was performed using the terms "COVID-19", "stress", "mental health", "healthcare worker", "staff", "psychiatry". Quantitative studies (including letters to the editor) published from January to March 2020 were included. RESULTS: 14 studies on healthcare workers in departments of infectiology, internal medicine, and fever wards including intensive care wards as well as surgery and psychiatry, were included. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9), Self-rating-Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) were the most often used test instruments. The sample size ranged between 37 and 1257 participants consisting of mostly nursing and medical personnel. The fraction of COVID-19-associated activities varied from 7.5â% to 100â%. An extensive strain was reported due to stress experience as well as depression and anxiety symptoms. Severe degrees of those symptoms were found in 2.2â% to 14.5â% of all participants. The severity of mental symptoms was influenced by age, gender, occupation, specialization, type of activities performed and proximity to COVID-19 patients. As mediator variables selection of personnel, preventive interventions, resilience, and social support were reported. CONCLUSION: Considering the frequency of mental symptoms occurring in healthcare workers, accompanying mental health informed interventions to facilitate coping are necessary. Further research in this field is needed.

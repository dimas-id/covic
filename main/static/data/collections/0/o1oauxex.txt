Abstract Worldwide, neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important health issues affecting dairy calves, and rotavirus A (RVA) is one of its primary causes. Among the measures to mitigate the risk of diarrhea outbreaks, cow vaccination stands out as one of the most important. However, the immune pressure resulting from routine vaccination may be able to select specific G and P genotypes in RVA field strains. This study aimed to determine the frequency and intensity of neonatal diarrhea and the incidence of RVA and attempted to monitor the G and P genotypes present in the RVA strains circulating in a high milk yield cattle herd vaccinated with RVA G6P[5] strain. Fecal samples (n = 1220) from 122 Holstein heifer calves between 0â€“30 days old that were born from RVA-vaccinated cows were collected at 10 different time points, regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea. The presence of RVA in fecal samples was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) technique and confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). G and P amplicons from 10 RVA-positive fecal samples from calves of different ages and collections were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The proportion of the calves and fecal samples that were positive for RVA were 62.3% (76/122) and 8.1% (99/1220), respectively. Using sequence analysis, all 10 RVA field strains presented genotype G10P[11]. The protection of G6P[5] vaccination is clear, as this genotype was not detected in this study, and it is known that vaccination against RVA reduces the incidence of diarrhea independent of genotype involved. This result demonstrates the importance of epidemiological monitoring of RVA genotypes circulating in vaccinated dairy cattle herds to the early detection of new potential pathogenic RVA strains.

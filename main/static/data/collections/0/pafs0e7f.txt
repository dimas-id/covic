Robotic total pancreatectomy (RTP) is a novel surgical approach currently performed by a select group of skilled surgeons. As robotic approaches to pancreatic surgery increase worldwide, rates of RTP are expected to increase. However, the standard technique is still evolving and several technical problems still require evaluation. Here, we describe our approach in a stepwise fashion and discuss solutions to overcome technical difficulties.

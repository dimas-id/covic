Peyronie's disease (PD) has a significant impact on the quality of life of both patients and their partners due to the compromised sexual function and physical deformation resulting from the condition. PD is a connective tissue disorder marked by fibrotic healing of the tunica albuginea, leading to penile deformities including curvature, shortening, loss of girth, hourglass appearance, and hinging. Despite the multiple medical therapies available, surgery is the gold standard of treatment once the plaque has stabilized. We present a review of the disease process, preoperative evaluation, operative planning, surgical treatments with outcomes and complications, and nascent developments in surgical management and graft development. Options include tunical lengthening procedures, tunical shortening procedures, and penile prosthesis. Decision-making is governed by degree of curvature, erectile function, and associated penile deformities. In cases with curvature of less than 60-70 degrees, adequate penile length, and no hourglass deformity, patients are candidates for tunical shortening procedures. Patients with curvature greater than 60-70 degrees, penile hourglass or hinge-destabilizing deformities, and adequate erectile function should be counseled with regard to tunical lengthening procedures. Patients with poor preoperative erectile function should undergo inflatable penile prosthesis placement, with possible secondary straightening procedures. Technique selection should be based upon surgeon preference, expertise, and experience, as evidence does not necessarily support one procedure over another.

When facing high-dimensional data streams, clustering algorithms quickly reach the boundaries of their usefulness as most of these methods are not designed to deal with the curse of dimensionality. Due to inherent sparsity in high-dimensional data, distances between objects tend to become meaningless since the distances between any two objects measured in the full dimensional space tend to become the same for all pairs of objects. In this work, we present a novel oriented subspace clustering algorithm that is able to deal with such issues and detects arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters in high-dimensional data streams. Data streams generally implicate the challenge that the data cannot be stored entirely and hence there is a general demand for suitable data handling strategies for clustering algorithms such that the data can be processed within a single scan. We therefore propose the CashStream algorithm that unites state-of-the-art stream processing techniques and additionally relies on the Hough transform to detect arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters. Our experiments compare CashStream to its static counterpart and show that the amount of consumed memory is significantly decreased while there is no loss in terms of runtime.

OBJECTIVE: Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside‐Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. METHODS: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 23, 2020. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Demographic, clinical and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases who were immigrated from Wuhan; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 “generations” was observed. Five asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8‐84) years and 49 (47.12%) were male. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1‐32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days, 96 (92.31%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. Average hospital stay was 10 (rang, 8‐14) days. CONCLUSIONS: Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers, suggesting the timely control measures after the Wuhan shutdown wok well. Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID‐19. A 14‐day quarantine may need to be prolonged. This article is protected by copyright.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has affected millions of people. A ‘closed‐off management’ protocol has been launched nationwide in China to cope with this major public health emergency. However, these procedures may cause a crisis for blood donation and blood supply. In this study, we assessed the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on blood donation and supply in Zhejiang province, which could provide reference and insight for developing countermeasures in other countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood donor and supply information from 38 blood centres during the Spring Festival of 2019 and 2020 were reviewed. A self‐administered questionnaire was carried out. RESULTS: Due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, the number of whole blood donors dropped by 67%. The success rate of recruitment for donations dropped by 60%. Most respondents (81·2%) were worried about the ‘possibility of acquiring COVID‐19 during blood donation’. The total amount of RBCs supply dropped by 65%. In the first week of the outbreak, the weekly amount of issued RBC units (10171·5 u) was almost six times higher than the collected units (1347·5 u). The mean haemoglobin value for RBCs transfusion was about 6·3 g/dl. About 4% of RBCs and 2·8% of frozen plasma were used in COVID‐19 patients. CONCLUSION: The secondary consequences of the COVID‐19 pandemic are blood shortages caused by the unavailability of blood donors, and this is likely to be replicated in many countries with high burdens of COVID‐19. Practical actions to broaden sources and reduce use for the global crisis must be taken proactively.

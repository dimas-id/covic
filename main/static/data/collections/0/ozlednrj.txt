Time to unwind: Graphene oxide (GO) enables the quantitative measurement of helicase‐dependent double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) unwinding activity in real time. GO selectively binds to unwound fluorescent‐dye‐labeled single‐stranded DNA and quenches its fluorescence (see picture). The helicase activity is monitored by following the change in fluorescence.[Image: see text]

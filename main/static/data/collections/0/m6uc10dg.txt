A retrospective evaluation of PEDV positive samples recovered in Spain before and after the re-emergence of this coronavirus in several European countries was carried out. We described for the first time recombinant SeCoV circulating in Spain between 1993 and 2014 and its misidentification as PEDV when diagnostic assays based on the S-protein or S-gene of the PEDV were used. The complete S-gene sequence of 7 Spanish SeCoV and 30 PEDV Spanish isolates was phylogenetically analysed including the S-gene sequences of the three SeCoV and a representative selection of the PEDV strains with complete genome sequences available in the GenBank. The tree showed a common ancestor for the S-gene of the PEDV and SeCoV, but no evolution from any known PEDV clade was shown for the SeCoV strains. Moreover, complete genome sequences were obtained from 23 PEDV strains recovered in Spanish swine farms since 2014. The phylogenetic tree showed the INDEL type genogroup of these Spanish strains, supporting the lower pathogenicity of this genogroup since no significant economic losses were reported in the affected Spanish swine farms. Four subgroups were detected among PEDV strains in Spain, closely related to the recent European strains. Moreover, eight of the most recent Spanish PEDV isolates formed a subclade together with three European strains from 2015, showing a new evolution branch with a recombinant virus.

COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease with widespread transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. Some of those infected become seriously ill. Others do not show any symptoms, but can still contribute to the transmission of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is excreted in the oral cavity and can be spread via aerosols. Therefore, there is an increased risk of its spread during aerosol-producing treatments in dental care clinics. Due to the risk of infection of dental care workers and patients, and based on the evidence currently available, additional infection control measures for all patients are strongly recommended when providing emergency dental care in this phase of the pandemic. Other treatments should be postponed. Based on guidance in scientific literature and advice from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), consideration should be given to what infection control measures are necessary when providing emergency and regular dental care in both the current situation and in the future.

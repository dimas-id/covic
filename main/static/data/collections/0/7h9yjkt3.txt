The CoVID-19 epidemic started in Wuhan, China and spread to 217 other countries around the world through direct contact with patients, goods transfer, animal transport, and touching unclean surfaces. In the Middle East, the first confirmed case in both Iran and UAE originated from China. A series of infections since those confirmed cases started in the Middle East originated from Qom, Iran, and other Shi'ite holy places. Thereafter, CoVID-19 has been transmitted to other countries in the Middle East. This report aims to trace all of the confirmed cases in the Middle East until March 6, 2020 and their further spread. This report proves that further transmission of CoVID-19 to the Middle East was because of human mobility, besides engaging in different Jewish and Shi'ite religious rites. This report suggests avoiding several religious rites, closing the borders of infected countries, and supporting the infected countries to prevent further transmission.

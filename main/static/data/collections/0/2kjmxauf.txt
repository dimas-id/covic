Summary Enhanced surveillance systems have been implemented recently in many countries in order to rapidly detect and investigate any possible cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection among travellers returning from the Middle East, including notably Hajj pilgrims. According to the available surveillance data, only a few sporadic travel-associated MERS-CoV cases have been reported outside the Arabian Peninsula so far, mainly in Europe, North Africa, and Asia. These have resulted in no cases, or limited numbers of secondary cases except in Korea. The vast majority of viral respiratory infections in pilgrims returning home have been due to seasonal influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and other known coronaviruses distinct from the MERS coronavirus. Influenza vaccination should be a priority for all Hajj pilgrims, as recommended by experts.

INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal mesh repair (TEP) of inguinal hernia has become well accepted with low recurrence and high patient satisfaction rates. However, inguinal pain has also been reported. Source of this pain has been suggested to be the fixation method, especially the use of tacks. Introduction of fibrin glue and absorbable tacks were suggested to lower chronic pain and inguinal discomfort rates. This study analyses the different methods of fixation. PATIENTS AND METHODS 201 patients were analysed. Primary end-points were patients' satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and specific inguinal conditions (e.g. pulling, swelling, troubles at coughing). Secondary endpoints were duration of operation, length of hospital stay, and material costs. RESULTS Fibrin glue was used in 101 patients and tacks in 100 patients, in 21 of those absorbable tacks. Patients were fully satisfied with the results in more than 90%, irrespective of the fixation method. Health-related quality of life along the SF-12(Â®) questionnaire attested no differences. Inguinal pulling occurred significantly more often after fibrin glue (25.7 %) than after tack fixation (11 %; p = 0.026), whereas no differences in the other specific inguinal sensations occurred. CONCLUSION Mesh fixation in TEP can be performed either by tacks or by fibrin glue with similar long-term results concerning satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and pain. No advantage of fibrin glue could be found, in fact, a higher percentage of patients had inguinal pulling and burning sensations after the use of fibrin glue. The use of absorbable tacks showed no advantage.

BACKGROUND Macrotextured anatomical implants are frequently used in aesthetic breast surgery; however, several safety concerns linked to this implant type have been raised recently. In an attempt to address these shortcomings, Motiva Ergonomix implants have been introduced. Here, the authors describe the current world's largest experience with these novel devices in aesthetic breast surgery and evaluate the postoperative outcome of 100 primary breast augmentations. METHODS A retrospective assessment of 100 consecutive primary breast augmentation patients over a period of 3 years was conducted. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months postoperatively. Demographics, surgical data, and complications were recorded. In addition, a survey regarding the breast augmentation outcome was performed. RESULTS The reasons for surgery were mainly hypoplasia (52 percent) and ptosis (28 percent). All implants were placed by means of an inframammary approach in a submuscular pocket, and the average implant volume was 370 cc (range, 150 to 700 cc) with mostly full projection (65 percent). The revision rate was 7 percent. The authors observed four cases of implant malpositioning, one implant rupture, one implant exchange for aesthetic reasons, and one hematoma evacuation. Nevertheless, the authors achieved a 100 percent satisfaction rate with the postsurgical outcome among both patients and surgeons. CONCLUSIONS Motiva Ergonomix implants provide reliable and satisfying results for both patients and surgeons. They can be used safely and effectively for aesthetic breast surgery. However, like all breast prostheses, Motiva Ergonomix implants are not completely free of complications and should be used only with advanced technique to achieve optimal results.

Abstract Pestiviruses including bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), border disease virus (BDV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV), occur worldwide and are important pathogens of livestock. A large part of their success can be attributed to the induction of central immunotolerance including B- and T-cells upon fetal infection leading to the generation of persistently infected (PI) animals. In the past few years, it became evident that evasion of innate immunity is a central element to induce and maintain persistent infection. Hence, the viral non-structural protease Npro heads the transcription factor IRF-3 for proteasomal degradation, whereas an extracellularly secreted, soluble form of the envelope glycoprotein Erns degrades immunostimulatory viral single- and double-stranded RNA, which makes this RNase unique among viral endoribonucleases. We propose that these pestiviral interferon (IFN) antagonists maintain a state of innate immunotolerance mainly pertaining its viral nucleic acids, in contrast to the well-established immunotolerance of the adaptive immune system, which is mainly targeted at proteins. In particular, the unique extension of ‘self’ to include the viral genome by degrading immunostimulatory viral RNA by Erns is reminiscent of various host nucleases that are important to prevent inappropriate IFN activation by the host’s own nucleic acids in autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. This mechanism of “innate tolerance” might thus provide a new facet to the role of extracellular RNases in the sustained prevention of the body’s own immunostimulatory RNA to act as a danger-associated molecular pattern that is relevant across various species.

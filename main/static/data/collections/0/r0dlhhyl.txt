BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The endovascular treatment of aneurysms located at or distal to the circle of Willis and not amenable to coiling remains a challenge. We report our experience with flow-diversion treatment using low-profile braided stents as a stent monotherapy procedure for treating distally located very small or uncoilable aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our data bases to identify patients with aneurysms located at or distal to the circle of Willis who were treated with stent monotherapy using low-profile braided stents. The immediate and follow-up angiographic findings and clinical status of the patients were assessed. RESULTS Twenty aneurysms in 19 patients were included in the study. The mean size of the aneurysms was 4.7 Â± 2.4 mm. Patients were treated via telescopic implantation of 2 stents for 11 aneurysms; single-stent placement was used for the remaining aneurysms. The technical success rate was 95%. We observed a technical complication in 1 case (5.3%) and a late ischemic event in another (5.3%). The final angiographies during a mean follow-up of 14.7 months showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 73.7%. The complete occlusion rate of the aneurysms treated with telescopic stent placement was 81.8%. The modified Rankin scale scores of all patients at the last follow-up were between 0 and 2. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion with low-profile braided stents as a stent monotherapy procedure for very small or uncoilable intracranial aneurysms located at or beyond the circle of Willis is a promising, relatively safe, and durable endovascular procedure.

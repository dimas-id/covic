The recent Ebola virus disease outbreak highlighted the need to build national and worldwide capacity to provide care for patients with highly infectious diseases. Specialized biocontainment units were successful in treating a number of critically ill patients with Ebola virus disease both in the United States and Europe. Several key principles underlie the care of critically ill patients in a high containment environment. Environmental factors, staffing, equipment, training, laboratory testing, procedures and waste management each present unique challenges. A multidisciplinary approach is key to developing effective systems and protocols to maintain the safety of patients, staff and communities.

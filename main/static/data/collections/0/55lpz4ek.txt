OLD VS. NEW BPD: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was described about 50 years ago as a fibroproliferative chronic lung disease in consequence of mechanical ventilation/oxygen exposure in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (old BPD). Surfactant therapy with increased survival of extremely premature infants identified a new type of an immaturity-related multisystem disorder that is characterized by a stop/simplification of alveolarisation and lung capillary development (new BPD). THERAPY: To date, mainly symptomatic treatment exists. However, growth factors and stem cell therapy have recently been tested with some success in animal experiments. OUTCOME: Survivors of new BPD may have problems in adult life concerning lung and cardiovascular function, growth and neurosensory and/or motor development.

Background: Limited assessments with handheld ultrasound have found meaningful clinical use in the care of acutely ill patients However, there are limited data on incorporating handheld-based limited echocardiography into the echocardiography laboratory The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of limited handheld tablet echocardiography as an alternative to traditional echocardiography during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a means to limit exposure while providing essential clinical information Method(s): Ninety consecutive inpatients with known or suspected COVID-19 were scanned according to laboratory COVID-19 guidelines using a limited 11- to 20-clip protocol on a tablet sonograph The primary assessment was length of study time Comparison data were drawn from comprehensive echocardiographic examinations ordered on intensive care patients not under COVID-19 precautions Result(s): Over a 36-day time period, a total of 91 requests were deemed to be appropriate for echocardiography on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (average age, 67 years;64% men;mean body mass index, 32 kg/msup2/sup) Of these, 90 (99%) examinations were performed using a handheld device, and all were deemed diagnostic and provided sufficient information for the clinical care team Sonographer scan time decreased from an average of 24 +/- 6 8 min on a traditional platform to 5 4 +/- 1 9 min on a tablet Conclusion(s): Limited handheld echocardiography can be successfully implemented in the echocardiography laboratory for screening of COVID-19-related cardiac conditions The protocol performed with handheld tablet ultrasound provides adequate diagnostic information of major cardiac complications of COVID-19 while decreasing sonographer contact and simplifying decontamination Copyright Â© 2020 American Society of Echocardiography

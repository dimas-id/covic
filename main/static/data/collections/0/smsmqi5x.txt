Abstract China has experienced outstanding economic growth during the last three decades through urbanization. But at the same time, many ecological and social issues have been marginalized, leading to problems in public safety, health, and social equity. Such a pattern of development is unlikely to be sustainable. In this article, we examine these issues and the challenges that come with resolving them, and advocate a holistic and pragmatic approach to the research and practice of urban sustainability in China.

Several comorbidities predict mortality in patients with COVID‐19, some of which are more prevalent in Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from cells are nano‐sized membrane‐bound vesicles that carry nucleic acids and proteins and mediate intercellular communication. In COVID‐19 associated comorbidities including diabetes, CVD and risk factors such as hypertension, elevated angiotensin II and obesity, levels of circulating EVs are raised and their cargo modified. Importantly, EVs released from damaged endothelial cells are known to be procoagulant. EVs in Black and White populations differentially express phosphorylated insulin signalling proteins, associated with impaired insulin signalling, insulin resistance and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism; these EV proteins are also associated with clinical mortality risk markers. If plasma EV levels are raised, and cargo modified in comorbidities associated with COVID‐19 such as diabetes, and account for excess deaths in BAME patients, this raises the possibility for important roles of EVs, also relating to ethnicity. This places EVs as hitherto understudied key factors, filling the current knowledge gap in COVID‐19, amongst BAME patients.

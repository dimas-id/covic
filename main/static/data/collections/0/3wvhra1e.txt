PURPOSE: To assess the response of rat urinary bladder regenerated by the homologous bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) to in vitro electrical and pharmacologic stimuli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Sprague-Dawley rats, partial cystectomy (>50%) was performed, followed by BAMG augmentation cystoplasty. After 4 months, organ bath studies of tissue strips in 10 were used to compare the contractility of the BAMG regenerates and the corresponding host detrusor smooth muscle. RESULTS: The BAMG regenerates exhibited contractile activity to electrical field stimulation and a qualitatively identical pattern of response to muscarinic, purinergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic drug administration and nitric oxide. At 4 months after surgery, the maximum forces of contraction of the BAMG regenerates to carbachol stimulation amounted to close to 80% of the host bladder response. With electrical field stimulation, they equaled 44% and 62% of the host bladder response after 2.5 and 4 months, respectively. Histological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of receptors for neurotransmitters that these functional in vitro studies implied. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides further evidence that augmentation cystoplasty with the BAMG leads to functional regeneration of the rat bladder detrusor smooth muscle.

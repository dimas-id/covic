RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Chest CT is not suitable for critically ill patients with COVID-19 and lung ultrasound (LUS) may play an important role for these patients. In this study, we summarized the findings of LUS and explore the value of semiquantitative LUS scores in evaluation and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively studied the LUS and chest CT imaging of 128 critically ill patients with COVID-19. The imaging data were reviewed to acquire the LUS and CT scores. The correlation between LUS scores and CT scores were made to evaluate the accuracy of LUS. A cut-off point of LUS score was calculated to distinguish critical-type patients from severe-type patients. LUS follow-up of 72 patients were compared with the gold standard chest CT. RESULTS: The most common LUS features of COVID-19 pneumonia were crowded or coalescent B-lines with multifocal small consolidations in multi-zone. The mean LUS score was 8.1 points in severe-type patients and 15.7 points in critical-type patients (P<0.05). The correlation between LUS scores and CT scores was high (r=0.891, p<0.01) and it was higher in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. The LUS score higher than 10.5 points had a 97.4% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity to distinguish critical-type patients. The consistency of LUS and chest CT in follow-up was 0.596, with higher consistency in diagnosis of lesion progression (Kappa values was 0.774). CONCLUSION: Our scoring system provides a more quantitative use of LUS findings and accurate evaluation of lung damage for critically ill patients with COVID-19.

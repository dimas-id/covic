BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding treatment options for pregnant women with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CASE: A 35-year-old primigravid patient at 22 weeks of gestation presented with 7 days of fever, cough, anosmia, and dyspnea. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and a chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates. Laboratory evaluation was notable for marked elevation of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein concentrations. On hospital day 3, owing to increased dyspnea and oxygen requirement, the patient was treated with tocilizumab followed by 5 days of remdesivir. She responded well, recovered to room air, and was discharged home after a 9-day hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab and remdesivir may be effective for treatment of severe COVID-19 in pregnancy, but additional data are needed to guide risk-benefit considerations.

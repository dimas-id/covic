In December 2019, some new and unexplained cases of pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and were later named as coronavirus disease 2019 by the World Health Organisation. The number of cases increased rapidly, and the virus spread continuously. Tens of thousands of medical staff throughout the country have since rushed to Wuhan to provide intensive medical treatment. Due to high levels of stress and work intensity, insufficient sleep and a lack of access to water after entering the isolation ward, staff may suffer from oral mucosal ulcers and other oral mucosal diseases. Police officers, community workers, family members in quarantine and even patients with mild coronavirus 2019, as well as those who have previously had oral mucosal disease, have also reported experiencing discomfort as a result of stress-induced oral mucosal disorders, such as recurrent aphthous ulcers, chronic cheilitis and oral lichen planus. This article will offer some suggestions for the prevention, treatment and care of the above-mentioned oral mucosal diseases during the fight against coronavirus 2019, focusing on measures to deal with the oral mucosal damage caused in response to stress.

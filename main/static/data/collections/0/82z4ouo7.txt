ABSTRACT: In this work, a new viral protein cage based nanoreactor was successfully constructed via encapsulating Tween 80 stabilized palladium nanoparticles (NPs) into rotavirus capsid VP2 virus-like particles (i.e. Pd@VP2). The effects of stabilizers including CTAB, SDS, Tween 80 and PVP on controlling the particle size of Pd NPs were investigated. They were further immobilized on graphene oxide (i.e. Pd@VP2/GO) by a simple mixing method. Some characterizations including FT-IR and XPS were conducted to study adsorption mode of Pd@VP2 on GO sheets. Their catalytic performance was estimated in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). Results showed that Tween 80 stabilized Pd NPs with the molar ratio of Pd to Tween 80 at 1:0.1 possessed the smallest size and the best stability as well. They were encapsulated into viral protein cages (mean size 49 ± 0.26 nm) to assemble confined nanoreactors, most of which contained 1–2 Pd NPs (mean size 8.15 ± 0.26 nm). As-prepared Pd@VP2 indicated an enhanced activity (apparent reaction rate constant k(app) = (3.74 ± 0.10) × 10(−3) s(−1)) for the reduction of 4-NP in comparison to non-confined Pd-Tween80 colloid (k(app) = (2.20 ± 0.06) × 10(−3) s(−1)). It was logically due to confinement effects of Pd@VP2 including high dispersion of Pd NPs and high effective concentration of substrates in confined space. Pd@VP2 were further immobilized on GO surface through C-N bond. Pd@VP2/GO exhibited good reusability after recycling for four runs, confirming the strong anchoring effects of GO on Pd@VP2.

Glucocorticoids have been used to treat SARS-CoV in 2003 but were associated with considerable side effects such as avascular bone necrosis [24] Glucocorticoids may also delay viral clearance and may lead to secondary infections in patients with MERS coronavirus infection [25] In fact, randomized controlled trials did not show benefit of glucocorticoids and may even aggravate lung injury in MERS and H1N1 pneumonia [26,27] With the availability of more targeted biological agents, glucocorticoids are currently out of favor for the treatment of severe COVID-19 The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used by rheumatologists for pain related to arthritis and myalgia Ibuprofen was commonly prescribed for early symptoms of COVID-19 in Italy and has been attributed to have caused the progression of infection because of its anti-inflammatory effects required for viral clearance [28] Although the deleterious effect of NSAIDs has yet to be confirmed, some European authorities have advised against their use in COVID-19 infection Several drugs commonly used by rheumatologists have been proposed to have potential efficacy in COVID-19 Rheumatologists may be consulted for the precautions and monitoring of these drugs should they be used in severe COVID-19 The optimal dosages of these agents in the treatment of COVID-19 have to be explored further On the other hand, a linkage between micro-organisms and the onset of autoimmune diseases has long been suggested [29] It is of intense interest to watch out for the incidence of rheumatic diseases in the next 12 to 24 months in our locality The COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance has created a registry to capture rheumatology patients who have been infected with COVID-19 [30]

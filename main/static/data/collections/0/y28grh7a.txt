Abstract A new 3,4-dihydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-corboxaldehyde (1) together with a known anthraquinone, damnacanthal (2), were isolated from the chloroform fraction of the aerial part (whole plant without root) of Saprosma fragrans. The isolated anthraquinones (1) and (2) were found to exhibit antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Sporitrichum schenckii. Their structures were established by chemical and spectral analysis.

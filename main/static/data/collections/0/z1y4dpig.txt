BACKGROUND Proper mesh fixation is critical for successful TAPP laparoscopic hernia repair. Conventional mesh fixation may cause chronic neuralgia, groin paresthesia or other complications. This study aimed at introducing a new vacuum suction technique for mesh fixation and evaluating its efficacy and safety compared with traditional staple fixation way. METHODS Clinical data of 242 patients undergoing TAPP from July 2011 to March 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into vacuum suction fixation group and staple fixation group. The operation time, hospital stay, complications, recurrence, visual analogue scale pain score and cost were evaluated. RESULTS All surgeries were successful. The operation time of staple group was (42.34 ± 10.15) min for unilateral hernia and (64.08 ± 16.01) min for bilateral hernias. The postoperative hospital stay was (2.76 ± 0.84) days. One recurrence was observed (0.90%). For vacuum group, the operation time was (42.66 ± 7.76) min and (63.92 ± 10.49) min, and hospital stay was (2.60 ± 0.74) days. No recurrence was observed. There was no significant difference in recurrence, operation time, postoperative pain and hospital stay between two groups (P > 0.05). Average cost were (11,714 ± 726) RMB for vacuum group which was lower than staple group (14,837 ± 1568) RMB (P < 0.05). The top three complications of staple group were scrotal emphysema (10.81%), scrotal seroma (6.31%) and temporary nerve paresthesia (4.50%) while for vacuum group, they were scrotal seroma (3.82%), temporary nerve paresthesia (3.05%), scrotal emphysema (1.53%) and uroschesis (1.53%). The incidence of scrotal emphysema was lower in vacuum group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in other complications (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Both techniques for mesh fixation are safe and effective. There is no significant difference in recurrence, operation time, postoperative pain or hospital stay. The vacuum suction fixation technique is more economical with lower incidence of scrotal emphysema.

Thrombectomy for large-vessel-occlusion stroke is a highly impactful treatment. The spread of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) across the United States and the globe impacts access to this crucial intervention through widespread societal and institutional changes. In this document, we review the implications of COVID-19 on the emergency care of large-vessel occlusion stroke, reviewing specific infection-control recommendations, available literature, existing resources, and expert consensus. As a population, patients with large-vessel occlusion stroke face unique challenges during pandemics. These are broad in scope. Responses to these challenges through adaptation of stroke systems of care and with imaging, thrombectomy, and postprocedural care are detailed. Preservation of access to thrombectomy must be prioritized for its public health impact. While the extent of required changes will vary by region, tiered planning for both escalation and de-escalation of measures must be a part of each practice. In addition, preparations described serve as templates in the event of future pandemics.

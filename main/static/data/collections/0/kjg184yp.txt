Data regarding the benefits for the complete video-assisted thoracic surgery (c-VATS) lobectomy over the open lobectomy are numerous. This article describes the experience of introducing this technique in a training hospital, the first reported cohort in The Netherlands. From March 2006 to November 2008, all patients operated on for proven or suspected lung cancer were analyzed. Prospective data from these patients were evaluated. A subgroup analysis for the c-VATS lobectomy is presented. A total of 184 operations were performed on 172 patients. In 122 (66.3%) of the operations the resection ended in a lobectomy of which 70 were done by complete thoracoscopic procedure. For the c-VATS lobectomy the mean operating time was 179 min, with a mean blood loss of 444 ml. The median hospital stay was four days. Complications were present in 10% of c-VATS lobectomies. No mortality was seen in the c-VATS group. After thorough evaluation and training, c-VATS lobectomy is a safe procedure that can be performed in a relatively low volume hospital. It has exceptional short-term benefits. For training purposes all operations must start thoracoscopically. All patients must be operated according the intention to treat method.

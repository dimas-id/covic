Trauma to the thorax and abdomen can occur during participation in sports. This chapter reviews some of the more common presentations of such injuries and how such injuries should be best managed. Thoracic injuries reviewed include internal injuries such as pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, hemothorax, commotio cordis, and cardiac contusion. Chest wall injuries are also reviewed such as rib fractures, costochondritis, and slipping rib syndrome plus sternal and scapular fractures. Abdominal injuries reviewed are focused on internal organ trauma to the spleen and liver, kidney, pancreas, and bowel. There is attention to the effect of Epstein-Barr virus and infectious mononucleosis, seen very frequently in high school and collegiate athletes. Finally, groin pain and athletic pubalgia are described. In addition to anatomy and clinical presentation, imaging modalities that characterize such trauma are reviewed for each diagnosis. Prevention of thoracoabdominal injuries and return-to-play decisions are described at the chapter conclusion.

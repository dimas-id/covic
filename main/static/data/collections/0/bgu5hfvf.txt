Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are chronic gastrointestinal conditions requiring corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy for disease control Patients with EGIDs usually report impaired quality of life We aimed to report the clinical and psychological impact of COVID-19 infection in EGID patients In this prospective web-based study we invited all consecutive EGID patients attending the University Hospital of Salerno (Campania) and Padua (Veneto) to fill an ad hoc COVID-19 survey Moreover, a telemedicine service for direct consultation was organized Data regarding the occurrence and perception of COVID-19 infection as well as clinical information were recorded The study population included 102 EGID patients (mean age 36 6 years, 34 females), of whom 89 had eosinophilic esophagitis, nine had gastroenteritis, and four had colitis No patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 or had recurrence of his/her primary disease All of them were adherent to therapy and preventive measures adoption Most patients were worried because of COVID-19 and social preventing measures but did not consider themselves at major risk or susceptible to COVID-19 or other infections due to their chronic condition or therapy Female gender and low education level were associated to a higher psychological perception of COVID-19 compared to lockdown status or other demographic and clinical factors (p &lt; 0 05) Overall, COVID-19 had a limited clinical impact on patients with EGIDs The degree of education and sex, but not the fact of living in a lockdown area, influenced the perception of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Show-Me ECHO, a state-funded project, provides access to education within a community of learners in order to optimize healthcare for the citizens of Missouri. Through videoconferencing and case-based review, ECHO shifts professional development from learning about medical problems in isolation to experiential learning as part of a multidisciplinary team. The establishment of a statewide COVID-19 ECHO is allowing a rapid response to this novel, unprecedented, and unanticipated health care crisis. There are many ongoing opportunities for clinicians from across the state to join a Show-Me ECHO learning community as a means to elevate their practice and improve ability to respond amidst a constantly evolving health care environment.

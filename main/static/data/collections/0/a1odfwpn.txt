Abstract In children with normal hearing, inflammatory disorders caused by infections of the middle ear (otitis media) are the most common ear illnesses. Many of older adults experience some level of hearing loss. Several factors can lead to either a partial loss or the total inability to hear (deafness) including exposure to noise, a hereditary predisposition, chronic infections, traumas, medications, and aging.

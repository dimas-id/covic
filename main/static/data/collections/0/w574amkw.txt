BACKGROUND: The novel SARS-Cov-2 virus that emerged in December 2019 causing the COVID-19 disease has led to sudden national reorganization and delivery of health care systems globally. The purpose of this survey was to assess the global impact of the coronavirus on the delivery of colorectal practice and surgery. Materials & Method: A panel of International Society of University Colon & Rectal Surgeons selected 22 questions that were included into a questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to ISUCRS fellows, other surgeons on our database and on social media. The questionnaire remained open from April 16-28, 2020. RESULTS: 287 surgeons completed the survey. 90% were colorectal specialists or general surgeons with an interest in colorectal diseases. COVID-19 had impacted the practice of 96% surgeons and 52% were now using telemedicine. 66% stated that elective colorectal cancer surgery (ECCS) could proceed but with perioperative precautions. 19.5% of respondents stated that provision of personal protection equipment was the most important perioperative precaution, however, this was only being provided in 9.1% of hospitals. 64% of surgeons were offering minimally invasive surgery, however, 44% stated that there was not enough information about the safety of loss of intrabdominal CO2 gas during the COVID-19 pandemic. 61% of surgeons were prepared to defer ECCS, with 29% willing to defer for up to 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey has demonstrated that globally COVID-19 has affected the ability of colorectal surgeons to offer care to practice. Various practical adaptation strategies have been discussed in this manuscript.

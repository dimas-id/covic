The presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was investigated by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) technique and by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in 169 samples of nasopharyngeal secretions of infants and children with acute respiratory infections. Of 31 samples positive by EIA, 25 were positive by IFA. In 24 samples from a retrospective study, RSV positive by IFA and/or tissue culture isolation (TCI), 22 were also positive by EIA. The EIA was also evaluated with 111 RSV isolates in Hep2 cell cultures representing different RSV subgroups. All were positive by EIA. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of myocardial injury upon corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection remain unknown,evidence of impact on outcome is insufficient, therefore, we aim to investigate the risk factors for death among COVID-19 patients combined with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes in this study. METHODS: This was a single-centered, retrospective, observational study. Patients of Sino-French Eco-City section of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China attended by Peking University Supporting Medical Team and admitted from Jan. 29, 2020 to Mar. 20, 2020 were included. The positive nucleic acid of COVID-19 virus and combination with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes were in the standard. We collected the clinical data and laboratory examination results of the eligible patients to evaluate the related factors of death. RESULTS: In the study, 94 COVID-19 patients enrolled were divided into the group of death (13 cases) and the group of survivors (81 cases), the average age was 66.7 years. Compared with the survival group, the death group had faster basal heart rate(103.2 beats/min vs. 88.4 beats /min, P=0.004), shortness of breath(29.0 beats /min vs. 20.0 beats /min, P<0.001), higher neutrophil count(9.2×109/L vs. 3.8×109/L, P<0.001), lower lymphocyte count(0.5×109/L vs. 1.1×109/L, P<0.001), creatine kinase MB(CK-MB, 3.2 µg/L vs. 0.8 µg/L, P<0.001), high sensitivity cardiac troponin â (hs-cTnâ , 217.2 ng/L vs. 4.9 ng/L, P<0.001), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP; 945.0 µg/L vs. 154.0 µg/L, P<0.001), inflammatory factor ferritin(770.2 µg/L vs. 622.8 µg/L , P=0.050), interleukin-2 recepter(IL-2R, 1 586.0 U/mL vs. 694.0 U/mL, P<0.001), interleukin-6(IL-6, 82.3 ng/L vs. 13.0 ng/L, P<0.001), interleukin-10(IL-10, 9.8 ng/L vs. 5.0 ng/L, P<0.001)were higher than those in the survival group. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for death were old age, low non oxygen saturation, low lymphocyte count, myocardial injury, abnormal increase of IL 2R, IL-6, and IL-10. Multivariate regression showed that old age (OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.03-1.19, P=0.026), low non oxygen saturation(OR=0.85, 95%CI=0.72-0.99, P=0.041), and abnormal increase of IL-10(ï¼9.1 ng/L, OR=101.93, 95%CI=4.74-2190.71, P=0.003)were independent risk factors for COVID-19 patients combined with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients combined with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes, the risk factors for death were old age, low non oxygen saturation, low lymphocyte count, myocardial injury, and abnormal increase of IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10. Old age, low non oxygen saturation and abnormal increase of IL-10 were independent risk factors.

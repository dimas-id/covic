Use of a bilateral caudal superficial epigastric skin flap and perineal urethrostomy for reconstruction of a wound which occurred secondary to rupture of the distal urethra and extravasation of urine is reported. A 10-month-old male neutered Domestic Shorthaired cat was presented with a history of trauma, signs of pain of the hind quarters and anuria. Progression of the clinical signs, including anuria, lethargy, anorexia, and azotemia, prompted referral and investigation 108 hours following the initial injury. Retrograde urethrography indicated a rupture of the distal pelvic urethra with extravasation of urine subcutaneously. Development of extensive skin necrosis of the perineum and rump progressed leaving a large wound defect which was managed with wound debridement and dressing. The wound was closed using staged caudal superficial epigastric skin flaps and perineal urethrostomy as part of the reconstruction.

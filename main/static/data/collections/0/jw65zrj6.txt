Diabetes is a common chronic disease affecting an estimated 285 million adults worldwide. The rising incidence of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and subsequent vascular diseases is a major public health problem in industrialized countries. This chapter summarizes current pharmacological approaches to treat diabetes mellitus and focuses on novel therapies for diabetes mellitus that are under development. There is great potential for developing a new generation of therapeutics that offer better control of diabetes, its co-morbidities and its complications. Preclinical results are discussed for new approaches including AMPK activation, the FGF21 target, cell therapy approaches, adiponectin mimetics and novel insulin formulations. Gene-based therapies are among the most promising emerging alternatives to conventional treatments. Therapies based on gene silencing using vector systems to deliver interference RNA to cells (i.e. against VEGF in diabetic retinopathy) are also a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of several diabetic complications. In conclusion, treatment of diabetes faces now a new era that is characterized by a variety of innovative therapeutic approaches that will improve quality of life in the near future.

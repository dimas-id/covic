Co‐production is blooming under Covid‐19, but can we expect it to last? Most likely, in post‐COVID‐19 times people and institutions will easily slip back into ‘business as usual’. This article addresses the relevance of co‐production under COVID‐19 and argues for the need of co‐production initiatives to persist well beyond the pandemic. The conditions that made co‐production emerge are likely to change, as emergency regulations and funds are abandoned and as the sense of urgency disappears. Areas of public life where there could be a more lasting effect are those where the basic conditions for successful co‐production are already in place and where only a push was necessary for co‐production to take off. These conditions include basic commitment, complementarity and supportive regulative frameworks, all of which can be sustained beyond the crisis with targeted choices and sufficient support.

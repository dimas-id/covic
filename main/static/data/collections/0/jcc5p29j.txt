The COVID-19 post-lockdown period and the subsequent progressive withdrawal of the quarantine measures are currently allowing the gradual resumption of the ordinary clinical activities, which have been suppressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this phase, it is crucial to minimize the risk of infection to limit COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality and the number of new cases. Indeed, COVID-19 manifestations may be equivocal, including asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. In order to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare providers, therefore, it is mandatory to stratify the risk of post-COVID-19 pandemic infection during the clinical and instrumental evaluation of cardiac patients, who are at low risk for COVID-19. Here we discuss the most common diagnostic procedures and therapeutic activities, the type of personal protective equipment according to the different tests, the timetable of the different diagnostic examinations, the tele-health services or alternative strategies, and the structural and management requirements, that should be applied to protect patients and healthcare providers in the post-COVID-19 era.

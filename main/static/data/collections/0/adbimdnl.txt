UNLABELLED The main advantages of the laparoscopic gastric plication, in comparison to other bariatric surgery techniques, are the lowest costs and the fewest postopertive complications. This study shows our first year experience with this procedure in the Emergency County Hospital of Baia Mare. METHODS The first 14 laparoscopic gastric pulications performed in 2014 were studied retrospectively: there were 13 women and one man, with age ranging from 25 to 60 years old and a body mass index (BMI) from 35,7 to 59,8. Postoperative, the patients' evolution was evaluated 9 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year after the surgery and before writing this paper, taking into account excess weight loss percentage and comorbidities' progress. RESULTS The average weight loss was 21,42 kg and the weight loss percentage was 36,52%. There were no postoperative complications in need of surgical reintervention. CONCLUSIONS The results were very good, the costs were low and the postoperative complications had a low rate. Therefore, there is a recommendation on performing this surgery in every hospital equipped for laparoscopic surgery.

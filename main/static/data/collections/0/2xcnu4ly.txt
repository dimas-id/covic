SUMMARY Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory tract infectious disease caused by the highly contagious coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Its propagation and symptom progress are very rapid. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics, laboratory results and mortality factors of probable SARS cases. Methods This study was adopted with a retrospective research design to study probable SARS cases from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou and Kaoshiung from August 2003 to February 2004, with a total of 78 cases (average age, 44 years; standard deviation, 18 years; age range, 13â€“84 years) including 24 males (30.8%) and 54 females (69.2%). Results Most of the 78 cases involved nosocomial infection (56.4%). A total of 24 patients died, and the mortality rate was as high as 30.8%. Logistic regression analysis found that intubation (odds ratio, 115; p < 0.001) was the mortality forecast factor. Conclusion The mortality rate of intubation patients was 115 times higher than that of those who did not require intubation. Therefore, special care must be taken with SARS disease with severe infiltration chest X-ray images and respiratory distress. Positive medical treatment should be performed to lower the mortality rate.

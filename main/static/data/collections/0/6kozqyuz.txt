Since November 2002 an epidemic of a new severe respiratory infection has taken place primarily in South-East Asia. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is assumed caused by a recently identified corona virus, which seems to be a new pathogen in the human population. The infection is assumed transferred primarily with droplets and is highly contagious within healthcare settings and families. Respiratory and barrier precautions are necessary to contain the virus, as it is contact tracing.

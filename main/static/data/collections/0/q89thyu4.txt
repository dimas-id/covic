BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The safety and efficiency of the dual-layer Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device has already been published. However, this international multicenter study sought to evaluate the safety of single-layer devices, which are the newest generation of the WEB intrasaccular flow-disrupter family. They have been designed to offer smaller-sized devices with a lower profile to optimize navigability and delivery, which may, in turn, broaden their range of use. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from all consecutive patients treated with a single-layer WEB device, in 10 European centers from June 2013 to May 2014 were included. Clinical presentations, technical details, intra- and perioperative complications, and outcomes at discharge were recorded. Clinical and angiographic data at last follow-up were also analyzed when available. RESULTS Ninety patients with 98 WEB-treated aneurysms were included in this study. In 93 cases (95%), WEB placement was possible. Complete occlusion at the end of the procedure was obtained in 26 instances (26%). Additional treatment during the procedure (coiling and/or stent placement) was necessary in 12 cases (12.7%). Procedure-related complications occurred in 13 cases, leading to permanent neurologic deficits in 4 patients (4.4%). Early vascular imaging follow-up data were available for 44 patients (57%), with an average time interval of 3.3 months. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality rates at last follow-up were 2.2% and 1.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the feasibility and safety of the single-layer WEB device was comparable with that of the double-layer. However, further studies are needed to evaluate long-term efficacies.

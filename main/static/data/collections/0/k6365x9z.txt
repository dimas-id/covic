The oncogenic capacity of a myc-containing strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), termed LC-FeLV, has been examined after inoculation of the virus into neonatal kittens. Like other myc-containing strains of FeLV, LC-FeLV may induce with relatively short latency, but does not necessarily induce, thymic lymphosarcoma in viremic animals. Naturally occurring and experimentally induced tumors are T-cell lymphomas which contain clonally integrated LC-FeLV proviral DNA and which cannot readily be cultivated in vitro in the presence or absence of exogenously supplied interleukin-2. Acquisition of myc by FeLV decreases the period of latency before the appearance of tumors but does not expand the spectrum of tumors induced by FeLV alone.

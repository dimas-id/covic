PURPOSE OF REVIEW The comorbidity of mental and somatic disorders is a complicated issue, especially concerning its epidemiological perspective. Complications are usually associated with the research approach, the etiological coherence of co-occurrence, and the obscurity or absence of diagnostic criteria for mental disorders due to a general medical condition or drugs, age, etc. This review aims to investigate contemporary epidemiological data on mental and somatic comorbidity. RECENT FINDINGS The frequent co-occurrence of certain physical diseases and certain mental disorders is corroborated by contemporary epidemiological data. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory disorders, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders seem to be associated with mental disorders; the rates of occurrence, however, depend on the special characteristics of the sample. Utilization of healthcare systems and costs for patients with mental-somatic comorbidities are suggested to be higher than those for patients without comorbidities. SUMMARY Although it is generally accepted that many physical conditions have been associated with serious mental disorders, the exact nature of the relationship between them is still unclear. Various factors such as unhealthy lifestyle habits, psychotropic medication, and inadequate medical treatment or provision are implicated. Further research is required.

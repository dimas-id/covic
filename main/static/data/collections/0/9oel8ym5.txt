We have read with great interest the articles regarding cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Studies showed 20.4% of COVID-19 patients developed cutaneous manifestations and might be the only presenting symptom.(1) To date, previous cases reported urticaria as one of the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19.(2)(1)(3)(4) This atypical symptom might lead to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and virus transmission, especially in countries where cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported widely such as in Indonesia. We would like to report a case of urticaria in COVID-19-positive non-ICU hospitalized patient from Indonesia to bring awareness to its cutaneous manifestations.

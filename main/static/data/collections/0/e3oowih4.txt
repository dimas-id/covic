BACKGROUND Based on short-term outcome, gastric plication (LGP) could be considered as an alternative to sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with severe obesity. However, long-term follow-up of weight loss and comorbidity are yet to be available. Theoretical advantages include reduced fistula rate, no implantable device, preservation of the alimentary pathway, and no gastric resection. We report a case-control study comparing short-term outcome in two groups of patients who had either LGP or LSG, respectively. METHODS From January 2012 to June 2013, 40 patients had LGP, matched with 40 patients who had LSG. RESULTS No postoperative mortality was observed. Overall morbidity rate reached 22.5 % in the LGP Group and 10 % in the LSG Group (P = 0.04). The most common complication was nausea and vomiting occurring in 20 % of patients with LGP and 5 % of patients with LSG, respectively (P < 0.001). No clinical or radiological leak occurred. Mean operative time was 91.5 ±18.6 min in the LGP group and 81 min ±16.8 min in the LSG group, respectively (P = 0.104). Mean hospital stay was 3.4 ±1.1 days in the LGP Group and 3.2 ±1.2 days the LSG group, respectively (P = 0.614). Average total operating room (OR) cost was 1736 euros for LGP as compared to 2842 euros for LSG, respectively (P < 0.001). At 18-month follow-up, mean excess weight loss (EWL) was 56.5 % +9.8 in LGP patients and 71.3 % +10.4 in patients who had LSG (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS LGP for patients with severe obesity is safe and feasible with low rates of serious complications. As compared to LSG, LGP is associated to higher postoperative rate of nausea, lower operative cost, and lower EWL at 18-month follow-up (P = 0.041).

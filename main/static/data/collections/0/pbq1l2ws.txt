Recent and developing literature has begun reporting on the incidence of thromboembolic events associated with COVID-19. Klok et al. analysed 184 SARS-CoV2-positive ICU patients in two Dutch University Hospitals, reporting an incidence of thrombotic complications to be 31%, with Pulmonary Embolism (PE) comprising 81% of these complications. [1] Moreover, Cui et al. reports on a population of 81 ICU patients at the Union Hospital, Wuhan, an incidence of 25% in VTE, also possibly related to worse prognosis.[2] Wang et al. collected data from 1026 COVID-19 positive patients in 31 provincial administrative regions in China and found 40% of the patients as high risk for VTE according to the Padua Prediction Score, with 11% being predicted to go on developing VTE. [3] Other reports and studies have also discussed the role of acute PE in COVID-19. Recent studies have also reported and advised on the use of prophylactic Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) in COVID-19 patients, to prevent the severe outcomes associated with thromboembolic complications.

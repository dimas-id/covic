The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the provision of acute inpatient care with specialists from all disciplines having to manage patients outside of their usual speciality areas. In many UK hospitals diabetes consultants and diabetes inpatient specialist nurses have been redeployed to the wards to care for COVID-19 positive or suspected cases. Consequently, clinicians relatively unfamiliar with managing hyperglycaemia have been required to do so as the usual input from diabetes specialist teams has not been possible in many areas.

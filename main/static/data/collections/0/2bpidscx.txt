Covid-19 is pandemic to which the world is fighting. Various precautionary measures are being imposed all over the world which is affecting the routine life of an individual and also the economy worldwide. Although, a definite vaccine is still not known to medical science but they are able to distinguish Covid-19 from the other types of flu. Presently this is being done by detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus using RT-PCR technique as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, Geneva, 2020). Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a nucleic acid amplification test that converts the RNA into DNA and subsequently amplifies the specific DNA targets. This method was already being employed to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Emery et al. in Emerg Infect Dis 10(2):311, 2004). The entire process of DNA amplification takes place in three steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension for which the sample is required to be maintained at constant temperatures of 95, 55 and 72 Â°C, respectively. This article introduces the technology to achieve a constant temperature which can be tweaked to develop on-chip RT-PCR.

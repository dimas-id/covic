BACKGROUND Routine radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an incompetent perforator vein (IPV) using the standard treatment protocol at 85°C has a treatment time of 6 minutes. To make treatment time more efficient, we sought to determine the effect of a shortened protocol for radiofrequency stylet (RFS) ablation by comparing the early success using three different temperatures: 85°C, 90°C, and 95°C. METHODS A retrospective study examined 642 procedures of IPV closures in 255 patients with varying degrees of venous insufficiency treated with RFA from 2009 to 2015. The Covidien (Mansfield, Mass) RFA system allows the operator to regulate temperature and allows increments in temperature of the RFS to 85°C, 90°C, and 95°C. The RFS probe was angled at four 90-degree angles at the mentioned temperatures with a shorter treatment time at 6, 4, and 3 minutes, respectively. The three different treatment protocols were compared. All patients had comparative preoperative and postoperative duplex ultrasound scans. Postoperative duplex ultrasound scans were performed 3 to 7 days after the procedure. Successful obliteration was defined as lack of color flow on postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning. Clinical correlation with age, gender, laterality, presenting symptoms (Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology [CEAP] classification), location, and vein diameter was also performed. RESULTS Of the 255 patients who underwent RFS ablation, 138 were female, with a mean age of 65 years (standard deviation, ±14.6 years). These patients had CEAP presentations from C1 to C6 (0 C1, 1 C2, 57 C3, 118 C4, 4 C5, 75 C6). The location of the 642 IPVs was distributed as 472 in the calf and 170 in the ankle; 322 of these procedures were performed on the right leg. Use of a shortened protocol had no significant effect on the early obliteration rates with the 85°C, 90°C, and 95°C protocols, which were 66.1%, 61.8%, and 67.1%, respectively. Significant correlation was seen between location of targeted vein and successful obliteration (P < .001). There was a borderline inverse linear association between higher stylet temperature and successful obliteration in the proximal calf at 85°C. After accounting for within-patient correlation, the middle and distal calf continued to show higher nonobliteration compared with the ankle. No clinical correlation with age, gender, laterality, presenting symptoms of CEAP, or vein diameter was observed. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that shortening the protocol time for RFA of the perforator did not make a significant difference in the early success rate, regardless of the temperature. The overall early success rate is still low (65.1%). RFA of perforator veins has a higher successful closure rate in proximal calf and ankle areas compared with the middle and distal calf.

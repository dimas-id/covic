Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine in the prevention of Giardia duodenalis infection in calves. Six 2-week old calves were vaccinated subcutaneously with a sonicated G. duodenalis trophozoite vaccine. Six 2-week old control calves received a subcutaneous injection of sterile phosphate-buffered-saline mixed with adjuvant. Injections were repeated after 28 days. Eleven days after the second injection, calves were challenged orally with 1Ã—105 purified G. duodenalis cysts from a naturally infected calf. Throughout the study, fecal samples were collected at regular intervals and examined for the presence of G. duodenalis cysts. Blood samples were collected weekly until G. duodenalis challenge and bi-weekly following challenge. Calves were euthanized 14 days after challenge and G. duodenalis trophozoites within the small intestines were enumerated. Serum antibody titers were significantly higher in vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated calves. Vaccinated calves tended to excrete more G. duodenalis cysts in their feces than non-vaccinated calves. The number of trophozoites in the small intestine was not different between vaccinated and non-vaccinated calves. Changes consistent of moderate enteritis were found in the intestines of one vaccinated and one non-vaccinated calf. Despite a serological immune response following vaccination, this vaccine was not efficacious in preventing giardiasis or reducing cyst shedding in calves.

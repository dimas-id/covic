PURPOSE Laparoscopic surgery is fast becoming the treatment of choice for inguinal hernia. By reviewing our 10-year experience of performing totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP), we sought to establish its clinical significance in the treatment of adult inguinal hernia. METHODS We reviewed retrospectively the clinical records of patients who underwent TEP for adult inguinal hernia between January 2003 and December 2012. RESULTS None of the 303 patients with adult primary or recurrent inguinal hernia in our study needed TEP converted to other procedures or suffered serious complications during the procedure. A significant difference was noted in the operation time between direct (n = 32) vs indirect (n = 128) hernias in the primary unilateral inguinal hernia group (91 ± 27 vs 80 ± 32 min, p = 0.033) and between direct/direct (n = 31) vs indirect/indirect (n = 24) hernias (136 ± 58 vs 89 ± 24 min, p = 0.01) in the primary bilateral inguinal hernia group. The only postoperative complications recorded were four cases of hernia recurrence (1.3 %) and one case of chronic pain (0.3 %). CONCLUSIONS The results obtained for TEP over 10 years support this as a promising procedure for the treatment of adult inguinal hernia.

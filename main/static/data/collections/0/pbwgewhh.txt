BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Innovations in minimally invasive surgery have allowed surgeons to perform increasingly complex surgeries through smaller incisions. We describe the feasibility and the technique of single-port laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling or lymphadenectomy in gynecologic malignancies. METHODS The study was approved by the institutional review board at the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio). Inclusion criterion was patients with apparent early-stage gynecologic malignancies who required pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node sampling or lymphadenectomy and were candidates for single-port laparoscopy. Procedures were performed through a single 2.0- to 3.0-cm umbilical incision using a single-port device, deflecting-tip laparoscope, and multifunctional instrumentation. RESULTS Twenty-one patients underwent single-port surgery/staging performed during the study period. The median patient age was 58 years (range, 17-80 years), and the median patient body mass index was 30 mg/kg² (range, 19-46 mg/kg²). Median overall operating time was 120 minutes (range, 60-185 minutes). Median pelvic and para-aortic node counts were 14 (range, 7-19) and 6 (range, 2-14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary report, the technique was feasible, and no morbidity was noted. Further studies are needed to better define the ideal gynecologic oncology procedures for single-site surgery and to assess the relative benefits of this new technique compared with more conventional minimally invasive approaches.

Abstract A number of novel viruses have been associated with canine gastroenteritis in recent years, from viral families as diverse as Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae to Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. The ability of many of these viruses to cause disease is uncertain, but epidemiological studies are continually adding to our knowledge of these potential pathogens. This review presents a summary of the latest research and current understanding of novel viruses associated with canine gastroenteritis.

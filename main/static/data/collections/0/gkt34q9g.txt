Purpose Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) selectively vasodilates the pulmonary circulation but the effects are sometimes insufficient. Available intravenous (iv) substances are non-selective and cause systemic side effects. The pulmonary and systemic effects of iNO and an iv mono-organic nitrite (PDNO) were compared in porcine models of acute pulmonary hypertension. Methods In anesthetized piglets, dose-response experiments of iv PDNO at normal pulmonary arterial pressure (n=10) were executed. Dose-response experiments of iv PDNO (n=6) and iNO (n=7) were performed during pharmacologically induced pulmonary hypertension (U46619 iv). The effects of iv PDNO and iNO were also explored in 5 mins of hypoxia-induced increase in pulmonary pressure (n=2-4). Results PDNO (15, 30, 45 and 60 nmol NO kg-1 min-1 iv) and iNO (5, 10, 20 and 40 ppm which corresponded to 56, 112, 227, 449 nmol NO kg-1 min-1, respectively) significantly decreased the U46619-increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to a similar degree without significant decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). iNO caused increased levels of methemoglobin. At an equivalent delivered NO quantity (iNO 5 ppm and PDNO 45 nmol kg-1 min-1 iv), PDNO decreased PVR and SVR significantly more than iNO. Both drugs counteracted hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and they decreased the ratio of PVR and SVR in both settings. Conclusion Intravenous PDNO was a more potent pulmonary vasodilator than iNO in pulmonary hypertension, with no severe side effects. Hence, this study supports the potential of iv PDNO in the treatment of acute pulmonary hypertension.

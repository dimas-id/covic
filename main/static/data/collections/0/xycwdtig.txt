In this paper, we provide a study about the impact of the most prominent inpainting and denoising solutions on the latent fingerprint identification. From an in-depth analysis, we show how some of the analyzed inpainting and denoising solutions can improve up 63% for Rank-1 and 26% for Rank-20 the fingerprint identification rates when state-of-the-art minutiae extractors are used. Nevertheless, it is necessary to create new denoising and inpainting solutions that are specifically built to deal with latent fingerprints and their associated issues.

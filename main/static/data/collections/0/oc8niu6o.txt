Eosinophilic meningitis is a known complication of duraplasty, including that using bovine tissues. Previous authors have relied on surgical removal of the graft for treatment. Authors of the present report describe a 7-year-old girl with eosinophilic meningitis following duraplasty with a bovine pericardium graft who was successfully treated using corticosteroid therapy alone.

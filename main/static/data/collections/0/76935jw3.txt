BACKGROUND In order to optimize postoperative therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), it is important to detect endoscopic recurrence preceding clinical recurrence. However, we have little knowledge about how high the rate of residual lesions is and whether these lesions have an influence on postoperative course or not. AIMS To assess residual lesions in small bowel immediately after surgery. METHODS Capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed immediately after surgery (< 3 months), and endoscopic activity was assessed using the Lewis score (LS) composed of the highest tertile score (in first, second, and third tertile) and the stenosis score (in whole small intestine). The relationship between these residual lesions and postoperative clinical recurrence was prospectively evaluated. RESULTS After assessing patency using a patency capsule, CE was performed in 25 patients. The mean LS was 751.3, and 84.0% (21/25) had endoscopic activity. These lesions were detected by preoperative examinations in 0% and by a serosal side view during surgery in 16.0%. Regarding the cumulative clinical recurrence rate according to endoscopic severity (normal, mild, and moderate-to-severe) immediately after surgery, no significant difference was found. However, comparing groups divided according to the highest tertile score, the cumulative clinical recurrence rate was significantly higher in the group with the highest third tertile score. Furthermore, patients with ulcers in the third tertile had a significantly higher recurrence rate. CONCLUSIONS Many cases with CD had endoscopic activity immediately after "curative" surgery. These residual lesions, especially in the distal small intestine, were associated with postoperative clinical recurrence.

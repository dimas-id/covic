COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is common in patients with COVID-19, causing high rates of thrombotic complications that increase the morbidity and mortality. Markedly elevated levels of D-dimer with normal fibrinogen levels are the hallmark laboratory findings and correlate with severity of illness and risk of thrombosis. Aggressive VTE prophylaxis is paramount for all patients with COVID-19. Patients with very high D-dimer levels (6 times the upper limit of normal, greater than 3,000 ng/mL) have the greatest risk of thrombosis and may benefit from active screening and more intensive VTE prophylaxis.

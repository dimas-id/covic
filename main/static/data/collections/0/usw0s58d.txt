INTRODUCTION Several studies demonstrated the benefits of rehabilitation in uraemic patients. This study evaluates physical and psychosocial effects of exercise on renal transplant recipients (RTRs). PATIENTS AND METHODS Eight RTRs were evaluated before and after an exercise training consisting of thirty 40-minute sessions, three times a week, performed with the interval training technique. RESULTS Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) significantly decreased (p<0.04 and <0.008, respectively). Quality of life mean scores (SF-36 test) significantly increased (p<0.000). No differences were recorded for muscle and fat mass, maximal explosive power of the lower limbs, alkaline and acid phosphatase, parathormone (PTH), myoglobin, lipoprotein-A, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), at rest heart rate, and cardiac troponin. IL-6 decreased from 2.8±0.6 to 1.7±0.5 pg/mL (p<0.01). Resting MAP fell from 112±4 to 99±3 mmHg (p<0.02). The metabolic threshold rose from 33±4 to 43±5% (p<0.033). The blood lactate level at peak exercise increased from 5.2±0.9 to 6.2±0.7 mmol/L (p<0.012). The maximum oxygen uptake increased from 1200±210 to 1359±202 mL/min (p<0.05), iso-load oxygen uptake decreased from 1110±190 to 1007±187 mL/min (p<0.034). The maximum working capacity increased from 90±14 to 115±15 watts (p<0.000). CONCLUSION This study suggests that an appropriate dose of physical training is a useful, safe and non-pharmacologic contribution to RTR treatment.

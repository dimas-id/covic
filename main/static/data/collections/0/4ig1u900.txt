Host recognition of intracellular viral RNA and subsequent induction of cytokine signaling are tightly regulated at the cellular level and are a target for manipulation by viruses and therapeutics alike. Here, we characterize chromosome 6 ORF 106 (C6orf106) as an evolutionarily conserved inhibitor of the innate antiviral response. C6orf106 suppresses the synthesis of interferon (IFN)-α/β and proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α in response to the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) and to Sendai virus infection. Unlike canonical inhibitors of antiviral signaling, C6orf106 blocks interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and, to a lesser extent, NF-κB activity without modulating their activation, nuclear translocation, cellular expression, or degradation. Instead, C6orf106 interacts with IRF3 and inhibits IRF3 recruitment to type I IFN promoter sequences while also reducing the nuclear levels of the coactivator proteins p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). In summary, we have defined C6orf106 as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity that blocks IRF3-dependent cytokine production via a noncanonical and poorly defined mechanism. This work presents intriguing implications for antiviral immunity, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.

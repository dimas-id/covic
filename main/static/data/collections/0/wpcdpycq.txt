OBJECTIVE To examine the psychosocial effects on health care workers of being quarantined because of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHOD We used semistructured qualitative interviews. RESULTS We identified 3 major themes concerning psychosocial effects: loss, duty, and conflict. CONCLUSIONS Quarantined workers experienced stigma, fear, and frustration. We highlight the need for clear and easily accessible information on dealing with infectious diseases. Practical advice on coping and stress management techniques for health care workers are needed in preparation for potential future outbreaks of infectious diseases.

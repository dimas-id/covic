BACKGROUND Biologic variability (BV) is one aspect of interpreting changes in biomarker concentrations known to be clinically important in people with cardiac disease, but it has not been adequately addressed in dogs so far. OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to determine BV of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in healthy dogs and dogs with 3 stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). METHODS Healthy dogs and dogs with 3 stages of MMVD were prospectively assigned to groups based on comprehensive clinical evaluation using current guidelines. Concentrations of cTnI were measured hourly, daily, and weekly using standard and high-sensitivity immunoassays. Within- (CVI ) and between-subject (CVG ) coefficients of variability, percent reference change value (RCV), and index of individuality (IoI) were calculated. RESULTS All 10 healthy dogs and 76/112 (68%) of samples from 28 MMVD dogs had cTnI concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD) using a standard sensitivity immunoassay. Only 49/160 (31%) of healthy dog samples and no MMVD samples had cTnI below the high-sensitivity immunoassay LOD. Data analysis for the high-sensitivity immunoassay revealed CVI of 48.1%, CVG of 60.1%, RCV of 134.0%, and IoI of 0.804 in healthy dogs. In MMVD dogs, CVI was 39.6%, CVG was 80.7%, RCV was 110%, and IoI was 0.494. Of all MMVD dogs, those with Stage B2 had the lowest RCV of 91%. CONCLUSIONS Biologic variability affects cTnI concentrations in healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD. Consideration of BV may be clinically relevant when monitoring individual changes in cTnI values, using high-sensitivity immunoassays.

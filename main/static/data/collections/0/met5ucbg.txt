BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) complications affect outcomes but it remains unknown if the diaphragm thickness affects rehabilitation outcomes after ICU. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the effect of diaphragm thickness on rehabilitation outcomes of post-ICU patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to evaluate factors that may be associated with diaphragm atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients (26 SCI, 25 TBI) who admitted to the rehabilitation clinic from the ICU included in this study. All demographic data were recorded. All participants underwent diaphragmatic ultrasonography evaluation before and after 12 weeks of neurologic rehabilitation program. The diaphragm thickness and outcome parameters were compared in all patient groups and in each patient subgroups. Evaluation parameters of patients before and after treatment were compared in patient subgroups. RESULTS: Diaphragm atrophy was found in 14 patients (64%) in TBI group and 12 patients (46%) in SCI group. The diaphragm thickness negatively correlated with the ICU length of stay and positively correlated with the before/after rehabilitation functional scores and the change in functional independence measure scores (p < 0.05). According to the regression analysis; the change in functional independence measure scores was found to be affected by the diaphragm thickness (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The diaphragm thickness may be an effective factor on the rehabilitation process.

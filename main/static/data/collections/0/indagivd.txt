BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow-diverter stents are widely used for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. Various parameters may influence intracranial aneurysm thrombosis, including the flow reduction induced by flow-diverter stent implantation, which is assumed to play a leading role. However, its actual impact remains unclear due to the lack of detailed intra-aneurysmal flow measurements. This study aimed to clarify this relationship by quantitatively measuring the intra-aneurysmal flow using 4D phase-contrast MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We acquired prospective pre- and post-stent implantation 4D phase-contrast MR imaging data of a consecutive series of 23 patients treated with flow-diverter stents. Velocity field data were combined with the intraprocedural 3D angiogram vessel geometries for precise intracranial aneurysm extraction and partial volume correction. Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic modifications were compared with occlusion outcomes at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS The averaged velocities at systole were lower after flow-diverter stent implantation for all patients and ranged from 21.7 ± 7.1 cm/s before to 7.2 ± 2.9 cm/s after stent placement. The velocity reduction was more important for the group of patients with aneurysm thrombosis at 6 months (68.8%) and decreased gradually from 66.2% to 55% for 12-month thrombosis and no thrombosis, respectively (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS We propose an innovative approach to measure intracranial flow changes after flow-diverter stent implantation. We identified a trend between flow reduction and thrombosis outcome that brings a new insight into current understanding of the flow-diversion treatment response.

Therapy has been tried with a variety of agents, ranging from anecdotal folk remedies, to well-designed medications. Measures primarily directed to relieve the symptoms of the common cold, rather than specific antimicrobial agents, are the current main stay of therapy. Millions of patients would benefit from an easy-to-perform diagnostic test and specific therapy that works quickly, shortening the duration of illness and preventing further spread of infection.

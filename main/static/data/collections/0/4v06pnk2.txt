We present the first geographic study that uses space-time statistics to monitor COVID-19 in Brazil. The first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by the contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and quickly turned into a pandemic. In Brazil, the first case occurred on January 23rd, 2020 but was officially reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health on February 25th. Since then, the number of deaths and people infected by COVID-19 in Brazil have been steadily increasing. Despite the underreporting of coronavirus cases by government agencies across the country, the State of Sao Paulo has the highest rate among all Brazilian States. Thus, it is essential to detect which areas contain the highest concentration of COVID-19 to implement public policies, to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. To identify these critical areas, we utilized daily confirmed case data from the Brasil.IO website between February 25th, 2020 to May 5th, 2020; which were aggregated to the municipality level. A prospective space-time scan statistic was applied to evaluate possible active clusters in three different time periods. The results visualize the space-time evolution and dynamics of COVID-19 clusters in the State of Sao Paulo. Since the first study period, the results highlight approximately 4.6 times the number of municipalities belonging to a significant cluster with a RR>1 on May 5th. These results can inform health authorities and public management to take the necessary measures to minimize the transmission of COVID-19 and track the evolution of significant space-time clusters.

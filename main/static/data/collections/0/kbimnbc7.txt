Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, is now generating a global epidemic, leading to a severe public health emergency. Until April 12, 2020 around 1,700,954 confirmed cases and 105,633 deaths have been reported all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Under this circumstance, surgical activities should be carefully evaluated to avoid excessive occupation of limited medical resources, and to reduce the possibility of hospital infection. China has achieved an inspiring achievement on epidemic control.

Abstract Neuropathies of digital nerves are an infrequent phenomenon and their causes are most often mechanical. A rare cause of acute neuropathy is hourglass-like fascicular constriction of a nerve due to torsion. Although several cases of hourglass-like constriction have been described in the literature, none to our knowledge involved digital nerves. In this report, we present the first case of hourglass-like constriction of a digital nerve.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiencies of selected anti‐emetic drugs (metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant) in preventing vomiting in the treatment of canine parvoviral enteritis. We designed a randomized, prospective clinical study. PVE quick ELISA test‐positive dogs between 4 and 12 months of age were included in the study. Each of metoclopramide, ondansetron, maropitant and control group had 8 dogs. Metoclopramide and ondansetron were administered as 0.5 mg/kg doses three times a day via intravenous route, and maropitant was administered as 1 mg/kg doses once a day subcutaneously. The number and severity of daily vomitings were recorded. All dogs were treated and monitored for five days; treatments were continued until all animals healed. Metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant decreased the severity of vomiting from the first day and the vomiting numbers from the third day in PVE treatment. Obtained results showed that maropitant can be used successfully such as metoclopramide and ondansetron, which are frequently used for PVE treatment. At the same time, it was discovered that metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant were equally effective in reducing the frequency and severity of vomiting.

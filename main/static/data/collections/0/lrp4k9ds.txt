We report a case in an Italian wolf ( Canis lupus italicus) of pantropic canine coronavirus infection, which has previously been detected only in dogs. The wolf was coinfected by canine parvovirus type 2b and canine adenovirus type 2, which highlighted the crucial role of epidemiologic surveys in European wild carnivores.

Local surgery for rectal tumors has been traditionally limited due to technical issues for lower risk lesions. In the 1980s, Buess described the transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) technique that enabled excision of lesions that were larger and in a higher location. TEM in a short time became the gold standard for the excision of large adenomas and early rectal carcinomas. Since the advent of TEM, and due to advances in minimal invasive technology, new devices and procedures have come to the surgical armamentarium, in many cases with only very slight differences between them. However, local surgery for rectal cancer still remains a challenge. An overview of the current status of minimal transanal invasive techniques is presented here and sheds some light on the controversies that the local management of rectal cancer still raises.

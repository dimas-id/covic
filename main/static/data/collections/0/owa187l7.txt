Objective@#To observe theepidemiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, imaging findings, treatment and prognosis of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia.@*Methods@#Clinical data of 109 patients with suspected and definite novel coronavirus pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Sixth Hospital from December 24, 2019 to January 28, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysiswas performed by using t test or chi-square test.@*Results@#Among the 109 patients, 48 (44%) were male and 61 (56%) were female, with the average age of (52.5±10.8) years. Fifty-four patients (49.5%) had definite contact history. Among the 109 patients, 104 (95.5%) presentedwith fever, 37(33.7%) with headache, 78 (71.9%) with general pain, 88 (80.8%) with fatigue and poor appetite, 23 (21.3%) with diarrhea, 94 (86.5%) withcoughing, 23 (21.3%) with shortness of breath, 57 (52.8%) withpalpitation, 45 (41.5%) with chest distress, 4 (3.3%) with chest pain, 40 (37.0%) with lung rales. Forty-two cases (38.5%) had leukocyte count &lt;4×109/L, 58 cases (53.2%) had lymphocyte count &lt;1.5×109/L, 7 cases (24.8%) had hemoglobin &lt;120g/L, 37 cases(33.9%) had LDH &gt;230 mmol/L, 29 cases (26.6%) had brain natriuretic peptide precursor&gt;300 ng/mL, 87 cases (79.8%) had hypersensitive C-reactive protein &gt;10mg/L, 26 cases (23.9%) had D-dimer &gt;0.5 mg/L, 35 cases (32.1%) had coagulation disorder. The leukocyte counts, LDH, brain natriuretic peptide precursor and D-dimer of severe/critical cases[(11.33±4.87)×109/L, (527.51±260.87) mmol/L, (722.88±189.56) ng/mL, (1.89±4.24) mg/L, respectively] were all significantly higher than those of common cases [(4.02±1.49)×109/L, (159.75±30.31)mmol/L, (428.22±124.76)ng/mLand (0.41±0.22)mg/L, respectively], while the lymphocyte count of severe/critical cases [(0.60±0.17)×109/L] was significantly lower than common cases [(1.13±0.43)×109/L] (t=11.36, 11.33,9.81,2.81 and 7.77,all P&lt;0.05). On admission, chest CT showed that 27 cases (24.8%) of pneumonia were unilateral, 82 cases (75.2%) werebilateral, and most of them were ground glass. The pneumonia progressed in a short time and reached the peak within 10 days. The comprehensive treatment included antiviral drugs, prevention ofbacterialinfection and supportive treatment, and glucocorticoid and respiratory support treatment wereadministrated when necessary.@*Conclusions@#The novel coronavirus pneumonia is characterized by highly infectious, rapid progress, and diverse clinical and imaging features. Early diagnosis and active comprehensive treatment could improve theprognosis and reduce themortality.

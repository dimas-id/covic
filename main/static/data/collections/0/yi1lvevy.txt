Platelets play a major physiological role in control of vascular integrity at the site of vascular lesions. However, the pathophysiological role of platelets is much broader than regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelets are critical elements in linking and modulating thrombosis, inflammation, and tissue repair. Platelets are stimulated by a variety of agonists including thrombin or ADP and also by inflammatory agents such as antibodies, complement, bacteria, and others. Platelets contribute to inflammation by interacting with inflammatory cells via adhesion and secretion of prestored proinflammatory mediators. Thus, platelets are critical elements in the pathophysiology of inflammation and modulate significantly a variety of inflammatory diseases. A profound understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of platelet in inflammation may result in new therapeutic strategies in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of, and outcome after, laparoscopic adrenalectomy in dogs with unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n=7) with Cushing's syndrome caused by unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma. METHODS Laparoscopic adrenalectomy with the dog in lateral recumbency on the unaffected side. Three 5-mm portals (1 laparoscopic portal, 2 instrument portals) were placed in the paralumbar fossa. A fourth instrumental portal (5-12 mm) was placed above the kidney. After dissection and hemostatic control of the phrenicoabdominal vein, the adrenal gland was carefully dissected or when there was capsule fragility, necrotic content was partially aspirated. The remaining glandular tissue was removed through the 12-mm trocar site. RESULTS Dogs with unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma (3 right-sided, 4 left-sided) without invasion of the caudal vena cava were successfully operated by laparoscopic approach. There were no significant intraoperative complications; 2 dogs died within 48 hours of surgery because of respiratory complications. Five dogs were discharged 72 hours after surgery, and signs of hyperadrenocorticism disappeared thereafter (survival time ranged from 7 to 25 months). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is feasible in dogs with either right- or left-sided adrenocortical carcinoma not involving the caudal vena cava. CLINICAL RELEVANCE When performed by experienced surgeons, laparoscopic adrenalectomy offers a minimally invasive alternative to open laparotomy or retroperitoneal surgery for the treatment of unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma in dogs.

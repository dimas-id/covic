Swine diarrhea can be caused by multiple agents, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine sapelovirus (PSV), and porcine sapovirus (SaV). We designed a one-step triplex reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) detection method including 3 pairs of primers that focused on the S1 gene of PEDV, a conserved gene of PSV, and the VP1 gene of SaV. The optimal concentrations of upstream and downstream primers in the triplex RT-PCR were 0.24 μM for PEDV, 0.15 μM for PSV, and 0.2 μM for SaV, and the optimal annealing temperature was 55.5°C. Triplex RT-PCR assessment of 402 piglet diarrhea samples was compared with conventional individual RT-PCR. Concordance rates in both tests for individual viruses were 100%, 97.6%, and 94.4% for PEDV, PSV, and SaV, respectively. PEDV, PSV, and SaV were detected in 57.2%, 10.4%, and 9.0% of the samples, respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity of this triplex RT-PCR-based detection method for PEDV, PSV, and SaV could allow rapid detection and analysis of mixed infections by these 3 viruses.

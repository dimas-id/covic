OBJECTIVES: The deciphering of intracellular signaling pathways that are activated by the interaction between viral fusion peptides and cellular membranes are important for the understanding of both viral replication strategies and host defense mechanisms. METHODS: Fusion peptides of several enveloped viruses belonging to different virus families were prepared by standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl polyamine solid-phase synthesis and used to stimulate U937 cells in vitro to analyze the phosphorylation patterns of the signaling pathways (PKC, Src, Akt, and MAPK pathways). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out by using phosphospecific antibodies. All samples were also assayed for the presence of IL-10 and IFN-β by ELISA and activation of nuclear factors (AP-1 and NF-κB). RESULTS: We have demonstrated that hydrophobic domains of fusion proteins are able to induce several transduction pathways that lead to cytokine (IFN-β and IL-10) production, an event that appears to be dependent on early activation of AP-1 and NF-κB. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained on the signaling activity of fusion peptides from different viruses enabled us to shed some light on the complex mechanism of viral entry and more precisely we focused on the exact signaling event induced by hydrophobic domains characteristic of fusion peptides interacting with the cell membrane.

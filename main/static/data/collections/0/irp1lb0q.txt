The chest X-ray is frequently used for the evaluation of the lower respiration tract. The knowledge of the pediatric anatomy and physiology is essential for the correct interpretation of the image. Also the accuracy of the examination should be considered. Pneumonia is the most important disease of the lower respiration tract. As there is still a high risk of mortality, specific diagnosis is required to initiate a prompt and efficient therapy. Sensitivity and specificity of the pediatric chest x-ray depend on the experience of the interpreter and the available clinical information. This paper gives a short introduction to the interpretation of pediatric chest X-rays. Specific anatomic and physiologic characteristics in pediatric patients and related pathology are presented.

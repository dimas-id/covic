Practitioners may be called on to treat rodents with respiratory diseases or to advise clients concerning the care of these rodents. Respiratory diseases of mice, rats, guinea pigs, and Syrian hamsters are well known because of the use of these species in research, whereas few or no reports of respiratory disease in rodents of other species exist. Features of the respiratory diseases of these four commonly encountered species are reviewed, including causes; clinical signs; diagnostic procedures; preventive measures; and, where appropriate, therapies.

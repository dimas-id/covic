This chapter explores Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s (MLK) contribution to Basic Income Guarantee (BIG) and its association with the USA’s Modern Civil Rights Movement (MCRM). The exploration begins with a synopsis of the MCRM: its antecedents, a biographical sketch of MLK and a precis of his leadership. A discussion of MLK’s support of BIG and a brief survey of his long-term influence follow, ending with the conclusion. The goal is to identify and analyze the international thought-leader, Nobel Peace Laureate and civil rights strategist’s approach (justifications and strategies) to realizing BIG for practical and theoretical lessons that could inform future and current BIG activism.

The chemoprophylactic effects of halofuginone lactate were tested against calf experimental cryptosporidiosis. Twenty 2-day-old calves, divided into four groups, were orally inoculated with 1 × 10(6) oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The infected control group was unmedicated whereas the three other groups were medicated with the drug at 30, 60 and 120 μg kg(−1) day(−1), respectively, for 7 days, from Day (D) 2 to D8 post-inoculation (D 0 was inoculation day). The calves were weighed twice weekly and disease development and drug efficacy were assessed daily from D0 to D30 from consistency of feces, shedding of oocysts and mortality. Experimental C. parvum infection caused a severe clinical disease with profuse watery diarrhea, high oocyst shedding and mortality (3 out of 5) in the unmedicated group. The results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of halofuginone lactate in reducing the severity of clinical cryptosporidiosis. This efficacy was dose-dependent. The lowest dose (30 μg kg(−1) day(−1)) was not able to prevent clinical disease and mortality (3 out of 5). No clinical signs were observed with the 60 and 120 μg kg(−1) day(−1) doses, but the animals shed oocysts after drug withdrawal. This shedding was more delayed the higher the dose of drug administered, but the delayed shedding had no effect on the growth of the animals.

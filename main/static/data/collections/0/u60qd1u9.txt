This study was designed to evaluate the histopathological response and intra-abdominal adhesion formation after an omentectomy in rats using the bipolar vessel-sealing device, ultrasonic coagulator, and suture ligation techniques. Forty Wistar albino rats were used, divided into four random groups. The rats underwent a midline laparotomy, and a partial omentectomy was performed using a 3-0 silk suture with suture ligation in group 1, bipolar device in group 2, and ultrasonic coagulator in group 3; only a laparotomy was performed on the control group. Lateral thermal damage was examined the same day, and a piece of the omentum was left in the animals to be examined on postoperative day 15. A relaparotomy was performed to assess adhesion formation and histopathological response. In pairwise comparisons, there was no statistically significant difference among the ultrasonic device, bipolar device, and suture ligation groups in terms of microscopic adhesion scoring; however, the scores of the bipolar device and suture ligation groups were significantly higher compared with those of the control group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the macroscopic adhesion scores were significantly lower for the ultrasonic device group when compared with those of the bipolar device and suture ligation groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). The ultrasonic device seems to be superior to the bipolar device and suture ligation in terms of macroscopic adhesion formation, but no significant difference was found in terms of the histopathological response in rats following an omentectomy. Further research may be required.

BACKGROUND Simultaneous vasospasm and endovascular aneurysm treatment (SVAT) has been shown to be effective with good clinical outcomes in small series, but these studies have not examined predictive factors for clinical outcome after treatment. OBJECTIVE To identify the safety and efficacy of SVAT in a large multicenter patient cohort and evaluate prognostic markers of clinical outcome following SVAT. METHODS This study retrospectively enrolled 50 consecutive patients undergoing SVAT at 11 different centers. We analyzed Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades, aneurysm location, angiographic vasospasm grade, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. RESULTS A total of 50 patients undergoing SVAT between the years 2003 and 2009 were identified. Patients presented, on average, 6.48Â±4.45 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades were 1 (n=7), 2 (n=12), 3 (n=14), 4 (n=15), 5 (n=2), and 3 and 4 (n=33), respectively. Aneurysm location was distributed as follows: anterior (n=32), posterior (n=16), anterior and posterior (n=2). Patients with good clinical condition (Hunt and Hess score 1-3) had significantly higher odds of surviving (OR=17.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 161.5), favorable GOS (OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 14.8), and favorable 90-day mRS (OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 14.8). CONCLUSIONS SVAT is safe, with the majority of patients achieving good clinical outcome. Patients with lower Hunt and Hess grades have higher odds of surviving and favorable clinical prognosis.

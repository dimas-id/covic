Excitotoxicity due to the excessive activation of glutamatergic receptors leads to neuronal dysfunction and death. Excitotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases with distinct etiologies such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Numerous studies link apolipoprotein D (apoD), a secreted glycoprotein highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), to maintain and protect neurons in various mouse models of acute stress and neurodegeneration. Here, we used a mouse model overexpressing human apoD in neurons (H-apoD Tg) to test the neuroprotective effects of apoD in the kainic acid (KA)-lesioned hippocampus. Our results show that apoD overexpression in H-apoD Tg mice induces an increased resistance to KA-induced seizures, significantly attenuates inflammatory responses and confers protection against KA-induced cell apoptosis in the hippocampus. The apoD-mediated protection against KA-induced toxicity is imputable in part to increased plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase type 2 expression (1.7-fold), decreased N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR2B levels (30 %) and lipid metabolism alterations. Indeed, we demonstrate that apoD can attenuate intracellular cholesterol content in primary hippocampal neurons and in brain of H-apoD Tg mice. In addition, apoD can be internalised by neurons and this internalisation is accentuated in ageing and injury conditions. Our results provide additional mechanistic information on the apoD-mediated neuroprotection in neurodegenerative conditions.

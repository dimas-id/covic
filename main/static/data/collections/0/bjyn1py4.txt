Abstract Influenza A coinfections with other respiratory viruses were investigated in 25.8% (41/159) of the samples from patients hospitalized in 2009 at our University Hospital. Out of the 41 influenza A cases, nine cases (21.9%) were coinfected with other viruses, with a similar frequency among children and adults (p=0.47), and seasonal influenza cases were more prevalent than H1N1 2009 influenza virus. Adenovirus was the most frequently detected (4/9) among coinfected cases. Coinfection was not associated with higher morbidity or mortality (p=0.75).

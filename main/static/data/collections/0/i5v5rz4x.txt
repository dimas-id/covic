Abstract Foot-and mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), and vesicular stomatitis (VS) are highly contagious vesicular diseases of swine but are not easy to differentiate clinically. For the purpose of instant detecting of FMD and differentiating it from the other vesicular diseases, a Luminex assay was developed. Sera from 64 infected, 307 vaccinated, and 280 naïve pigs were tested by the Luminex assay. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assay was 100%. Diagnostic specificity of the assay was 98.7% in vaccinated pigs and 97.5% to 100% in naïve pigs. Agreement between the results from the Luminex assay and those from a 3ABC polypeptide blocking ELISA was 96.3% with kappa statistics of 0.92. The Luminex assay can detect the immune response to NSP-3ABC in swine as early as eight days post-infection. Moreover, all of the 15 vaccinated but unprotected pigs were all detected by the Luminex assay. The results indicated that the Luminex assay has potential with specificity in detecting antibodies to FMDV 3ABC NSP and in distinguishing FMDV-infected pigs from with either SVDV or VSV.

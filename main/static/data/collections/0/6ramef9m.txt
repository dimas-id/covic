PURPOSE To compare the safety and efficacy of right-side and left-side retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy (RDN) using our hybrid technique. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data obtained from 151 consecutive patients who underwent RDN between May 2005 and July 2013. Right and left nephrectomies were performed in 87 and 64 patients, respectively. We compared these two groups with respect to donors' intraoperative parameters, postoperative outcomes, and recipients' outcomes. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding donor blood loss, warm ischemia time, donor postoperative creatinine levels, donor postoperative length of hospital stay, recipient creatinine levels at 1 year after transplantation, and 1-year graft survival rate after transplantation. The time required for graft extraction and overall operative time were significantly shorter in the right RDN group than in the left RDN group (152 vs. 168 min, P = 0.016; 175 vs. 195 min, P = 0.0059). Only one case in the right nephrectomy group required open conversion because of uncontrollable bleeding from the inferior vena cava. CONCLUSION Although larger sample sizes would be required to evaluate postoperative complication rate, these results indicate that both the right and left RDN could be performed with similar donor and recipient outcomes.

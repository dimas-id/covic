During the progress of the COVID-19, many countries have observed that their active cases tend to rise again after falling for some time. This may cause some mathematical models like the one discussed in [2] tend to make errors in the future prediction. We discuss a simple method to better the future prediction in such cases. This method is applied on the active and total cases data for the countries USA and Canada. In the case of Canada, the method succeeded in predicting the date when the active cases began to decrease. In the case of USA, a major improvement in prediction was observed when the method was applied: the predicted active and total cases are 1465602 and 2729015 for June 30; whereas the actual values are 1455400 and 2728856. We also give the active and total cases prediction for Canada and the USA for the first week of July 2020.

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has been detected sporadically in China since its first description in 2012. In our study, 62 faecal and intestinal samples from pigs with diarrhoea were collected in Guangxi Province, China, during 2017 and 2018. Twelve samples (19.4%, 12/62) were positive for PDCoV. Five complete genomes of PDCoV were then determined, and sequence alignment revealed that the five strains had discontinuous deletions at 400-401 aa in non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) and 758-760 aa in non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) compared with the respective proteins in the HKU15-44 strain. Notably, the CHN-GX81-2018 strain contained two insertions in the S gene and 3'-UTR. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that four strains shared 98.2%-98.4% nucleotide identity with CHN-AH-2004 and were classified into a new cluster of China lineage strains, whereas the CHN-GX81-2018 strain shared 98.7% nucleotide identity with Vietnam/Binh21/2015 and belonged to the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage. Recombination analyses revealed that four strains were the result of recombination between CHN-HB-2014 and Vietnam/Binh21/2015 strains. This study demonstrated the co-existence of multiple lineages of PDCoV in China, and our findings will aid the reorganization and evolution of the virus.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with profound compromises in host defenses. The patterns of immune compromise change over time. Infections are an important cause of serious morbidity and pose substantial threats to life. Thus, the challenges of infection facing the transplant clinician are both myriad and dynamic. Early after transplant, neutropenic infections are most important. Later herpesvirus and invasive fungal infections predominate. Even late after transplant, patients with chronic graft versus host disease remain susceptible to encapsulated bacterial, varicella zoster virus, and invasive fungal infections. Over time, with robust engraftment and control of GVHD, the risk of serious infections recedes with immune reconstitution.

GOAL To evaluate a novel kind of textile electrodes based on woven fabrics treated with PEDOT PSS, through an easy fabrication process, testing these electrodes for biopotential recordings. METHODS Fabrication is based on raw fabric soaking in PEDOT PSS using a second dopant, squeezing and annealing. The electrodes have been tested on human volunteers, in terms of both skin contact impedance and quality of the ECG signals recorded at rest and during physical activity (power spectral density, baseline wandering, QRS detectability, and broadband noise). RESULTS The electrodes are able to operate in both wet and dry conditions. Dry electrodes are more prone to noise artifacts, especially during physical exercise and mainly due to the unstable contact between the electrode and the skin. Wet (saline) electrodes present a stable and reproducible behavior, which is comparable or better than that of traditional disposable gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes. CONCLUSION The achieved results reveal the capability of this kind of electrodes to work without the electrolyte, providing a valuable interface with the skin, due to mixed electronic and ionic conductivity of PEDOT PSS. These electrodes can be effectively used for acquiring ECG signals. SIGNIFICANCE Textile electrodes based on PEDOT PSS represent an important milestone in wearable monitoring, as they present an easy and reproducible fabrication process, very good performance in wet and dry (at rest) conditions and a superior level of comfort with respect to textile electrodes proposed so far. This paves the way to their integration into smart garments.

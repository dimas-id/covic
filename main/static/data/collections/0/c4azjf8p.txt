The nucleotide sequence of the human coronavirus strain 229E (HCV 229E) has been determined. This article describes the organization of the virus genome, the predicted viral gene products and the mechanisms which regulate viral gene expression. This information provides a basis to investigate the biology and pathogenesis of HCV.

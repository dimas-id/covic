Viruses are obligate intracellular microbes that exploit the host metabolic machineries to meet their biosynthetic demands, making these host pathways potential therapeutic targets. Here, by exploring a lipid library, we show that AM580, a retinoid derivative and RAR-Î± agonist, is highly potent in interrupting the life cycle of diverse viruses including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and influenza A virus. Using click chemistry, the overexpressed sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is shown to interact with AM580, which accounts for its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Mechanistic studies pinpoint multiple SREBP proteolytic processes and SREBP-regulated lipid biosynthesis pathways, including the downstream viral protein palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles formation, that are indispensable for virus replication. Collectively, our study identifies a basic lipogenic transactivation event with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents SREBP as a potential target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.

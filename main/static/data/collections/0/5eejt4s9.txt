Viruses are the smallest infective agents currently known to affect humans and animals. The virus has a centrally situated nucleic acid, which is encased within a capsid consisting of a protein core. Viruses are obligatory intracellular microorganisms that live inside cells, using components of the nucleic acid and protein generating system of the host to replicate and trigger cell destruction leading to diseases. Alternatively, the host’s defense mechanisms lead to cell destruction in an attempt to clear cells infected by the viruses. The nucleic acid is RNA or DNA, which may be single-stranded or double-stranded [1]. The pathophysiology of viral infections may be attributed to the degeneration and cellular necrosis of the infected cells, leading to local and systemic inflammatory responses. The body’s defense mechanisms include phagocytosis, humoral and cell-mediated responses and the production of interferons [2]. Interferons prevent the local spread of viruses, whereas antibodies prevent viremia, ensure long-term immunity and sensitize infected cells to be destroyed by T-cells and macrophages [3, 4]. Cell-mediated immunity leads to an increase in cytotoxic cells that then release lymphokines, including interferon.

OBJECTIVE Virtual CT sonography with magnetic navigation yields cross-sectional images of CT volume data that correspond to the angle of the transducer in the magnetic field in real time. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of virtual CT sonography for radiofrequency ablation of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma poorly defined on B-mode sonography. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred one patients enrolled in the study were separated into two groups. Fifty-one patients with 65 hepatocellular carcinomas underwent prospective virtual CT sonography as guidance for radiofrequency ablation. Fifty patients with 63 hepatocellular carcinomas managed with B-mode sonographic guidance were retrospectively selected under the same conditions as the virtual CT sonography group to act as a historical control group. RESULTS In the virtual CT sonography group, technically successful ablation was achieved in a single session in 92% (47/51) of the patients and in two sessions in 8% (4/51). In the B-mode sonography group, technical success was achieved in a single session in 72% (36/50) of the patients, in two sessions in 24% (12/50), and in three sessions in 4% (2/50). Treatment analysis showed that the technical success rate after a single treatment session was significantly (p = 0.017) higher for the virtual CT sonography group. The number of treatment sessions was significantly (p = 0.021) lower for the virtual CT sonography group (mean, 1.1 +/- 0.1 vs 1.3 +/- 0.3 sessions). CONCLUSION Virtual CT sonographically assisted radiofrequency ablation is an efficient treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma that is poorly defined on B-mode sonography.

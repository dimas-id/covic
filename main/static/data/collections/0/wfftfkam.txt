It has been unclear why the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars‐CoV‐2) hits a small minority hard, while the vast majority of children appear to be protected and develop mild or no disease (1,2). The editorial by Brodin suggests some possible mechanisms why it is so (1). I would like to emphasize the significance of cross immunity due to previous exposure to seasonal coronavirus; it may be a plausible explanation for why children appear to be protected (2,3).

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019 and currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value<0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues, including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.

Online social networks are known to lack adequate multi-user privacy support. In this paper we present EXPRI, an agent architecture that aims to assist users in managing multi-user privacy conflicts. By considering the personal utility of sharing content and the individually preferred moral values of each user involved in the conflict, EXPRI identifies the best collaborative solution by applying practical reasoning techniques. Such techniques provide the agent with the cognitive process that is necessary for explainability. Furthermore, the knowledge gathered during the practical reasoning process allows EXPRI to engage in contrastive explanations.

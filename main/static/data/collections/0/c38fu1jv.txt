Finding new therapeutic targets of glomerulosclerosis treatment is an ongoing quest. Due to a living environment of various stresses and pathological stimuli, podocytes are prone to injuries; moreover, as a cell without proliferative potential, loss of podocytes is vital in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. Thus, sufficient understanding of factors and underlying mechanisms of podocyte injury facilitates the advancement of treating and prevention of glomerulosclerosis. The clinical symptom of podocyte injury is proteinuria, sometimes with loss of kidney functions progressing to glomerulosclerosis. Injury-induced changes in podocyte physiology and function are actually not a simple passive process, but a complex interaction of proteins that comprise the anatomical structure of podocytes at molecular levels. This chapter lists several aspects of podocyte injuries along with potential mechanisms, including glucose and lipid metabolism disorder, hypertension, RAS activation, micro-inflammation, immune disorder, and other factors. These aspects are not technically separated items, but intertwined with each other in the pathogenesis of podocyte injuries.

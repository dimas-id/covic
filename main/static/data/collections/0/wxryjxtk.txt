BACKGROUND Treatment of instent restenosis after carotid artery stenting because of circumferential or calcified lesions can be difficult and refractory to conventional balloon angioplasty. We describe the off-label use of a cardiac scoring balloon that was used for lesions refractory to angioplasty with other balloons. CASE DESCRIPTIONS Two patients with a history of carotid artery stenting 6 and 8 years ago, presented with symptomatic carotid instent restenosis caused by circumferential and calcified lesions, respectively. Angioplasty with conventional compliant and noncompliant balloons was unsuccessful. An AngioSculpt percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) scoring balloon catheter (AngioScore, Fremont CA, USA) was successful in achieving vessel recanalization despite the refractory nature of these lesions. No further conventional balloons or use of cutting balloons was required. CONCLUSION The AngioSculpt PTCA scoring balloon catheter can be a useful option for treatment of refractory calcified or circumferential carotid instent restenosis.

Mycoplasmas are frequently isolated from many animal species. In domestic cats, mycoplasmas may be isolated from respiratory and ocular mucosae, but other sites are also occasionally colonized by these organisms. No cases of Mycoplasma species-associated neurologic disease have been reported in cats. We describe a case of Mycoplasma felis-associated meningoencephalitis in a 10-month-old domestic shorthair cat.

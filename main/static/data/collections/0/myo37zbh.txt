The first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Argentina was reported in Buenos Aires on March 3rd, 2020, in a patient who arrived from Milan. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and course of illness of patients infected with Covid-19 that were hospitalized in a private clinical setting during March 2020. Sixty three patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, were admitted to our hospital during March 2020. Twenty six of these subjects were diagnosed positive by the RT-PCR for SARS Cov-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. We recorded data about epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, in addition to comorbidities, laboratory and radiological studies were done. The median age was 40 years (SD Â± 15 years); there was an equal number of men and women; all the patients but one were coming from abroad; the most common symptom was fever (24/26 cases) and lymphopenia (n = 8). We found that there were patients in whom fever disappeared within the first 72h (n = 17) and another group in which the fever lasted six or more days (n = 7). One patient out of 26 died. The population of our study was young and almost all were imported cases, in alinement with the stage of the epidemic at the time when the study was conducted. We observed that there were two patterns in the fever curve but the persistence of it did not lead to a worse prognosis. Larger population studies are required in order to confirm these clinical findings.

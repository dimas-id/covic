Objective@#To explore the relationship between different serum albumin and lymphocyte levels in patients with 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia (COVID-19).@*Methods@#A retrospective study was performed to identify the characteristics of the clinical data of 205 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Happy Street of Hanchuan People&apos;s Hospital, Xiaogan, Hubei Province from January 24 to February 12, 2020, including their general information, serum albumin (ALB) levels, lymphocyte counts (LYM), percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%) and other laboratory parameter levels. Low ALB group and normal ALB group were demarcated by the concentration of 35g/L, further to identify the differences of LYM and LYM% levels and the incidence of LYM and LYM% decline at different ALB levels between groups,as well as the correlation between ALB and LYM, LYM% levels in hypoalbuminemia conditions .@*Results@#17.5% of COVID-19 patients were associated with hypoalbuminemia. The levels of LYM and LYM% in the low ALB group were significantly lower than those in the normal ALB group (P &lt;0.001). The incidence of LYM and LYM% decline in the low ALB group was significantly higher than those in the normal ALB group (P &lt;0.001). The levels of LYM and LYM% in the low ALB group were significantly positively correlated with serum ALB concentrations (P &lt;0.05).@*Conclusions@#The decrease of lymphocyte levels in COVID-19 patients may be correlated to hypoalbuminemia. COVID-19 patients complicated by hypoalbuminemia should be actively intervened to maintain serum albumin in the normal range.

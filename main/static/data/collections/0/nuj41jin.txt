BACKGROUND Patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction are at increased risk of cerebrovascular events. We assessed the incidence, predictors, and implications of cerebrovascular events in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction managed with a primary percutaneous coronary intervention strategy. METHODS AND RESULTS In the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial, 72 of 3602 patients (2.0%) experienced at least 1 cerebrovascular event (stroke: 63 patients; transient ischemic attack: 12 patients) during the 3-year follow-up (40.3% within 30 days, 20.8% between 30 days and 1 year, and 38.9% between 1 and 3 years). Stroke was ischemic in 58 (92.1%) patients and hemorrhagic in 5 (7.9%) patients. More than half of all strokes (52.3%) were disabling. By principal management strategy, cerebrovascular events developed in 2.0%, 14.9%, and 1.9% of patients triaged to primary percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, and medical therapy, respectively (P<0.0001). Cerebrovascular events were independently predicted by older age, creatinine clearance <60 mL/min, treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. Cerebrovascular events were associated with significantly increased rates of 3-year mortality (20.5% versus 6.5%; P<0.0001), as well as reinfarction (14.3% versus 3.8%; P=0.0007), ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (22.8% versus 13.0%; P=0.006), and major bleeding (23.5% versus 8.4%; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In HORIZONS-AMI, cerebrovascular events within 3 years after ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in patients undergoing a primary percutaneous coronary intervention management strategy occurred in 2.0% of patients and were most frequent after coronary artery bypass grafting. Cerebrovascular events were often disabling and were strongly associated with high rates of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, and major bleeding.

Networks of genes, proteins, and cells exhibit significant multiscale organization, with distinct communities appearing at different spatial resolutions. Here, we apply the concept of ‘persistent homology’ to identify network communities that persist within defined scale ranges, yielding a hierarchy of robust structures in data. Application to mouse single-cell transcriptomes significantly expands the catalog of cell types identified by current tools, while analysis of SARS-COV-2 networks suggests pro-viral hijacking of WNT.

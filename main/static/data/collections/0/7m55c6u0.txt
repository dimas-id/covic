The current COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed more than 100,000 victims and it will cause more deaths in the coming months. Tools that can track the number and locations of cases are critical for surveillance and can help in making policy decisions for controlling the outbreak. The current surveillance web-based dashboards run on proprietary platforms, which are often expensive and require specific computational knowledge. We present a new tool (OUTBREAK) for studying and visualizing epidemiological data. It permits even non-specialist users to input data most conveniently and track outbreaks in real-time. This tool has the potential to guide and help health authorities to intervene and minimize the effects of the outbreaks. It is freely available at http://outbreak.sysbio.tools/.

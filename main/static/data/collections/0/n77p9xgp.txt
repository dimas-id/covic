A grass soda technical lignin (PB1000) underwent a process combining solvent-fractionation and treatment with an ionic liquid (IL), and a comprehensive investigation of the structural modifications was performed using HPSEC, 31P NMR, thioacidolysis and GC-MS. Three fractions with distinct reactivity were recovered from successive ethyl acetate (EA), butanone (MEK) and methanol (MeOH) extractions. In parallel, a fraction deprived of EA extractives was obtained. The samples were treated with methyl imidazolium bromide [HMIM]Br using either conventional heating (CH) or microwave irradiation (MW). The treatment allowed to solubilise 28% of the EA insoluble fraction and yielded additional free phenols in all the fractions, as a consequence of depolymerisation and demethylation. The gain of the combined process in terms of antioxidant properties was demonstrated through DPPH‚óè radical scavenging test. Integrating further IL safety-related data and environmental considerations, this study paves the way for the sustainable production of phenolic oligomers competing with commercial antioxidants.

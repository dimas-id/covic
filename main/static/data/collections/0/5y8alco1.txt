BACKGROUND & AIMS Phase 3 trials have shown the efficacy of vedolizumab, which binds to integrin α4β7, in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in patients who failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. METHODS From June through December 2014, there were 173 patients with CD and 121 patients with UC who were included in a multicenter nominative compassionate early access program granted by French regulatory agencies. This program provided patients with access to vedolizumab before it was authorized for marketing. Vedolizumab (300 mg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. We report results obtained after the 14-week induction phase. RESULTS Among the 294 patients treated with vedolizumab (mean age, 39.5 ± 14.0 y; mean disease duration, 10.8 ± 7.6 y; concomitant steroids, 44% of cases), 276 completed the induction period, however, 18 discontinued vedolizumab because of a lack of response (n = 14), infusion-related reaction (n = 2), or infections (n = 2). At week 14, 31% of patients with CD were in steroid-free clinical remission and 51% had a response; among patients with UC, 36% were in steroid-free clinical remission and 50% had a response. No deaths were reported. Severe adverse events occurred in 24 patients (8.2%), including 15 (5.1%) that led to vedolizumab discontinuation (1 case of pulmonary tuberculosis and 1 rectal adenocarcinoma). CONCLUSIONS In a cohort of patients with CD or UC who failed previous anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, approximately one third of patients achieved steroid-free clinical remission after 14 weeks of induction therapy with vedolizumab. This agent had an acceptable safety profile in these patients.

Patients undergoing thoracic organ transplantation procedures involving the heart or lung are at increased risk for developing a wide variety of infections due to their underlying immunosuppression and/or other factors. Lung transplant recipients are at high risk for developing infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and opportunistic fungi, whereas heart transplant recipients are at risk for developing infections caused by these same microorganisms, as well as parasitic infections, including toxoplasmosis and New World trypanosomiasis. This review will highlight the various infections that thoracic organ transplant recipients may develop following their procedures.

The curvilinear relationship between a screening test's positive predictive value (PPV) and its target disease prevalence is proportional. In consequence, there is an inflection point of maximum curvature in the screening curve defined as a function of the sensitivity and specificity beyond which the rate of change of a test's PPV declines sharply relative to disease prevalence. Herein, we demonstrate a mathematical model exploring this phenomenon and define the prevalence threshold point where this change occurs. Understanding where this prevalence point lies in the curve has important implications for the interpretation of test results, the administration of healthcare systems, the implementation of public health measures, and in cases of pandemics like SARS-CoV-2, the functioning of society at large. To illustrate the methods herein described, we provide the example of the screening strategies used in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, and calculate the prevalence threshold statistic of different tests available today. This concept can help contextualize the validity of a screening test in real time, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of the current pandemic.

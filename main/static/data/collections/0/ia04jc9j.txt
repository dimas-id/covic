Abstract The sequences of the 5′ terminal 1140 and 3′ terminal 1546 nt of tomato ringspot virus (TomRSV) RNA1 have been determined. These sequences share a high degree of nucleotide sequence similarity with the previously determined TomRSV RNA2 sequence. Eighty-eight percent of the 5' terminal 907 nt of TomRSV RNA1 and RNA2 contain identical nucleotide residues; the first 459 nt are identical at all positions, whereas the next 447 nt are identical at only 75.8% of the nucleotide positions. The region of similarity includes not only the 5' nontranslated leader but also sequence probably encoding polyproteins. The 3′ terminal 1533 nt of TomRSV RNA1 and RNA2 are identical and are noncoding. The sequences common to RNA1 and RNA2 account for almost 35% of the total genomic sequence. It is possible that the similar sequences at both ends of TomRSV RNA1 and RNA2 are a result of recombination between these two genomic RNA components.

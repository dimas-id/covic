PURPOSE OF REVIEW Pig-to-human xenotransplantation has taken steps closer to reality through advances in animal engineering to address immunological as well as microbial problems. The most highlighted problem in xenotransplantation safety has been the potential risk for zoonotic infection mediated by porcine endogenous retroviruses. Safety issues regarding viral zoonosis, particularly porcine endogenous retroviruses, are summarized and commented upon. RECENT FINDINGS Several molecular, transgenic strategies to provide safer transplant source animals with less porcine endogenous retrovirus infectivity have been developed. A genomics approach by selective breeding and porcine endogenous retrovirus loci knockout is at least theoretically possible. For other viruses, advances have been made in technologies for virus discovery and identification. SUMMARY The consequences of possible zoonoses in xenotransplantation are largely unknown. Further work to identify and control potential zoonotic agents based on recent progress will improve the safety profile of xenotransplantation. Advances made should be subjected to cautious testing in well controlled, preclinical and clinical experiments.

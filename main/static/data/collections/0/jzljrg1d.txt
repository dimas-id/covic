PURPOSE: To discuss the effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 betacoronavirus on ambulatory ophthalmology practices, the value proposition of telemedicine, teleophthalmology implementation methodologies, and the accelerated future of telemedicine. DESIGN: Review of the current telehealth landscape including usage, policies, and techniques for ambulatory practice integration. METHODS: We provide author-initiated review of recent trends in telehealth, governmental recommendations for health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a PubMed Central query for telemedicine in ophthalmology or teleophthalmology. In addition, the authors' comprehensive experience in telemedicine design and implementation is provided. RESULTS: We provide a summary describing the present state of telehealth, teleophthalmology modeling, care delivery, and the proposed impact of telehealth surges on the future of ophthalmology practice. CONCLUSION: Recent patient and provider interest in telemedicine, the relaxation of regulatory restrictions, increased remote care reimbursement, and ongoing social distancing practices compel many ophthalmologists to consider virtualizing services.

Surgery for Killian-Jamieson diverticulum of the esophagus is scarcely reported in the literature owing to the rarity of this entity. This is a case report of such a diverticulum and a description of the transcervical diverticulectomy that we performed on a 49-year-old lady. The patient was investigated for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease and was diagnosed with a left-sided Killian-Jamieson diverticulum.

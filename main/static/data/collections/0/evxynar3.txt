Penicillium subrubescens is able to degrade a broad range of plant biomass and it has an expanded set of Carbohydrate Active enzyme (CAZyme)-encoding genes in comparison to other Penicillium species. Here we used exoproteome and transcriptome analysis to demonstrate the versatile plant biomass degradation mechanism by P. subrubescens during growth on wheat bran and sugar beet pulp. On wheat bran P. subrubescens degraded xylan main chain and side residues from Day 2 of cultivation, whereas it started to degrade side chains of pectin in sugar beet pulp prior to attacking the main chain on Day 3. In addition, on Day 3 the cellulolytic enzymes were highly increased. Our results confirm that P. subrubescens adapts its enzyme production to the available plant biomass and is a promising new fungal cell factory for the production of CAZymes.

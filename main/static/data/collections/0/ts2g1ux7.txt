Immunoglobulins have been used widely in medicine for a variety of diseases including infectious diseases. While the main clinical applications of immunoglobulin therapy concern their use as replacement for patients with primary immunodeficiencies, or as treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, their role in infectious disease is limited largely to viral and toxin neutralization and replacement therapy in patients with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Many aspects of the therapeutic regimen of immunoglobulins even in the established indications remain open. Recently, due to the worldwide surge of immunosuppression caused by AIDS, organ transplantation, cancer, and autoimmune therapies, as well as the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, there has been renewed interest in the use of antibody preparation to prevent infections in high-risk groups. Knowing the limitations of the current anti-infective armamentarium, approaches that target the host through manipulations to augment the host immune response provide a helpful aid to conventional treatment options. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that strategies aiming to support or stimulate immune response could be feasible approaches that would benefit immunocompromised patients. In the present chapter, we present contemporary indications of immunoglobulin administration for therapy and prophylaxis of infections in the immunocompromised population.

OBJECTIVE To analyze tracheal intubation and respiratory treatment in the critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. METHODS Review and analyze tracheal intubation and respiratory treatment in critical SARS patients in intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS Three of thirteen patients had been intubated or received tracheotomy before they entered into ICU, the other patients received treatment of nasal cannula or oxygen mask. With the development of the disease, two patients had been intubated because of respiratory failure or tracheotomy. Tracheal intubation was twice made in two patients in order to replace tracheal tubes. CONCLUSIONS The patient should be intubated or received tracheotomy if non-invasive respiratory support has no effect. Standard protection could protect medical staff from infection under tracheal intubation.

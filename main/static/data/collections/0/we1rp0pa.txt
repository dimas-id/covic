The modern public health model for leadership will unlikely be the omniscient figure with easy answers.51 Rather the public health leader of the future may well be the transcendent, collaborative «servant leader»(50,52) who knits and aligns disparate voices together behind a common mission. They pinpoint passion and compassion, promote servant leadership, acknowledge the unfamiliar, the ambiguous, and the paradoxical, communicate succinctly to reframe, and understand the «public» part of public health leadership. By working between and above the levels of leadership of self, others and organizations, these transcendent leaders can ultimately shift the paradigm from «no hope» to «new hope» and create a renewed sense of community. Such leadership will be vital as the 21st century progresses. Beginning the journey to new hope may start by motivating underdogs who nurture the spirit, discover a passion to serve, cultivate interdependence, and create uncommon bonds. These emerging leaders can tap into their unique talents, passion, and compassion to promote a mission of «the highest attainable standard of health» for all, in every community.

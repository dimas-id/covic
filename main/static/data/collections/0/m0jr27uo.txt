Since January 11th , when the first 40 cases of infection by SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19 disease) were communicated from Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei, about 4.5 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide. During this three-month period, 80,000 new cases and 11,000 deaths were registered daily. Spain holds the sad privilege of leading the European raking of confirmed cases (>228,000) and deaths (>27,000) with no consensus on the actual figures.

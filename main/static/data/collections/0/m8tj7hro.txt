BACKGROUND Complete cytoreductive surgery (CCRS) plus Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the best-known treatment for pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). In 30% of the cases, PMP realize a widespread involvement of the peritoneal cavity. In these extreme situations, we developed, devoted strategies to optimize the feasibility and safety of CCRS. This study describes the surgical resections required for CCRS and the consequent approaches that we propose to achieve CCRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS We defined "huge PMP" by a peritoneal cancer index (PCI) â‰¥ 28. Surgical procedures of patients operated on between 1994 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospective database in a single institution. RESULTS During this period, 311 patients were operated on and 247 (79%) underwent CCRS + HIPEC. Among them, 100 patients presented "huge" PMP and 54 patients underwent CCRS + HIPEC. In patients with "huge" PMP, the rate of CCRS + HIPEC was 25% before 2002 and reached 71% between 2011 and 2014. We identified 3 conditions for CCRS 1) to guaranty a sufficient length of residual small bowel 2) to preserve the left gastric vessels in order to preserve the superior third of the stomach 3) to ensure that the hepatic pedicle can be entirely cleared from its tumor involvement. None of the other peritonectomy procedures were decisional for CCRS. CONCLUSION Our learning curve improved the selection and completion rate of CCRS + HIPEC for "huge PMP". Some anatomical and physiological prerequisites guarantee the feasibility and safety of such extensive surgeries.

Abstract The E3 region of all simian and human types classified within species Human mastadenovirus B (HAdV-B) encodes two unique highly conserved ORFs of unknown function designated E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ. We generated a HAdV-3 mutant encoding small epitope tags at the N-termini of both E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ (HAdV-3 N-tag wt) and a double knock out (HAdV-3 N-tag DKO) mutant virus that does not express either protein. Our studies show that HAdV-3 E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ are type I transmembrane proteins that are produced predominantly at late times post infection, are glycosylated, co-localize at the plasma membrane of non-polarized epithelial cells, and interact with each other. At their extreme C-termini HAdV-B E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ possess a conserved di-leucine motif followed by a class II PDZ domain binding motif (PBM). HAdV-3 E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ are dispensable for virus growth, progeny release, spread, and plaque formation in A549 cells.

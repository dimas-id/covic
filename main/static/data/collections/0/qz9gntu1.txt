BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the major cause of death under 5 years. With high CAP numbers in China and growing access to PICUs, factors associated with severe CAP need to be determined to optimize care. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine PICU CAP admission features and outcomes. METHODS: A 4 year prospective study of CAP aged 1 month to <14 years admitted to PICU, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, China. All were managed in a standard manner. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were collected systematically. All received antibiotics. RESULTS: Eight hundred ten (7%) of 10,836 CAP hospital admissions needed PICU. Seven hundred seven (87%) were enrolled. PICU CAP children were young (76% ≤ 12 months) and 33% had co‐morbid conditions; 21% congenital heart disease.21% required mechanical ventilation. The average length of PICU stay was 5 days (range, 3–27). The case fatality rate was 5.8%. Viruses were detected in 38%, RSV 24%; bacteria in 23%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7%, Haemophilus influenza b 4%, Mycoplasma 11%. On single factor analysis, PICU admission respiratory rate >70/min, grunting/groaning, head nodding, cyanosis, and anemia were associated with respiratory failure and with fatality. On multivariate analysis only presence of congenital heart disease, Trisomy 21 and immunodeficiency correlated with fatality; not microbe nor PICU findings. CONCLUSIONS: Young age and underlying congenital heart disease were associated factors for PICU support in CAP in China. Early referral if altered sensorium, high respiratory rate, head nodding, grunting and anemia, and universal access to conjugated vaccines may decrease morbidity and mortality.

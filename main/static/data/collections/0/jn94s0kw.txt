Fungal endocarditis following Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is rare and very rarely reported. Though rare it has a high mortality rate. A 49-year-old male patient who had venovenous ECMO presented with aortic valve endocarditis after 40 days. He underwent sutureless bioprosthehtic valve placement and debridement of abscess. Abscess fluid grew aspergillus species and was started on dual antifungal intravenous amphotericin and variconazole. He was discharged after 1 month with oral variconazole. Incidence of aseptic endocarditis (AE) has been on rise due to increase in invasive procedures. Blood culture is mostly sterile, and fever may be absent. Abscess debridement and aggressive dual antifungal treatment helped our patient in his road to recovery. In current era with increasing use of ECMO, newer rarer complications should be kept in mind. High index of suspicion is required for diagnosing fungal endocarditis after ECMO.

The author aims to depict the current COVID-19 pandemic and personal protective equipment (PPE) crisis in the UK. The current situation is put into context exploring the history of global outbreaks of infectious disease and what has been learnt. These lessons are then applied and weighed against the recent response to coronavirus. An in depth interview with a UK biomedical SME based in Shanghai, China is reported in order to inform future procurement of PPE. It is hoped that an appreciation of the dynamic nature of the market will allow adaptations to be made in order to secure reliable supply chains moving forwards.

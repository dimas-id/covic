Many people in Japan and around the world have questioned whether Japan's "number of tests" for COVID-19 infection control is sufficient Because the scope of influence caused by infection is broad and complex, it is difficult to see the whole picture by only cutting one aspect of the situation, and there are differences among the sectors involved This misunderstanding can be seen as a communication failure in Japan's countermeasures against COVID-19 infection, and it is important for science and technology to clarify the reasons for the failure Why has the number of tests been narrowed down? The problem is not limited to the government's ability to execute, but there are also systemic impediments and overlooked issues in the effective implementation of countermeasures against new coronavirus infection In this paper, we first used a systems thinking technique (causal loop diagram) to visualize the situation related to COVID-19 infection, and confirmed its characteristics as a system Our causal loop diagram consists of an "infection model" and an "incidence response model" The government and the Council of Experts) have separated the "infection model" from the "incidence model" with the goal of reducing the number of deaths and, by extension, serious illnesses as much as possible In the process, attention has been paid to avoiding the depletion of medical resources, which is probably one of the reasons why the number of tests has not been able to increase so far However, while this approach is reasonable when each model is taken separately, it turns out that there are serious systemic weaknesses that occur at the interface between the two models For example, raising the testing hurdle will increase the number of mild cases that are active in the city without being tested, increasing the chance of infection and increasing the number of new cases This will create a new spread of infection Considering this, the following two measures need to be implemented It is necessary to implement blockades or other measures to reduce the number of opportunities for infection as soon as possible, or equivalent measures to reduce the number of opportunities for infection (e g , school closures, refraining from going outside, cancellation of events, city blockades, etc ) In order to expand inspections, it is necessary to introduce an inspection system that minimizes the connection with medical resources, such as the combination of drive-through inspections and walk-through inspections, which are famous in Korea, with Internet interviews However, in the current situation where infection is spreading to a certain extent and medical resources are tight, a two-sided strategy, such as increasing the number of tests, is necessary to control the spread of infection by lightly infected people (and subclinical infected people) who spread infection in the city in order to deal with the serious systemic problems at the interface between the two models The causal loop diagram shows that citizens are also required to take measures to prevent infection, such as masks and hand washing, and to change their behavior in order to reduce the chance of infection This case is an example of the importance of system-wide understanding of the situation for both citizens and experts, and of sharing that understanding Translated with www DeepL com/Translator (free version)

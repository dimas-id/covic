Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is a swarm intelligence to optimize discrete space problems by extending the Particle Swarm Optimization. Its transfer function is the key element of BPSO. In this paper, a new V-shaped transfer function with a parameter k has been proposed. The parameter k was used to control the opening size of the transfer function. At first, the setting of the parameter k has been obtained by the experiments, and then the new V-shaped transfer with the optimal k value is compared with the other kinds of the V-shaped transfer functions by the experiment of feature selection. The results have indicated that the new V-shaped transfer function improved the performance of Binary Particle Swarm Optimization.

Multiple Organ Failure (MOF) has largely been attributed to bacterial sepsis, though conclusive evidence of an essential role for bacteria and/or their endotoxins is still lacking. On the other hand, MOF and the clinical syndrome of sepsis may be aseptically induced in germfree animals. This paper reviews the evidence that excessive activation of endogenous humoral mediators and inflammatory cells may cause this highly lethal syndrome.

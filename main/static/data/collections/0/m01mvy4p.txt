Abdominal muscles, such as the oblique- and transverse muscles, find their blood supply from multiple segmental pedicles from the iliac artery. Besides its superior vascularization, its release is simple, leaving two abdominal muscles for securing abdominal wall strength. The release of the muscle and coverage of the graft requires partial muscle mobilization and is a minor reconstruction, but extension of the mobilization cranially enables coverage of larger defects. We present a case of an infected vascular graft in the groin successfully preserved through coverage with an external oblique muscle flap.

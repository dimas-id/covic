COVID-19 pandemic strongly modified the organizations of our clinical practice. Strict containment measures have been adopted to limit the disease diffusion. In particular, hospital face-to-face post discharge and follow up visits have been reduced. Although cancelling or deferring appointments seems to be a pragmatic approach, this solution may have a devasting long-term impact on health medical care and on patients. In this context, telemedicine and remote consultations may have the potential to provide healthcare minimizing virus exposure. In this paper we describe how Multidisciplinary team (MDT) reorganized genitourinary cancer care delivery at our Institute (AO SS Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo, Alessandria), taking advantage of telematic means. Furthermore, we present our preliminary results regarding patients' satisfaction.

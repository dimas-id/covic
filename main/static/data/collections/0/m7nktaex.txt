We read with interest the International Forum recently published on Vox Sanguinis on the actions carried out from hospital transfusion services during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) [1]. The survey, to which 12 centers from around the world (included Italy) have joined, was structured on 9 questions assessing the changes in blood bank activities during COVID‐19 pandemia and including various technical aspects from pre‐transfusion testing to blood products storage and blood components utilization. Interestingly, the 9(th) question regarded the production of convalescent plasma (CP) [1]. The Italian participants answered that a number of protocols on CP are ongoing or planned in Italy and indicated as a reference the position paper of the Italian Society for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology (SIMTI) and the Italian Society for Haemapheresis and Cell Manipulation (SIdEM).

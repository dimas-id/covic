This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of respiratory viral infections (RVI) in persons living with HIV (PLH) admitted with a respiratory complaint using real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and primer‐independent next‐generation sequencing (NGS) Of 82 subjects, respiratory viruses were the most common pathogen identified in 27 (33%), followed by fungus and bacteria in 8 (10%) and 4 (5%) subjects, respectively Among subjects with RVI, 11 (41%) required ICU admission and 16 (59%) required mechanical ventilation The proportion of respiratory viruses identified, and the associated complicated hospital course highlights the significant role that RVIs play in the lung health of PLH

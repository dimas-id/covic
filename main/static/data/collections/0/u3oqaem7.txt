Symptoms of severe encephalomyelitis developed in a 31-year-old man in 1967. He had a high serum antibody titre to mumps virus associated with a polymorphic cell reaction and an increased protein concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). He recovered considerably within a year and was able to resume work. In 1975 his condition deteriorated again; it improved during the following few years, but a further deterioration then occurred. In March, 1981, the complement-fixing antibody titre to mumps virus was 1/32 in the serum and 1/4 in the CSF. In November, 1981, the CSF IgG index was increased and the altered serum/CSF antibody ratio persisted. The specificity of the altered antibody ratio was confirmed by the single radial haemolysis test and an immunoassay specific for mumps virus. Antibodies against the mumps virus envelope glycoprotein, M-protein, and nucleoprotein could be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and the antibody patterns in serum and CSF were similar. Antibodies against other microorganisms were not detected in the patient's CSF, and mumps antibodies were not found in the CSF specimens of 57 control patients. This case may be an example of a new diseaseâ€”chronic mumps virus infection in the central nervous system.

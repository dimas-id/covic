BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Our objective is to report intermediate-term outcomes for patients who have undergone upper tract urologic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) at a single institution. METHODS From January 1, 2008, through November 30, 2012, 107 cases treated with LESS were identified, including pyeloplasty (n = 30), ureterolithotomy (n = 32), nephrectomy (n = 35; simple = 31, partial = 4), and cyst decortication (n = 10). Perioperative data were reviewed, and conversion and complication rates were noted. RESULTS The median follow-up was 21.5 months for pyeloplasty, 20.5 for ureterolithotomy, 28.0 for simple nephrectomy, 14.0 for partial nephrectomy, and 19.0 for cyst decortication. Major complications were encountered in 8 patients, including 3 intraoperative complications (2 bowel injury with serosal tearing and 1 intraoperative bleeding), which were recognized and repaired with LESS or conversion to conventional laparoscopy (CL). During the intermediate postoperative period (30-90 days) major complications occurred in 5 patients: 4 ureteral strictures (Clavien-Dindo grade [CG] IIIb) and 1 urinoma formation (CG IIIa). During the early postoperative period (<30 days), the most common minor complications were flank pain (CG I) in 16 patients and urinary tract infection (CG II) in 11, followed by urinary leakage (CG I) in 8. CONCLUSIONS Intermediate-term functional outcomes of this single-center study confirm that upper tract LESS is a challenging procedure that can be safe and effective when performed by an experienced team. Prospective studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate the safety of LESS in the treatment of various upper urinary tract conditions.

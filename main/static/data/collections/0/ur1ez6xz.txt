Summary BackgroundThe continuous outbreak of COVID-19 poses a devastating threat to the global public health, and there's no special therapeutic drugs.This paper is to explore the effect of high fiber whey short peptide enteral nutrition on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, to find ways to prevent patients from progressing to severe illness, and to reduce the harm of epidemic situation to human beings. Methods: The course of fighting against COVID-19 in our hospital for 49 days was reviewed. Three nutritional interventions including five-step nutrition treatment, early intervention of whole protein, and high fiber whey short peptide intervention were conducted consecutively.The effect of high fiber whey short peptide on nutrition, immune function and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 was compared with that of whole protein intervention. Results: High fiber whey short peptide group when compared with whey protein group, can significantly improve prealbumin in patients with covid-19, improve the negative nitrogen balance of patients, and reduce the average period of turning negative by 39.06%. Conclusion: High fiber whey short peptide can significantly improve the recovery speed of patients with covid-19.

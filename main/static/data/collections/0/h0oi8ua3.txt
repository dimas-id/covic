Human health is intrinsically linked to the health of animals and to the environment, and efforts by just one sector alone cannot prevent or adequately address the complex problems at the human-animal-environment interface. Countries of the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region, as any other region, face the threat of emerging and remerging zoonoses. However, the challenges in this Region are high given the lack of resources, poor health systems, and political factors. Hence, adopting the One Health approach becomes urgent to assist those countries. Subsequently, based on analysis of One Health capacities in the Region and in close consultation with representatives and subject matter experts from countries in the Region, a framework for action towards effectively implementing the One Health approach was developed. The framework capitalizes on current opportunities in the region and provide countries with a list of practical key activities towards optimal use of their resources and strengthening their capabilities to tackle concurrent and future health challenges at the interface. Strong governance structures and building on existing mechanisms are crucial for achieving effective disease surveillance and response. Additionally, using intersectoral approaches for risk assessment and risk mitigation for health issues at the human-animal-environment interface can improve efficiency and result in more successful outcomes.

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) changed the surgical everyday practice overnight. Currently, the first articles reporting outcomes of liver transplant recipients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are published. The aim of the present study was to summarise the existing evidence of impact of COVID-19 global pandemic on liver transplant recipients. Electronic databases were searched in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Five studies were selected from a pool of 12 studies with a total of 854 liver transplant recipients of whom 700 were children and the rest 154 were adults.

During January and February 2012, state and local public health agencies in West Virginia and Idaho, with assistance from facility staff members and CDC, investigated outbreaks of unexplained respiratory illness characterized by high proportions of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) at two skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Investigations were conducted to determine the extent and etiology of each outbreak and make recommendations to prevent further spread. During both outbreaks, influenza was initially suspected; however, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was identified as the etiologic agent. Among 57 cases of respiratory illness from both facilities, 45 (79%) patients had evidence of LRTI, of whom 25 (56%) had radiologically confirmed pneumonia; five (9%) had evidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and seven (12%) could not be classified. Six patients (11%) died. These outbreaks demonstrate that hMPV, a recently described pathogen that would not have been detected without the use of molecular diagnostics in these outbreaks, is associated with severe LRTI and should be considered as a possible etiology of respiratory outbreaks in SNFs.

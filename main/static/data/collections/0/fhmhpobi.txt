Abstract Viruses exist wherever there is life. They can cause allergy, immune response, inflammation, and even fatal diseases directly or indirectly. Accumulating evidence shows that host RNA undergoes rapid degradation during virus infection. Herein, we focus on several possible mechanisms of infection-induced host RNA turnover, which seems to be a common strategy for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses during the very early stage of infection and a potential application of live cell imaging on its visualization.

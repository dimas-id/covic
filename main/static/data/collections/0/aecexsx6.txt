SARS-CoV-2 infection recently reached pandemic proportions, with high risk of death for the worldwide population. In this dramatic scenario, all the resources are addressed to the intensive care units for the assessment of the emergency. However, more attention should be paid with respect to the risk of viral diffusion among asymptomatic people. Italy is the second most involved country in the world, and we needed to gain a lot of experience in a very limited time. At least 1 m of distance among people is recommended; however, some clinical practices cannot allow this distance. In this context, we believe that the careful safety assessment of clinical settings, like ophthalmologic ones, may have a remarkable impact on the fight against SARS-CoV-2 spread.

INTRODUCTION Complications and challenges arising from the intraoperative double-stapling technique are seldom reported in colorectal surgery literature. Partial or full-thickness rectal injuries can occur during the introduction and the advancement of the circular stapler along the upper rectum. The aim of this study is to address some of these issues by designing and optimizing a "phantom" anvil manufactured to overcome difficulties throughout the rectal introduction and advancement of the circular stapler for the treatment of benign and malignant colon disease. METHODS The design of the "phantom" anvil has been performed using computer-aided modeling techniques, finite element investigations, and 2 essential keynotes in mind. The first one is the internal shape of the anvil, which is used for the connection to the gun. The second is the shape of the cap, which makes possible the insertion of the gun through the rectum. The "phantom" anvil has 2 functional requirements, which have been taken into account. The design has been optimized to avoid colorectal injuries, neoplastic dissemination (ie, mechanical seeding) and to reduce the fecal contamination. RESULTS Numerical simulations show that a right combination of both top and bottom fillet radii of the shape of the anvil can reduce the stress for the considered anatomic configuration of >90%. Both the fillet radii at the top and the bottom of the device influence the local stress of the colon rectum. CONCLUSIONS A dismountable device, which is used only for the insertion and advancement of the stapler, allows a dedicated design of its shape, keeping the remainder of the stapler unmodified. Computer-aided simulations are useful to perform numerical investigations to optimize the design of this auxiliary part for both the safety of the patient and the ease of the stapler advancement through the rectum.

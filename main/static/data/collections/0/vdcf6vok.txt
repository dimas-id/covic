Abstract Rubella virus was purified by chromatography on Sepharose 2B after concentration by ultrafiltration on hollow fibers and hydroextraction with PEG 20,000. Yields of 40% infectivity and 70% hemagglutinating activity were routinely obtained. Chromatographie purification was compared to ultracentrifugation in sucrose, metrizamide and sodium metrizoate. Yields were lower in sucrose and metrizamide, while sodium metrizoate reduced the infectivity of the virus below detectable levels. These results demonstrate the advantage of Sepharose 2B for the purification of infectious rubella virus.

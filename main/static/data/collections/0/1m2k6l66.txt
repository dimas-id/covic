We are honored to have been invited to write this piece entitled, "How to get the most out of your trainees in robotic thoracic surgery". Perhaps a better question is "How can we optimally coach and inspire each resident and/or fellow to maximize their value and potential as people, physicians and surgeons during the span of their career?". As surgeons, we must recognize some of the subtle differences in alignment between ourselves and our trainees, appreciate the value of the trainee within our profession, understand that there is variability to the coaching style that each trainee best responds to, and acknowledge that the success of the people we train-which may be our only true legacy-depends on how we engage and inspire them.

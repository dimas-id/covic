The Covid-19 pandemic has markedly changed our practices. This article analyses the risks of contamination among healthcare professionals (HCPs) during laparoscopic surgery on patients with Covid-19. Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum, with the virus present, have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.

A 22-year-old woman was involved in a motor vehicle collision resulting in multiple facial fractures and extensive internal carotid artery (ICA) injury including a right carotid-cavernous fistula, complex dissection flap and dissecting aneurysms. Endovascular coil embolization was initially performed to treat the cavernous carotid fistula and then again on two separate occasions to treat expanding dissecting aneurysms. Parent vessel reconstruction of the right ICA was subsequently performed with the Pipeline embolization device, resulting in complete anatomical restoration of this vessel.

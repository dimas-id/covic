Objective Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) has been reported to achieve lower recurrence rates, shorter recovery time, and less dyspareunia. However, as a pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery, LSC is problematic because it requires specific techniques and it takes a comparatively longer operative time. In this study, we present our surgical techniques of LSC and their effectiveness for shortening operative times and raising safety. Methods Thirty-four women with stage 2 or greater POP who underwent LSC in our hospital between September 2014 and October 2015 were enrolled in this study. The notable points of our operative procedures are as follows: (1) fixing the sigmoid colon to the left lateral abdominal wall for a clearer visualization of the sacral promontory, (2) making a retroperitoneal tunnel (not opening the peritoneum) from the sacral promontory to the Douglas pouch, (3) dissection of the vaginal wall after transvaginal hydrodissection, (4) fixation of mesh to the vaginal wall by using absorbable tacks, and (5) limiting usage of posterior mesh for the patients with posterior vaginal wall descent. Results The median operative time was 140 (range, 90-255) minutes, and blood loss was 50 (range, 10-1600) mL. The operative time decreased as the surgical techniques improved through experience. No major intra- or postoperative complications occurred. The mean follow-up period was 4 (range, 1 -14) months, and only one patient presented a recurrent grade 2 cystocele. Conclusion Our unique procedures will help shorten operative times and reduce complications of LSC.

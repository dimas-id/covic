OBJECTIVE Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a highly virulent atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus that resulted in a pandemic in 2003. Singapore was one of the most severely affected countries, and SARS took a heavy toll on our health care system. The lessons learned during the pandemic have shaped our national contagion response plan and have proved valuable in subsequent epidemics. We describe the lessons learned for the radiology department. CONCLUSION Our experience with SARS has shaped and changed our daily practice of radiology.

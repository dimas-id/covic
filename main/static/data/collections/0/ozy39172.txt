COVID-19 infection is associated with several cardiac complications with high rates of adverse outcomes. Cardiac imaging has different utility in different clinical scenarios, and the importance of minimizing healthcare worker exposure should be considered. Cardiac imaging should only be ordered if its benefits outweigh its risks, with anticipated changes in acute treatment and outcomes, and no suitable alternative of sufficient adequacy is available. Indications for advanced cardiac imaging for COVID-19 patients in the acute phase are limited, although follow-up imaging in the convalescent stage may provide prognostic importance in recovered COVID-19 patients with positive troponin or decompensated heart failure.

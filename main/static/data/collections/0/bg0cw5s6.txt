Background: The duration of viral shedding is central to guide decisions around isolation precautions and antiviral treatment. However, studies about risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the potential impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment remain scarce. Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had RT-PCR conversion at the NO.3 People's hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Results: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The median duration of viral shedding was shorter in the LPV/r treatment group (n=78) than that in no LPV/r treatment group (n=42) (median, 22 days vs. 28.5 days, p=0.02). Only earlier administration of LPV/r treatment (â‰¤10 days from symptom onset) could shorten the duration of viral shedding. Conclusions: Older age and lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding.

Abstract In this chapter the authors analyze the binding and dissociation kinetics (if applicable) of (1) interferon-gamma as a function of aptamer variants and inclusion of spacer, (2) GST-N protein in PBS and GST-N protein in 10-fold diluted serum to a localized surface plasmon resonance coupled fluorescence biosensor, (3) cytochrome c mutant to a superoxide biosensor, (4) Carbonic Anhydrase-II to an 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonamide ligand on an surface plasmon resonance biosensor surface, (5) glycerol secretion from differentiated (murine 3T3-L1) adipocytes to a microfluidic platform for fluorescence-based assay, and (6) different concentrations of C-reactive protein in solution to a sandwich-type assay using reflectometric interference spectroscopy (label-free detection method).

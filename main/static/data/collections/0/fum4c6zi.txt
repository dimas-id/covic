Objective CPP affects approximately 15% of women worldwide and has significant psychological, physical and financial impact on the lives of sufferers. Psychological interventions are often recommended as adjuncts to medical treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP). This is as women with CPP experience higher rates of mental health concerns and difficulties coping with their pain.. However, recent systematic reviews have highlighted that the efficacy of psychological interventions is not conclusive in this population. This review aimed to identify predictors of mental health outcomes and effective psychological techniques and interventions in women with CPP to inform the development of future psychological therapies. Methods Scoping review using the method outlined by Arskey & O'Malley (2005). Relevant databases, reference lists and grey literature were searched to identify effective mental health interventions and predictors of psychological outcomes for women with CPP. Results Methodological concerns made identifying predictors of mental health outcomes and effective psychological interventions difficult. However, ﻿cognitive ﻿behavioural ﻿therapy and Mensendieck therapy emerged as therapeutic interventions with the best evidence for women with CPP. A number of useful predictors of mental health outcomes and techniques included in effective interventions were identified. Conclusion The evidence provided in this review has the potential to inform future research directions and the development of targeted psychological interventions for women with CPP.

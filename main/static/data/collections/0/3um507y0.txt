In an epidemiological study of ferret coronaviruses (FRCoVs), novel FRCoV strains (Saitama-1 and Aichi-1) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis of partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these strains belonged to different clusters from other FRCoV strains. Next, the nucleotide sequence of the 3â€²-terminal region of Saitama-1 (8271 bases) strain was determined and compared with those of the other FRCoVs, indicating that the Saitama-1 strain differed from the previously reported MSU-1 and MSU-2 strains in the regions encoding spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid, and open reading frame 7b. Furthermore, the results of SimPlot analysis indicated that FRCoV (MSU-2 strain) emerged via a recombination event of S protein between the MSU-1 and Saitama-1 strains. This mechanism is similar to that responsible for the emergence of type II feline coronavirus. This information will be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of FRCoV in ferrets.

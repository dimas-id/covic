OBJECTIVES To compare conventional and advanced bipolar energy instruments in terms of perioperative outcomes inpatients who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 101 patients who underwent TLH between June 2017 and December 2018 for benigngynecological disorders were analyzed retrospectively. Conventional bipolar forceps (Robi forceps) were used in 37 patientsand advanced bipolar instruments (LigaSure) were used in 64 patients. Data about the characteristics of the patients, operationtime, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay and other perioperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS The mean ages of the patients in the conventional bipolar and LigaSure groups were 47.6 ± 6.5 and 48.1 ± 7 years,respectively (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to all otherpatient characteristics; body mass index, parity, previous pelvic operation and indications of hysterectomy (p > 0.05). Themean operation time (41 ± 13.2 vs 37 ± 11.5 min), estimated intraoperative blood loss (70 ± 22 vs 65 ± 21 mL) and absolutechange in hemoglobin (-1.23 ± 1.12 vs -1.11 ± 1.14 g/dL) were slightly higher in the conventional bipolar group. However,there was no statistical significance with respect to these differences between the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that a conventional bipolar system is as safe and effective as LigaSure, and it may beused as an alternative option for patients undergoing TLH in low-income hospitals.

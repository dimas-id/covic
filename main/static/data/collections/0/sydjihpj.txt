As more complex cases and larger uterine specimens are able to be managed with minimally invasive surgery, the limitations of tissue retrieval with these methods are of increasing concern. Risks of morcellator-related injury, tissue dissemination, or fragmentation must be weighed against increased morbidity of abdominal approach to hysterectomy. In an effort to mitigate the risks of tissue morcellation, containment system use must be considered when fragmenting a specimen, either with power morcellation or a manual technique via the vagina or minilaparotomy.

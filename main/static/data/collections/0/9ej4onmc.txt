BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become a popular bariatric procedure. The mechanisms responsible for weight loss and improvement of metabolic disturbances have still not been completely elucidated. We investigated the effect of SG on body weight, adipose tissue depots, glucose tolerance, and liver steatosis independent of reduced caloric intake in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. METHODS C57BI/6 J mice fed a high fat diet (45 %) for 33 weeks were divided into three groups: sleeve gastrectomy (SG, 13 mice), sham-operated ad libitum fed (SALF, 13 mice) and sham-operated pair fed (PFS, 13 mice). The animals were humanely killed 23 days after surgery. RESULTS In SG mice, food intake was reduced transiently, but weight loss was significant and persistent compared to controls (SG vs. PFS, P < 0.05; PFS vs. SALF, P < 0.05). SG mice showed improved glucose tolerance and lower levels of liver steatosis compared with controls (area under the curve, SG vs. PFS, P < 0.01; PFS vs. SALF, P < 0.05) (liver steatosis, SG vs. PFS, P < 0.05; PFS vs. SALF, P < 0.01). This was associated with a decrease in the ratios of the weight of pancreas, epididymal and inguinal adipose tissues to body weight, and an increase in the ratio of brown adipose tissue weight to body weight. Epididymal adipose tissue was also infiltrated by fewer activated T cells and by more anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. Serum levels of fasting acyl ghrelin were still significantly decreased 3 weeks after surgery in SG mice compared to PFS mice (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Reduced white adipose tissue inflammation, modification of adipose tissue development (brown vs. white adipose tissue), and ectopic fat are potential mechanisms that may account for the reduced caloric intake independent effects of SG.

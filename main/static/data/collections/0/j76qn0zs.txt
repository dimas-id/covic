BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, electroconvulsive therapy units have had to confront challenges such as the infectious hazard due to aerosol-generating ventilation, or the lack of staff and material resources. Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. METHODS: A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations’ guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. RESULTS: The protocol includes the following main areas: 1) ECT unit's structural and functional; 2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; 3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); 4) management of COVID-19 cases; and 5) protocol assessment. LIMITATIONS: The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT should continue to be advocated as an essential medical procedure. It is recommended that each ECT unit develop its own protocol. This proposal may be used as a reference.

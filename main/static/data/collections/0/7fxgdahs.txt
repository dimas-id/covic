INTRODUCTION The effectiveness of cancer screening programmes is highly dependent on screening uptake. Many interventions have been tested to increase screening uptake. AIM The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cancer screening pamphlets as a standalone intervention. The outcome of interest was uptake of cancer screening tests. METHODS A systematic review was performed on the effectiveness of pamphlets compared to usual care without pamphlets. We searched five databases for research papers in English from 2000 up to May 2019. Randomised controlled trials were included. This research group independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and then compared the information as a group. RESULTS A total of nine trials involving 4912 participants met our inclusion criteria, of which five were about colorectal cancer screening, three were about prostate cancer screening and one was about lung cancer screening. Five of the nine trials showed that pamphlets alone increased uptake significantly, while the remaining four trials did not show significant effects. DISCUSSION There is some evidence that pamphlets increase uptake for cancer screenings, especially for colorectal cancer. Due to the small number of studies in this area, generalisability could be limited.

Objective This integrative review identifies convergent and divergent areas of need for collecting and using patient-generated health data (PGHD) identified by patients and providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, and dietitians). Methods A systematic search of 9 scholarly databases targeted peer-reviewed studies published after 2010 that reported patients' and/or providers' needs for incorporating PGHD in clinical care. The studies were assessed for quality and bias with the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. The results section of each article was coded to themes inductively developed to categorize patient and provider needs. Distinct claims were extracted and areas of convergence and divergence identified. Results Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. All had moderate to low risk of bias. Three themes (clinical, logistic, and technological needs), and 13 subthemes emerged. Forty-eight claims were extracted. Four were divergent and twenty were convergent. The remainder was discussed by only patients or only providers. Conclusion As momentum gains for integrating PGHD into clinical care, this analysis of primary source data is critical to understanding the requirements of the 2 groups directly involved in collection and use of PGHD.

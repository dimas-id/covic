Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 virus is being intensively studied, particularly, its evolution in the increasingly available sequences between countries/continents with classical phylogenetic tree representation. More recently, certain protein mutations are correlated with specific functional impacts. Our clinical data from patients suggest different clinical symptoms between European countries. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 mutations could explain these disparities. Our analyses point out an association of diverse mutations, including co-evolving ones, in a few SARS-CoV-2 proteins, with specific countries. We therefore suggest combining clinical information from patients and the determination of the associated SARS-CoV-2 genome to better understand the specific symptoms.

PURPOSE Surgical outcome is influenced by multiple patient-specific factors and operative expertise of the surgeon. Clinical relevance of medical technical innovations often remains unclear even though laparoscopic surgical procedures are characterized by continual advancement of various devices. Lately, in dissection and sealing technology, fast-cutting ultrasonic scissors are combined with simultaneous bipolar coagulation (bimodal dissection device (BDD)). We investigated how this new technology, operative expertise, and patient-specific factors (body mass index, age) influence operation time in laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection. METHODS Between 2008 and 2016, 161 laparoscopic sigmoid resections (52% conventional dissection device (CDD); 48% BDD) performed in a single center were retrospectively evaluated. Biometric patient data, complication rates, and surgery duration, reflecting the learning curve, were analyzed. Operations were performed by experienced surgeons (n = 3) and trainees (n = 4). RESULTS Minor postoperative complications (e.g., impaired wound healing, non-revisional secondary bleeding) occurred in 11 cases (6.8%). Major complications (e.g., bleeding requiring revision, anastomotic leakage) were observed in 3.7%. No heat-related coagulation damage was observed. BDD reduced operation time for both experienced (CDD 150 min, BDD 125 min; p < 0.001) and trainee surgeons (CDD 169 min, BDD 135 min; p = 0.036). Reduction of operation time (indicative of a learning curve in progress) was observed for all surgeons. The curve was steeper using BDD. CONCLUSIONS Patient-specific factors did not have a significant effect on operation time. Even taking the learning curve into account, a combination of ultrasonic dissection and simultaneous bipolar coagulation reduces operation time of laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection, regardless of surgeon's expertise.

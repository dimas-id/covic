Abstract Poult Enteritis and Mortality Syndrome (PEMS) is a condition of yet undefined etiology. Affected flocks may exhibit 100% morbidity with mortality up to 50% or more between 2 to 4 wk of age. The current study reports the immune status of poults experimentally infected with PEMS agent(s) in various trials. When compared with the unchallenged controls, PEMS-infected poults had significant atrophy of the bursa (up to 2-fold), thymus (up to 11-fold), and spleen (up to 2-fold) (P < or = 0.05). When challenged with SRBC, PEMS-infected poults had 1 to 2 log2 lower anti-SRBC antibody titers than the controls (P < or = 0.05). Responsiveness to a mitogenic lectin, phytohemagglutinin-P, was reduced significantly in PEMS poults (P < or = 0.05). These data show that the immune system of the poults is compromised significantly during PEMS infection in terms of lymphoid organ integrity and humoral and cell-mediated immunity. These findings imply, therefore, that immune dysfunction may contribute to the mortality observed during PEMS outbreaks.

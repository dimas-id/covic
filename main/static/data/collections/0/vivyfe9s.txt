Emerging health risks, weapons of mass destruction, and terrorism – including biological weapons and bioterrorism – are identified in the 2008 White Paper on defence and national security as threats for France and its citizens. Since the beginning of the century, the 2001 anthrax attacks in the USA and subsequent hoaxes as well as the global SARS outbreak and influenza pandemic threats have all contributed to raise public awareness about health emergencies, leading authorities to adapt and improve planning for such events. This chapter focuses on natural and intentional public health threats and on biopreparedness from a French perspective, describing legal and organizational frameworks, plans and guidelines.

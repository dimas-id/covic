The purpose of this primer is to provide the clinical surgeon with a survey overview of the basic biochemistry of collagen and the methods and rationale of collagen cross-linking in the processing and preparation of bioprosthetics for surgical implantation. The author highlights the critical biologic factors, such as strength over time, integration, and rate, and type of remodeling, that are to an extent controllable by the cross-linking of collagen tissues so that clinicians may be better capable of understanding differences among the devices, which may be more applicable to their clinical indications.

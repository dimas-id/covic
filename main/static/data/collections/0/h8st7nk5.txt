This paper describes the technique of robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy. (RAMIE) Also, a systematic literature search was performed. Safety and feasibility of RAMIE was demonstrated in all reports. Short term oncologic results show radical resection rates of 77-100% and 18-43 lymph nodes harvested. RAMIE offers great visualization of the mediastinum and enables meticulous dissection in the mediastinum from diaphragm to thoracic inlet.

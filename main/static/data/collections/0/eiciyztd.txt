BACKGROUND Skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) is increasingly used in patients with breast cancer. We compared the differences between use of electrocautery and LigaSure™ Small Jaw in patients with breast cancer who underwent SSM. METHODS Between January 2012 and December 2015, 81 patients with breast cancer who underwent SSM were selected and were divided into the electrocautery group and the LigaSure™ Small Jaw group based on the devices that were used. Clinicopathological characteristics, body mass index, operative time, and weight of removed breast were obtained from medical records. Total amount and days of drain use, until removal, and postoperative skin necrosis, requiring debridement, were also analyzed. RESULTS The study population consisted of 50 patients in the electrocautery group and 31 in the LigaSure™ Small Jaw group. The latter group has significantly shorter operative time (117.5 ± 16.9 vs. 104.0 ± 23.6 min, P = 0.004). The mean total volume of drainage was less (805 ± 278 vs. 694 ± 131 mL, P = 0.017) and mean duration of drainage was also significantly shorter in the LigaSure™ Small Jaw group (11.3 ± 2.5 vs. 10.1 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS The use of LigaSure™ Small Jaw during skin-sparing mastectomy shortened the operative time and duration of drainage and reduced the total volume of drainage.

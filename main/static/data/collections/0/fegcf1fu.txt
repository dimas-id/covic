Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infection that can affect individuals of all ages. The description of determinants of immunopathogenesis in TB is of tremendous interest due to the perspective of finding a reliable host-directed therapy to reduce disease burden. The association between specific biomarker profiles related to inflammation and the diverse clinical disease presentations in TB has been extensively studied in adults. However, relatively scarce data on profiling the inflammatory responses in pediatric TB are available. Here, we employed the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) score adapted to plasma biomarkers in two distinct databanks from studies that examined either adults or children presenting with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. We used multidimensional statistical analyses to characterize the impact of age on the overall changes in the systemic inflammation profiles in subpopulation of TB patients. Our findings indicate that TB results in significant increases in molecular perturbation, with the highest values being detected in adult patients. Furthermore, there were unique differences in the biomarker perturbation patterns and the overall degree of inflammation according to disease site and age. Importantly, the molecular degree of perturbation was not influenced by sex. Our results revealed that aging is an important determinant of the differences in quality and magnitude of systemic inflammatory perturbation in distinct clinical forms of TB.

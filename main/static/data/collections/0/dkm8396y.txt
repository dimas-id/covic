It is clear that the risk for epidemics with high health and socio-economic impacts remains but there will be many unknowns at the start of future responses to these events. This article highlights principles and practices to assist health leaders in preparing for uncertainty, including integrating scalability to ensure response activities can be more easily adapted to suit evolving needs; assessing risk and capabilities to inform planning for appropriate response measures; and considering overall flexibility and adaptability of plans, systems, and resources. Ultimately, being prepared for “Disease X” is about applying the approaches that we have learned from previous events, using evidence-based practices to develop and strengthen foundational capacities, so that we are able to respond to the unanticipated in proportionate and appropriate ways.

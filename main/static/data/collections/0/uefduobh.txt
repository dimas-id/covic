Transanal, hybrid natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and NOTES-assisted natural orifice specimen extraction techniques hold promise as leaders in the field of natural orifice surgery. We report the feasibility of a novel NOTES assisted technique for unlimited length, clean, endolumenal proctocolectomy in a porcine model. This technique is a modification of a transanal intussusception and pull-through procedure recently published by our group. Rectal mobilization was achieved laparoscopically; this was followed by a transanal recto-rectal intussusception and pull-through (IPT). IPT was established in a stepwise fashion. First, the proximal margin of resection was attached laparoscopically to the shaft of the anvil of an end-to-end circular stapler with a ligature around the rectum. Second, this complex was pulled transanally to produce IPT. To achieve an unlimited-length proctocolectomy, the IPT step was repeated several times prior to bowel resection. This was facilitated by removing the ligature applied in the first step of this procedure. Once sequential IPT established the desired length of bowel to be resected, a second ligature was placed around the rectum approximating the proximal and distal resection margins. The specimen was resected and extracted by making a full-thickness incision through the 2 bowel walls. The anastomosis was achieved by deploying the stapler. The technique was found to be feasible. Peritoneal samples, collected after transanal specimen extraction, did not demonstrate bacterial growth. The minimally invasive nature of this evolving technique as well as its aseptic bowel manipulation has the potential to limit the complications associated with abdominal wall incision and surgical site infection.

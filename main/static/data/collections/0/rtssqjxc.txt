Objective@#To analyze the clinical data of 153 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in chongqing ,and provide reference and thinking for the diagnosis and treatment.@*Methods@#Analyze the clinical data, laboratory examination and chest imaging characteristics of 153 COVID-19 patients in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from January 26 to February 5, 2020. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria ,patients were divided into non-severe group(n=132) and severe group(n=21),and analyze the correlation between serum index changes and disease severity.@*Results@#Combined with diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, the severity of the disease was statistically significant (&#x03C7;2=11.04和6.94, P&lt;0.05). No symptoms were found in patients with mild illness (&#x03C7;2=4.09, P&lt;0.05) .The proportion of fever and muscle soreness in the severe group was higher than that in the non-severe group (&#x03C7;2=4.40 and 22.67,P&lt;0.05).Among the concomitant symptoms, the proportion of cough and shortness of breath in the severe group was higher than that in the non-severe group (&#x03C7;2=8.46 and 4.80,P&lt;0.05).C-reactive protein and d-dimer were higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (t=43.44 and 37.13, P&lt;0.05), and the number of CD3+T lymphocyte cells, CD4+T lymphocyte cells and CD8+T lymphocyte cells in the severe group was lower than that in the non-severe group (Z=27.25, 20.60 and 17.36, P&lt;0.05).Compared with the non-severe group, both lungs and the right lung lower lobe were more susceptible to involved (&#x03C7;2=6.95和20.39, P&lt;0.05) .@*Conclusion@#Severity of COVID-19 was associated with underlying disease, symptoms, site of involvement, C-reactive protein, d-dimer, CD3+T lymphocyte count, CD4+T lymphocyte count, and CD8+T lymphocyte count.

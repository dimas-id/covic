Abstract We report two confirmed cases of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) associated with infection of the human bocavirus (HBoV). In one case HBoV was identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during an acute exacerbation as well as post mortem in different tissues giving raise to the hypothesis that HBoV infections trigger UIP or could be a causative agent and be a systemic component in UIP. In the other case, the UIP was confirmed by radiological methods and HBoV was detected in the BAL during an acute exacerbation. Both cases give raise to the hypothesis that HBoV could be a causative agent of UIP or could contribute to its development and/or acute exacerbations.

Since the very first days of announcing Covid 19 as a global pandemic, researchers around the world from different backgrounds and organizations including national governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) have extensively begun using Modeling and Simulation (M&S) techniques in deciding on the optimal strategies in order to mitigate the public health and economical effects of Covid-19. In this paper, we present our results from applying M&S on the city of Casablanca, Morocco to comprehend (i): How it can be relatively easy or difficult for such pandemic to penetrate to the studied region (country, city, district, etc.). (ii): How it can spread relatively fast or slow within that region. And finally (iii): What is the optimal strategy for containing and mitigating the propagation of the disease while still keeping the economy as near to normal as possible.

This case report describes a case of concomitant ovarian drilling and retrieval of oocytes using laparoendoscopic single-site surgery and the resultant birth of a healthy infant after transfer of frozen-thawed blastocyst from in vitro matured oocyte in a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome. A 33-year-old woman presented with anovulatory, clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome, and 1-year history of infertility. Thirty-seven immature oocytes were retrieved and multiperforation of ovaries was performed at the same time by laparoendoscopic single-site surgery. Twenty-three oocytes reached metaphase II after 24-h culture in in vitro maturation medium, which was followed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Eventually, seven embryos were vitrified and spontaneous ovulation was restored after the operation. Although the first single frozen-thawed blastocyst transferred in a natural cycle ended up a biochemical pregnancy, the second frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer resulted in successful pregnancy, followed by live birth of a healthy male infant.

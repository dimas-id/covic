Coronaviruses contain a small envelope membrane protein with cation-selective ion channel activity mediated by its transmembrane domain (ETM). In a computational study, we proposed that ion channel activity can be explained by either of two similar ETM homopentameric transmembrane α-helical bundles, related by a ∼50° rotation of the helices. Later, we tested this prediction, using site-specific infrared dichroism of a lysine-flanked isotopically labeled ETM peptide from the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, reconstituted in lipid bilayers. However, the data were consistent with the presence of a kink at the center of the ETM α-helix, and it did not fit completely either computational model. Herein, we have used native ETM, without flanking lysines, and show that the helix orientation is now consistent with one of the predicted models. ETM only produced one oligomeric form, pentamers, in the lipid-mimic detergent dodecylphosphocholine and in perfluorooctanoic acid. We thus report the correct backbone model for the pentameric α-helical bundle of ETM. The disruptive effects caused by terminal lysines probably highlight the conformational flexibility required during ion channel function.

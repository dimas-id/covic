LaSer, the formal language server, allows a user to enter a question about an independent language and provides an answer either in real time or by generating a program that can be executed at the userâ€™s site. Typical examples of independent languages are codes in the classic sense, such as prefix codes and error-detecting languages, or DNA-computing related codes. Typical questions about independent languages are the satisfaction, maximality and construction questions. We present some theoretical and implementational aspects of LaSer, as well as some ongoing progress and research plans.

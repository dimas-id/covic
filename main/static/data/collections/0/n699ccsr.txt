Thoracic trauma severity score (TTSS) has been used to assess severity and risk of pulmonary complications in patients with chest trauma. The role of cytokines and biomarkers in patients with chest trauma and its association with TTSS is not well elucidated. The aim of the study was to assess the cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α) and biomarkers (vWF, CC-16) in patients of thoracic trauma and correlate it with TTSS and patient’s outcome. This was a prospective observational study. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected from chest trauma patients. TTSS was calculated in all patients. Suitable controls for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample were selected. The outcome parameters included patient discharge or death, duration of hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Forty-three patients were included. There was no significant correlation between the measured cytokines and biomarkers and TTSS. The mean TTSS of patients who had a fatal outcome was significantly higher than the patients who recovered. Patients with a high TTSS score had a significant prolonged ICU stay. Patients with a prolonged hospital stay had lower values of CC-16. TTSS is a useful tool to predict severity of chest trauma and prolonged ICU stay. Lower levels of CC-16 in BAL fluid of chest trauma patients were associated with prolonged hospital stay suggestive of its protective role in the airway. Longer prospective studies are required to determine the role of cytokines and biomarkers in patients with thoracic trauma in predicting the patient’s outcome.

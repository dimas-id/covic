BACKGROUND The ideal tidal volume (TV) during one-lung ventilation (OLV) remains controversial. High TVs may increase the incidence of postoperative lung injury after thoracic surgery. There is nonetheless little evidence that the use of low TV during OLV will fail to provide adequate arterial oxygenation. We evaluated the influence of low (5 mL/kg-1) and high (10 mL/kg-1) TV on arterial oxygenation during one-lung ventilation in clinical conditions. METHODS A hundred patients scheduled for lung surgery were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to either 30 minutes of one-lung ventilation with a TV of 10 mL/kg-1 at a rate of 10 breaths/minute (Group 10, N.=50) or a TV of 5 mL/kg-1 with 5 cmH2O PEEP at a rate of 20 breaths/minute (Group 5, N.=50). According to the rules of crossover design during the subsequent 30 minutes, each patient received the alternative management. Arterial blood partial pressures, hemodynamic responses, and ventilatory parameters were recorded. Results are presented as means ± SDs; P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS PaO2 was unaffected by TV (10 mL/kg-1: 218±106 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 211±119 mmHg, P=0.29). Calculated intrapulmonary shunt fraction was also similar with each TV during OLV (5 mL/kg-1: 25±9% versus 10 mL/kg-1: 24±8%, p=0.14). In contrast, low TV significantly increased PaCO2 (10 mL/kg-1: 39±6 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 44±8 mmHg, P<0.001). There were significant differences both in peak (10 mL/kg-1: 27±6 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 21±5 cmH2O, P<0.001) and plateau airway pressure values (10 mL/kg-1: 22±6 versus 5 mL/kg-1: 18±5 cmH2O, P<0.001) during OLV. CONCLUSION Low TV (5 mL/kg-1) accompanied by 5 cmH2O PEEP provides comparable arterial oxygenation and intrapulmonary shunt fraction during one-lung ventilation as higher TV (10 mL/kg-1) without PEEP.

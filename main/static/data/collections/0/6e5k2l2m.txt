We have investigated the intracellular localization of proteolytic cleavage products encoded in the 5' portion of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 1. Immunofluorescent labeling of cells with an antiserum which recognizes p28, the ORF1a N-terminal cleavage product, resulted in widespread somewhat granular cytoplasmic staining, indicating that this protein is widely distributed in the cytoplasm of MHV-infected, but not control uninfected cells. Immunofluorescent staining of infected cells with antisera which recognize the downstream polypeptides, p65, p240 and p290 labeled discrete vesicular perinuclear structures. Double immunofluorescent labeling of BHK cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK(MHVR1)) and infected with MHV-A59 with a Golgi-specific anti-mannosidase II monoclonal antibody and with antiserum recognizing each of these anti-MHV ORF1a polypeptides, showed that the p240 and p290 polypeptides were localized in discrete vesicular structures that overlapped the Golgi complex. Labeling with antibodies specific for p65 colocalized with the Golgi region, and showed staining of the perinuclear cytoplasm as well. Plasmids containing sequences contained in the first 6.75 kb of ORF1a have been expressed using the coupled vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase system. Immunofluorescent labeling of transfectants with the anti-ORF1a antisera showed patterns of antigen distribution similar to those observed in cells infected with MHV-A59. A deletion analysis with constructs containing only portions of the ORF1a sequence indicated that 303 amino acids containing the first papain-like protease domain (PLP-1) was sufficient to associate this protein with the Golgi.

At present, bioactive glasses (BAGs) are demonstrating promising results in the remineralization of hard tissues. Their bioactive properties can potentially overcome the demineralization effect accompanying orthodontic treatment. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of bioactive glass enhanced orthodontic bonding resins on enamel remineralization, in addition to their antibacterial, ion release and acid neutralization effect. Four databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched. Two hundred and fifty-one full-text articles were screened independently, out of which seven studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Quality appraisal was performed by two independent reviewers. Methodologies used to assess the anti-demineralization effect included Micro-Computed Tomography, Polarized Light Microscopy and Hardness Testing (Knoop and Berkovich). All seven articles confirmed the superior remineralization effect of BAG orthodontic bonding resins compared to their non-BAG counterparts. A proportional relationship was proved between BAG concentrations and increased anti-demineralization effect. The addition of antibacterial agents to BAG does not necessarily improve its anti-demineralization effect. Although studies have confirmed the effectiveness of BAG orthodontic bonding resins on enamel remineralization, there was a degree of heterogeneity across studies due to the lack of an in vitro studies standardized protocol.

Abstract Recent developments in the South China Sea (SCS) and the actions expected to be taken by China and member states of ASEAN in accordance with the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the SCS have the potential to further marginalize Taiwan's role in any serious discussion on SCS issues and then deprive Taiwan of its legitimate rights and interest in the area. These developments will also force Taiwan to respond by taking more active actions for the sole purpose of safeguarding its sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction in the SCS. This article discusses a number of possible confidence-building measures that could be considered for adoption by China to help engage Taiwan in the regional security dialogue process and enable Taiwan to participate in the planned joint co-operative activities in the SCS. The co-operative actions taken in the SCS area could enhance mutual trust between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.

Abstract The somatic cell hybridization technique for gene mapping depends on assembling panels of rodent-human hybrid clones containing random subsets of the human chromosomes. Such panels should be as informative as possible and permit error detection and error correction for assays of the human gene in the various clones. We derive estimates of the number of randomly generated clones required to be reasonably confident of accurately and unambiguously assigning a gene to a particular human chromosome. The collection of clones in such a random panel is contrasted with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. To approximate minimal panels we suggest the method of simulated annealing for selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones. These theoretical insights emphasize the need for more collaboration and coordination among gene mapping groups so that optimal clone panels can be assembled, stored, and distributed.

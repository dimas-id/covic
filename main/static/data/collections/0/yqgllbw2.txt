This paper provides an overview of the electric vehicle transition in the UK. The spatial disparity in the uptake of BEVs across the different regions is analysed using historic BEV sales. A forecast for future growth in BEVs (ignoring the impact of Covid-19) is performed using an s-curve model. Currently, South East England and Greater London have the highest BEV sales as a percentage of new vehicle sales. The spatial distribution of EV chargers across the different regions is also analysed. The spatial analysis clearly shows the regional disparity in the uptake of EV. South East England has the highest number of public chargers excluding Greater London. However, if we consider the number of EVs in that region, it has the second-lowest ratio of approx. 1 charger per 10 BEV. The lowest ratio being 0.8 in the West Midlands.

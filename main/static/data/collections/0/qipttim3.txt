Over the past 6 months, coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19) has spread across 212 countries, affecting millions of people. As it has no known cure, social distancing is highly recommended for prevention of spread of the disease. Here, we have described the impact of the social distancing measures implemented by the Government of India on various sections of the society, especially the vulnerable sections. Furthermore, we have presented an analysis of these measures, according to the World Health Organization´s Guidance for Managing Ethical Issues in Infectious Disease Outbreaks (2016); we have also applied principles, as applicable, from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants (2017). Finally, we have presented several measures that should have been adopted before and in addition to implementing the lockdown to improve its effectiveness.

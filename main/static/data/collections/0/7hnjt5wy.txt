We report the case of a 15-year-old male patient presenting frontal headaches with retro-orbital pain accompanied by fever evolving to weakness and pain of the lower limbs, which ascended to upper limbs. A COVID-19 rapid test (IgG and IgM) and nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The blood tests, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis and CSF aerobic culture revealed no abnormalities. PCR testing of the CSF was negative for the most prevalent etiologies as well as for SARS-CoV-2. Electroneurography study was compatible with the acute motor axonal neuropathy variant of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. No cases involving young patients have been presented to date. Therefore, this is the first reported pediatric case of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with GBS. Evidence reveals that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to the respiratory tract. Neurotropism could explain this important neurologic manifestation of COVID-19 in children.

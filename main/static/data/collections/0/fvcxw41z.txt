BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Recently, the use of stents to assist in the coiling and repair of wide-neck aneurysms has been shown to be highly effective; however, the effect of these stents on the RC of the parent vessel has not been quantified. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of intracranial stenting on the RC of the implanted artery using 3D datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients receiving FDA-approved neurovascular stents to support coil embolization of brain aneurysms were chosen for this study. The stents were located in the ICA, ACA, or MCA. We analyzed C-arm rotational angiography and contrast-enhanced cone beam CT datasets before and after stent implantation, respectively, to ascertain changes in vessel curvature. The images were reconstructed, and the vessel centerline was extracted. From the centerline, the RC was calculated. RESULTS The average implanted stent length was 25.4 ± 5.8 mm, with a pre-implantation RC of 7.1 ± 2.1 mm and a postimplantation RC of 10.7 ± 3.5 mm. This resulted in a 3.6 ± 2.7 mm change in the RC due to implantation (P < .0001), more than a 50% increase from the pre-implantation value. There was no difference in the change of RC for the different locations studied. The change in RC was not impacted by the extent of coil packing within the aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS The implantation of neurovascular stents can be shown to have a large impact on the RC of the vessel. This will lead to a change in the local hemodynamics and flow pattern within the aneurysm.

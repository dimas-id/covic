Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition supposedly increases the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, serving as a binding site for SARS-CoV-2. Concerns arose regarding therapy with RAS inhibition during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pharmacological restraining the classical RAS axis might be beneficial due to the reduction of deleterious effects of angiotensin II and enhancement of the anti-inflammatory angiotensin 1-7 pathway. Unless large controlled studies are performed, RAS inhibition remains the cornerstone therapy in populations with cardiovascular disorders.

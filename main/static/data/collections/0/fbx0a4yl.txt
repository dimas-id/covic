Numerous human studies and animal models have implicated various infectious agents in the pathogenesis of vasculitis in susceptible hosts. However, the link between infection and vasculitis is very complex and only incompletely understood. In fact, different agents can induce the same type of vasculitis, as the case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis exemplifies. Conversely, the same agent can give rise to a panoply of host responses ranging from a clinically silent infection or localized organ involvement to devastating, widespread vasculitis.

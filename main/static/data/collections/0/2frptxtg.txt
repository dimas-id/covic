Monoclonal antibodies specific to 22, 67 and 135 kDa proteins of yellow-head virus (YHV) were produced from a mouse immunized with partially purified YHV isolated from the haemolymph of experimentally YHV-infected Penaeus monodon. Four groups of monoclonal antibodies were identified. One group of antibodies bound only to native protein of YHV while the others were specific to 135, 67 and 22 kDa proteins in both native and denatured forms. All antibodies could be used to detect YHV infection by means of dot blot and immunohistochemistry. However, antibodies specific to the 22 kDa protein gave the best immunohistochemistry results in terms of intensity and sharpness of staining.

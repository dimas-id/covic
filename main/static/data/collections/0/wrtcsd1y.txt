An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in which the antigen is captured to the plate by monoclonal antibodies (MACELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The viral antigen was semipurified from TGEV-infected cells by simple ultracentrifugation. MACELISA results with 258 field sera were compared with those of a standard indirect ELISA and with the virus neutralization test (VNT). Sensitivity, specificity, and kappa values of MACELISA indicated a strong correlation with VNT results, whereas an indirect ELISA was less sensitive and much less specific than VNT. The serologic response of 4 pigs orally inoculated and intraperitoneally boostered with TGEV was compared using the 3 tests. Its sensitivity, specificity, and ability to use unpurified antigen make the MACELISA the advisable first step in TGEV serodiagnosis.

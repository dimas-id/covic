The aim of this study was to identify the differences in the expression of cell adhesion molecule-related mRNAs between symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and a control group, and to investigate the interactions among activated leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells. Whole human gene chip was applied to detect the expression of cell adhesion molecule-related mRNAs in symptomatic PE and in the control group, and statistical analysis was performed. In patients with PE, the expression of the majority of integrin mRNAs located on leukocytes and platelets was significantly upregulated. The expression of mRNAs related to L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand was significantly upregulated, while the expression of mRNA related to E-selectin was significantly downregulated. The expression of mRNAs related to classic cadherins and protocadherins was downregulated, and the expression of mRNAs related to vascular endothelial cadherin was significantly downregulated; the expression of mRNAs related to the immunoglobulin superfamily had no obvious difference between the 2 groups. In conclusion, we demonstrated that, in symptomatic PE patients, the adhesion of leukocytes and platelets was enhanced; the activation of endothelial cells was obviously weakened; the adherens junctions among endothelial cells were weakened, with the endothelium becoming more permeable.

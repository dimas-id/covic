With the development of newer meshes and approaches to hernia repair, it is currently difficult to evaluate their performances while considering the patients' perspective. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical outcomes and quality of life consequences of abdominal hernia repairs performed in Italy using Phasix and Phasix ST meshes through the analysis of real-world data to support the choice of new generation biosynthetic meshes. An observational, prospective, multicentre study was conducted in 10 Italian clinical centres from May 2015 to February 2018 and in 15 Italian clinical centres from March 2018 to May 2019. The evaluation focused on patients with VHWG grade II-III who underwent primary ventral hernia repair or incisional hernia intervention with a follow-up of at least 18 months. Primary endpoints included complications' rates, and secondary outcomes focused on patient quality of life as measured by the EuroQol questionnaire. Seventy-five patients were analysed. The main complications were: 1.3% infected mesh removal, 4.0% superficial infection requiring procedural intervention, 0% deep/organ infection, 8.0% recurrence, 5.3% reintervention, and 6.7% drained seroma. The mean quality of life utility values ranged from 0.768 (baseline) to 0.967 (36 months). To date, Phasix meshes have proven to be suitable prostheses in preventing recurrence, with promising outcomes in terms of early and late complications and in improving patient quality of life.

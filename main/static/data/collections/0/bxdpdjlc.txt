The study reported that expression of misfolded proteins in the ER affects the composition and stability of the dislocation machinery built around the HRD1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the absence of UPR induction. During efforts to extend this work, the authors have been unable to replicate some of the results obtained by the first author of the paper, which describe the mechanisms regulating the rapid turnover of HERP and how the presence of misfolded proteins affects the composition and the stability of the HRD1 complex. The authors therefore wish to immediately retract the paper. The authorsâ€™ lab continues working on the regulation of the ERAD machinery aiming to publish verified data in t52/6he near future. The authors sincerely apologize for any difficulties that may have been experienced by the scientific community. The first author, R.B., declined to sign the retraction notice.

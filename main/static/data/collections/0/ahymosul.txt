OBJECTIVES Before cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation, cardiac computed tomography (CT) can provide assessment of cardiac venous anatomy and visualize left ventricular (LV) myocardial scar. We hypothesized that localization and burden of transmural myocardial scar verified by cardiac CT are associated with echocardiographic and clinical response to CRT. METHODS We prospectively included 140 CRT recipients undergoing preimplant cardiac CT. We assessed transmural scar, defined as hypoperfusion involving more than one-half of the myocardial wall in each LV segment using a 17-segment model. Echocardiographic nonresponse was defined as less than 5% absolute improvement in LV ejection fraction at 6 months' follow-up. Clinical nonresponse was defined as 1 or more of the following at 6 months' follow-up: death, heart failure hospitalization, or no improvement in New York Heart Association class and less than 10% increase in 6-minute walk-test distance. RESULTS Higher burden of myocardial scar was associated with echocardiographic nonresponse (adjusted odds ratio, 3.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-8.91; P = 0.045). Scar concordant or adjacent to LV pacing site was associated with echocardiographic nonresponse (adjusted odds ratio, 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-44.27; P = 0.015). No association between scar and clinical nonresponse was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS Higher scar burden and scar in proximity to the LV pacing site assessed by cardiac CT are associated with echocardiographic nonresponse to CRT. Burden and location of scar were not associated with clinical nonresponse. Further large-scale studies are needed to assess the potential association between myocardial scar detected by cardiac CT and clinical CRT outcome.

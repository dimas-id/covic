A novel electrochemical magnetoimmunosensor for fast and ultrasensitive detection of H9N2 avian influenza virus particles (H9N2 AIV) was designed based on the combination of high-efficiency immunomagnetic separation, enzyme catalytic amplification, and the biotin-streptavidin system. The reusable, homemade magneto Au electrode (M-AuE) was designed and used for the direct sensing. Immunocomplex-coated magnetic beads (IMBs) were easily accumulated on the surface of the M-AuE to obtain the catalytically reduced electrochemical signal of H2 O2 after the immunoreaction. The transducer was regenerated through a simple washing procedure, which made it possible to detect all the samples on a single electrode with higher reproducibility. The magnetic-bead-based electrochemical immunosensor showed better analytical performance than the planar-electrode-based immunosensor with the same sandwich construction. Amounts as low as 10 pg mL(-1) H9N2 AIV could be detected even in samples of chicken dung. This electrochemical magnetoimmunosensor not only provides a simple platform for the detection of the virus with high sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility but also shows great potential in the early diagnosis of diseases.

BACKGROUND Fluid overload leading to pulmonary congestion is an important issue in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This study aimed to determine if a simplified method of extravascular lung water assessment using ultrasound provided clinically relevant information. METHODS This prospective study recruited 47 patients from a single hemodialysis center. Pulmonary ultrasound was performed before and after 2 hemodialysis sessions in 28 regions on the thorax. The B-line score was defined as the percentage regions where B-lines were present. RESULTS When B-lines were detected before hemodialysis, a significant relationship was found between fluid removal and the change in B-line score. Patients with a B-line score of â‰¥21.4% (4th quartile) after the second hemodialysis session were more likely to be hospitalized for pulmonary edema or acute coronary syndrome. CONCLUSIONS A simplified pulmonary assessment using ultrasound provides relevant information about pulmonary congestion in hemodialysis patients and identifies patients at risk of hospitalization for heart-related problems.

We present a novel approach for enumerating partial models of a propositional formula, inspired by how theory solvers and the SAT solver interact in lazy SMT. Using various forms of dual reasoning allows our CDCL-based algorithm to enumerate partial models with no need for exploring and shrinking full models. Our focus is on model enumeration without repetition, with potential applications in weighted model counting and weighted model integration for probabilistic inference over Boolean and hybrid domains. Chronological backtracking renders the use of blocking clauses obsolete. We provide a formalization and examples. We further discuss important design choices for a future implementation related to the strength of dual reasoning, including unit propagation, using SAT or QBF oracles.

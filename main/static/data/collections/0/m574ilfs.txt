OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical findings, surgical treatment, and long-term outcome of dairy cattle undergoing partial hysterectomy with or without unilateral ovariectomy. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dairy cattle (n = 7). METHODS Medical records (June 2007-June 2014) of dairy cattle that had partial hysterectomy with or without ipsilateral ovariectomy were reviewed. Follow-up data were obtained by telephone interviews with owners and referring veterinarians between 6 months and 7 years following discharge. RESULTS Seven dairy cattle met the inclusion criteria. Diagnoses made intra- or postoperatively were ovarian abscess with multiorgan adhesions (4 cows), segmental aplasia of the uterus (2 cows), and uterine lymphosarcoma (1 cow). Partial hysterectomy with or without unilateral ovariectomy was performed without surgical complications by standing flank approach. All cows were successfully discharged from the hospital (short-term prognosis). Five cows became pregnant, and 4 delivered live calves and had a satisfactory productive life without long-term complications. CONCLUSION Partial hysterectomy by standing flank approach should be considered as a viable treatment option for unilateral ovarian or uterine problems in dairy cattle. Cattle undergoing partial hysterectomy with or without ipsilateral ovariectomy are capable of satisfactory reproduction and milk production after surgery with no short- or long-term complications.

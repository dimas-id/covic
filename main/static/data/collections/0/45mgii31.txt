Background The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for innovation in cost-effective and easily produced surgical simulations for trainee education that are not limited by physical confines of location. This can be accomplished with the use of desktop three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. This study describes the creation of a low-cost and open-access simulation for anatomical learning and pedicle screw placement in the lumbar spine, which is termed the SpineBox. Materials and methods An anonymized CT scan of the lumbar spine was obtained and converted into 3D software files of the L1-L5 vertebral bodies. A computer-assisted design (CAD) software was used to assemble the vertebral models into a simulator unit in anatomical order to produce an easily prototyped simulator. The printed simulator was layered with foam in order to replicate soft tissue structures. The models were instrumented with pedicle screws using standard operative technique and examined under fluoroscopy. Results Ten SpineBoxes were created using a single desktop 3D printer, with accurate replication of the cortico-cancellous interface using previously validated techniques. The models were able to be instrumented with pedicle screws successfully and demonstrated quality representation of bony structures under fluoroscopy. The total cost of model production was under $10. Conclusion The SpineBox represents the first open-access simulator for the instruction of spinal anatomy and pedicle screw placement. This study aims to provide institutions across the world with an economical and feasible means of spine surgical simulation for neurosurgical trainees and to encourage other rapid prototyping laboratories to investigate innovative means of creating educational surgical platforms in the modern era.

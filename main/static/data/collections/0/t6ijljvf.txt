Childhood obesity and associated modifiable risk factors exert significant burden on the health care system. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effectiveness of school-based intervention types perceived by Canadian stakeholders in health and education as feasible, acceptable and sustainable in terms of improving physical activity (PA), fruit and vegetable intake, and body weight. We searched multiple databases for studies that evaluated school-based interventions to prevent obesity and associated risk factors (i.e., unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour) in children aged 4-18 years from January 1, 2012 to January 28, 2020. From 10,871 identified records, we included 83 and 80 studies in our systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Comprehensive School Health (CSH) and interventions which focused on modifications to school nutrition policies showed statistically significant positive effects on fruit intake of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.23) and 0.30 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.51) servings per day, respectively. No intervention types showed statistically significant effect on vegetable intake. CSH, modifications to physical education (PE) curriculum, and multicomponent interventions showed statistically significant difference in BMI of -0.26 (95% CI: -0.40, -0.12), -0.16 (95% CI: -0.3, -0.02), and -0.18 (95% CI: -0.29, -0.07), respectively. CSH interventions showed positive effect on step-count per day, but no other types of interventions showed significant effect on any of PA outcome measures. Thus, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that decision-makers should carefully consider CSH, multicomponent interventions, modifications to PE curricula and school nutrition policies to prevent childhood obesity.

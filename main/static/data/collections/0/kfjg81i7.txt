Deleuze|Guattari’s philosophical oeuvre has become increasingly known in East Asia as scholars recognize their importance for virtually all disciplines. In this chapter, I try to show why representational thought, which they overturn, continues to retain its force over us. By introducing concepts, which they developed, such as simulacrum, powers of the false, the event, and affect, I make the attempt to show how non-representational thought can be understood within visual art and media. Lastly, when West-East Meet, there is an attempt on my part to show the relationship between Taoist understanding of chaos and Deleuze|Guattari’s use of the transcendental plane to grasp the genesis of creativity proper.

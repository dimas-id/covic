OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence, risk factors and natural history of respiratory inhibition after crying (RIAC) and feeding hypoxemia. METHODS We screened for RIAC and feeding hypoxemia among 393 infants with a gestational age â‰¥ 36 weeks using pulse oximetry. Twenty-seven infants were treated in the neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS RIAC and feeding hypoxemia were observed in 95 (24.2%) and 124 (31.6%) infants, respectively. RIAC correlated with feeding hypoxemia (p < 0.001), grade II increased echogenicity in the ganglionic eminence (p = 0.005), dilation of the lateral ventricle (p = 0.044), threatened premature labor (p = 0.033) and twin gestation (p = 0.089). Feeding hypoxemia correlated with RIAC (p < 0.001), abnormal cranial ultrasound findings (p < 0.001), maternal smoking during pregnancy (p = 0.083), asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (p = 0.012) and twin gestation (p = 0.067). All infants recovered from RIAC in an average of 4.5 (2.0-7.0) d. Fifteen infants recovered from feeding hypoxemia, but 10 infants needed additional assistance and monitoring by nursing until the day of discharge. The day of discharge was day 8.0 (5.0-12.4). CONCLUSIONS RIAC and feeding hypoxemia are observed among healthy infants, and these infants experience repeated events of prolonged hypoxemia.

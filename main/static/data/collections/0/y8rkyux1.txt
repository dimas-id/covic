One hundred and twelve preschool teachers in Indiana were asked to complete a questionnaire requesting them to indicate what personal health-related activities they were incorporating into their classroom routines, why they were incorporating them, and how often such activities were done. The results of the study indicate that the most incorporated activities were hand-washing, proper ways of coughing, and discussion on germs. The least incorporated personal health-related activities were proper use of bathroom and keeping things out of the mouth. Reasons for incorporating the activities include helping to curtail the spreading of colds and germs, helping the children to develop good life skills later in life, and helping the preschoolers know about the health hazards associated with germs, among others. The study recommends the need to make Health Education a core component of preschool teachersâ€™ training.

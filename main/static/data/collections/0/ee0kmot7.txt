As advances occur in surgical technique, postoperative care, and immunosuppressive therapy, the rate of mortality in the early postoperative period following lung transplantation continues to decline. With the improvements in immediate and early posttransplant mortality, infections and their sequel as well as rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction are increasingly a major cause of posttransplant mortality. This chapter will focus on infections by respiratory viruses and other viral infections relevant to lung transplantation, including data regarding the link between viral infections and allograft dysfunction.

Blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate the development and improvement of cross-organizational business processes. When it comes to developing systems relying on blockchain having this purpose, model-driven engineering is a promising approach that has been adopted by a number of solutions. This paper presents B-MERODE, a novel approach relying on model-driven engineering and artifact-centric business processes to generate blockchain-based information systems supporting cross-organizational collaborations. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by modeling the case of a rice supply chain. Compared to other solutions, B-MERODE provides more flexibility, more reusability and further leverages the automation potential offered by model-driven engineering.

Abstract Just after World War II, more than 10,000 malaria cases per year were reported in Japan, including indigenous, imported and induced malaria. Malaria has been successfully eradicated since 1961 in Japan and now only imported malaria cases are encountered. However, as the number of Japanese people who are going abroad and also the number of foreigners who are visiting Japan increases (about 16 and 5 millions, respectively, in 2001), so does the chance for Japanese doctors to see imported malaria or transfusion-transmitted malaria cases. In fact, the total number of the patients with acute malaria in Japan has been around 100â€“150 annually for the last 10 years. Of those, about 75% are Japanese and 25% are foreigners, and about 75% are male and 25% are female. The peak age is in the 20s. Recently, about 45% of patients are Plasmodium falciparum and another 45% Plasmodium vivax infections. The former species is likely to be seen in travelers coming back from African countries and the latter is mainly from Asian countries. The important issue is that patients in Japan have not been diagnosed promptly nor treated properly because doctors in Japan are no longer familiar with tropical medicine. Therefore, some patients are dying from severe malaria as a consequence. As it is, most of the effective medicines for drug-resistant malaria or severe malaria have not been registered in Japan. There is now a need for medical practitioners to focus on travel medicine in Japan.

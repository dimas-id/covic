BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In this single-institution study, we aimed to compare the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy (SILSS) with multiport laparoscopic sigmoidectomy (MLS) for recurrent diverticulitis. METHODS Between October 2011 and February 2013, 60 sigmoidectomies were performed by the same surgeon. Forty patients had a MLS and 20 patients had a SILSS. Outcomes were compared. RESULTS Patient characteristics were similar. There was no difference in morbidity, mortality or readmission rates. The mean operative time was longer in the SILSS group (P=.0012). In a larger proportion of patients from the SILSS group, 2 linear staplers were needed for transection at the rectum (P=.006). The total cost of disposable items was higher in the SILSS group (P<.0001). No additional ports were placed in the SILSS group. Return to bowel function or return to oral intake was faster in the SILSS group (P=.0446 and P=.0137, respectively). Maximum pain scores on postoperative days 1 and 2 were significantly less for the SILSS group (P=.0014 and P=.047, respectively). Hospital stay was borderline statistically shorter in the SILSS group (P=.0053). SILSS was also associated with better cosmesis (P<.0011). CONCLUSION SILSS is feasible and safe and is associated with earlier recovery of bowel function, a significant reduction in postoperative pain, and better cosmesis.

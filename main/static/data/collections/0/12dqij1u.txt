PURPOSE This report describes a case of a 32-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with a facial arteriovenous malformation during childhood. Because this patient possessed a major risk of perioperative hemorrhage, the use of several local hemostatic measures was thoroughly explored before routine exodontia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Selective embolization of the right superior thyroid artery was performed intraoperatively and a novel hemostatic technique using a combination of a packing of Gelfoam wrapped in Surgicel was placed within the extraction sites and sealed with SwiftSet. RESULTS Local hemostasis was achieved with a novel technique using a combination of cyanoacrylate and local hemostatic agents despite aggressive hemorrhaging after routine exodontia. CONCLUSION By exploiting the local properties of these agents, local hemostasis can be achieved with this novel technique even in the most challenging cases of vascular anomalies.

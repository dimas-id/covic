During the COVID-19 pandemic dermatologists in countries with the highest incidence have noted an increase in consultations for chilblain-like lesions. In the Region of Murcia, a south-east Spanish area with around 1.5 million population, dermatologists have collected these findings during one week. In most cases photographs were taken by the patients themselves and referred to their General Practitioners before getting to us via our regional teledermatology platform. Patients were asked about fever, cough, shortness of breath or gastrointestinal symptoms.

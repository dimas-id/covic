The contradiction between a large population and limited and unevenly distributed medical resources is a serious problem in many developing countries. This problem not only affects human health but also leads to the occurrence of serious infection if treatment is delayed. With the development of wireless communication network technology, patients can acquire real-time medical information through wireless network equipment. Patients can have the opportunity to obtain timely medical treatment, which may alleviate the shortage of medical resources in developing countries. This study establishes a new method that can decide and transmit effective data based on sensor device mobile health in wireless networks. History data, collection data, and doctor-analyzed data could be computed and transmitted to patients using sensor devices. According to probability analysis, patients and doctors may confirm the possibility of certain diseases.

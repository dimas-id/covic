BACKGROUND We sought to investigate morbidity and infectious complications following pelvic exenteration (PEx) and compare infectious complications of patients undergoing PEx and conventional rectal resections. METHODS The NSQIP database was utilized to examine the clinical data of patients undergoing elective rectal resections during 2005-2013. Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare postoperative complications of patients who underwent PEx and proctectomy procedure. RESULTS We sampled a total of 7,950 patients who underwent rectal resection. Of these, 303 (3.8%) patients underwent pelvic exenteration. Mortality, morbidity, and infectious complications of patients who underwent pelvic exenteration were 1.7%, 65.7%, and 42.6%, respectively. Patients who underwent PEx had a significantly higher rate of morbidity (AOR: 2.01, P < 0.01), overall infectious complications (AOR: 1.49, P < 0.01), hemorrhagic complications (AOR: 3.36, P < 0.01), and surgical site infections (SSI) (AOR: 1.23, P = 0.04) compared to patients who underwent proctectomy. Return to operation room (AOR: 4.99, P < 0.01), obesity (AOR: 1.43, P < 0.01), disseminated cancer (AOR: 1.30, P = 0.01) were significantly associated with SSI complications. CONCLUSION Postoperative morbidity and infectious complication are significantly higher after PEx procedure. Return to operation room, obesity, and disseminated cancer are strongly associated with surgical site infections complications in rectal surgery. Specific consideration to infectious complications is recommended for these patients.

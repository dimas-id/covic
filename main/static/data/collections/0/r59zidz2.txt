The literature about tibial tuberosity advancement surgery in dogs and humans informed the development of a version of the operation using a wedge-shaped implant of titanium foam. Computer-assisted drawing and stereolithography was used to create instruments and implants that were evaluated by cadaver surgery. A trial, involving 26 client-owned dogs with lameness due to cranial cruciate ligament failure, was started. Follow-up was done by clinical and radiographic examination after 4 wk and clinical examination again 6-11 mo after surgery. The titanium foam implant maintained tibial tuberosity advancement easily and effectively. The same major complication occurred in 2 of the first 6 cases before, a slightly modified technique was used to treat 20 dogs without complication. At mid-term follow-up (6-11 mo), 20/26 dogs (77%) had returned to full function, two dogs (7.7%) had acceptable function, two dogs (7.7%) could not be evaluated due to recent contra lateral modified Maquet procedure surgery, and two (7.7%) dogs had died for reasons unrelated to the study. This is the first clinical report of the use of titanium foam in veterinary orthopaedics. Modified Maquet procedure appears to be an effective treatment for lameness due to failure of the cranial cruciate ligament in dogs.

Calvarial bone healing remains difficult but may be improved by stimulating chondrogenesis of implanted stem cells. To simultaneously promote chondrogenesis and repress adipogenesis of stem cells, we built a CRISPRai system that comprised inactive Cas9 (dCas9), two fusion proteins as activation/repression complexes and two single guide RNA (sgRNA) as scaffolds for recruiting activator (sgRNAa) or inhibitor (sgRNAi). By plasmid transfection and co-expression in CHO cells, we validated that dCas9 coordinated with sgRNAa to recruit the activator for mCherry activation and also orchestrated with sgRNAi to recruit the repressor for d2EGFP inhibition, without cross interference. After changing the sgRNA sequence to target endogenous Sox9/PPAR-γ, we packaged the entire CRISPRai system into an all-in-one baculovirus for efficient delivery into rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSC) and verified simultaneous Sox9 activation and PPAR-γ repression. The activation/inhibition effects were further enhanced/prolonged by using the Cre/loxP-based hybrid baculovirus. The CRISPRai system delivered by the hybrid baculovirus stimulated chondrogenesis and repressed adipogenesis of rBMSC in 2D culture and promoted the formation of engineered cartilage in 3D culture. Importantly, implantation of the rBMSC engineered by the CRISPRai improved calvarial bone healing. This study paves a new avenue to translate the CRISPRai technology to regenerative medicine.

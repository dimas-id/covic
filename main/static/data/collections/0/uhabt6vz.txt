The Ebola crisis in Africa presented a case study in both hope and despair. There were severe casualties in the weak and unprepared system of Liberia and Sierra Leone, but hope for a developing system in Nigeria, which managed to prevent a mass outbreak. This chapter takes a closer look at the Ebola crisis of 2014 in Africa and examines Nigeria as a model of political will and voluntary preparedness to tackle this national and continental health emergency. This chapter looks at risk and crisis communication in particular, and explores the concepts of ethics in the case of the Ebola outbreak.

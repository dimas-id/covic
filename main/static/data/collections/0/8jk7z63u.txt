The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on many aspects of head and neck cancer (HNC) care. The uncertainty and stress resulting from these changes has led many patients and caregivers to turn to HNC advocacy groups for guidance and support. Here we outline some of the issues being faced by patients with HNC during the current crisis and provide examples of programs being developed by advocacy groups to address them. We also highlight the increased utilization of these organizations that has been observed as well as some of the challenges being faced by these not-for-profit groups as they work to serve the head and neck community.

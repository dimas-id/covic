Abstract A heterodinuclear (Ru(II), Co(III)) metal polypyridyl complex [(phen)2Ru(bpibH2)Co(phen)2]5+ {phen=1,10-phenanthroline, bpibH2 =1,4-bis([1,10]phebanthroline-[5,6-d]imidazol-2-yl)-benzene} has been designed and synthesized. The comparative study on the interactions of the Ru(II)–Co(III) complex with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) and yeast tRNA has been investigated by UV–visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, viscosity, as well as equilibrium dialysis and circular dichroism (CD). The antitumor activities of the complex have been evaluated by MTT {3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide} method and Giemsa staining experiment. These results indicate that the structures of nucleic acids have significant effects on the binding behaviors of metal complexes. Furthermore, the complex demonstrates different antitumor activity against selected tumor cell lines in vitro, and can make the cell apoptosis.

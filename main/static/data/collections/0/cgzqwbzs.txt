ABSTRACT To provide policy recommendations for managing COVID-19 in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), a group of certified medical directors from several facilities in New York state with experience managing the disease used email, phone, and video conferencing to develop consensus recommendations. The resulting document provides recommendations on screening, and protection of staff, screening of residents, management of COVID-19 positive and presumed positive cases, communication during an outbreak, management of admissions and readmissions, and providing emotional support for staff. These consensus guidelines have been endorsed by the Executive Board of the New York Medical Directors Association and the Board of the Metropolitan Area Geriatrics Society.

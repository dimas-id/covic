The study aims to develop a new mathematical model in order to explain the dynamics of viral infections in vivo such as HIV infection. The model includes three classes of cells, takes into account the cure of infected cells in latent period and also incorporates three modes of transmission. The mention modes are modeled by three general incidence functions covering several special cases available in the literature. The basic properties of the model as well as its stability analysis have been carried out rigorously. Further, an application is given and also numerical simulation results have been incorporated supporting the analytical results.

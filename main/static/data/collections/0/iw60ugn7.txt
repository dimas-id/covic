At the beginning of the 2020 New year, novel coronavirus infection continues to affect our lives. The anxiety and stress caused by rising epidemic data, the helplessness and fear caused by city closure and isolation, and the boredom and irritability caused by extended holiday grounding all have a great impact on the psychology of students.

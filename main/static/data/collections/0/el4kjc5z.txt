BACKGROUND To date, hybrid NOTES, combining transvaginal and laparoscopic access, represents the most popular clinically applied NOTES approach enabling surgical handling comparable to laparoscopic surgery. The transrectal route could be used in a similar way; however, suitable devices facilitating feasible transrectal access and rectal sealing are lacking. METHODS In collaboration with Karl Storz GmbH, we tailored a rectoscope and trocars to facilitate transrectal trocar placement and rectal sealing for hybrid NOTES procedures using rigid instruments. Five German Landrace pigs underwent transrectal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy using the new devices. In a second experiment, the transferability to human anatomy was assessed in a human cadaver. RESULTS Using the new devices, transrectal trocar placement and rectal sealing proved to be feasible in both experiments. Transrectal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy could be performed without complications. CONCLUSION The presented devices provide a tailored operating platform allowing precise transrectal trocar insertion and feasible sealing of the rectotomy. Consequently, these new instruments may pave the way for transrectal hybrid NOTES procedures and could succeed to clinical use in future.

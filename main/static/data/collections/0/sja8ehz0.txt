Rel/NF-κB transcription factors play a key role in modulating the response of immunoregulatory genes including cytokines and chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, acute phase proteins, and anti-microbial peptides. Furthermore, an array of genes important for angiogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis is also regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Close association of NF-κB with inflammation and tumorigenesis makes it an attractive target for basic research as well as for pharmaceutical industries. Studies involving various animal and cellular models have revealed the importance of NF-κB in pathobiology of lung diseases. This review (a) describes structures, activities, and regulation of NF-κB family members; (b) provides information which implicates NF-κB in pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and cancer; and (c) discusses information about available synthetic and natural compounds which target NF-κB or specific components of NF-κB signal transduction pathway and which may provide the foundation for development of effective therapy for lung inflammation and bronchogenic carcinomas.

BACKGROUND The indications for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) have been extended to include large dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tracts (RVOTs). Prestenting of the RVOT is commonly performed before PPVI in order to ensure a stable landing zone. The AndraStent XXL (AndraMed GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), a cobalt-chromium stent with semi-open cell design, has unique mechanical properties in this indication but is no longer available in France. AIMS To assess the efficiency of AndraStent XXL before PPVI. METHODS In this retrospective multicentre cohort study, 86 AndraStents XXL were implanted in 77 patients in 6 centres. RESULTS PPVI was indicated mainly for pulmonary regurgitation (75.3%) in native or patched RVOT (88.3%). The stents were manually mounted on balloon catheters and delivered through sheaths using a conventional femoral approach. PPVI was performed successfully in 97.4% of patients after successful prestenting, generally during the same procedure (77.9%). There were no deaths associated with stent implantation, and four patients experienced five complications, mainly stent embolization, including one requiring surgery. Neither stent fracture nor dysfunction were observed in any patient during a mean follow-up of 19.2±8.7months. Stent analysis showed an excellent maximal stent expansion (97.1%) regardless of balloon size. A 22.3%±3.4 stent shortening with a 30mm balloon was observed. CONCLUSIONS Implantation of large cobalt-chromium AndraStent XXL stents is efficient for prestenting before PPVI.

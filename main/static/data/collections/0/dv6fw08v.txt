Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has overwhelmed and disrupted healthcare systems including dermatology services. National directives were issued to reduce patient footfall within hospitals in anticipation of a deluge of COVID‐19 admissions. We conducted a survey focusing on the impact of the pandemic upon Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) practices and invited all British Society for Dermatological Surgery (BSDS) members undertaking MMS to complete over three weeks commencing 27(th) April 2020.

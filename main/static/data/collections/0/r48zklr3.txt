Since the introduction of robotic technology, there have been significant changes to the field of gynecologic oncology. The number of minimally invasive procedures has drastically increased, with robotic procedures rising remarkably. With recent evidence suggesting that minimally invasive techniques should be the standard of care for early endometrial and cervical cancers, the push for new technology and advancements has continued. Several emerging robotic technologies have significant potential in the field of gynecologic oncology. The single-site robotic platform enables robotic surgery through a single incision; the Firefly camera detects the fluorescent dye indocyanine green, which may improve sensitivity in sentinel lymph node biopsy; and a robotic vessel-sealing device and stapler will continue to improve efficiency of the robotic surgeon.

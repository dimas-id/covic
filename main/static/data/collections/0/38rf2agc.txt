Knowledge tracing is a fundamental task in the computer-aid educational system. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical exercise feature enhanced knowledge tracing framework, which could enhance the ability of knowledge tracing by incorporating knowledge distribution, semantic features, and difficulty features from exercise text. Extensive experiments show the high performance of our framework.

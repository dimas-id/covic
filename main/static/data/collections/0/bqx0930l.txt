BACKGROUND Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) may reduce morbidity after cystectomy. Descriptions of the surgical techniques of RARC with intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder or ileal conduit are sparse and oncologic and functional outcome data have not been reported. OBJECTIVE We present our technique with RARC and intracorporeal urinary diversion (neobladder or ileal conduit) and present oncologic and functional outcomes, as well as complication rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-hospital institution case-series from 2004 to 2009 including 45 selected patients (38 male, 7 female) with high-grade and/or muscle-invasive urothelial cancer of the bladder. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed RARC; pelvic lymph node dissection using three different templates; and a totally intracorporeal urinary diversion, either orthotopic neobladder (n=36) or ileal conduit (n=9). MEASUREMENTS Perioperative variables, pathology data, early and late complication rates, urinary continence, potency, and cancer-specific survival were evaluated as outcome measures. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Median patient age, operative time, estimated blood loss, and lymph node yield were 62 yr (range: 37-79), 477 min (range: 325-760), 550 ml (range: 200-2200), and 19 (range: 10-52), respectively. Nine patients were diagnosed with positive lymph nodes. Surgical margins were clear in all but one patient. Early complications occurred in 18 patients (40%). Median postoperative stay was 9 d (range: 4-78), and median postoperative follow-up time was 25 mo. Four patients died due to metastatic disease. The study is limited by a relative small sample size and no comparative group. CONCLUSIONS RARC with totally intracorporeal urinary diversion is technically feasible with good intermediate-term oncologic results. This is a nonrandomised study including a limited number of patients with a restricted follow-up time, however, and so precautions must be considered when interpreting the outcomes.

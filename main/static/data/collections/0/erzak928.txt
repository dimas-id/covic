Summary: The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has created a dramatic need for the rapid implementation of telehealth services in areas of the country where telehealth is limited in scope.1 This implementation would not be possible without significant changes in how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide reimbursement for these services. In this brief review we intend to evaluate what regulatory changes have occurred, the impact of these changes, and additional opportunities for outpatient pharmacists to receive compensation while providing distant healthcare.

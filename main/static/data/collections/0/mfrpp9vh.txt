Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) are blistering disorders associated with barrier disruption, immune dysregulation and use of immunosuppressing systemic therapy. Patients with BP and PV have higher potential risk factors for infections secondary to skin alterations, comorbidity and chronic treatment with immunosuppressing agents.

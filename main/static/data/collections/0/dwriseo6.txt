Aim: To critically evaluate single-case design (SCD) studies performed within the population of children/adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: A scoping review of SCD studies of children/adolescents with CP. Demographic, methodological, and statistical data were extracted. Articles were evaluated using the Risk of Bias in N-of-1 Trials (RoBiNT) Scale and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension for N-of-1 trials (CENT 2015). Comments regarding strengths and limitations were analyzed. Results: Studies investigated the effects of a wide range of interventions on various outcomes. Most SCD types were adopted in multiple studies. All studies used visual inspection rather than visual analysis, often complemented with basic statistical descriptives. Risk of bias was high, particularly concerning internal validity. Many CENT items were insufficiently reported. Several benefits and limitations of SCD were identified. Conclusions: The quality of evidence from results of SCD studies needs to be increased through risk of bias reduction.

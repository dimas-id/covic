Abstract Hantaviruses are emerging RNA viruses that cause human diseases predominantly in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Besides rodents, insectivores and bats serve as hantavirus reservoirs. We report the detection and genome characterization of a novel bat-borne hantavirus isolated from insectivorous common noctule bat. The newfound virus was tentatively named as Brno virus.

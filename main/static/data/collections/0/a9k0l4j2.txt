In 3 patients seropositive for HIV 1 (2 homosexual men and 1 female drug addict), we found "oral hairy leukoplakia" on the lateral margin of their tongues. DNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) were identified in cellular DNA by molecular-virological means using Southern blot hybridization and/or DNA/DNA filter hybridization on epithelial cells taken by swabs from the epithelium of the tongue. The results were compared with those obtained from the identical anatomical sites of 2 HIV-1-seropositive patients without "oral hairy leukoplakia", 3 clinically healthy HIV-1-seronegative patients, and 2 HIV-1-negative patients suffering from oral leukoplakia on their lateral tongues. In all 3 cases investigated, EBV DNA was detected in cells taken from "oral hairy leukoplakia" by filter in situ hybridization. In addition, EBV DNA was found in cells taken from clinically normal epithelia of the tongue as well as in those taken from the 2 leukoplakias mentioned. EBV DNA was regularly detected on the lateral margin of the tongue, but only in one case on the pharyngeal mucosa. Electronmicroscopy on ultrathin sections revealed particles of herpes virus (EBV), particles of HPV, in one case particles of retrovirus, and in another coronavirus and diplococci.

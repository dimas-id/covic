Positive-strand RNA viruses need to arrogate many cellular resources to support their replication and infection cycles. These viruses co-opt host factors, lipids and subcellular membranes and exploit cellular metabolites to built viral replication organelles in infected cells. However, the host cells have their defensive arsenal of factors to protect themselves from easy exploitation by viruses. In this review, the author discusses an emerging arms race for cellular resources between viruses and hosts, which occur during the early events of virus-host interactions. Recent findings with tomato bushy stunt virus and its hosts revealed that the need of the virus to exploit and co-opt given members of protein families provides an opportunity for the host to deploy additional members of the same or associated protein family to interfere with virus replication. Three examples with well-established heat shock protein 70 and RNA helicase protein families and the ubiquitin network will be described to illustrate this model on the early arms race for cellular resources between tombusviruses and their hosts. We predict that arms race for resources with additional cellular protein families will be discovered with tombusviruses. These advances will fortify research on interactions among other plant and animal viruses and their hosts.

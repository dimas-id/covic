OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings at presentation and after hospital admission in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the HRCT findings at presentation (n = 12) and after hospital admission (n = 25) of 29 patients with SARS and compared the HRCT findings with the radiographic findings. HRCT scans were obtained using 1-mm (n = 28) or 2-mm (n = 1) collimation. The radiographs and HRCT scans were reviewed independently by two observers who reached a decision by consensus. RESULTS All patients had abnormal findings on HRCT at presentation. Eight of these 12 patients had normal findings on radiographs. The predominant HRCT findings at presentation consisted of unilateral (n = 6) or bilateral (n = 2) ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral (n = 2) areas of consolidation. All patients showed progression of disease on follow-up. The predominant HRCT findings on follow-up CT scans consisted of unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral ground-glass opacities (n = 13), unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral consolidation (n = 5), or a mixed bilateral pattern of ground-glass attenuation, consolidation, and reticulation (n = 3). Reticulation with associated architectural distortion and mild traction bronchiectasis was present in eight patients. CONCLUSION HRCT can show parenchymal abnormalities in patients with SARS who have normal findings on radiographs at presentation. Follow-up CT scans obtained in hospitalized patients show findings consistent with fibrosis in a small percentage of patients.

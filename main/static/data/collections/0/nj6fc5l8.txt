Objective: To evaluate differences in morbidity and mortality among mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 treated with therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 245 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation from March 1, 2020 through April 11, 2020 at Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients either received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days or prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Morbidity and mortality data were analyzed. Results: Propensity score (PS) weighted Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated a survival advantage (57% vs. 25%) at 35 days from admission to the ICU in patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days compared to those who received prophylactic anticoagulation during their hospital course. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model with PS weights to adjust for baseline differences found a 79% reduction in death in patients who were therapeutically anticoagulated HR 0.209, [95% CI (0.10, 0.46), p <0.001]. Bleeding complications were similar between both groups. A 26.7% [95% CI (1.16, 1.39), p<0.001] excess mortality was found for each 1 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine over a 21-day period. Conclusions: Therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with a survival advantage among patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

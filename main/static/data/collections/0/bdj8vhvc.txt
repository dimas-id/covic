INTRODUCTION The low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS) device is a new, braided, intracranial microstent designed for stent-assisted coiling. OBJECTIVE To present the results of a single-arm, prospective, multicenter trial of the LVIS for treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. METHODS 31 patients with unruptured, wide-necked (neck ≥4 mm or dome:neck ratio ≤2) intracranial aneurysms were treated with the LVIS device and bare platinum coils at six US centers (investigational device exemption G110014). Clinical follow-up was conducted at 30 days and 6 months. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 6 months. The primary safety endpoint was any major stroke or death within 30 days or major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death within 6 months. 'Probable benefit' was defined as ≥90% angiographic occlusion at 6 months. An independent core laboratory adjudicated the angiographic results. An independent clinical events committee adjudicated the clinical endpoints. RESULTS Average aneurysm size was 7.2 mm (SD 3.8) and average neck width was 4.6 mm (SD 1.8). 68% of patients had a dome:neck ratio ≤2. LVIS placement was technically successful in 29/31 patients (93.5%). No primary safety endpoints occurred during the study (0%). No patient had a higher modified Rankin Score at 6 months than at baseline. 26/28 (92.9%) treated aneurysms with 6-month angiographic follow-up demonstrated ≥90% angiographic occlusion. 21/28 (75%) were completely occluded at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The LVIS device facilitated the coil embolization of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms with high rates of technical success, an excellent safety profile, and very high rates of complete and near-complete occlusion at follow-up.

Nosocomial pneumonia is the most commonly acquired infection in intensive care units (ICUs). Its frequency is approximately 10 cases/1000 admissions; however, the incidence may increase to 20 times that number in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation [1–3]. The overall incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) may range between 15 % to 20 % [2–6]. This complication prolongs the length of hospital stay, increases healthcare costs and may increase mortality [4, 5, 7, 8].

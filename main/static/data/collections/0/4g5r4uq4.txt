INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of the self-gripping Parietex ProGrip™ mesh (Sofradim Production, Trévoux, France) used with the laparoscopic approach for inguinal hernia repair. The incidence of chronic pain, post-operative complications, patient satisfaction and hernia recurrence at follow-up after 12 months was evaluated. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively from patient files and were analyzed for 169 male and female patients with 220 primary inguinal hernias. All patients included had undergone surgical repair for inguinal hernia by the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal approach using Parietex ProGrip™ meshes performed in the same clinical center in Germany. Pre-, per- and post-operative data were collected, and a follow-up after 12 months was performed prospectively. Complications, pain scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), patient satisfaction and hernia recurrence were assessed. RESULTS The only complications were minor and were post-operative: hematoma/seroma (3 cases), secondary hemorrhage through the trocar's site (2 cases), hematuria, emphysema in the inguinal regions (both sides) and swelling above the genital organs (1 case for each). At mean follow-up at 22.8 months, there were only 3 reports of hernia recurrence: 1.4 % of the hernias. Most patients (95.9 %) were satisfied or very satisfied with their hernia repair with only 1.2 % reporting severe pain (NRS score 7-10) and 3.6 % reported mild pain. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that in experienced hands, inguinal hernia repair surgery performed by laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty using Parietex ProGrip™ self-gripping meshes is rapid, efficient and safe with low pain and low hernia recurrence rate.

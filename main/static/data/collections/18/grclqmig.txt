Lytically and persistently infected VERO and LUB cells were cytophotometrically characterized with the aid of computer analysis. Images scanned at 260 and 280 nm were processed by computer algorithms. With this approach, infected cells could be segmented and differentiated from uninfected cells. Lytically and persistently infected cells could be distinguished by distinct differences in nuclear and cytoplasmic optical densities. These findings are supported by biologic data based on the analysis of virus‐specific proteins and nucleic acids. The applied computer aided cytophotometry provides a new approach in the study of virus‐cell interaction.

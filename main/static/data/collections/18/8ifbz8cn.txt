In this study, we report that human plantar fascia consists of two distinct tissues with differential structural properties. These tissues also contain stem/progenitor cells with differential biological properties. The mechanobiological responses of these two plantar fascia stem cells also differ in terms of expression of collagen I and IV, non-ligament-related genes, and proinflammatory genes. The production of inflammatory agents (prostaglandin E(2), interleukin-6) and matrix degradative enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-2) are also different between the two types of plantar fascia stem cells. Based on the findings from this study, we suggest that plantar fasciitis results from the aberrant mechanobiological responses of the stem cells from plantar fascia sheath and core tissues. Our findings may also be used to devise tissue engineering approaches to treat plantar fascia injury effectively.

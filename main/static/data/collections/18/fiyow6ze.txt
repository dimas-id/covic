Lymph node dissection (LND) represents a critical step in order to determine lymph node invasion (LNI), not only for prognostic means but also as a therapeutic strategy in the management of patients with prostate cancer (CaP). Indications for performing LND are inconsistent with the American Urologic Association (AUA), European Association of Urology (EAU), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations differing. A thorough appreciation of lymph node drainage patterns and extent of LND has reshaped our understanding of this disease. Moreover, newer research into this field has directly resulted in refinements to current nomograms with utilization of various prostate-specific antigen (PSA) parameters and genomic medicine. Lastly, the application of newer imaging modalities in combination with molecular-guided robotic surgery has personalized the approach of LND espousing excellent safety, efficacy, and oncologic outcomes in these patients.

Summary The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by SARS-CoV-2 mediated cytokine storm (CS) in lungs leads the high mortality in COVID-19 patients. To reduce ARDS, an ideal approach is to diminish virus loading by activating immune cells for CS prevention, or to suppress the overactive cytokine-releasing immune cells for CS inhibition. Here, a potential radiation-mediated CS regulation is raised by reevaluating the radiation-mediated pneumonia control in the 1920s with the following latent advantages of lung radiotherapy (LR) in treatment of COVID-19: a, Radiation accesses poorly-circulated tissue more efficiently than blood-delivered medications; b, Low dose radiation (LDR)-mediated metabolic rewiring and immune cell activation inhibit virus loading; c, Pre-consumption of immune reserves by LDR decreases CS severity; d, High dose radiation (HDR) within lung-tolerable doses relieves CS by eliminating in situ overactive cytokine-releasing cells. Thus, LDR and HDR or combined with antiviral and life-supporting modalities may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 and other virus-mediated ARDS.

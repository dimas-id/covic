OBJECTIVE: The availability of public health information for optimised supportive care is critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe the first case of COVID-19 complicated by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and x-ray images demonstrated pathognomonic pneumonia. The patient developed tachycardia and the echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors should be aware of the need to thoroughly study this new infection in order to understand its underlying mechanisms and related complications. LEARNING POINTS: We report the first case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with COVID-19. We discuss a rare presentation in the current pandemic. COVID-19 can be associated with cardiac complications, even after the onset of pneumonia, and so strict monitoring of these patients is essential.

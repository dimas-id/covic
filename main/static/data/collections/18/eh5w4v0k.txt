The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs. One patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV. Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients. The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.

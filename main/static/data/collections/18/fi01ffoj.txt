Virusâ€“platelet interplay is complex. Diverse virus types have been shown to associate with numerous distinct platelet receptors. This association can benefit the virus or the host, and thus the platelet is somewhat of a renegade. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that viruses are capable of entering platelets. For at least one type of RNA virus (dengue virus), the platelet has the necessary post-translational and packaging machinery required for production of replicative viral progeny. As a facilitator of immunity, the platelet also participates in eradicating the virus by direct and indirect mechanisms involving presentation of the pathogen to the innate and adaptive immune systems, thus enhancing inflammation by release of cytokines and other agonists. Virus-induced thrombocytopenia is caused by tangential imbalance of thrombopoeisis, autoimmunity, and loss of platelet function and integrity.

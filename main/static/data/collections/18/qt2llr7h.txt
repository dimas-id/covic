The data diodes are very often used to protect users’ networks and sensitive data and that is why additional assurance of those devices is demanded. This assurance can be obtained by applying the Common Criteria security development process. The process is very difficult and time-consuming specially for those not familiar with the standard. Although there are many guidelines and templates telling how to define the security problem still there is a lack of computer aiding tools. This paper describes the plug-in application which supports identification of protected assets, threats, security objectives and security functions – the main elements of security specification. The tool facilitates and speeds up the security development process of IT products.

We sought to estimate the ascertainment ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China, using a modified Bayesian SEIR model with publicly reported case data. We estimated it at 0.465% (95%CI: 0.464-0.466%), implying that the outbreak in Wuhan was abated by depletion of susceptibles, rather than public health action alone. This suggests a high-transmissibility/low-severity profile for the current pandemic and raises doubt about whether suppression, rather than mitigation, is a feasible goal.

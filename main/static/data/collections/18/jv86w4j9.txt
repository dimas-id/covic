A 65 year-old man was hospitalized due to fever (38.6°C) and dry cough since 4 days. He visited Wuhan 8 days ago. At admission, nasopharyngeal swabs sample were taken and PCR analysis confirmed SARS-CoV-2RNA positivity. On day 9 after admission, chest CT scan showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in patient’s bilateral lungs. On day 11, his respiratory symptoms worsened. Subsequently, type 1 respiratory failure was diagnosed, coinciding with kidney injury, and subsequently, type 2 respiratory failure occurred, coupled with multi-organ failure including heart and liver. However, patient constitution worsened although SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative since day 13. He died on day 21. Lung biopsy showed areas of diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by extensive acute alveolitis with numerous intra-alveolar neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrations. Microthrombi were seen in the dilated pulmonary capillaries. Immunohistochemistry stainings for SARS-CoV-2-N protein was negative. Taken together, the patient died of multiorgan failure although the SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared already, implicating that for disease worsening, no active SARS-CoV-2 infection is required.

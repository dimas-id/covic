After an initial period of rising numbers of infected subjected by SARS-CoV-2 and deaths by COVID-19, currently some areas of the World are experiencing a reduction of cases. Different degrees of lockdown and social distancing measures greatly helped in limiting the spread of the disease. The contribution of other external factors like weather conditions and population density, though not as significant, seemed nonetheless to have played an additional role in shaping the course of the epidemic. A third factor still subject of debate is how and how much the mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 provide an indication of viral fitness and adaptation, and their role first into the initial phases of transmission and now during the reduction of viral spreading. Aim of this commentary is to provide an overview of the status of the pandemic situation linking together the different factors implicated in current situation, and to summarize some strategies that could help us to better manage either a second wave of this virus or a potential new threat of similar nature.

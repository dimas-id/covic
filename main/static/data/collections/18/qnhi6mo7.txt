OBJECTIVES Hysterectomy is among the most common gynecologic procedures performed for women, second only to cesarean sections, and the proportion of it performed laparoscopically continues to increase. Addressing apical support at the time of the hysterectomy is crucial to minimizing the risk of posthysterectomy prolapse. Barriers to addressing apical support include the lack of experience in laparoscopic suturing and knot tying that require advanced skills and dexterity. The K-technique is a novel modification of the uterosacral ligament suspension procedure using the knot-less barbed suture technology, rendering suturing easier and quicker to perform. METHOD The vaginal cuff epithelium is closed with 2 unidirectional barbed sutures that are started at the lateral fornices and ran until the midsection. The same sutures will then serially purchase the anterior and posterior vaginal endopelvic fascia and the midsegment of the uterosacral ligament. Two more passes are thrown through the same structures, yet farther laterally, back and forth. A video illustration of the procedure is attached. RESULTS Eighteen patients underwent the procedure with no urinary tract injuries documented by cystoscopy and no postoperative morbidity documented during the 6-week postoperative follow-up period. Limited short- and long-term follow-up data are reassuring, but more will be needed to confirm the efficacy of barbed sutures in prolapse repair. CONCLUSIONS The K-technique combines the conventional uterosacral ligament suspension concept with the ease, effectiveness, and safety of barbed sutures. The technique might aid the surgeon to add the apical vaginal support when indicated.

Purpose: Evaluating the guideline ‘Diagnosis and treatment of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus bronchiolitis’ on the number of chest X-rays, C-reactive proteïn (CRP) counts, leukocyte counts, and antibiotic prescriptions in infants admitted to hospital with RS bronchiolitis. Design: Retrospective ‘before-after’ cohort study. Location: Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Patients: Infants admitted with proven RS virus infection. Methods: Guidelines, including sound restriction of performance of X-rays, CRP and leukocytes, were introduced in February 2003. Data from infants admitted with RS virus infection during 1997- 1999 (cohort A) were compared with those admitted from 2003- April 2006 (cohort B) Results: There were 155 infants in cohort A and 170 in cohort B. Implementation of guidelines led to significant reductions of CRP and leukocyte determinations: 49.0% and 48.2%, respectively (both p<0.001) and X-rays: 30.3% (p=0.020). Numbers of antibiotic prescriptions decreased with 55% (p<0.001). The chance of antibiotic prescription increased significantly when X-rays (OR=5.2), CRP (OR=5.4), or leukocytes (OR=4.2) were done. After implementation of the guidelines, the median stay in hospital decreased significantly from 8.0 to 6.0 days (p<0.001; ranges 1-13 days and 2-23 days, respectively). Performing X-ray, CRP or leukocytes, or antibiotic prescription did not significantly alter the total duration of hospital stay. Conclusion: Implementation of the guidelines led to significant decreases in numbers of X-rays, CRP and leukocytes determinations, and antibiotic prescriptions. Our data support the restrictive use of chest X-rays, CRP and leukocyte determinations in infants, admitted to hospital with RS virus bronchiolitis.

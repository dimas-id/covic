The competences of the immune systems of the ancient pig breed Turopolje (T×T), German Landrace × Turopolje (L×T) and 'modern' pig breed German Landrace × Pietrain (L×P) were compared in this study. All pigs were immunized with a modified live vaccine against 'Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome' (PRRS) virus (Ingelvac PRRS MLV(®)) to simulate an infection. Antibody production against PRRS MLV was evaluated in serum. Elimination of the viral infectious fragments during the experimental period was monitored in serum, leukocytes and tonsils by RT-qPCR. Furthermore relevant immune marker genes were quantified either on gene expression level using RT-qPCR [toll like receptor (TLR) 7, TLR8, TRAF6, CD163, SIGLEC1, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL) 1, IL2, IL6, IL12], and on protein level using ELISA [interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12]. The three breeds showed individual inactivation efficiencies as a reaction to the PRRS MLV vaccination. T×T eliminated the virus in serum within 16 days, followed by L×T (28 days) and L×P (36 days). The antibody titers against PRRS MLV of L×T and L×P were significantly higher compared to T×T (p<0.05). The gene expression data and protein analysis of interleukins revealed that T×T reacted with a type 1 immune response. In contrast, the two other breeds (L×T and L×P) showed a type 2 immune response, which resulted in the higher synthesis of B-cells and an increased concentration of specific anti-PRRS MLV antibodies.

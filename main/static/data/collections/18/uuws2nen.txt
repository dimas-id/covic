The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an urgent global public health emergency and warrants investigating molecular and structural studies addressing the dynamics of viral proteins involved in host cell adhesion. The recent comparative genomic studies highlight the insertion of Furin protease site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein alerting possible modification in the viral spike protein and its eventual entry to host cell and presence of Furin site implicated to virulence. Here we structurally show how Furin interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein homotrimer at S1/S2 region, which underlined the mechanism and mode of action, which is a key for host cell entry. Unravelling the structural features of biding site opens the arena in rising bonafide antibodies targeting to block the Furin cleavage and have great implications in the development of Furin inhibitors or therapeutics.

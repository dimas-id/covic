PURPOSE Stent retrievers apply mechanical force to the intracranial vasculature. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long Solitaire 4 × 40 mm stent retriever for large vessel occlusion in stroke patients. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients treated for acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke with the Solitaire 2 FR 4 × 40 device between May and October 2016 at our institution. Patient-specific data at baseline and at discharge were documented. Reperfusion was graded with the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) classification. Postinterventional angiograms and follow-up cross-sectional imaging were used to evaluate complications. RESULTS TICI 2b/3 recanalization was achieved in 20 of 23 patients (87.0%), in 17 patients with the first retriever pass. NIHSS improved from a mean score at presentation of 16 (range 4-36) to 11 (range 0-41) at discharge. Mean mRS score at discharge was 3 (range 0-6) and 3 (range 0-6) at 90 days post-treatment. No infarcts in other territories were observed. One patient showed a (reversible) vasospasm in the postinterventional angiogram and another a small contrast extravasation in follow-up imaging. CONCLUSION The Solitaire 2 FR 4 × 40 stent retriever is a safe and efficient device for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke with a high recanalization rate and a low peri- and postinterventional complication rate together with a good clinical outcome. Despite potentially higher friction and shearing forces, no increased incidence of visible damage to the vessel wall was observed.

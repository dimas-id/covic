Viruses replicate using both their own genetic information and host cell components and machinery. The different genome types have different replication pathways which contain controls on linking the process with translation and movement around the cell as well as not compromising the infected cell. This chapter discusses the replication mechanisms, faults in replication and replication of viruses co-infecting cells.

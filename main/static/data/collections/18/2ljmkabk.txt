Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic condition, yet little is known about its dermatologic manifestations. We report here on peculiar (perniosis-like) skin lesions, unreported in the previous years, observed in young outpatients visited in our Dermatologic Unit in the last 4 weeks of COVID-19 pandemic (March-April 2020). Similar cases were referred to us in the same period by Pediatricians and Dermatologists from Italy and European countries.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infections have occurred continuously and crossed the species barrier to humans, leading to fatalities. A polymerase chain reaction based molecular test is currently the most sensitive diagnostic tool for HPAIV; however, the results must be analyzed in centralized diagnosis systems by a trained individual. This requirement leads to delays in quarantine and isolation. To control the spread of HPAIV, rapid and accurate diagnostics suitable for field testing are needed, and the tests must facilitate a differential diagnosis between HPAIV and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), which undergo cleavage specifically by trypsin‐ or furin‐like proteases, respectively. In this study, a differential avian influenza virus rapid test kit is developed and evaluated in vitro and using clinical specimens from HPAIV H5N1‐infected animals. It is demonstrated that this rapid test kit provides highly sensitive and specific detection of HPAIV and LPAIV and is thus a useful field diagnostic tool for H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks and for rapid quarantine control of the disease.

The development of a rhinovirus (RV)-RNA-specific reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay is complicated by the close homology between the RV and enterovirus (EV) genomes in the highly conserved 5'-noncoding region, which is chosen for primer design in most RT-PCR assays. We have developed a sensitive, rapid, and RV-specific nested RT-PCR assay and have used it to test nasopharyngeal aspirates from 556 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections. RV RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR not only in all of 52 samples that were RV positive by virus isolation methods but also in 124 of 367 samples that were negative by virus isolation methods and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, in 23 of 137 samples that were positive for a different respiratory virus by virus isolation and/or ELISA, RV RNA was detected by RT-PCR. EVs, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, coronaviruses, and influenza and parainfluenza viruses, including clinical isolates as well as stock viruses, were not amplified in our RV-specific RT-PCR assay, indicating that this assay was highly specific. The processing time was less than 2 days for the RT-PCR, as opposed to up to 2 weeks for virus isolation. These results indicate that nested RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional methods for the detection of RV in patients experiencing acute respiratory tract infections and represents the only reliable tool for the early laboratory diagnosis of RV infections. This is especially important in light of new opportunities for therapy currently being developed.

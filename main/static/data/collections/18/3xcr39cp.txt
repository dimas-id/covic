Abstract The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging for physicians treating patients with genitourinary cancers as those are considered at high risk for severe events. The uro-oncology outpatient clinic at our academic institution was affected early by the outbreak due to the widespread infection of health care personnel. Subsequently, we developed a strategy to ensure patient’s safety by efforts focused on strict quarantine observation, reduction of clinic visits and implementation of virtual patient management into the workflow. Further, we analyze susceptibility to COVID-19 and its effects on uro-oncological patients treated with anti-tumoral agents. The goal is to warrant high quality cancer care, despite being an academic center on the front-line of Germany’s response to COVID-19.

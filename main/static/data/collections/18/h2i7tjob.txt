Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that sense microbial motifs or cellular stress and stimulate caspase-1-dependent cytokine secretion and cell death. Recently, it has become increasingly evident that both DNA and RNA viruses activate inflammasomes, which control innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infections. In addition, recent studies suggest that certain microbiota induce inflammasomes-dependent adaptive immunity against influenza virus infections. Here, we review recent advances in research into the role of inflammasomes in antiviral immunity.

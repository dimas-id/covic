Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic requires healthcare teams to rethink how they can continue to provide high quality care for all patients, whether they are suffering from a COVID-19 infection or other diseases with clinical uncertainty. Although the number of cases of COVID-19 in Jordan remains relatively low compared to many other countries, our team introduced significant changes to team operations early, with the aim of protecting patients, families and healthcare staff from COVID-19 infections, while preparing to respond to the needs of patients suffering from severe COVID-19 infections. This paper describes the changes made to our ‘Do not resuscitate’ (DNR) policy for the duration of the pandemic.

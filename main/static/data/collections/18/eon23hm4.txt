Uncertainty is significant when assessing a risk of certain health care facility conditions especially the facility that prone to the COVID 19 risk. One solution to deal with an uncertainty in health situation assessment is through fuzzy inference system. For that reason, this study aims to develop fuzzy assisted system to assess the safety of dental care related to the sets of patient and environmental conditions. The fuzzy system allows assessment based on the patient body temperature, travel history, dental care ventilation rate, and disinfection frequency. The fuzzy system incorporates several steps including fuzzification, fuzzy regulation, and defuzzification. As a result of this study, the fuzzy system is able to assess and identify the risk of dental care according to the patient health status and hygiene conditions of dental care as well. To conclude, fuzzy system used in this study has offered the advantage of assessing at any situation as for patient and environmental factor predicts the safety of dental care.

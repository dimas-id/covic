AIM: Diabetes mellitus is recognised as a major chronic pandemic disease that does not consider any ethnic and monetary background. There is a dearth of literature on the cost of diabetes in the Indian context. Therefore, the present study aims to capture the evidence from the literature on the cost of diabetes mellitus in India. METHODS: An extensive literature was reviewed from ACADEMIA, NCBI, PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, Springer, JSTOR, Scopus and Google Scholar. The eligibility criterion is based on ‘PICOS’ procedure, and only those studies which are available in the English language, published between 1999 and February 2019, indexed in ABDC, EBSCO, ProQuest, Scopus and peer-reviewed journals are included. RESULTS: A total of thirty-two studies were included in the present study. The result indicates that the median direct cost of diabetes was estimated to be ₹18,890/- p.a. for the north zone, ₹10,585/- p.a. for the south zone, ₹45,792/- p.a. for the north-east zone and ₹8822/- p.a. for the west zone. Similarly, the median indirect cost of diabetes was ₹18,146/- p.a. for the north zone, ₹1198/- p.a. for the south zone, ₹18,707/- p.a. for the north-east and ₹3949/- p.a. for the west zone. CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted that diabetes poses a high economic burden on individuals/households. The study directed the need to arrange awareness campaign regarding diabetes and associated risk factors in order to minimise the burden of diabetes.

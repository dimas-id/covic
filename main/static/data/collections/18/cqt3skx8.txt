Since multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become a standard treatment for gallbladder (GB) disease, a single incision laparoscopic surgical technique has been tried to decrease the surgical site pain and achieve a better cosmetic out come in selected patients. The development of devices dedicated for single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is expanding the indication of this single incision laparoscopic technique to more complicated GB diseases. Mirizzi syndrome (MS) is one of the complex uncommon gallstone diseases in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Because the laparoscopic procedure has become a routine treatment for cholecystectomy, several studies have reported their experience with the laparoscopic technique for the treatment of MS with a comparable outcome in Csendes type I or II. Because the indication for SILC cholecystectomy is expanded to more complicated GB conditions, and the desire of patients for a less painful, better cosmetic surgical outcome has increased, our medical center used this single incision laparoscopic surgical technique for MS Csendes types I and II patients. Here, we report 2 successful cases of SILC for patients with MS types I and II without significant morbidity.

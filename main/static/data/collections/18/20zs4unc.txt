Coronaviruses employ various nuclear signalling mechanisms for their propagation. Here we link replication of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-causing virus, with cytoskeleton-dependent signalling and 3D genome organization. This link could provide novel insights into the high coronavirus pathogenicity in certain cellular states, particularly those associated with ageing.

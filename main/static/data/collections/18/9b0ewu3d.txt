BACKGROUND A Billroth I reconstruction with a mechanically sutured anastomosis is commonly performed in gastric cancer patients. Some surgeons prefer to use large circular staplers during suturing to minimize risks for anastomotic stricture and gastric stasis after surgery. The effect of stapler size on anastomotic complications has not been validated. METHODS This study was conducted with 1,031 patients who underwent gastrectomy and Billroth I reconstruction at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, between January 2007 and October 2008. Patients were assigned to group A (384 patients) or group B (647 patients) depending on the size of the circular stapler that the surgeon selected for mechanical anastomosis. A 25 mm circular stapler was used for patients in group A, and a 28 or 29 mm circular stapler was used for patients in group B. Postoperative complications were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The incidence of complications (e.g., gastric stasis, anastomotic stricture, and bleeding) did not differ significantly between groups. Age greater than 60 years was the only significant risk factor for anastomotic complications identified in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS Stapler size was unrelated to complications, such as stricture and gastric stasis. Age was the only significant risk factor for anastomotic complications after gastroduodenostomy.

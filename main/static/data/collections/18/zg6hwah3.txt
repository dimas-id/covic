Infectious diarrhea is a universal and important health problem in the pediatric population. An expanding number of potential viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens have been associated with diarrheal disease. However, the epidemiologic association of a microorganism with diarrhea is only one step in the process of identifying new pathogens. Once the virulence mechanisms of these organisms are elucidated, a causal relationship can be more readily defined. This article reviews the etiologic agents of diarrhea in the pediatric population and focuses on the newer treatment and prevention modalities, including probiotics and vaccinations, which are used increasingly to combat these diseases.

Abstract Knowledge of implicated food vehicles and contributing factors derived from foodborne disease outbreak (FBDO) investigations allows consumers to be educated on decreasing high-risk behavior to reduce the risk of being affected by foodborne diseases. Food safety regulatory authorities also need summary of outbreak data, as these data indicate where the existing food supply system should be improved. To obtain information on epidemiology of FBDOs in China, FBDOs reported to the China National Foodborne Diseases Surveillance Network by 12 surveillance provinces that include 43% of the Chinese population was summarized. Between 2003 and 2008, 2795 FBDOs were reported, resulting in 62559 illnesses, 31261 hospitalizations, and 330 deaths. Outbreak size ranged from 2 to 464 cases, with a median of 14 cases. The outbreak rate had decreased from 1.37 per 1 million population in 2003 to 0.46 per 1 million population in 2008. Of the 2176 outbreaks with a single known etiology, bacteria (1051 outbreaks, 48%), man-made chemical hazards (550 outbreaks, 25%), and animal and plant toxins (536 outbreaks, 25%) were the main courses. Only one outbreak was caused by virus. Of the 1930 outbreaks with a single commodity, plant-based foods were the most common reported (930 outbreaks, 48%), followed by animal-based foods (590 outbreaks, 31%). Outbreaks most frequently occurred in private residences (32%), workplace cafeterias (21%), and restaurants (17%). The most common factor reported in the 2190 outbreaks with known contributing factors were improper cooking (510 outbreaks, 23%), contaminated ingredient (503 outbreaks, 23%), cross contamination (475 outbreaks, 22%) and improper storage (295 outbreaks, 13%). It is considered that FBDOs continue to be an important public health problem in China.

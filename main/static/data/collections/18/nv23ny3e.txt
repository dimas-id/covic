PURPOSE To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the retrievable Option inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in patients at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial. Subjects (N = 100) underwent implantation of the IVC filter and were followed for 180 days; subjects whose filters were later removed were followed for 30 days thereafter. The primary objective was to determine whether the one-sided lower limit of the 95% CI for the observed clinical success rate was at least 80%. Clinical success was defined as technical success (deployment of the filter such that it was judged suitable for mechanical protection from PE) without subsequent PE, significant filter migration or embolization, symptomatic caval thrombosis, or other complications. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in 100% of subjects. There were eight cases of recurrent PE, two cases of filter migration (23 mm), and three cases of symptomatic caval occlusion/thrombosis (one in a subject who also experienced filter migration). No filter embolization or fracture occurred. Clinical success was achieved in 88% of subjects; the one-sided lower limit of the 95% CI was 81%. Retrieval was successful at a mean of 67.1 days after implantation (range, 1-175 d) for 36 of 39 subjects (92.3%). All deaths (n = 17) and deep vein thromboses (n = 18) were judged to have resulted from preexisting or intercurrent illnesses or interventions and unrelated to the filter device; all deaths were judged to be unrelated to PE. CONCLUSIONS Placement and retrieval of the Option IVC filter were performed safely and with high rates of clinical success.

OBJECTIVES Single-port access laparoscopic surgery (SPALS) is supposed to simplify and improve the outcomes of current multiport laparoscopic procedures. This retrospective study was performed to assess the actual outcomes of SPALS in 2 simple gynecological oncology procedures, namely, diagnostic laparoscopy and bilateral adnexectomy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective monocentric study. Case files of only those women who underwent bilateral adnexectomies and diagnostic and/or staging laparoscopy were studied with respect to the operative room time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative pain, and lengths of hospital stays. The main objective was to assess the feasibility and utility of SPALS surgery in gynecology. The secondary objective was to compare this group with a cohort of patients with multiport conventional laparoscopic surgery (MPCLS) performed during the same period. RESULTS From December 2009 to March 2013, there were 134 patients who underwent these 2 procedures. Eighty adnexectomies were performed, 41 by SPALS and 39 by MPCLS. Fifty-four diagnostic laparoscopies were performed, with 27 patients in each group. In the group of adnexectomies, operative time was significantly lower in SPALS compared with MPCLS (36 vs 59 minutes, P < 10) and also compared with the postoperative stay (1 vs 2.2 nights, P < 10). By contrast, no significant difference was observed between the 2 methods of access in all the parameters studied in the group of diagnostic laparoscopies. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrates that SPALS is feasible and safe for simple gynecological procedures. This approach may result in a smooth postoperative course and shorter hospital stay and can thus be promoted to a day care procedure.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are major antigen-presenting cells that constitute a link between innate and adaptive immune responses, and are critical in the processes of control and elimination of viral infections. On the other hand, there is a large body of data strongly implicating respiratory viruses in morbidity during infancy through the induction of lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchiolitis, and later on in childhood and adult life, mainly due to their association with asthma exacerbations. Little is known, however, about the precise role of DCs in human respiratory tract infections. This review focuses on current data, both from in vivo and in vitro studies, that highlight the interplay between DCs and the viral causes of bronchiolitis.

OBJECTIVES To investigate the tolerance and safety of thermal ablation (TA), consisting of radiofrequency or endovenous laser (EVLA) of saphenous veins (SV) in elderly (group 1 â‰¥75 years), compared with a control group (group 2 <75 years). METHOD An Observational multicenter-prospective study was conducted, under the aegis of the French and Swiss Societies of Phlebology (18 centers). Ninety patients were included in group 1, 617 in group 2 (mean age 80 years and 53 years; 69% women in both groups), representing 863 SV. Mean trunk diameters were similar in both groups (small SV: 6 mm; great SV: 7 mm). In group 1, comorbidities were more frequent, particularly cardiac insufficiency, diabetes, history of thrombosis, and CEAP clinical class was significantly higher. RESULTS EVLA was used in 86% of cases. Settings used were similar in both groups for each technique. Only 6% of TA was performed in an operating room for group 1 (14% group 2). Tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA) alone was used in 91% of cases in group 1 (85% group 2). The mean pain score was only 1.6 for the procedure itself (VASP 0-10; 10 max.) and 1.4 for the 10 days following the procedure. Side effects were few, but rate of paraesthesia was higher when general anaesthesia was used (11.8%) compared with TLA alone (2.2%). At three months, 100% of SV was occluded in group 1 (99.5% group 2), with high satisfaction score (9.3/10). CONCLUSION TA is safe and effective in elderly; it should be performed strictly under TLA to minimize side effects.

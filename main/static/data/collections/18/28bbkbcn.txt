OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of traditional Chinese medicine in 461 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) on glucocorticoid's dosage. METHOD By using the polycentric nonrandomized concurrent controled trial and under the condition of glucocorticoid use, the patierts were divided into two groups: the integrated traditional Chinese and western mendicine(ITCWM) and simplicity western mendicine alone(WM). The observation indexes were time in hospital, pneumonia duration, mortality, glucocorticoid's gross dosage, glucocorticoid's average dosage of days and glucocorticoid use time. RESULT In the ITCWM group, average time in hospital was shortened (P = 0.058), pneumonia duration was shortened (P = 0.057), mortality fell (P = -0.001). The median of glucocorticoid' s gross dosage was 1,277.0 mg x d(-1) in the ITCWM group, and that was 1,680.0 mg x d(-1) in the WM group (P = 0.083). The median of glucocorticoid's average dosage of days was 84.40 mg x d(-1) in the ITCWM group, and that was 115.33 mg x d(-1) in the WM group (P = 0.025). According to the analysis of 461 cases divided by stages and different ponderance, within 7 days after illness, in the ITCWM group, the glucocorticoid' s average dosage decreased. In the common type, the dosage in the ITCWM and in the WM was 146.43 mg x d(-1), and 183.64 mg x d(-1), respectively (P = 0.057), in the severe type, that was 137.71 and 177.86 mg x d(-1), respectively (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION Compared with the group of simplicity western mendicine, in the group of integratived Chinese and western mendicine, time in hospital shorten, pneumonia duration shorten, mortality fall, simultaneity, glucocorticoid's average dosage is decreased. The use of TCM in the forepart of treatment can be capable of decreasing glucocorticoid's dosage.

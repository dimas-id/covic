This technical note describes the preliminary design of a simple, easy-to-use, and easy-to-build ventilator with an unique design that can be used for COVID-19 patients in emergencies and to prevent massive loss of life in resource-poor environments. It can be assembled by a nonexpert as a homemade solution, without the need for specific equipment or technology. The proposed system is novel, inexpensive, has a reduced reliance on external power, and is very easy to maintain.

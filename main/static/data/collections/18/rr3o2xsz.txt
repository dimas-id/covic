Abstract The replication processes used by individual viruses is highly variable. However, all viruses must attach to a susceptible host cell, enter the cell, disassemble the virus particle (uncoating), replicate its own genetic material and express the associated proteins, assemble new virus particles, and escape from the infected cell (release). This chapter will outline the general processes involved in each of these steps.

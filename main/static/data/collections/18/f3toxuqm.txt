Our current understanding of virus‚Äêspecific T cell responses has been shaped by model systems with mice, where naive animals are infected with a single viral pathogen. Paradigms derived from such models, however, may not always be applicable to a natural setting, where a host is exposed to numerous pathogens over its lifetime. Accumulating data in animal models and with some human diseases indicate that a host's prior history of infections can impact the specificity of future CD8 T cell responses, even to unrelated viruses. This can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences for the host, including altered clearance of virus, distinct forms of immunopathology, and substantial changes in the pool of memory T cells. Here we will describe the characteristics of CD8 T cells and the dynamics of their response to heterologous viral infections in sequence.

Although percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the preferred method to provide enteral nutrition for a longer time period, in obstructive esophageal cancer, we cannot safely perform endoscopic access to the stomach even with the ultrathin endoscope. We experienced 1 fatal case due to esophageal perforation caused by balloon dilation, and hence, we developed a safer method. We treated 4 patients with obstructive esophageal cancer using a 3-step gradual dilation method with nasogastric tubes (from 8 to 16 Fr). After about 2 weeks of initial dilation, we could safely perform endoscopic access to the stomach with the ultrathin endoscope and PEG placement using the introducer technique. The 3-step gradual dilation method is a safe and easy procedure for endoscopic access to the stomach. It can be used to provide enteral access as a palliative treatment for patients with obstructive esophageal cancer that is not suitable for conventional PEG placement.

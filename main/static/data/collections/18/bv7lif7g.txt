InnoMetrics is the system that aims at collecting software development process metrics in a non-invasive way to access and optimize the development process and its efficiency. This paper demonstrates the development and analysis of energy consumption of MacOS systems based on the software process measurement data. It represents the experience of the development of MacOS system collector and Transfer, in addition to the user interface and early analysis of energy consumption metrics calculations.

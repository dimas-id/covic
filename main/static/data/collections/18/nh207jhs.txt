In a recent review, we have suggested a neuroinvasive potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and its possible role in the causation of acute respiratory failure of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients (J Med Viol doi: 10.1002/jmv.25728), based upon the clinical and experimental data available on the past SARS‐CoV‐1 and the recent SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. In this article, we provide new evidence recently reported regarding the neurotropic potential of SARS‐CoV‐2 and respond to several comments on our previously published article. In addition, we also discuss the peculiar manifestations of respiratory failure in COVID‐19 patients and the possible involvement of nervous system.

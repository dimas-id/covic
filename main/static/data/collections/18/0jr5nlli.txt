Abstract Kangsabati basin located in tropical plateau region faces multiple problems of soil erosion susceptibility (SES), soil fertility deterioration, and sedimentation in reservoirs. Hence, identification of SES zones in thirty-eight sub-basins (SB) for basin prioritization is necessary. The present research addressed the issue by using four multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models: VlseKriterijumska optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), simple additive weighing (SAW), compound factor (CF). To determine the best fitted method from MCDM for erosion susceptibility (ES), a comparison has been made with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), where fifteen morphometric parameters were considered for MCDM, and meteorological data, soil, slope and land use land cover (LULC) were considered for SWAT model. Two validation indices of percentage change and intensity change were used for evaluation and comparison of MCDM results. With SWAT model performance, SWAT calibration and uncertainty analysis programs (CUP) was used for sensitive analysis of SWAT parameters on flow discharge and sediment load simulation. The results showed that 23, 16, 18 SB have high ES; therefore they were given 1 to 3 ranks, whereas 31, 37, 21SB have low ES, hence given 38 to 36 rank as predicted by MCDM methods and SWAT. MCDM validation results depict that VIKOR and CF methods are more acceptable than TOPSIS and SAW. Calibration (flow discharge R2 0.86, NSE 0.75; sediment load R2 0.87, NSE 0.69) and validation (flow discharge R2 0.79, NSE 0.55; sediment load R2 0.79, NSE 0.76) of SWAT model indicated that simulated results are well fitted with observed data. Therefore, VIKOR reflects the significant role of morphometric parameters on ES, whereas SWAT reflects the significant role of LULC, slope, and soil on ES. However, it could be concluded that VIKOR is more effective MCDM method in comparison to SWAT prediction.

Most ecosystems are populated by a large number of diversified microorganisms, which interact with one another and form complex interaction networks. In addition, some of these microorganisms may colonize the surface or internal parts of plants and animals, thereby providing an additional level of interaction complexity. These microbial relations range from intraspecific to interspecific interactions, and from simple short-term interactions to intricate long-term ones. They have played a key role in the formation of plant and animal kingdoms, often resulting in coevolution; they control the size, activity level, and diversity patterns of microbial communities. Therefore, they modulate trophic networks and biogeochemical cycles, regulate ecosystem productivity, and determine the ecology and health of plant and animal partners. A better understanding of these interactions is needed to develop microbe-based ecological engineering strategies for environmental sustainability and conservation, to improve environment-friendly approaches for feed and food production, and to address health challenges posed by infectious diseases. The main types of biotic interactions are presented: interactions between microorganisms, interactions between microorganisms and plants, and interactions between microorganisms and animals.

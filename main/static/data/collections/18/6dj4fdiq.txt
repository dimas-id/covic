We previously reported the detection of bat coronaviruses (bat CoVs 1A, 1B, HKU7, HKU8 and bat-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in Miniopterus spp. that cohabit a cave in Hong Kong. Here, we report the full genomic sequences of bat CoVs 1A, 1B and HKU8. Bat CoVs 1A and 1B, which are commonly found in the Miniopterus, are phylogenetically closely related. Using species-specific RT-PCR assays, bat CoVs 1A and 1B were confirmed to have distinct host specificities to Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus, respectively. Interestingly, co-infections of bat CoVs 1B and HKU8 in M. pusillus are detected in seven of 38 virus-positive specimens collected from 2004 to 2006. These findings highlight that co-infections of some coronaviruses might be common events in nature. The biological basis for the host restriction of bat coronaviruses, however, is yet to be determined.

Abstract Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are cysteine protease proteins that reverse the ubiquitination by removing ubiquitins from the target protein. With over 100 DUBs identified and categorized into at least 7 families, many DUBs interact with one or more cytokines, influencing cellular processes, such as antiviral responses, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, etc. While some DUBs influence cytokine pathway or production, some DUBs are cytokine-inducible. In this article, we summarize a list of DUBs, their interaction with cytokines, target proteins and mechanisms of action.

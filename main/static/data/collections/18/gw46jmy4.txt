OBJECTIVE To discuss the effective of artesunate in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS Using prospective method, the 43 cases of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Nanning Fourth People's Hospital from January 22nd to February 15th in 2020 were enrolled and divided into routine treatment group (n = 25) and artesunate treatment group (n = 18) by odd-even rule after admission. According to the guidelines, the routine treatment group was recommended to receive lopinavir/ritonavir 500 mg + α-aerosolized interferon 500×104 U, twice daily; the artesunate treatment group was given artesunate 60 mg, twice daily besides the routine treatment, for 10 days in both groups. During the treatment period, the pharynx swab test of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid was carried out every 2 days, and the routine blood test, liver and kidney functions, blood coagulation function and myocardial enzymes were re-examined. Chest CT was checked every 3 days after the treatment, and re-examined every 5 days after the condition was improved. The routine blood test and biochemical results of two groups were observed, and the efficacy evaluation was performed by monitoring the time for significant improvement of symptoms, negative conversion time of throat swab virus nucleic acid, lung lesion absorption time, adverse drug reactions and the length of hospital stay of the two groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, age, body weight, routine blood test and biochemical results before treatment. In artesunate treatment group, the time for significant improvement of symptoms (days: 3.33±1.91 vs. 4.84±2.19), negative conversion time of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid (days: 4.72±2.16 vs. 6.68±3.76), lung lesion absorption starting time (days: 5.39±2.36 vs. 7.48±3.78), lung lesion absorption greater than 70% time (days: 14.11±4.16 vs. 17.04±4.42) and the length of hospital stay (days: 16.56±3.71 vs. 18.04±3.97) were significantly shorter than those in routine treatment group, with significant differences (all P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse drug reactions in two groups had no significant difference (72.2% vs. 80.0%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Artesunate can shorten the treatment time of COVID-19, improve prognosis and eliminate pathogens, with fewer adverse reactions and a good application prospect.

Navigation is an important human task that needs the human sense of vision. In this context, recent technologies developments provide technical assistance to support the visually impaired in their daily tasks and improve their quality of life. In this paper, we present a mobile assistive application called “GuiderMoi” that retrieves information about directions using color targets and identifies the next orientation for the visually impaired. In order to avoid the failure in detection and the inaccurate tracking caused by the mobile camera, the proposed method based on the CamShift algorithm aims to introduce better location and identification of color targets. Tests were conduct in natural indoor scene. The results depending on the distance and the angle of view, defined the accurate values to have a highest rate of target recognition. This work has perspectives for this such as implicating the augmented reality and the intelligent navigation based on machine learning and real-time processing.

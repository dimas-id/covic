Acylguanidines are a new class of antiviral compounds with the unique ability to target both RNA polymerase and transmembrane proteins of viruses from different families. Importantly, they inhibit proteins which are not targeted by existing antiviral therapies, for example, Vpu of HIV type 1, p7 of hepatitis C virus, E of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of coxsackievirus B3. BIT225, developed by Biotron Limited, is the first acylguanidine in clinical trials against HIV type 1 and hepatitis C virus. In this article we focus on the mechanisms of inhibition of viral proteins by acylguanidines.

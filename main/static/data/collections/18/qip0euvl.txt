Superfamily 1 helicases are nucleic acid motor proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to translocation along, and concomitant unwinding of, DNA or RNA. This is central to many aspects of cellular DNA and RNA metabolism and, accordingly, they are implicated in a wide range of nucleic acid processing events including DNA replication, recombination and repair as well as many aspects of RNA metabolism. This review discusses our current understanding of the structure, function and mechanism of Superfamily 1 helicases.

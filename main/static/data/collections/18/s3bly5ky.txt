Macrolides have enjoyed continued use for over 40 years, being increasingly usedfor the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Newer macrolides have been introduced that show improved absorption after oral administration, better gastrointestinal tolerance, and delivery of increased amounts of drug to the infection site. Macrolides are commonly used in community-acquired pneumonia, as well as in atypical pneumonia and legionellosis. The newer macrolides, in comparative studies, have been shown to be as effective as the conventional therapies for treating acute otitis media, acute sinusitis and acute pharyngitis, with a low incidence of side-effects. However, dosing can be simplified because of their unique pharmacokinetic properties. Limitations in the use of macrolides for respiratory infections include rather marginal activity in the most severe cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections, lack of activity against Klebsiella and other coliforms, which precludes their use as single agents in the therapy of pneumonia in patients with significant underlying disease or in the elderly, and development of resistance in streptococci and staphylococci.

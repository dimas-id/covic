We report a patient that presented with acute abdominal pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. His workup revealed rupture of a 5.8 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. He presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath and radiologic evidence of COVID-19 infection. After careful consideration, he underwent successful endovascular repair under local anesthesia with good short-term results.

BACKGROUND Since 1 January 2005, the situation of bariatric surgery has been examined in Germany. All data are registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS Data collection on the results of gastric banding procedures was started in 2005, and the data are registered in an online database. Follow-up data were collected once a year. Participation in the quality assurance study is voluntary. RESULTS Since 2005, 3,453 gastric banding procedures have been performed at 88 hospitals. The mean age of patients was 40.7 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 45.2 kg/m2. BMI and comorbidities are significantly higher in male patients. Regarding gender-specific aspects, there are no significant differences in the perioperative complication rates. The amelioration rate of comorbidities in male patients is lower than in female patients. CONCLUSION Gastric banding in Germany is generally performed in patients with a BMI below 45 kg/m2. The perioperative complication rate is low. Data from the nationwide survey of the German Bariatric Surgery Registry show significant differences in preoperative comorbidities and their amelioration between male and female patients. There is a need for further evaluation of gender-specific aspects of gastric banding procedures to optimize patient selection, reduce specific postoperative complications, and achieve long-term effects on weight loss and remission of comorbidities.

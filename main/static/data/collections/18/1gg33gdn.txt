ABSTRACT Objective: To conduct a systematic review of original peer-reviewed studies, containing data on the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples of amniotic fluid, placenta or membranes, umbilical cord blood, and human milk, from women with a clinically or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. These studies should have been published after the guide for the management of patients with COVID-19 from World Health Organization guide (available in March 13, 2020). Results: Seventeen studies were included, in which 143 clinical samples were identified (38 of amniotic fluid; 34 of placentas or membranes; 39 from umbilical cord blood and 32 from human milk). Among the 143 samples, nine were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (one amniotic fluid sample obtained before rupturing the membranes; six samples of placenta or membranes, although authors indicate the possibility of contamination by maternal blood in three of these, and two samples of human milk). Conclusions: Following our search criteria, we found no studies that demonstrate the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in conjunction with viral isolation and the evaluation of the infective capacity of viral particles, in clinical samples of amniotic fluid, placenta or membranes, umbilical cord blood and human milk, from women with a confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. However, vertical transmission cannot be ruled out, larger studies are required that ideally locate in situ RNA and protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as isolation that demonstrate the infective capacity of the viral particles.

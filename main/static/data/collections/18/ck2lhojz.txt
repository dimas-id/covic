The discovery of viruses heralded an exciting new era for research in the medical and biological sciences. It has been realized that the cellular receptor guiding a virus to a target cell cannot be the sole determinant of a virus's pathogenic potential. Comparative analyses of the structures of genomes and their products have placed the picornaviruses into a large “picorna-like” virus family, in which they occupy a prominent place. Most human picornavirus infections are self-limiting, yet the enormously high rate of picornavirus infections in the human population can lead to a significant incidence of disease complications that may be permanently debilitating or even fatal. Picornaviruses employ one of the simplest imaginable genetic systems: they consist of single-stranded RNA that encodes only a single multidomain polypeptide, the polyprotein. The RNA is packaged into a small, rigid, naked, and icosahedral virion whose proteins are unmodified except for a myristate at the N-termini of VP4. The RNA itself does not contain modified bases. The key to ultimately understanding picornaviruses may be to rationalize the huge amount of information about these viruses from the perspective of evolution. It is possible that the replicative apparatus of picornaviruses originated in the precellular world and was subsequently refined in the course of thousands of generations in a slowly evolving environment. Picornaviruses cultivated the art of adaptation, which has allowed them to “jump” into new niches offered in the biological world.

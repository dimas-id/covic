The current dreadful pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is playing havoc with humanity, socio-communal systems and economic reservoirs worldwide. Certain countries have managed to curtail COVID-19 crisis to some extent, however, a great majority still remains helpless in containing this outbreak. Rapidly evolving disease patterns and complex epidemiology of COVID-19 necessitate a tailored approach by medical experts in dealing with this devastating outbreak. Similar to other medical disciplines, surgical associations and societies have developed a tailored approach of patientsâ€™ selection and planning with improvised endolaparoscopic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-essential and non-urgent surgical procedures are deferred till this outbreak is abated. Benefits of delaying elective and non-urgent surgery outweighs the risk of performing surgical procedures on patients with asymptomatic or active COVID-19 disease. Laparoendoscopic procedures increase the risk of aerosol exposure, disease transmission and contamination. Limiting the number of operating room personnel, use of disposable instruments, small trocar incisions, negative pressure environment, and setting energy devices at low modes can help reduce disease transmission during laparoendocsopic procedures. This write up provides a brief account of the impact of the COVID-19, big data analytics of response of medical personnel in curtailing and understanding the disease process and the consensus guidelines for carrying out laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures.

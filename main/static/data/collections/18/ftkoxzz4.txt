Abstract Disasters often occur without warning and have the potential to affect large numbers of people. Those in the radiology environment experience unique effects on them, their equipment, and their ability to provide quality patient care. Lessons can be learned by reviewing events and their impact on imaging departments around the world. Radiology departments need to be actively involved in the disaster planning and the management of disasters when they occur. Common themes emerge regardless of the type of disaster and these themes should be included in all planning.

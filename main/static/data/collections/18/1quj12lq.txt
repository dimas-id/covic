The COVID‚Äê19 crisis has seen some dramatic changes to health care as we know it. In particular, one area that has seen rapid changes is the area of telemedicine. Telemedicine is not a new phenomenon. Quite the opposite. For some time now, telemedicine has been used to connect those in rural areas to providers for both medical care and behavioral health care services. Unfortunately, the conditions surrounding it have been fairly stringent and have even gone so far as to require that specific audiovisual equipment be used in order for it to qualify for reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and other health insurers.

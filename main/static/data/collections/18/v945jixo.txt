PURPOSE OF REVIEW Incidental pancreatic cysts are common, and management strategies continue to evolve. This review summarizes diagnostic and management recommendations in older patients with these lesions based on guidelines and best clinical evidence. RECENT FINDINGS Diagnosis of cyst type has been enhanced with improved imaging and cyst fluid analysis and visualization. Recent outcome studies indicate that certain cyst types should be followed independent of patient age as long as certain criteria which are reviewed are met. Differentiation of pancreatic cyst type is important as this dictates the need for long-term follow-up. Because most cyst-related neoplasia occurs in older patients, surveillance should continue within certain guidelines.

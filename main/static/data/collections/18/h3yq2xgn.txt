Roman Catholic priests are at high risk for stressors, burnout, and other emotional problems due to aging, role confusion, lack of support, changes in occupational focus, and ideological questions (Fruehle, Gautier, Bendyna, 2000; Hamel, 2000; Sammon, Reznikoff, & Gersinger, 1985; USCCB, 1982; USCCB, 2000). The business theories of Organizational Citizen Behavior and Survivor's Syndrome provide organizational explanations for factors contributing to the lack of motivation among priests. The techniques in Motivational Interviewing provide tools for religious leaders to employ when addressing the lack of motivation with individual priests. The article provides recommendations for seminaries and priests' programs of ongoing formation in addressing the issues of burnout, low-morale, and the lack of motivation.

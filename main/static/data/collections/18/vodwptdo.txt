Stem cells (SCs) are traditionally viewed as rare, slow-cycling cells that follow deterministic rules dictating their self-renewal or differentiation. It was several decades ago, when limbal epithelial SCs (LSCs) that regenerate the corneal epithelium were one of the first sporadic, quiescent SCs ever discovered. However, LSC dynamics, heterogeneity and genetic signature are largely unknown. Moreover, recent accumulating evidence strongly suggested that epithelial SCs are actually abundant, frequently dividing cells that display stochastic behavior. In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of the murine limbal epithelium by single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative lineage tracing. The generated data provided an atlas of cell states of the corneal epithelial lineage, and particularly, revealed the co-existence of two novel LSC populations that reside in separate and well-defined sub-compartments. In the “outer” limbus, we identified a primitive widespread population of quiescent LSCs (qLSCs) that uniformly express Krt15/Gpha2/Ifitm3/Cd63 proteins, while the “inner” limbus host prevalent active LSCs (aLSCs) co-expressing Krt15-GFP/Atf3/Mt1-2/Socs3. Analysis of LSC population dynamics suggests that while qLSCs and aLSCs possess different proliferation rates, they both follow similar stochastic rules that dictate their self-renewal and differentiation. Finally, T cells were distributed in close proximity to qLSCs. Indeed, their absence or inhibition resulted in the loss of quiescence and delayed wound healing. Taken together, we propose that divergent regenerative strategies are tailored to properly support tissue-specific physiological constraints. The present study suggests that in the case of the cornea, quiescent epithelial SCs are abundant, follow stochastic rules and neutral drift dynamics.

PURPOSE Functional outcomes were prospectively compared between two types of reconstruction [double tract (L-DT; n = 15) and jejunal interposition (L-JIP; n = 15)] following laparoscopic half-proximal gastrectomy (LPG), including laparoscopic total gastrectomy (L-TG; n = 30) as a control group, at 1 year after surgery. METHODS Clinical investigations were performed in each patient, and functional evaluations, involving the swallowing of an alimentary liquid containing acetaminophen (AAP), followed by measurements of the concentrations of AAP and hormones in the sitting (n = 5) and in the supine positions (n = 5), were carried out in each group. RESULTS The post-/preoperative body weight ratios were significantly higher in the L-DT and L-JIP groups than in the L-TG group. The AAP levels were significantly lower in the LPG group than in the LTG group. The AAP, insulin, and gastrin levels in the L-JIP group were markedly increased in the sitting position compared with the supine position, while those in the L-DT and L-TG groups were stable in both positions. CONCLUSIONS L-JIP and L-DT are procedures that maintain gradual intestinal absorption and help improve the quality of life. Intestinal absorption and hormonal secretion were relatively unaffected by the posture of the meal intake after L-DT, so L-DT might be the procedure providing the most stable results.

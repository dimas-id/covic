Rapid prototyping and fabrication of elastomeric molds for sterile culture of engineered tissues allow for the development of tissue geometries that can be tailored to different in vitro applications and customized as implantable scaffolds for regenerative medicine. Commercially available molds offer minimal capabilities for adaptation to unique conditions or applications versus those for which they are specifically designed. Here we describe a replica molding method for the design and fabrication of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds from laser-etched acrylic negative masters with âˆ¼0.2 mm resolution. Examples of the variety of mold shapes, sizes, and patterns obtained from laser-etched designs are provided. We use the patterned PDMS molds for producing and culturing engineered cardiac tissues with cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrate that tight control over tissue morphology and anisotropy results in modulation of cell alignment and tissue-level conduction properties, including the appearance and elimination of reentrant arrhythmias, or circular electrical activation patterns. Techniques for handling engineered cardiac tissues during implantation in vivo in a rat model of myocardial infarction have been developed and are presented herein to facilitate development and adoption of surgical techniques for use with hydrogel-based engineered tissues. In summary, the method presented herein for engineered tissue mold generation is straightforward and low cost, enabling rapid design iteration and adaptation to a variety of applications in tissue engineering. Furthermore, the burden of equipment and expertise is low, allowing the technique to be accessible to all.

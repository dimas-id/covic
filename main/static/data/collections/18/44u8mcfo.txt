Abstract Background Dihydromyricetin (DMY) is an important plant flavonoid, which has received great attention due to its health-benefiting activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic and neuroprotective activities. DMY capsules have been sold in US as a nutraceutical supplement to prevent alcoholic hangovers. The major disadvantage associated with DMY is its chemical instability and poor bioavailability caused by the combined effects of its low solubility and poor membrane permeability. This limits its practical use in the food and pharmaceutical fields. Scope and approach The present paper gives an overview of the current methods for the identification and quantification of DMY. Furthermore, recent findings regarding the main biological properties and chemical stability of DMY, the metabolism of DMY as well as different approaches to increase DMY bioavailability in both aqueous and lipid phases are discussed. Key findings and conclusions Current trends on identification and quantification of DMY have been focused on spectral and chromatographic techniques. Many factors such as heat, pH, metal ions, could affect the chemical stability of DMY. Despite the diverse biological effects of DMY, DMY faces with the problem of poor bioavailability. Utilization of different delivery systems including solid dispersion, nanocapsule, microemuslion, cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, co-crystallization, phospholipid complexes, and chemical or enzymatic acylation has the potential to improve both the solubility and bioavailability. DMY digested in laboratory animals undergoes reduction, dehydroxylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. Novel DMY delivery systems and basic pharmacokinetic studies of encapsulated DMY on higher animals and humans might be required in the future.

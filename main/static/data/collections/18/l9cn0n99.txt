This chapter reviews some characteristic features of membrane fusion activity for each virus and discusses the mechanisms of membrane fusion, especially low pH-induced membrane fusion. It concentrates on the interaction of the hydrophobic segment with the target cell membrane lipid bilayer and suggests the entrance of the segment into the lipid bilayer hydrophobic core as a key step in fusion. The envelope is a lipid bilayer membrane with the virus specific glycoproteins spanning it. The bilayer originates from the host cell membrane and has a lipid composition and transbilayer distribution quite similar to the host's. The viral glycoproteins have the functions of binding to the target cell surface and fusion with the cell membranes. The two functions are carried by a single glycoprotein in influenza virus (HA), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein, and Semliki Forest virus SFV E glycoprotein. In Sendai virus (HVJ), the functions are carried by separate glycoproteins, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) for binding and fusion glycoprotein (F) for fusion. When viruses encounter target cells, they first bind to the cell surface through an interaction of the viral glycoprotein with receptors.

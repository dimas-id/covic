Manipulating charges is fundamental to numerous systems, and this ability is achieved through materials of diverse characteristics. This ability is achieved through materials of diverse characteristics. Electrets are dielectrics that trap charges or dipoles. Applications include electrophotography, microphones, air filters and energy harvesters. To trap charges or dipoles for a long time, electrets are commonly made of hard dielectrics. Stretchable dielectrics are short-lived electrets. The two properties-longevity and stretchability-conflict; existing electrets struggle to attain both. This work describes an approach to developing stretchable electrets. Nanoparticles of hard electret are immobilized in a matrix of dielectric elastomer. The composite divides the labor of two functions: the particles trap charges with longevity, and the matrix enables stretchability. The design considerably broadens the choice of materials to enable stretchable electrets. Silica nanoparticles in polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, achieve charge density ~ 4 Ã— 10-5 Cm-2 and lifetime beyond 60 days. Long-lived, stretchable electrets open extensive opportunities.

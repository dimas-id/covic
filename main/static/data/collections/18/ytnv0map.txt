Viral antigens for human and veterinary vaccines are still inactivated with formaldehyde. This is not an ideal inactivant and the problems of formaldehyde inactivation of vaccines are discussed. Vaccines inactivated with aziridines are superior in safety and antigenicity. Aziridines inactivate viruses in a first-order reaction and the inactivation rate and endpoint can be determined. The preparation and application of the aziridine compound binary ethylenimine (BEI) and the necessary conditions for and controls of the inactivation process are described and discussed. A computer program has been written for assistance in the use of BEI for controlled inactivation of viral antigens.

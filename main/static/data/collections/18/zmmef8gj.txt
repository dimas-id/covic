Every year, influenza causes seasonal epidemics and is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. In general, clinical signs include fever, respiratory symptoms and myalgia. Human influenza viruses include influenza viruses A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, influenza virus B and influenza virus C. Wild waterfowl are the natural reservoir of influenza A virus. On a sporadic basis novel viruses can emerge from the zoonotic reservoir and cross the species barrier. In such events clinical presentation in humans can range from mild (e.g. conjunctivitis) to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In early 2013, a novel avian influenza A virus H7N9 emerged in China and the clinical presentation included bilateral pneumonia with ARDS and a high case fatality rate. In this article a summary is given on diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of influenza and on future developments.

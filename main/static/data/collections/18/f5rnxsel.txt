The occurrence of human rhinoviruses (HRV) and its relationship to clinical and histopathological findings were investigated in 127 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from 36 lung transplant recipients by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, 286 samples from 235 other immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients were also studied. HRV was detected in 41.7% of lung transplant recipients vs 14.5% of other patients (p < 0.0001), and no differences in viral load were observed. Acute respiratory insufficiency was found in 15 cases, three of which were HRV positive (viral load, 6.3x10(6) RNA copies/ml in one patient with chronic graft dysfunction). A diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 10 out of 127 cases, two of which were HRV positive (viral load, 10(3)-10(4) in cases of co-infection). Acute rejection was diagnosed in 12 cases, three of which were HRV positive (viral load, 10(3) in two cases of co-infection and 10(5) in a single infection). HRV infection may involve the lower respiratory tract, particularly in the presence of an impaired pulmonary background, such as a transplanted lung. Clinical evaluation should take into account the viral load, with a load of >10(5) possibly being associated with clinical symptoms, although lower loads can be detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

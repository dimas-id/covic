The RV-97 rabies virus vaccine strain is widely used in Russia as a component of the live attenuated oral anti-rabies vaccine "Sinrab". This vaccine has also been used in some other countries, such as Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine. Entire genome sequencing is an effective tool for studying the genetic properties of virus strains. In this study, a simple technique for obtaining the entire genome sequence of the rabies virus was used. The entire genome sequence and the deduced amino acid sequences of the major viral proteins were compared with those of other rabies vaccine virus strains. The RV-97 strain forms a separate phylogenetic branch and seems to be phylogenetically more related to the group of Japanese vaccine strains. It also contains several unique amino acid changes in known immunodominant sites of G and P proteins.

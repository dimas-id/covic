BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES This is a case report of a 5-mm trocar-site large bowel herniation following laparoscopic tubal sterilization. During laparoscopic sterilization, the 5-mm port site was closed initially. Large bowel herniation was recognized at the end of the case and managed immediately by laparoscopically reducing the hernia and closing the port site without any short- or long-term complications. Trocar-site bowel hernia is a rare complication after laparoscopic surgery. It is usually associated with trocar size > 10 mm. We describe a case of bowel herniation through a 5-mm trocar site, which was managed after laparoscopic surgery. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old multigravid patient underwent a laparoscopic tubal fulguration. Two 5-mm ports were used for the procedure. At the end of the procedure, the lateral trocar site was found to have fat protrusion that looked like appendices epiploicae. A laparoscopic camera was reintroduced into the abdominal cavity that showed a large bowel herniation through the 5-mm lateral port site. The hernia was reduced laparoscopically, and the fascial defect was repaired. CONCLUSION Bowel herniation can occur through a 5-mm port. All port sites should be closed to avoid such complications.

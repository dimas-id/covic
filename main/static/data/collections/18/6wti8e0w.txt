The problem of the theoretical precariousness of psychology requires defining, at an epistemological level, its concepts and languages and the use of models for finding core concepts and building more or less 'hard' theories. After reviewing some main aims and models of psychology, and comparing them with those of other sciences, the commentary deals with the possibility of simulating life as a tool for building evolutionary psychological models. In particular, evolutionary and developmental robotics and the evo-devo models can simulate the simultaneous adaptation effects of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic development of the embodied mind in response to the characteristics of the environment. The simulation using Artificial Intelligence and robotics could contribute significantly to the definition, experimentation, and validation of the models that make up the theories of psychology in its different domains, enhancing the interdisciplinarity with other sciences that study the same objects. Further studies, both epistemological and empirical, are suggested to confirm whether this evo-devo approach can be integrated with "evolutionary psychology" and contribute to a unifying meta-theory of psychological science.

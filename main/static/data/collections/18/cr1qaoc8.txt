1.. The geographical features, in particular the western escarpment, and the climate and vegetation of western Angola combine to divide the area into three avifaunal zones. 2.. An unusual relationship exists between some related forms of different zones. This is illustrated by two groups of examples in which the characters of the forms are summarised, their distribution is shown on maps, and an attempt is made to interpret in evolutionary terms the picture presented. 3.. Endemic or near‚Äêendemic forms of the Escarpment Zone are listed with some notes on their affinities with other species. 4.. The botanical history of the area is discussed in relation to the conclusions reached on the evolution of the birds. 5.. The Escarpment Zone of Angola has been of considerable importance in the evolution of species in western Africa, south of the Equator.

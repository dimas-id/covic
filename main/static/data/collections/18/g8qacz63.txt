The integration and evolution of implantable medical devices made of bioresorbable polymers and used for temporary biomedical applications are crucial criteria in the success of a therapy and means of follow-up after implantation are needed. The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate a method based on microscopic Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR) mappings to monitor the degradation of such polymers on tissue explant sections, after implantation. This technique provided information on their location and on both their composition and crystallinity, which is directly linked to their state of degradation induced predominantly by chain scissions. An in vitro study was first performed on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) meshes to validate the procedure and the assumption that changes observed on FTIR spectra are indeed a consequence of degradation. Then, mappings of in vivo degraded PLLA meshes were realized to follow up their degradation and to better visualize their degradation mechanisms. This work further warrants its translation to medical implants made of copolymers of lactic acid and to other polyesters.

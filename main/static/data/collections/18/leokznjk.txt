PURPOSE: Most cell culture processes for viral vaccine production are mainly based on adherent cell culture systems using serum, which are associated with expensive and labor-intensive processes to produce large amounts of viral vaccine strains. In this study, we investigated whether Vero cells could be grown in serum-free and shaking suspension conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of the Vero cell suspension culture system to produce adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), compared to that of the adhesive Vero cell culture system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the feasibility of commercial serum-free media for Vero cell culture. For the adaptation of Vero cells in suspension culture, adhesive Vero cells were added in the early phase of shaking suspension culture, and 50 days after shaking suspension culture, suspension-adapted Vero cells were subcultured continuously. To assess the virus production ability of Vero cells in suspension, the cells were infected with Ad5-green fluorescent protein and evaluated based on their fluorescence intensity. RESULTS: The Vero cells grown in OptiPRO serum-free medium showed no changes in morphology and growth rate, but MRC-5 and FRhk-4 cells showed morphological changes and decreased growth rate, respectively. The Vero cells were well adapted to the suspension culture system. The Vero cells in suspension showed a better Ad5 production ability than the adherent Vero cells. CONCLUSION: Vero cells can be grown in OptiPRO serum-free medium. Further, our suspension culture-adapted Vero cells may be suitable to produce viral vaccine strains due to their high ability to produce viruses such as Ad5.

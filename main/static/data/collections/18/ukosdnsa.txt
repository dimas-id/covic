Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), presumably due to acute tubular injury. However, this does not explain the sometimes severe proteinuria and hematuria often observed. We present 2 African American patients with glomerulopathy demonstrated by kidney biopsy in the setting of AKI and COVID-19 infection. Kidney biopsies showed collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in addition to acute tubular injury. Both patients were homozygous for APOL1. COVID-19 infection likely caused the interferon surge as a second hit causing podocyte injury leading to collapsing FSGS. APOL1 testing should be strongly considered in African American patients with nephrotic range proteinuria. More data from future kidney biopsies will further elucidate the pathology of kidney injury and glomerular involvement from COVID-19 infections.

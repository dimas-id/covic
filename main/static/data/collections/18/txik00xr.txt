Rhinoviruses are a frequent cause of the common cold and more serious illnesses, such as otitis media, sinusitis and asthma exacerbations and, more infrequently, have been implicated in lower airway infections, including pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Diagnosis of rhinovirus infections is best achieved using sensitive and specific reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR assays. The article by Do et al. describes the development and validation of a new one-step, TaqMan RT-PCR assay targeting the rhinovirus noncoding region for the detection of rhinovirus RNA in respiratory specimens from children with upper respiratory symptoms. The assay was rapid and specific and sensitive compared with cell culture. The recent use of RT-PCR assays for the detection of rhinoviruses in clinical specimens has provided more accurate information about the disease burden and epidemiology of these ubiquitous viruses.

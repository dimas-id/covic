Two otherwise healthy adult cats were presented with progressive cerebellar signs of different severity. Owners requested euthanasia. Necropsy disclosed whole cerebellum and pontine atrophy, with a severity paralleling the neurologic dysfunction. We used cell type-specific immunolabelings to characterize the lesions. The severity of the cerebellar cortex atrophy followed a general gradient from the midvermis toward the hemispheres and a local gradient from the depth of the folia toward their tip. Along these gradients, Purkinje cells were the first to disappear, followed by basket, Golgi, and stellate cells, and eventually by granule cells. Bergmann glia cells and unipolar brush cells were preserved. Pontine nuclei and the olivary complex were also severely depopulated. Neurons in the cerebellar nuclei, vestibular nuclei, and other cerebellar system-associated structures were preserved, as well as substantia nigra. Olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) in a domestic animal species was rarely reported. Some features allow tentative linking to either familial or sporadic OPCA of humans. However, the ordered disappearance of all cortical neuronal types has never been described before. Either this entity is cat specific or it might pinpoint the need for increased knowledge about differential gene expression depending on genetic background, i.e., among different species. It also would open prospects about gene product interactions within neurons.

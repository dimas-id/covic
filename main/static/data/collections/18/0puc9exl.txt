OBJECTIVE To describe the epidemiologic features of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing. METHOD Database of the 2 521 probable cases of SARS in Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control was used. RESULTS The course of SARS epidemic in Beijing could be divided into five phases: import and spreading-from 1 to 31 in March, rising-from April 1 to April 15, peak-from April 16 to May 4, declining-from 5 to 18 in May, terminating-from 19 to 28 in May. The proportions of portable cases of SARS in each phase were 2.7%, 13.6%, 71.0%, 11.6% and 1.1%, respectively. Totally, 2 521 portable cases were diagnosed and verified according to the diagnostic criteria of SARS issued by the Ministry of Health. Among them, 192 died from SARS. The incidence and mortality rates of SARS were 18.57 per 100,000 and 1.41 per 100,000 with the fatality of 7.6%. The ratio of male to female with SARS was 1:0.97. The highest incidence rate of SARS was in the group of 20 - 29 years (30.85 per 100,000), and the lowest was in the group of 0 - 14 years (2.54 per 100,000). People aged 20 - 49 accounted for 72.3% of all SARS cases. The incidence rates in urban, suburb and far-suburb were 32.25/100,000, 20.57/100,000 and 8.90/100,000, respectively, decreasing according to the population density. Health care providers (17.3%), staff (12.9%), retirees (11.4%), workers (9.7%) and house-hold unemployees (8.8%) appeared to be at the five top risk populations being infected. The fatality increased significantly with age. CONCLUSION Beijing was the most severe epidemic region of SARS in the world, but the fatality was the lowest.

Abstract Data from a cross-sectional study of 113 British pig herds carried out in 2004 were used to investigate the associations between postweaning multisystemic wasting (PMWS) in pigs and herds and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) antigen score and antibody titre, and associated histological signs in lymph nodes. The sensitivity and specificity of published herd definitions for PMWS were tested on the study farms to consider the role of PCV2 in PMWS. Herds were defined as PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered based on current and past postweaning mortality (PWM), grower pigs with clinical signs of rapid wasting, hairiness and pallor and no other known cause of death on the farm. PCV2 antigen and antibody were not used in the definition of PMWS. In each PMWS-affected herd, up to three sick pigs with the clinical signs above and one healthy pig of a similar age were taken for postmortem examination (PME). In all other herds at least one healthy pig was taken for PME. Lymph nodes were analysed for PCV2 antigen and histological changes, and serum samples were analysed for PCV2 antibody. PCV2 antibody was present in all the herds sampled. There was a non-linear association between PCV2 antigen and antibody. There was no association between the presence of high scores of PCV2 antigen in pigs and the presence of high PWM in herds. PCV2 antigen score was significantly higher in sick than healthy pigs within farms, and high PCV2 score was associated with giant cells, coalescence and absence of germinal centres in lymph nodes. These results did not vary by PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered farms. PCV2 antigen was present at high scores in approximately 10% of healthy pigs on all farms. All three herd definitions of PMWS were highly sensitive, defining PMWS-affected herds as affected, but had a specificity ranging from 23% to 43%. We conclude that the current diagnostic tests for PCV2 indicated higher scores of virus in sick pigs but were not useful to define pigs or herds with PMWS. The ubiquity of PCV2 and the lack of specificity of the PCV2 tests indicate that PCV2 may be a necessary but not sufficient cause of PMWS disease. Linking this with the knowledge that the herd breakdowns occurred in a space time epidemic indicates that another infectious co-factor may be necessary for disease to occur.

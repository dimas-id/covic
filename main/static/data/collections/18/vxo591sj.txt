Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) struck 1755 patients in Hong Kong and developed into a global health crisis. Although the World Health Organization and national health authorities are sparing no effort to contain the disease and to find a cure for the potentially deadly infection, SARS has an impact on our liver transplantation (LTx) program. Before the SARS outbreak, an average of 1 LTx was performed per month in our center. For 6 months since the outbreak, there had been no LTx performed. The intensive care unit had to be dedicated to patients with SARS. Two of the LTx team members were struck by SARS. A survey conducted among LTx recipients and their family members (n = 45) demonstrated symptoms of anxiety and stress in all. Some LTx recipients were treated at the Emergency Department for suspected SARS, which were later confirmed to be false alarms. Many LTx patients were too frightened to come back for follow-up. A new strain of coronavirus was identified as the causative agent. The origin of this virus is uncertain but the probability of zoonoses is being seriously discussed. Not only are immunosuppressed patients exposed to higher risk of infection, but also the waiting list mortality is also expected to increase. The SARS outbreak has demonstrated the vulnerability of an organ transplantation service and reminds us of the fearful possibility of zoonoses in future xeno-transplantation.

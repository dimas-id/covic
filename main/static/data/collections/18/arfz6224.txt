Epidemiological studies suggest that age distribution of a population has a non-trivial effect on how morbidity rates, mortality rates and case fatality rates (CFR) vary when there is an epidemic or pandemic. We look at the empirical evidence from a large cohort of countries to see the sensitivity of Covid-19 data to their respective median ages. The insights that emerge could be used to control for age structure effects while investigating other factors like cross-protection, co-morbidities, etc.

Abstract Coronavirus membrane (M) protein is the most abundant structural protein playing a critical role in virion assembly. Previous studies show that the N-terminal ectodomain of M protein is modified by glycosylation, but its precise functions are yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we confirm that N-linked glycosylation occurs at two predicted sites in the M protein ectodomain of infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Dual mutations at the two sites (N3D/N6D) did not affect particle assembly, virus-like particle formation and viral replication in culture cells. However, activation of the ER stress response was significantly reduced in cells infected with rN3D/N6D, correlated with a lower level of apoptosis and reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, this study demonstrates that although not essential for replication, glycosylation in the IBV M protein ectodomain plays important roles in activating ER stress, apoptosis and proinflammatory response, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBV.

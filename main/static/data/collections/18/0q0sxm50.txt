A novel coronavirus (SCoV) is the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) SCoV-like viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets found in a live-animal market in Guangdong, China Evidence of virus infection was also detected in other animals (including a raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides) and in humans working at the same market The detection of SCoV-like viruses in small, live wild mammals in a retail market indicates a route of interspecies transmission, although the natural reservoir is not known This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing viral assembly

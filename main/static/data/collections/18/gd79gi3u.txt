Three-dimensional structures of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein bound to cellular receptor and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been determined by X-ray crystallography, providing structural information about receptor recognition and neutralizing mechanisms of mAbs at the atomic level. In this chapter, we describe the purification, crystallization, and structure determination of the MERS-CoV RBD.

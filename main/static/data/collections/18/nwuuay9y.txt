ABSTRACT PAK1 (RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1) is the major “pathogenic” kinase whose abnormal activation causes a wide variety of diseases/disorders including cancers, inflammation, malaria and pandemic viral infection including influenza, HIV and COVID-19. Since Louis Pateur who developed a vaccine against rabies in 1885, in general a series of “specific” vaccines have been used for treatment of viral infection, mainly because antibiotics in general are ineffective for treatment of viral infection. However, it takes 12–18 months till the effective vaccine becomes available. Until then ventilator (O2 supplier) would be the most common tool for saving the life of COVID-19 patients. Thus, as alternative potentially more direct “broad-spectrum” COVID-19 therapeutics, several natural and synthetic PAK1-blockers such as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available in the market, are introduced here.

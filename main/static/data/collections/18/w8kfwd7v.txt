During the last decade, the propagation of immunological knowledge describing the critical role of dendritic cells (DC) in the induction of efficacious immune responses has promoted research and development of vaccines systematically targeting DC. Based on the promise for the rational design of vaccine platforms, the current review will provide an update on particle-based vaccines of both viral and synthetic origin, giving examples of recombinant virus carriers such as adenoviruses and biodegradable particulate carriers. The viral carriers carry pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), used by the original virus for targeting DC, and are particularly efficient and versatile gene delivery vectors. Efforts in the field of synthetic vaccine carriers are focussing on decorating the particle surface with ligands for DC receptors such as heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan structures, integrins, Siglecs, galectins, C-type lectins and toll-like receptors. The emphasis of this review will be placed on targeting the porcine immune system, but reference will be made to advances with murine and human vaccine delivery systems where information on DC targeting is available.

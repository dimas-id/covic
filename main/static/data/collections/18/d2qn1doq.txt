ABSTRACT: Indole derivatives have been the focus of many researchers in the study of pharmaceutical compounds for many years. Researchers have investigated the effect of carboxamide moiety at positions 2 and 3, giving unique inhibitory properties to these compounds. The presence of carboxamide moiety in indole derivatives causes hydrogen bonds with a variety of enzymes and proteins, which in many cases, inhibits their activity. In this review, synthetic strategies of indole 2 and 3-carboxamide derivatives, the type, and mode of interaction of these derivatives against HLGP, HIV-1, renin enzyme, and structureâ€“activity studies of these compounds were investigated. It is hoped that indole scaffolds will be tested in the future for maximum activity in pharmacological compounds. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]

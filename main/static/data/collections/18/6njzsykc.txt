Forty adult, male Atlantic walruses ( Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) were successfully immobilized for the attachment of global positioning system loggers on their tusks and collection of various biological samples. A standard dose of 7.8 mg etorphine was used for each animal, regardless of body size. All animals were reversed with an iv or im injection of 250 mg naltrexone, immediately after tag attachment. Twenty-seven of the animals were intubated and ventilated with 100% oxygen during the recovery period. The induction time was, on average, 4 min 51 sec ± 1 min 46 sec. Several animals had venous pH, and Pco2 levels that indicated severe acidosis and hypercarbia. All animals recovered within an average of 5 min 16 sec ± 2 min 47 sec after reversal. The total time from darting to recovery was 15 min 23 sec ± 3 min 33 sec. The use of naltrexone is recommended for reversal of etorphine immobilization in adult, male walruses, and the use of positive-pressure ventilation with oxygen is highly encouraged.

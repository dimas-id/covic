BACKGROUND: The impact of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) utilization and resource consumption among long-stay patients has not been characterized recently. This study aimed to describe the resource consumption and characteristics of long-stay patients in a PICU. METHODS: This was a single-center descriptive cohort study of 1309 patients admitted to a PICU in 2017. The main outcome was ICU length of stay (LOS). Patients were divided into prolonged LOS (PLS) and non-PLS groups if they had an LOS of ≥ 28 or < 28 days, respectively. Two groups were compared to characterize PLS. RESULTS: Thirty-two (2.4%) patients had a PLS and utilized 33% of PICU bed days. Factors associated with PLS with odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] were being a neonate (7.8 [2.5–25.4], p = <0.001), being an infant (2.9 [1.0–9.0], p = 0.04), admission for a respiratory ailment (7.3 [1.6–44.2], p = 0.003), cardiovascular dysfunction (24.1 [4.8–152.1], p = <0.001), post-cardiac operation (8.0 [1.7–50.1], p = 0.003), post-cardiopulmonary arrest (22.8 [1.7–211.9], p = 0.01), and transfer from another facility (4.2 [1.8–10.7], p = 0.001). PLS patients developed more nosocomial infections and disproportionately received monitoring and therapeutic resources. CONCLUSIONS: A PLS was associated with substantial PICU utilization and complication rates. Future studies should aim to alleviate both institutional and patient-related issues in the affected population harboring possible risk factors for PLS.

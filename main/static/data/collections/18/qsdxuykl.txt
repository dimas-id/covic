Summary A sudden outbreak of epidemic diarrhoea of piglets occurred in Japan, the principal features being watery diarrhoea, dehydration and high mortality in newborn animals. The microscopical lesions were villous atrophy in the small intestine, the villous enterocytes being vacuolated and cuboidal in shape. The villus-crypt ratio was severely reduced, varying from 1:1 to 3:1. Transmission electron microscopy showed numerous coronaviruses within the cytoplasm of enterocytes and among microvilli. Specific antigens of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus were detected in the cytoplasm of enterocytes by the streptavidin-biotin (SAB) technique. Infected cells, which were most abundant in the villous epithelia of the jejunum and ileum, were present in small numbers in the large intestine, the crypt epithelia, the lamina propria and Peyer's patches. The study suggests that the SAB technique is useful for the diagnosis of PED.

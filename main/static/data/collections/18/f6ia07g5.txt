INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic insertion of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter has become a preferred method compared to the traditional open technique for PD catheter insertion. We retrospectively report the outcome of 1-port laparoscopic placement PD catheters in our institution. METHODS A total of 263 patients with end-stage renal disease who underwent single-trocar laparoscopic PD catheter insertion during a recent 6-year period were reviewed. Laparoscopic technique involves introducing a PD catheter over a stiff guidewire into the abdominal cavity through a 10-mm laparoscopic port. Pertinent clinical variables, procedural complications, and follow-up outcome were analyzed. RESULTS There were 182 men and 81 women. The mean age was 56 years. Technical success was 95.8%. Catheter occlusion was the most common early complications (<6 months) that occurred in 4 (1.5%) patients. Late complications (> 6 months) including catheter occlusion, cuff extrusion, catheter leakage, catheter migration, infection, and hernia occurred in 5 patients (1.9%), 2 patients (0.8%), 3 patients (1.1%), 3 patients (1.1%), 6 patients (2.3%), and 4 patients (1.5), respectively. Mean follow-up time was 39 Â± 18 months. Catheter survival rate at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 96%, 94%, 90%, 85%, and 82%, respectively. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic PD catheter implantation via a single-trocar utilizing a stiff guidewire technique is feasible and safe. This method can result in low complication and high catheter survival rate.

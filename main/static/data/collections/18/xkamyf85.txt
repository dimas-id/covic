Ischemic stroke following cardiac surgery is one of the devastating complications that surgeons may encounter, and may lead to serious disabilities for the patient. The clinical course of such a complication may be prolonged if it is not treated properly. Making a quick decision when choosing a revascularization method is very helpful in this matter. Effective treatment options are usually limited. Neurointerventional maneuvers have recently emerged as a possible therapeutic modality in this field. We present the case of a 52-year-old woman who had open heart surgery in Queen Alia Heart Institute, Jordan, to replace a severely stenotic rheumatic mitral valve and repair a leaking tricuspid valve. Her surgery went smoothly with no major event. However, she developed a massive ischemic stroke during her recovery period despite being on adequate anticoagulation therapy. Urgent radiological work-up confirmed the diagnosis of ischemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. We chose a neuro-interventional method for her treatment, and mechanical thrombectomy was performed with a successful outcome and no apparent complications.

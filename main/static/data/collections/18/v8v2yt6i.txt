The management of an 11-month-old infant who developed a bronchopleural fistula (BPF) 3 weeks after video-assisted thoracic surgery for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the right lower pulmonary lobe is presented. Being refractory to treatment with chest tubes, the BPF was managed using a bronchoscopic approach using porcine dermal collagen (PDC) combined with a fibrin glue plug. The single session was sufficient to manage the BPF and the postoperative course was uneventful. This case highlights the novelty in the successful management of BPF in infants after pulmonary surgery using PDC and fibrin glue using the minimal access bronchoscopic approach.

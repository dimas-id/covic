BACKGROUND Most portable bi-level positive airway pressure devices are not equipped with air-oxygen blenders for precisely regulating oxygen concentrations, and supplemental oxygen must be added to increase the F(IO2). Very few studies have investigated the factors that affect F(IO2), and their conclusions have been inconsistent. We investigated in vitro noninvasive ventilation (NIV) parameters and their effects on F(IO2), particularly the effect of the oxygen injection site. METHODS NIV was simulated with a test lung and manikin setup. F(IO2) was measured with 4 oxygen injection sites (mask, in front of the exhalation valve, at the humidifier outlet, and proximal to the ventilator), with 3 exhalation valve types, with 2 oxygen flows, and with 4 combinations of inspiratory and expiratory pressure. RESULTS Oxygen flow, inspiratory and expiratory pressure, and exhalation valve type all affected F(IO2). For a given oxygen flow, the oxygen injection site was the most important factor that affected F(IO2). The oxygen injection site that was closest to the patient (on the mask) had the higher F(IO2) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The oxygen injection site had the greatest effect on F(IO2) during NIV.

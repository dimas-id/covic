The explosive pace of sequencing of RNA viruses is leading to rapid advances in our understanding of the evolution of these viruses and of the ways in which their genomes are organized and expressed. New insights are coming not only from genomic nucleotide sequence comparisons, but also from direct sequencing of transcribed mRNAs and of RNAs that serve as intermediates in replication.

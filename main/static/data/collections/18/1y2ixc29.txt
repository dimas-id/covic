OBJECTIVE To report successful minimally invasive treatment of a uterine leiomyoma in a cow and a mare. STUDY DESIGN Clinical report. ANIMAL POPULATION Limousine cow (n = 1), Thoroughbred mare (n = 1). METHODS A 10-year-old cow and an 18-year-old mare were presented for difficulties in breeding and infertility, respectively. Examination of the reproductive tract revealed the presence of a large mass attached to the uterine wall via a wide and short peduncle in both cases. The mass expanded into the uterine lumen in the mare and into the abdomen in the cow. Both masses were removed using a minimally invasive endoscopic approach and a vessel-sealing and dividing device. RESULTS Minimally invasive surgical resection of a subserosal and a submucosal leiomyoma with maximal sparing of uterine tissue resulted in a short convalescence period and apparent return to breeding function in a cow and a mare. Use of a vessel-sealing and dividing device provided excellent hemostasis and decreased tissue handling. CONCLUSION Leiomyoma with short, wide, and thick peduncles were treated successfully in a cow and a mare with minimally invasive endoscopic approaches aiming at maximal uterine tissue preservation.

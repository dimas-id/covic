Experimental infection of 2-day-old gnotobiotic lambs with lamb astrovirus produced mild diarrhoea after an incubation period of about 48 hours. No other clinical symptoms developed. Infection was studied by immunofluorescent and histological examination of tissues from the lambs. Astroviruses infected only mature villus epithelial cells and subepithelial macrophages in the small intestine, where they produced partial villus atrophy. Infected enterocytes were replaced with cuboidal cells from the crypts, and the lesion gradually healed by 5 days after infection. No serological relationship was detected by immunofluorescence between lamb astrovirus antigen in gut sections and antisera to either calf or human astrovirus.

Baylis–Hillman adduct-derived N-cinnamyl-substituted isatin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antitubercular activity on Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv strain ATCC 27294 by agar dilution method. Anticancer activity for the same compounds was also screened on four different cell lines: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO cells), Colo 205 (human colon cancer), Sup-T1 (human lymphoma) and C6 glioma (rat glioma) by MTT assay method. The compounds (3j–l) have shown significant activity against Mycobacterium strain and the compound 3l has shown specific cytotoxic activity.

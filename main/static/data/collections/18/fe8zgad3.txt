Abstract An increasing number of virology laboratories are now utilising in house real time PCR assays as the frontline diagnostic tests. As the number of tests on offer increases the natural progression from this will be to rationalise their service via multiplexing. Since 2003 we have introduced a large number of qualitative and quantitative multiplex real time PCR assays into our routine testing service. This paper describes the development of the multiplex assays, the problems encountered and the resultant benefits to the routine service.

Feline calicivirus (FCV) shedding and oral bacterial flora were monitored over a period of 22 months in a case of feline gingivostomatitis (FGS). The cat was treated daily with 50 mg thalidomide capsules by mouth, and 200 mg lactoferrin powder was applied directly to the lesions. Clinical signs began to resolve after 11 months when, in addition to treatment, the diet had been changed to an additive-free cat food supplemented with antioxidant vitamins A, D3 and E. Resolution of clinical signs of FGS coincided with the cessation of FCV shedding, and this is the first report documenting such an association. Which part of the treatment, if any, contributed to the cure requires further investigation.

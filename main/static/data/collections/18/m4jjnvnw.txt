PURPOSE To report the results and complications of a single-center experience of above-the-knee angioplasty via transradial access (TRA). METHODS In a prospective study, 110 consecutive patients (88 men; mean age 72 years, range 37-90) referred for critical limb ischemia (26, 24%) or claudication were eligible for lower limb angioplasty via TRA (patients with TASC D lesions of the superficial femoral artery and below-the-knee lesions were excluded). RESULTS The majority of patients (84, 76%) were treated via a left TRA. A total of 170 lesions were addressed, of which 38 (22%) were occlusions; 113 stents were positioned in 82 patients. The overall technical success rate was 91%, with a 63% success rate in occlusions and a 98% success rate in stenoses; by location, the success rates were 91% in suprainguinal lesions and 90% in infrainguinal lesions. No hemorrhagic or local complications requiring surgery were observed. At 1-month follow-up, 101 patients had a downward shift of at least one category in the Rutherford classification of symptoms (clinical success rate 92%); 18 (16%) patients had occlusion of their access radial artery, but none had symptoms or discomfort. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that TRA is a safe and effective approach for lower extremity arterial revascularization, at least for interventionists with longstanding experience in TRA and in selected anatomical subsets.

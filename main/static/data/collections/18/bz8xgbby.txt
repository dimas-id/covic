Objective: To systematically analyze the basic characteristics and contents of the current health standards for infectious disease, environmental health, school health and disinfection in the context of COVID-19 prevention and control, and provide support for the further optimization of epidemic prevention and control guidelines and reference for the revision and improvement of related health standards. Methods: Public health standards used in COVID-19 prevention and control were selected for a systematic comparison with "The Plan of COVID19 Prevention and Control" (the 6th Edition) and other epidemic prevention and control guidelines from the perspectives of application scope and technical elements. Results: The current standards of public health are with scientificity, timeliness and feasibility. The application scope and technical elements of the current public health standards basically meet the needs of the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic, but the public health standardization system still needs improvement, and some public health standards need to be revised. Conclusions: The implementation of current public health standards can provide strong technical support for the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic. The experience obtained from COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control might promote the further improvement of the health standardization system.

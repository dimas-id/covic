Three different synthesis methods were applied to obtain TiO2 nanoparticles: microwave-assisted hydrothermal (TiO2-MW), sonochemical (TiO2-US), and polymeric precursor (TiO2-PP). The nanoparticles thus obtained presented 93% (TiO2-MW) and 92% (TiO2-US) anatase phase, and TiO2-PP 93% rutile phase. The TiO2-US sample performed best during the Prozac® photodegradation assays because of its lipophilic surface, attributable to the C-H groups therein. Additionally, adsorption rate and photodegradation were optimized by adjusting Prozac® solution to pH ~ 8. Following Prozac® photodegradation, quantitative monitoring of its by-products (PPMA, MAEB, and TFMP) was done using HPLC. This quantitative approach led us to conclude that semiconductor photoactivity cannot be discussed solely in terms of the main compound. Lastly, it was seen that these by-products compete with each other in the degradation mechanisms and are influenced by different materials. Graphical abstract.

Previously, fusion of established T cell lines or clones has been claimed to be difficult. We now report our experiences in the fusion of both long term cultures of rat T cell clones and mouse T cell lines to rat W/Fu (C58NT)D. Upon fusion of rat T cell clones the hybrids obtained expressed antigen specificities identical to those of the parent clones. In addition, C58 was used for interspecies hybridisation of murine T cell lines. The specificity of intra- and inter-species hybrids was maintained by subcloning. We conclude that the C58 cell line can be used to generate continuously growing monoclonal T-cell reagents of sufficient stability using both intra- and inter-species hybri disation.

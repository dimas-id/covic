The aim of the current survey is collecting laboratory findings, analysis them and reporting a specific pattern for help to COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: To collect laboratory characteristics, we searched "PubMed" electronic database with the following keywords: "COVID-19" "2019 novel coronavirus" "laboratory findings" "clinical characteristics". Results: Once the initial searches 493 studies were yielded. After removing duplicates studies 480 studies were remained. The 12 studies obtained from the literature, of which 58.3% (7) of studies were case-control, and 41.7% remaining studies were designed as cross-sectional. Conclusion: The result of the current study showed that in the early stage of COVID-19 infection, maybe there are not significant laboratory findings, but with disease progression, the one or more than signs include increasing AST, ALT, LDH, CK, CRP, ESR, WBC, neutrophil, and decreasing Hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count can be seen. Elevating D-dimer and FDP are associated with ARDS development and can be used as prognostic factors. Keywords: COVID-19; laboratory findings; prognostic factors

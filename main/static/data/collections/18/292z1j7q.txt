In this paper, a series of imidazo[2,l-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles have been prepared by reacting 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole with various phenacyl bromides in alcohol. The structures of all the derivatives were con- firmed by IR, NMR and mass spectroscopy. All the derivatives have been tested for cytostatic activity against human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), murine leukemia cell line (L1210), and antiviral activity. Among the tested compounds, derivatives 5b, 5c, and 7a were cytostatic between 49-63 mM against Hela and 7g was cytotoxic at 23 mM against L1210 and CEM cell lines. Compounds 5h and 7h emerged as antiviral agents with slight activity against influenza A and B.

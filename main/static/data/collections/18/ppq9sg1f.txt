AIM No studies have tested disinfectants on mature multispecies oral biofilms on titanium substrata. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of commonly used antimicrobial agents in decontamination of multispecies mature oral biofilm on sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched (SLA) titanium implants. METHODS SLA titanium disks were inoculated with dental plaque and cultured anaerobically for 21 days. The disks were rinsed with 0.9% NaCl, exposed for 2 min. to tetracycline paste, 1% Chlorhexidine gel (CHX), 35% phosphoric acid gel (Etch) or a novel chemical formula (0.3% cetrimide, 0.1% CHX and 0.5% EDTA) and then rinsed again with 0.9% NaCl. Bacteria were quantified from scanning electron micrographs of the implant surfaces. Living bacteria were quantified with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Rinsing the surfaces with 0.9% NaCl removed the majority of the biofilm. However, bacteria persisted in all specimens and none of the disinfectants was superior to the double saline rinse group. CLSM analysis showed that CHX and Etch groups had a statistically significant reduction of viable bacteria, although small. Overall the results show that many disinfection agents used in the clinic are ineffective in biofilm removal and leave live bacteria on the surface.

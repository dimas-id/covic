Abstract The threat of re-introduction of rabies virus into the United Kingdom exists on several levels. Firstly, importation of live animals into the UK continues to challenge the regulations in place to ensure that the virus does not enter the country. Secondly, the indigenous bat population is known to carry a virus genetically related to rabies virus, the European bat lyssavirus (EBLV). Molecular characterization of this virus has further characterized it as being EBLV type 2, genetically distinct from a similar virus that has caused several human deaths across Europe. Finally, a lack of awareness of the threat of rabies and related viruses to travelers visiting endemic areas also constitutes a re-introduction threat to the UK population. This review will address the most recent cases of lyssavirus infection, in both humans and animals, either contracted within the UK or from abroad. We highlight the current diagnostic necessity for testing indigenous and foreign cases and comment on current UK government policy in light of a European call to harmonise rabies legislation across Europe.

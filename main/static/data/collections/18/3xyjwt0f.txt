Localized bioimpedance (BIA) was measured with a single frequency phase-sensitive analyzer at 50 kHz in three post-traumatic types of injuries on four professional soccer players: (1) myositis ossificans, (2) intramuscular seroma and (3) trochanteric (hip) bursitis. Normal reference value (no injury) was obtained from the contra lateral not injured limb at a mirror-like location of the injury. The relative variations resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) at the time of injury was confronted with the not injured values. Relative variations between acute measurements and post medication ones on intramuscular seroma and bursitis have been computed. In intramuscular seroma and trochanteric bursitis we have obtained a percent of change between injury data and after medical intervention. On myositis ossificans, localized BIA showed a 7-8 % decrease in Xc whereas the percent of change of R was negligible (1 %). These percent of changes are in concordance with histological evidence. In the case of a presence of seroma or the lower thigh and trochanteric bursitis, the soft tissue cavity accumulates fluid. Post-injury localized BIA, relative with respect to non-injured side, confirmed sizeable soft tissue destruction evidenced by 50 % decrease of Xc and 24-31 % decrease of R due to interstitial fluid accumulation. Once the seroma and the blood in the bursitis was removed the localized the immediate post-injury BIA parameters increased as follows: a) intramuscular seroma + 10 % on R and + 74 % of Xc; b) trochanteric bursitis + 20 % of R and +24 % of Xc. Localized BIA other than classifying soft tissue injuries, can be useful to understand the pathophysiology and structural impairments of other kind of injuries and to understand their behavior.

Abstract Objective To identify markers associated with in-hospital death in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia. Patients and Methods Retrospective, cohort study of 140 patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19 associated pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation admitted from January 28th, 2020 to February 28th, 2020, and followed up through March, 13th 2020 in Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. Results Of 140 patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, 51.4% were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 â‰¤90% were older, more likely to be men, to have hypertension and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 >90%. Overall, 36 (25.7%) patients died during hospitalization after a median 14-day follow-up. Higher post-oxygen supplementation SpO2 levels were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-unit SpO2 0.93, 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.95, P < .001). SpO2 cutoff of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival. Dyspnea was also independently associated with death in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 2.60; 95% confidence interval 1.24-5.43, P = .01). Conclusions In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, hypoxemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These results may help guide clinical management of severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.

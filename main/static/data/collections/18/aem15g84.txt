Abstract Lung disease is common in the tropics; lower respiratory tract infections are a major cause of mortality, especially in children under 5 years of age. The World Health Organization has launched strategies to tackle this killer of children. Infections, including tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, find vulnerable hosts in the tropics where human immunodeficiency virus co-infection is widespread, especially in India and sub-Saharan Africa. Parasitic infections can cause pulmonary manifestations (e.g., pleural effusion and cavitary lesions). Blood and pulmonary eosinophilia are common in such infections. Non-communicable lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer associated with tobacco use, contribute to mortality, particularly where there is poor access to health structures.

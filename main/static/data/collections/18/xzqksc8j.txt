SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic which is putting strain on the health-care system and global economy. There is much pressure to develop both preventative and curative therapies for SARS-CoV-2 as there is no evidence to support therapies to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Medications that inhibit certain steps of virus life cycle that are currently used to treat other illnesses such as Malaria, Ebola, HIV and Hepatitis C are being studied for use against SARS-CoV-2. To date, data is limited for medications that facilitate clinical improvement of COVID-19 infections.

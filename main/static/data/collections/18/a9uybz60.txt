Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top ten leading causes of death worldwide. The causative agent of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Acute tuberculous pneumonia (TP) is an acute form of pulmonary TB. However, acute TP and non-tuberculous community-acquired pneumonia can be easily confused, resulting in deterioration of TP due to delayed treatment. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute TP is crucial in order to stop the transmission of TB. Moreover, development of new diagnostic tools (technologies and approaches), and flexible application of different therapy schemes will help to reduce the incidence of TP and promote the goal of ending the TB epidemic.

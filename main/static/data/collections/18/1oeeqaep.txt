Particulate matter (PM) pollution has become a serious public health issue, especially with outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. However, most present filters are bulky, opaque, and show low‐efficiency PM(0.3)/pathogen interception and inevitable trade‐off between PM removal and air permeability. Here, a unique electrospraying–netting technique is used to create spider‐web‐inspired network generator (SWING) air filters. Manipulation of the dynamic of the Taylor cone and phase separation of its ejected droplets enable the generation of 2D self‐charging nanostructured networks on a large scale. The resultant SWING filters show exceptional long‐range electrostatic property driven by aeolian vibration, enabling self‐sustained PM adhesion. Combined with their Steiner‐tree‐structured pores (size 200–300 nm) consisting of nanowires (diameter 12 nm), the SWING filters exhibit high efficiency (>99.995% PM(0.3) removal), low air resistance (<0.09% atmosphere pressure), high transparency (>82%), and remarkable bioprotective activity for biohazard pathogens. This work may shed light on designing new fibrous materials for environmental and energy applications.

Abstract Viruses of human or animal origin can spread in the environment and infect people via water and food. These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters. Viruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation, recombination, and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness. While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water, the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses, but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied. The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past, but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments. Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.

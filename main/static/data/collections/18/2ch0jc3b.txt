The effects of temperature on extracellular secretion of the α-cyclodextrin glucosyltransferase (α-CGTase) from Paenibacillus macerans JFB05-01 by Escherichia coli were investigated. When protein expression was induced at constant temperature, the greatest amount of extracellular recombinant α-CGTase was produced at 25 °C. Higher or lower induction temperatures were not conducive to extracellular secretion of recombinant α-CGTase. To enhance extracellular secretion of α-CGTase by E. coli, a two-stage temperature control strategy was adopted. When expression was induced at 25 °C for 32 h, and then the temperature was shifted to 30 °C, the extracellular α-CGTase activity at 90 h was 45% higher than that observed when induction was performed at a constant temperature of 25 °C. Further experiments suggested that raising the induction temperature can benefit the transport of recombinant enzyme and compensate for the decreased rate of recombinant enzyme synthesis during the later stage of expression. This report provides a new method of optimizing the secretory expression of recombinant enzymes by E. coli.

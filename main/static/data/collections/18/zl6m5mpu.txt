UNLABELLED Laparoscopic single access technique is a next step in development of minimally invasive surgery. The aim of the study was to present results of different laparoscopic single incision procedures and evaluate application of this technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS 102 patients (15 males and 87 females) who underwent laparoscopic single incision procedure from 15th October 2009 to 31st December 2012 were included in the study. RESULTS In the analyzed period we performed 72 cholecystectomies (70.6%), 8 left adrenalectomies (7.8%), 3 right adrenalectomies (2.9%), 7 splenectomies (6.9%), 5 spleen cysts unroofings (4.9%), 2 appendectomies (2%), 1 Nissen fundoplication procedure (1%), 1 removal of the adrenal cyst (1%) and 3 concomitant splenectomies and cholecystectomies (2.9%). There were 3 technical conversions to multiport laparoscopy, but no conversion to open technique. Complications were observed in 5 patients (4.9%). Average operation time was 79 min (SD=40), average hospitalization time 2.4 day (SD=1.4). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic single incision technique is a safe method and can be used as a reasonable alternative to multiport laparoscopy in different minimally invasive procedures especially in young patients to whom an excellent cosmetic effect is particularly important.

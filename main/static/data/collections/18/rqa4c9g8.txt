Here we examine examples of the farming of coevolutionary systems, focusing on the mutually amplifying roles of large-scale psychosocial stress, economic structure, and reductionist interventions in the ecology and evolution of highly adaptive disease organisms. We find, in general, that population-level socioeconomic and other stressors, in synergism with reductionist interventions, are precisely suited to trigger mesoscale resonance coevolutionary resilience domain shifts affecting rapidly evolving pathogens.

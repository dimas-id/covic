The number of cyber-attacks are continuing to rise globally. It is therefore vital for organisations to develop the necessary skills to secure their assets and to protect critical national infrastructure. In this short paper, we outline upon human-computer interaction elements which should be considered when developing a cybersecurity training platform, in an effort to maintain levels of user engagement. We provide an overview of existing training platforms before covering specialist cyber ranges. Aspects of human-computer interaction are noted with regards to their relevance in the context of cyber ranges. We conclude with design suggestions when developing a cyber range platform.

Abstract In Thailand, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of subtype H5N1 had been isolated from various wild birds during the HPAI outbreak in poultries. In this study, we examined the pathogenicity of two wild bird isolates (A/Pigeon/Thailand/VSMU-7-NPT/2004; Pigeon04 and A/Tree sparrow/Ratchaburi/VSMU-16-RBR/2005; T.sparrow05) in mice. They showed similar replication in several organs and lethal outcome. However, on day 3 post-infection, Pigeon04 induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 and TNFÎ±) and MIP-2, neutrophil chemoattractant, in the lungs, resulting in severe pneumonia that was accompanied by neutrophil infiltration. In contrast, on day 7 post-infection, T.sparrow05 induced the expression of several cytokines to a greater extent than Pigeon04; it also potently induced mRNA expression of several cytokines in brains of the infected mice that triggered frequent inflammatory events. In sum, our study demonstrated that two HPAI viruses induced different host responses, despite having similar replications, resulting in lethal outcome in mice.

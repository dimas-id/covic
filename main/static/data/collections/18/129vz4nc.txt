The common cold is a highly prevalent, uncomplicated upper airway disease. However, rhinovirus (RV) infection can lead to exacerbation of asthma, with worsening in airway hyperresponsiveness and bronchial inflammation. The current authors questioned whether such involvement of the intrapulmonary airways is disease specific. Twelve nonatopic, healthy subjects (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) >80% predicted, provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) >8 mg x mL(-1)) were experimentally infected with RV16. Next to PC20 and the maximal response to methacholine (MFEV1 and MV'40p), the numbers of mucosal inflammatory cells and epithelial intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression in bronchial biopsies were assessed before and 6 days after RV16 inoculation. RV16 infection induced a small but consistent increase in maximal airway narrowing, without a change in PC20. There was a significant increase in bronchial epithelial ICAM-1 expression after RV16, whereas inflammatory cell counts did not change. Nevertheless, the change in the number of submucosal CD3+ cells was correlated with the change in MV'40p. In conclusion, rhinovirus infection in normal subjects induces a limited, but significant increase in maximal airway narrowing, which is associated with changes in bronchial T-cell numbers. Together with the upregulation of bronchial epithelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1, these findings indicate that, even in healthy subjects, rhinovirus infection affects the intrapulmonary airways.

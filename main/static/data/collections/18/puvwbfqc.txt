In light of recent disasters and terrorist attacks, private and public organisations alike are becoming increasingly concerned with their ability to continue operating in spite of unforeseen events. This paper describes a project conducted at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital to develop a Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework, and outlines the learning experience. It provides a Framework and describes the key issues to be considered when initiating BCM in a health organisation, concluding that a project management approach can be used to establish a framework for BCM.

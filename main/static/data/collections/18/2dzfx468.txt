The viral RNA shedding time of SARS-CoV-2 has not been well characterized. Clinical data were collected and compared between patients with short and long viral RNA shedding (in the first and last quarter). The probability of recurrent positive RT-PCR results decreased sharply to 4.8% after three consecutive negatives. At least three consecutive negatives were suitable for the criteria of end of viral RNA shedding. The viral RNA shedding from respiratory tract in patients with normal B cell count was significantly shorter than patients with decreased B cell on admission (median [IQR], 11[9-13] vs 16[12-20] days, P=0.001).

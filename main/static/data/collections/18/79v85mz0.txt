Many people have doubts about the factual accuracy of online news, while still trusting the press releases of police departments. To enable an easy corroboration of online news about police-related events, we build a search engine for press releases of police departments. Addressing the German “market”, the search engine takes the URL of a German piece of online news as input and retrieves relevant press releases of the German police. Comparing different query-by-document strategies in a TREC-style evaluation on 105 topics, we show that our system is able to accurately identify relevant press releases if there are any.

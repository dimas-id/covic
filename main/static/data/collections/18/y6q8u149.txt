Killian-Jamieson diverticulum (KJD) is a rarely encountered esophageal diverticulum which attributes to several symptoms. Clinically, KJD should be differentiated from the most common type of esophageal herniation, i.e., Zenker's diverticulum (ZD). The two diverticula may present in a similar fashion, and treatments have evolved from transcervical to a minimally invasive endoscopic approach in recent years. We present a case of an 88-year-old male with symptomatic esophageal diverticulum. Barium swallow esophagogram and flexible esophagoscopy demonstrated a large KJD with food debris retention. Endoscopic diverticulotomy using a stapler was performed successfully without injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). A literature review and discussion concerning etiology, clinical presentations, and radiographic characteristics of KJD was conducted, and comparison between open and endoscopic method for esophageal diverticulum was also carried out.

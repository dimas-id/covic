BACKGROUND Surgical approach into the fissural parenchyma may be an important and modifiable factor for the prevention of air leak after anatomical lung resections. Fissureless fissure-last technique has been described as useful technique to reduce air leak, yet in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) data are limited and mostly on the upper lobes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of fissureless fissure-last VATS 'non-upper' lobectomies and the impact of it on the immediate outcome, especially relating to air leak. METHODS This study is a monocentric single-surgeon retrospective analysis on prospectively collected data. During 24 months, 46 patients underwent VATS 'non-upper' lobectomy or lower bilobectomy, with conventional (VATS-c) technique in 20 and fissureless fissure-last (VATS-f) technique in 26 patients. Results were evaluated according to preoperative, perioperative and postoperative parameters. RESULTS There were no differences between VATS-c and VATS-f groups in any characteristics or peri- and postoperative variables, except the number of staplers, where it was significantly higher in VATS-c group (MVATS-c = 5.7; MVATS-f = 7.7; P = 0.001). Operation time did not differ between the groups, but showed gender-related difference, being longer in males (MVATS-c = 188; MVATS-f = 157; P = 0.04). Prevalence of air leak was 20%; prolonged air leak (PAL) (>5 days) being 11% and PAL (>7 days) 0%. Patients with air leak were older by tendency (MVATS-c = 74.9; MVATS-f = 66.5; P = 0.08), had more complications (P = 0.025; relative risk = 2.65) and stayed longer at hospital (MVATS-c = 10.8; MVATS-f = 7.7; P = 0.02). Postoperative complications were present in 24% of patients. CONCLUSION VATS-f lobectomy is safe and feasible not only for 'upper' but also for 'non-upper' lobes. When applied to properly selected patients, it may reduce air leak and PAL and thus may potentially reduce the rate of complications.

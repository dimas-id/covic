This study reviewed the serial rRT‐PCR results of 37 patients admitted to our hospital in Wuhan, China, who had three or more sequential negative results prior to discharge. Of these 37 patients, 14 (~38%) had a positive rRT‐PCR result after a negative result during convalescence, and 5 (~14%) had a positive rRT‐PCR result after two consecutive negative results during convalescence. These results suggest that it may be necessary to require that patients have three consecutive negative results prior to discharge, to ensure that they do not spread infection among members of their household, or in the community. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it is not currently the standard of care to require patients to have three consecutive negative results prior to discharge. Our results suggest that a relatively high proportion of patients may continue to shed SARS‐CoV‐2 after they have clinically recovered, and thus may transmit the infection to others.

Although extracorporeal septorhinoplasty is the most powerful technique for correcting deviated and leaning noses, many investigators have abandoned it because of keystone problems. The authors defined a new neoseptum fixation technique and used it in 10 patients in 2016. Preoperative and postoperative Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale and peak nasal inspiratory flow measurement, and septal indexes of the patients were compared. There was statistically significant improvement in the respiratory condition of all patients. No recurrence or dorsal irregularity has been observed. This new, easily applicable, and robust fixation method of extracorporeal septorhinoplasty may be a definitive solution to prevent keystone irregularities. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Therapeutic, IV.

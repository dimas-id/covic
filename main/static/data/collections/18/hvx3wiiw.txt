In this study, the authors examined fear related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among 2 samples of hospital staff in Hong Kong. Sample 1 included health care workers (n=82) and was assessed during the peak of the SARS epidemic. Sample 2 included hospital staff who recovered from SARS (n=97). The results show that participants in both samples had equal, if not more, concern about infecting others (especially family members) than being self-infected. Sample 1 participants had stronger fear related to infection than Sample 2 participants, who seemed to be concerned more about other health problems and discrimination. Participants with lower self-efficacy tended to have higher fear related to SARS. Fear related to SARS was also correlated positively with posttraumatic stress symptoms among respondents of Sample 2 (recovered staff). Interventions based on these findings are described.

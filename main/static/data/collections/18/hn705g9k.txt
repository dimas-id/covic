Seasonal and novel influenza infections have the potential to cause worldwide pandemics. In order to properly treat infected patients and to limit its spread, a rapid, accurate and automatic influenza diagnostic tool needs to be developed. This study therefore presents a new integrated microfluidic system for the rapid detection of influenza infections. It integrated a suction-type, pneumatic-driven microfluidic control module, a magnetic bead-based fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) and an end-point optical detection module. This new system can successfully distinguish between influenza A and B using a single chip test within 15 min automatically, which is faster than existing devices. By utilizing the micromixers to thoroughly wash out the sputum-like mucus, this microfluidic system could be used for the diagnosis of clinical specimens and reduced the required sample volume to 40 Î¼L. Furthermore, the results of diagnostic assays from 86 patient specimens have demonstrated that this system has 84.8 % sensitivity and 75.0 % specificity. This developed system may provide a powerful platform for the fast screening of influenza infections.

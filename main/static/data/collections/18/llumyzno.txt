Abstract In Spain, Home Care as a fundamental tool of Primary Health Care, has had uneven development both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, although it initially played a relevant role in the control and monitoring of infected people and their families. However, at no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES We sought to develop a simulation model that accurately replicates the challenges of the thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis. This model is intended to serve as a teaching tool during the introduction to, and development of, the skills required to perform a thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis during an Ivor Lewis minimally invasive esophagectomy. METHODS The simulation model uses porcine tissue placed within an artificial hemithorax and covered with a synthetic skin. The model is draped to simulate a realistic operative setting, and ports are placed in standard surgical fashion. Dissection of the esophagus from the mediastinum is then performed, followed by the creation of an esophagogastric anastomosis. The effectiveness of the training model was evaluated using volunteer general and thoracic surgery residents at varying stages of surgical training. The quality of the anastomoses created were evaluated using both objective and subjective criteria, and successful anastomoses were tested for leaks using hydrostatic pressure. RESULTS Objective evaluation showed that successful completion of the anastomosis task increased with the number of attempts, with 100% of participants successfully completing an anastomosis by the final attempt. The time to completion of a successful anastomosis also improved across successive attempts. Moreover, objective measures also showed improvement over time based on the graded quality of the completed anastomosis. CONCLUSION As surgical techniques continue to evolve, so must the means by which they are taught. This simulation model shows effectiveness in the training of general and thoracic surgery residents performing thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis during the Ivor Lewis minimally invasive esophagectomy.

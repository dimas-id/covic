Limited information is available regarding reversal of gastric bypass. While reversal will lead to weight regain and return of comorbid conditions, procedure reversal is sometimes necessary due to complications. The decision to reverse versus revise is difficult; currently, there are no established guidelines. The objective was to review one center's experience with reversals of gastric bypass and jejunoileal bypass procedures and identify potential indications as well as technical feasibility and short-term outcomes. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database from 1999 to 2010 was conducted; 12 patients who underwent reversal of non-banding bariatric procedures were included. There was no major perioperative morbidity in elective patients; one patient whose reversal was part of a second-look operation had massive intestinal necrosis. There was one (8.3 %) non-procedure-related postoperative death. No leaks were identified in any of the reversals. Leak rates were compared with other revisional procedures such as reversals, revisions, and conversions, with no statistical significance regarding leak rates between all three groups; however, revisions and conversions were performed via open or laparoscopic approach, while reversals were performed exclusively via open approach. Reversals of bariatric (non-banding) procedures, either combined or purely malabsorptive, are technically challenging. Indications remain poorly defined. In our experience, short gut syndrome, renal failure, marginal ulceration, and malnutrition were the most common indications for reversal, differing from previously published data. Indications can depend on patient and surgeon preferences, but primarily on surgeon experience and type of complications. Based on this initial experience, these operations can be performed using the open approach with good outcomes.

Jackson et al (2020) have recently described the extraordinary times we face as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As we write, the number of cases and the associated mortality continues to rise. In the United Kingdom (UK) a number of 'Nightingale Hospitals' have been constructed within large arenas. Clinical staff who have recently left National Health Service (NHS) are being asked to return to practice to support the rapidly escalating numbers of patients, and nursing students from year two of their degree programme onwards are being asked to opt-in to an extended placement working to further bolster the numbers of care staff available.

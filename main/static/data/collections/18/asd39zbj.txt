The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a threat to the global healthcare system and economic security. As of July 2020, no specific drugs or vaccines are yet available for COVID-19, fast and accurate diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 is essential in slowing down the spread of COVID-19 and for efficient implementation of control and containment strategies. Magnetic immunoassay is a novel and emerging topic representing the frontiers of current biosensing and magnetics areas. The past decade has seen rapid growth in applying magnetic tools for biological and biomedical applications. Recent advances in magnetic materials and nanotechnologies have transformed current diagnostic methods to nanoscale and pushed the detection limit to early stage disease diagnosis. Herein, this review covers the literatures of magnetic immunoassay platforms for virus and pathogen detections, before COVID-19. We reviewed the popular magnetic immunoassay platforms including magnetoresistance (MR) sensors, magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Magnetic Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic kits are also reviewed aiming at developing plug-and-play diagnostics to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as well as preventing future epidemics. In addition, other platforms that use magnetic materials as auxiliary tools for enhanced pathogen and virus detections are also covered. The goal of this review is to inform the researchers of diagnostic and surveillance platforms for SARS-CoV-2 and their performances.

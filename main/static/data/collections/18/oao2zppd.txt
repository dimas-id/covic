In December 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Hubei province in China. The disease has since spread worldwide and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. We describe the case of a 65-year-old woman who clinically recovered from COVID-19 but showed persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 for 51 days. LEARNING POINTS: A case of persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is described. Some tests may pick up viral RNA fragments, giving a false positive result. The quarantining of infected patients to limit possible SARS-CoV-2 spread is important.

Effect of Concanavalin (ConA) on attachment of three strains of Transmissible Gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGE) of swine was investigated in cell culture. Whatever the virus strain, reduction of virus plaques number is observed when viral suspension is incubated with cells together or after addition of ConA. Intensity of inhibition is related with ConA concentration. ConA treatment of preinfected cell cultures has no effect on plaque formation. Addition of alpha-methyl-D-mannoside inhibits the ConA activity. Treatment of cells with metaperiodate has no effect on plaque formation and ConA activity. Our results suggest that ConA inhibits formation of plaques by TGE coronavirus.

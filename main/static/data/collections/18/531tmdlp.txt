Summary In hospitalized children and adults, the temporal relationship of viruses causing influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and influenza has not been well described. During the 2015â€“2016 influenza season at our hospital, the dynamic interrelationships between ILI viruses (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4, rhinoviruses/enteroviruses, and coronaviruses) and influenza A were characterized in 768 hospitalized children and adults.

Liposomes (phospholipid bilayer vesicles) represent an almost ideal carrier system for the preparation of synthetic vaccines due to their biodegradability and capacity to protect and transport molecules of different physicochemical properties (including size, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and charge). Liposomal carriers can be applied by invasive (e.g. i.m., s.c., i.d.) as well as non-invasive (transdermal and mucosal) routes. In the last 15 years, liposome vaccine technology has matured and several vaccines containing liposome-based adjuvants have been approved for human and veterinary use or have reached late stages of clinical evaluation. Given the intensifying interest in liposome-based vaccines, it is important to understand precisely how liposomes interact with the immune system and how they stimulate immunity. It has become clear that the physicochemical properties of liposomal vaccines – method of antigen attachment, lipid composition, bilayer fluidity, particle charge, and other properties – exert strong effects on the resulting immune response. In this chapter we will discuss some aspects of liposomal vaccines including the effect of novel and emerging immunomodulator incorporation. The application of metallochelating nanoliposomes for development of recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease will be presented as a suitable example.

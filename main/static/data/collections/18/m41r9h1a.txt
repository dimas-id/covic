One of the compulsory secret exceptions derives from the situation within which the data about patient must be provided to the third person in the interest of his/her health protection. Despite some interpretation difficulties any providing information according to this legal exception is allowed only on the base of proved and re-examined facts. The state of emergency itself is not the base for the compulsory secret breach.

UNLABELLED represents a safe and complete technique to remove benign lesions of the rectum not treatable by endoscopy and malignant rectal lesions at early stage. It is a valid alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), to conventional transanal surgery and to transabdominal resection. METHODS In our operating Unit we performed a resection of 8 voluminous adenoma in the rectal ampulla with SILSTM-Port. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was of 51.1 years, the mean BMI was 23. There were not intra or post-operative complications nor conversions to conventional transanal excision or major resective surgery. The postoperative course was normal. The average time of hospitalization was 3 days. CONCLUSIONS TEVA is easier to perform than TEM and does not require a long training and specific and expensive material as the TEM does. TEVA might go to replace completely TEM. KEY WORDS Rectal tumours, SILS, TEVA.

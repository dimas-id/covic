Abstract During routine electron microscopy of fecal samples from diarrheic dogs dated from 2000 virus particles resembling circovirus in shape and size were detected in two samples (V2177/00; V3374/00). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) amplified DNA recovered from both samples. Sequencing of PCR amplificates (V2177/00) obtained with PCV2-specific primer pairs revealed a genome size of 1768bp. The nucleotide sequence was highly similar (98% nucleotide identity) to the PCV2a reference sequence.

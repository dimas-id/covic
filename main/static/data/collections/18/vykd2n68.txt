Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare condition characterized by the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). While the precise pathophysiology is not entirely understood, it is believed that dysregulation of the immune system is a primary contributor to the condition. ES has been observed in viral infections including hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, varicella‐zoster, and Epstein‐Barr viruses (1‐4). Initial cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) were first described in early December 2019 and has now spread to a global pandemic. While knowledge about COVID‐19 continues to evolve, clinicians have reported hematologic complications associated with the virus.

The Outreach DAC is an intermediate-sized catheter designed for use with the Merci clot retriever in acute stroke. We investigated its utility as an adjunctive device during AVM pedicle embolization. In the authors' opinion, the DAC provided additional guide-catheter and microcatheter support, improved selective angiographic visualization of AVM angioarchitecture, aided microcatheter removal from its embedded position in the AVM Onyx cast, and enhanced local microcatheter control and safety, compared with embolization with the guide and microcatheter alone.

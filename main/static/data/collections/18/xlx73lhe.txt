In many areas, researchers might think that a differential equation model is required, but one might be forced to use an approximate difference equation model if data is only available at discrete points in time. In this paper, a detailed comparison is given of the behavior of continuous and discrete models for two representative time-delay models, namely a model for HIV and an extended logistic growth model. For each model, there are seven different time-delay versions because there are seven different positions to include time delays. For the seven different time-delay versions of each model, proofs are given of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov–Hopf bifurcations in the differential equations and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations in the difference equations. We show that only five of the seven time-delay versions have bifurcations and that all bifurcation versions have supercritical limit cycles with one having a repelling cycle and four having attracting cycles. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the analytical results and to show that critical times for Neimark–Sacker bifurcations are less than critical times for Andronov–Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization tends to zero.

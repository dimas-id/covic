BACKGROUND The feasibility of using reduced-port laparoscopic total gastrectomy (RPLTG) for the treatment of gastric cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to address the potentially important advantages of this surgical technique. METHODS Between April 2002 and February 2014, 90 patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomies, performed by a single surgeon. Of these, 45 patients underwent RPLTG and 45 patients underwent conventional laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (CLATG). Short-term outcomes were compared to evaluate the feasibility of RPLTG for gastric cancer. RESULTS There were several significant differences between the RPLTG and CLATG groups in short-term outcomes: the mean total operation durations were significantly longer in the RPLTG group (319.0 min) than in the CLATG group (259.0 min). However, the mean volume of blood loss, the degree of lymph node dissection, and the number of dissected lymph nodes did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that RPLTG could be an acceptable and satisfactory procedure for the treatment of gastric cancer requiring total gastrectomy for surgeons sufficiently experienced in CLATG.

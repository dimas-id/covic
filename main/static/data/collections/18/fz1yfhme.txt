Background Spain is one of the countries that has been most affected by COVID-19 disease. However, the emotional distress on the Spanish population remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of emotional disorders and related symptoms and to assess the influence of sociodemographic characteristics on this population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey using an online platform. Participation was completely voluntary. Sociodemographic variables were collected and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic were assessed through three questionnaires: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-Panic Disorder (PHQ-PD). Chi-squared statistics were applied to determine the influence of sociodemographic variables on symptom severity and diagnosis. Results Most respondents (n=1753) were female (76.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 (12.9) years; 39.1% were married and 39.5% held a high school degree. Severe and moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression were high (6.5% and 14.3%; 9.9% and 12.9%, respectively) and more than one in four participants (25.7%) experienced a panic attack. A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD; 12.2% for MDD; and 17.2% for PD. Significant risk factors were as follows: female, young adult, single, unemployed, and low income. Conclusion Due to limitations related to the study design (convenience sample), the findings of these study may not be applicable to the general population. Nonetheless, the high prevalence of emotional symptoms and disorders in this sample suggests that mental health interventions are urgently needed in Spain.

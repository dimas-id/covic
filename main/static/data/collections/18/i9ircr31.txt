Interleukin-12 is a lymphokine that triggers gamma interferon secretion by various cells and differentiation of T-helper lymphocytes towards the Th1 subtype. Since viruses are potent inducers of gamma interferon production and elicit immune responses most probably mediated by Th1 cells, like B-cell immunoglobulin G2a secretion, we analyzed interleukin-12 message expression after infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and mouse adenovirus. Our results indicated that the message for the p40 component of interleukin-12 was transiently increased shortly after infection. Interleukin-12 was expressed mainly by macrophages. Therefore, production of interleukin-12 might constitute the initial event that would determine the subsequent characteristics of the immune response elicited by viral infections.

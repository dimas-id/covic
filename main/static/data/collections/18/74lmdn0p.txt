Vaccinia-virus (VV) recombinants encoding either the nucleocapsid (N) or the spike (S) protein of MHV-JHM were constructed to study the role of the immune response against defined coronavirus antigens. For the S-protein, a fusogenic (Sfus+) or non fusogenic variant (Sfus-) of the gene was inserted into the VV genome. A strong protection against acute encephalomyelitis (AE) was mediated in Lewis rats which were immunized by VV-Sfus+ and challenged with an otherwise lethal dose of MHV-JHM before the induction of S-specific IgG antibodies. By contrast, a VV recombinant encoding a variant non fusogenic S-protein or the N-protein was not capable conferring protection. In addition, we demonstrated that MHV-JHM S-specific IgG antibodies elicited before MHV-JHM challenge modulated the disease process, changing it from an acute disease to subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE).

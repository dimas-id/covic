Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is highly invasive and uniformly fatal, with median survival<20months after diagnosis even with the most aggressive treatment that includes surgery, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy. Cisplatin is a particularly potent chemotherapeutic agent, but its use to treat GBM is limited by severe systemic toxicity and inefficient penetration of brain tumor tissue even when it is placed directly in the brain within standard delivery systems. We describe the development of cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles that are small enough (70nm in diameter) to move within the porous extracellular matrix between cells and that possess a dense polyethylene glycol (PEG) corona that prevents them from being trapped by adhesion as they move through the brain tumor parenchyma. As a result, these "brain penetrating nanoparticles" penetrate much deeper into brain tumor tissue compared to nanoparticles without a dense PEG corona following local administration by either manual injection or convection enhanced delivery. The nanoparticles also provide controlled release of cisplatin in effective concentrations to kill the tumor cells that they reach without causing toxicity-related deaths that were observed when cisplatin was infused into the brain without a delivery system. Median survival time of rats bearing orthotopic glioma was significantly enhanced when cisplatin was delivered in brain penetrating nanoparticles (median survival not reached; 80% long-term survivors) compared to cisplatin in conventional un-PEGylated particles (median survival=40days), cisplatin alone (median survival=12days) or saline-treated controls (median survival=28days).

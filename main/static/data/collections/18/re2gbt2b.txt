The 11-year experience with open (OS) and laparoscopic (LS) splenectomy at a single center is reported. A total of 201 splenectomies were performed and clinical and demographic data were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified according to the type of operation as LS or OS. The mean age of patients was 45.1 +/- 17.1, and 141 patients were male. Out of 43 LS, 40 were done for hematologic causes, and they had a significantly shorter hospital stay compared to OS for hematologic causes (6.87 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.84 +/- 2.9 days; p = 0.000003) and significantly less requirement for blood transfusion (26.2 +/- 93.4 vs. 132.4 +/- 252.3 mL; p = 0.0152). In the OS group, comparison of patients with trauma and those with hematologic causes showed that significantly more males underwent surgery for trauma causes (35 of 43 vs. 16 of 21), hospital stay was longer (18.9 +/- 27.4 vs. 9.8 +/- 2.9 days) and blood requirement higher (708.1 +/- 603.7 mL vs. 132.4 +/- 252.3 mL; p = 0.0004, p = 0.047 and p = 0.000001, respectively). Laparoscopic splenectomy is a safe procedure for spleen removal.

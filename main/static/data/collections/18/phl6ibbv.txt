In the NCBI database, as on June 6, 2020, total number of available complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 across the world is 3617. The envelope protein of SARS-CoV2 possesses several non-synonymous mutations over the transmembrane domain and (C)-terminus in 15 (0.414%) genomes among 3617 available SARS-CoV2 genomes. More precisely, it is to be mentioned that 10(0.386%) out of 2588 genomes from the USA, 3(0.806%) from Asia, 1 (0.348%) from Europe and 1 (0.274%) from Oceania contain the missense mutations over the envelope proteins of SARS-CoV2 genomes. The C-terminus motif DLLV has been changed to DFLV and YLLV in the proteins QJR88103 (Australia: Victoria) and QKI36831 (China: Guangzhou) respectively, which might affect the binding of this motif with the host protein PALS1.

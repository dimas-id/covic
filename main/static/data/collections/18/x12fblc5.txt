The first COVID-19 cases in Mali were reported almost 1 month after the first case in the African continent. However, the outbreak continues to spread faster there than in other countries which, along with Mali, successfully tackled the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa. Given this context, specific actions targeting people living with HIV (PLWH) are needed to reinforce prevention. Community-based involvement is crucial to ensure continuity of care and treatment for PLWH. Furthermore, the health of frontline healthcare workers must take priority in any actions taken. The long-established trustful relationship between NGOs and PLWH in Mali is indispensable to disseminate key messages about COVID-19.

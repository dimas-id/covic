The authors report a patient with sexual exposure, clinical symptoms, MRI, virological and CSF findings suggestive of acute demyelinizating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as initial presentation of primary HIV infection. The aetiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ADEM is reviewed, and the sparse existing literature on ADEM and HIV infection is discussed.

The non-toxicological causes for elevated transaminases include infection, ischemia, metabolic derangements, malignancy, autoimmune disease, and primary graft failure after transplant. Acute liver failure is a common pathway for many conditions and insults, leading to massive hepatic necrosis or loss of normal hepatic function. Acute liver failure can be described in different subgroups by acuity of encephalopathy onset. Tools exist to aid in the prognostication of acute liver failure. Treatment of transaminitis and disposition of the patient are guided by the underlying diagnosis.

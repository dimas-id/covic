PURPOSE The extent of surgical trauma is reflected by systemic inflammatory response (SIR). The aim of this study was to assess SIR after single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) versus the standard laparoscopic approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty pigs were assigned into 4 groups: SILS (group SILS), laparoscopy using 4 trocars (group LAPSC), pneumoperitoneum (group PNE), or a sham-operation (group Sham) group. Blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours and 1 week postoperation to measure tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and C-reactive protein serum levels. RESULTS No significant changes were noted among groups for each time point studied regarding tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-18. C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower (P<0.05) in group PNE compared with the other groups at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week. CONCLUSIONS There is no difference in SIR after SILS versus the standard laparoscopic approach.

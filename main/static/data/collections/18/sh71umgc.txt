Protein interaction with polymers layers is a keystone in designing bio-nano devices. Polyamidoamines (PAMAMs) are well-known polymers. Zero aromatic core dendrimers (ZAC) are molecules with no proven toxic effect in cultured cells. When coating nanodevices with enzymatic systems, active sites are disturbed by an interaction with the biosystem surface. Computational methods were used in order to simulate, characterize, and quantify protein-polymer interaction. Protein corona, i.e., surface proteins disposed on a viral membrane or nanodevice outer surface, are crucial in interactions with a potential pharmacological target or receptor. Corona symmetry has been observed in the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a protein alpha 1 antitrypsin's a crystallographic structure was chosen. Protein-mono dendrimer layer systems were generated using in silico methods in order to simulate their interaction. Interactions were quantified using topological and quantum mechanical strategies. Results showed that PAMAM and ZAC interact differently with alpha 1 antitrypsin. Energy and topological surfaces of protein vary accordingly with the dendrimer monolayer. Topological surfaces have a higher sensibility in describing the interactions.

Infection of Aedes albopictus cells with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) leads to polykaryocyte formation below pH 6.2. This syncytium formation is accompanied by a decrease of the cellular ATP level. Addition of inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation leads to a rapid, total depletion of ATP in infected cells at pH 6 and results in an inhibition of polykaryocyte formation. However, when cells were exposed for only a few minutes to pH 6 in the presence of the inhibitors and then kept at pH 7.2, the ATP level partially recovered to values sufficient for syncytium formation. Similar results were obtained after ATP depletion induced by 2-deoxyglucose. Thus, it can be concluded that SFV-induced syncytium formation is an ATP-dependent event.

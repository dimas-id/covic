The effect of five propolis flavonoids on the infectivity and replication of some herpesvirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus strains has been studied. Experiments were performed in vitro in cell cultures using the viral plaque reduction technique. The cytotoxicity of flavonoids, including chrysine, kaempferol, acacetin, galangin and quercetin, was evaluated on uninfected monolayers to determine their effect on cell growth and viability. Chrysine and kaempferol caused a concentration-dependent reduction of intracellular replication of herpes-virus strains when monolayers were infected and subsequently cultured in a drug-containing medium. However, virus infectivity was not significantly affected. Acacetin and galangin had no effect on either the infectivity or replication of any of the viruses studied. Quercetin reduced infectivity and intracellular replication, but only at the highest concentrations tested.

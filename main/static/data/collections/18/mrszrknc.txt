Respiratory conditions constitute many of the diseases affecting all avian species, including gallinaceous birds. Clinical signs and gross lesions of different respiratory diseases are often similar, and establishing a definitive diagnosis may require ancillary laboratory testing. Determination of a specific diagnosis allows practitioners to select the most effective therapies and to prescribe a management program that prevents recurrence.

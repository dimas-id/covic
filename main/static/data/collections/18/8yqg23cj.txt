Standardization of transanal total mesorectal excision requires the delineation of the principal procedural components before implementation in practice. This technique is a bottom-up approach to a proctectomy with the goal of a complete mesorectal excision for optimal outcomes of oncologic treatment. A detailed stepwise description of the approach with technical pearls is provided to optimize one's understanding of this technique and contribute to reducing the inherent risk of beginning a new procedure. Surgeons should be trained according to standardized pathways including online preparation, observational or hands-on courses as well as the potential for proctorship of early cases experiences. Furthermore, technological pearls with access to the "video-in-photo" (VIP) function, allow surgeons to link some of the images in this article to operative demonstrations of certain aspects of this technique.

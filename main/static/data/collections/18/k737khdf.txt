ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, technical complexity and operational costs might have been barriers for its wide use and implementation in some jurisdictions, thereby decreasing accessibility. OBJECTIVE Our main goal was to test the feasibility of a novel rTMS protocol optimized for practicality, scalability and cost-effectiveness. We hypothesized that our novel rTMS protocol would be simple to implement and well-tolerated, but less costly and allow for more treatment capacity. METHODS Treatment was administered in an open-room setting, allowing a single technician to attend to multiple patients. Large non-focal parabolic coils held by custom-built arms allowed simple yet efficient and accurate placement. We employed a low-frequency (LF) 1 Hz stimulation protocol (360 pulses per session), delivered on the most affordable FDA-approved devices. MDD participants received an initial accelerated rTMS course (arTMS) of 6 sessions/day over 5 days (30 total), followed by a tapering course of daily sessions (up to 25) to decrease the odds of relapse. The self-reported Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was used to measure severity of depression. RESULTS Forty-eight (48) patients completed the arTMS course. No serious adverse events occurred, and all patients reported manageable pain levels. Response and remission rates were 35.4% and 27.1% on the BDI-II, respectively, at the end of the tapering course. CONCLUSION If rTMS could be delivered for lower cost at higher volume, while preserving efficacy, safety and tolerability, it could warrant further investigation of this treatment as a first-line intervention in MDD.

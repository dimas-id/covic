The rise of global supply chains as well as attention to the Triple Bottom Line provides organizations with new conditions and strategy paradoxes to be dealt with when it comes to sustainability in supply chain management. This study of a large multinational organization with a strong Triple Bottom Line focus provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of control and governance mechanisms in supply chain context. Through the Levers of Control framework, the application of these mechanisms both internally and across organizational boundaries is shown. The interplay between levers helps in dealing with the in itself paradoxical nature of Triple Bottom Line goalsetting. The results show that the "softer" elements of the Triple Bottom Line, i.e., People and Planet, are approached with the lever associated with the beliefs system, which in turn enforces the boundary and interactive control systems. Ultimately, applying the Levers of Control in supply chain context might contribute to pursuing a holistic approach of sustainable supply chain management.

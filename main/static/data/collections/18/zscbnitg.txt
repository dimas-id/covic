Super learner algorithm can be applied to combine results of multiple base learners to improve quality of predictions. The default method for verification of super learner results is by nested cross validation; however, this technique is very expensive computationally. It has been proposed by Tsamardinos et al., that nested cross validation can be replaced by resampling for tuning hyper-parameters of the learning algorithms. The main contribution of this study is to apply this idea to verification of super learner. We compare the new method with other verification methods, including nested cross validation. Tests were performed on artificial data sets of diverse size and on seven real, biomedical data sets. The resampling method, called Bootstrap Bias Correction, proved to be a reasonably precise and very cost-efficient alternative for nested cross validation.

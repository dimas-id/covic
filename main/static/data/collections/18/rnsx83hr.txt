This final chapter considers Neill Blomkamp’s film District 9 for its commentary on human and non-human alien relationships. Returning to many of the issues raised in the previous chapters, this coda analyzes the overt biopolitical dimensions of the film and considers how desire works to challenge the violent machinations of the multinational security company, Multi-National United. It examines how the film’s protagonist gets caught up in logics of exclusion in his experience of becoming-alien and approaches a position of bare life, outside the protections of the community. Ultimately, the chapter concludes the project by arguing that new, creative modes of resisting neocolonial and capitalist violence will be needed in response to biopolitical regimes, and that such creativity might arise from different desires and other modes of affect.

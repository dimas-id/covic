BACKGROUND Compression anastomosis has been recently abandoned because of a nonsuperiority compared to stapling anastomosis. Nonremoval of the rings has frequently been reported and this technique does not support a routine use. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the feasibility of anastomosis using compression with a device consisting of fragmented rings. METHODS A new compression device, the "Anastocom," was compared to standard double-stapled colocolonic anastomosis in 2 groups of 8 pigs. In each group, colocolonic anastomosis was performed with a circular stapler (DST Series EEA Staplers) in 4 pigs and with the Anastocom device for the other 4 pigs. RESULTS The anastomotic rings were expelled between postoperative day 7 and day 13 from the 4 animals sacrificed at day 30. The anastomosis was clean and intact in all pigs. After sacrifice, there was no difference in the bursting pressure at day 7 ( P = .226) or at day 30 ( P = .885) between the 2 types of anastomosis. After sacrifice at day 7, the mean bursting pressure values for the Anastocom and EEA anastomoses were 128.6 mm Hg (range 119-143 mm Hg) and 218.9 mm Hg (range 84-240 mm Hg), respectively. After sacrifice at day 30, the mean bursting pressure values for the Anastocom and EEA anastomoses were 111 mm Hg (range 59-234 mm Hg) and 105 mm Hg (range 81-130 mmHg), respectively. CONCLUSION No bowel obstruction was observed with Anastocom. This fragmentation mechanism should better prevent nonexpulsion compared to basic compression anastomosis.

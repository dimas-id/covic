Some novel 2,3-dioxo-5-(substituted)arylpyrroles have been synthesized. Among these, pyrrolidine compound 1b was converted to 2,3-dioxo-5-aryl pyrrolidine 2b. Finally a set of hydrazone derivatives was obtained from the reaction of 2b with various hydrazine salts. The structures of all the new synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, IR and (1)H-NMR spectra.

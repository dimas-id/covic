The aims of this paper are to detect floristic variation within different types of tall‐fern dominated vegetation and to interpret these patterns in terms of environmental variables. Numerical approaches have been applied to a large and varied vegetational data‐set with associated environmental data from stands dominated by Athyrium distentifolium, Thelypteris limbosperma, and Matteuccia struthiopteris in different parts of western Norway. The numerical procedures of two‐way indicator species analysis, simple discriminant functions, and canonical correspondence analysis have been used, and the strengths and weaknesses of these as tools in discerning vegetational‐environmental relationships are discussed. For each of the 96 quadrats investigated, 17 environmental variables were measured. The investigation shows that some of the observed differences in vegetational composition can be explained in terms of relatively simple soil and climatic variables measured for each quadrat. The ferns appear to be ecologically well separated. T. limbosperma‐dominaled stands are mainly characterised by low soil fertility, high January temperature, and high humidity. A. distentifolium‐dominated stands are associated with low winter temperatures, and M. struthiopteris‐dominated stands have high soil fertility and high summer temperatures.

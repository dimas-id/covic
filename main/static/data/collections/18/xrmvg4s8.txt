We created a new library of disordered patterns and disordered residues in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). To obtain such datasets, we clustered the PDB and obtained the groups of chains with different identities and marked disordered residues. We elaborated a new procedure for finding disordered patterns and created a new version of the library. This library includes three sets of patterns: unique patterns, patterns consisting of two kinds of amino acids, and homo-repeats. Using this database, the user can: (1) find homologues in the entire Protein Data Bank; (2) perform a statistical analysis of disordered residues in protein structures; (3) search for disordered patterns and homo-repeats; (4) search for disordered regions in different chains of the same protein; (5) download clusters of protein chains with different identity from our database and library of disordered patterns; and (6) observe 3D structure interactively using MView. A new library of disordered patterns will help improve the accuracy of predictions for residues that will be structured or unstructured in a given region.

Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who undergo distal pancreatectomy with resection of the celiac axis (CA) are at risk for postoperative hepatic or gastric ischemia if collateral blood flow from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) via the gastroduodenal artery is insufficient. This study presents a technique for preoperative angiographic evaluation of these collateral vessels by using an AMPLATZER Vascular Plug to temporarily occlude the CA or common hepatic artery while simultaneously performing digital subtraction angiography of the SMA. If collateral vessels are deemed sufficient, the plug can subsequently be released for permanent occlusion with the intent to enhance the blood flow in these collateral vessels.

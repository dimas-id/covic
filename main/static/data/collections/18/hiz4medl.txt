BACKGROUND Hepatic venous outflow is important for graft survival in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). If hepatic venous outflow obstruction occurs, hepatic vein stenting is considered to restore the patency. PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and patency of primary hepatic vein stenting for hepatic venous outflow obstruction (HVOO) after LDLT. MATERIAL AND METHODS Percutaneous interventions, including hepatic vein stent placement with or without balloon angioplasty, were performed in 21 patients who had undergone LDLT and had HVOO confirmed through hepatic venography or manometry, including the patients who had a structural abnormality. Two stents each were inserted in four patients; therefore, the total number of treated anastomoses was 25. Technical success, patency rates, and pressure gradients between hepatic veins and the right atrium were evaluated in 19 patients each. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in 25 of 26 vessels (96%). The mean interval between operation and stenting was 43 days. After the procedure, the follow-up period was a mean 530 days. The mean pressure gradient decreased from 8.5 mmHg to 2.1 mmHg after treatment (P < 0.01). The patency rates of the 25 vessels were 80% at 1, 2, and 3 years after stent placement. However, middle hepatic vein stenting revealed a low patency rate (all were 36%). Three of seven stents (43%) in the middle hepatic vein occluded during follow-up. CONCLUSION Percutaneous primary hepatic vein stent replacement is an effective treatment for HVOO after LDLT.

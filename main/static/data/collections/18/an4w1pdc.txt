Abstract A brief description of attitudes and représentations of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among patients in a psychiatric parisian office. Collected Data suggest that the confinement’s measure has been accepted. However the end of confinement has been a time of increased anxiety for many. The representations of Covid-19 and the one of the other’s body tended to be assimilated. Some perplexity over preventive measures has been observed.

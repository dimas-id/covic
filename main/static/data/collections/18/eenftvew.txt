We extend the theory of initial conflicts in the framework of [Formula: see text]-adhesive categories to transformation rules with ACs. We first show that for rules with ACs, conflicts are in general neither inherited from a bigger context any more, nor is it possible to find a finite and complete subset of finite conflicts as illustrated for the category of graphs. We define initial conflicts to be special so-called symbolic transformation pairs, and show that they are minimally complete (and in the case of graphs also finite) in this symbolic way. We show that initial conflicts represent a proper subset of critical pairs again. We moreover demonstrate that (analogous to the case of rules without ACs) for each conflict a unique initial conflict exists representing it. We conclude with presenting a sufficient condition illustrating important special cases for rules with ACs, where we do not only have initial conflicts being complete in a symbolic way, but also find complete (and in the case of graphs also finite) subsets of conflicts in the classical sense.

OBJECTIVE To determine the weight loss, and complications as well as to exemplify the use of vessel sealer and the triple stapler establish the safety and efficacy of vessel sealer for robotic surgery and triple stapler in robotic sleeve gastrectomy. STUDY DESIGN Observational case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Private Koru Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, from December 2015 till January 2016. METHODOLOGY Twenty robotic sleeve gastrectomy was performed. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, docking time, surgical time, leaks, bleeding, stapler number, strictures, mortality, conversion, weight loss, and hospital length of stay were included for data collection. RESULTS The mean age and body mass index were 40.73 ±11.2 years and 44.75 ±8.38 Kg/m2, respectively. Postoperative trocar site (assistance port) bleeding occurred in one patient. There were no conversions, stricture, leakage or mortality. The mean number of staplers used was 6.27 ±0.46 and excess body weight loss (EWL%) at three months was 24.91 ±2.84 kg. CONCLUSION Robotic surgery for obesity surgery was safe during our initial experience and use of vessel sealer and triple stapler was effective, safe and facilitates procedure in obese patients.

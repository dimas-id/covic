OBJECTIVE: In response to ongoing concerns regarding transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), surgical practice has changed for the foreseeable future. Practice guidelines recommend only urgent or emergent surgical procedures be performed to minimize viral transmission. This effectively limits standard training and practice for surgical residents. The purpose of this article is to describe opportunities in surgical simulation, and highlights the challenges associated with training in the COVID-19 era. DESIGN: This is a perspective summarizing the potential role of surgical simulation to target training gaps caused by decreased surgical caseloads. CONCLUSIONS: This manuscript concisely discusses simulation options available to training programs, including the novel concept of “surgical kits.” These kits include all instruments necessary to simulate a procedure at home, effectively pairing safety and utility.

The results of PCR measurements are regarded as unquestionable. This statement must be put into perspective. This relativization is particularly important in connection with the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 results. Members of the critical infrastructure, such as nurses, may be quarantined although this is not necessary and are therefore missing from patient care. With our small but impressive comparison of methods and transport media for SARS-CoV-2, we not only show the different sensitivity of common routine systems and media in laboratory medicine. Further, we would like to inform clinically working physicians, who are not familiar with the technical weaknesses of the PCR investigation, about gaps and present solutions for their daily work.

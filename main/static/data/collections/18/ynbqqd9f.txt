As COVID-19 spread all over the world, most of the countries adopted some kind of restrictions to avoid the collapse of health systems. In Brazil, São Paulo and Rio the Janeiro, the two most populated cities in the country, were the first to determine social distancing. In this study, the impact of the social distancing measures on the concentrations of the three main primary air pollutants (PM(10), NO(2) and CO) was analyzed. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (up to 100%) since it is related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO(2) also showed reductions (9.1%–41.8%) while PM(10) levels were only reduced in the 1st lockdown week. The decrease of pollutants was not directly proportional to the vehicular flux reduction, because it depends on other factors such as the transport of air masses from industrial and rural areas. The differences observed can be explained considering the fleet characteristics in the two cities and the response of the population to the social distancing recommendations.

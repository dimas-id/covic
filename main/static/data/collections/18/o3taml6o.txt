OBJECTIVES: To measure the prevalence rate of, and determine the association between food and drink related behaviors and diarrheal illness among Japanese tourists, and assess their health care needs. METHODS: Eligible Japanese tourists (1,480) aged ≥15 years traveling in Chiangmai Province in the north, Ayutthaya Province in the center, Kanchanaburi Province in the west, Pattaya City in the east, and Krabi Province in the south of Thailand were enrolled in the study. Of these tourists, 1,318 consented to participate in this study and completed questionnaires in Japanese, giving a response rate of 89.1%. RESULTS: Among these Japanese tourists 21.3% had diarrheal illness, and of these tourists, 5.0% had classical travelers’ diarrhea (TD), 11.8% had mild TD, 3.3% had good food and drink related behaviors, and 75.4% had moderate level of perception of diarrhea related to drinking and eating. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated three significant diarrheal illness predictors: large number of previous visits to Thailand, longer stay in Thailand, and the experience of visiting other countries. Furthermore, 56.9% suggested providing an adequate number of toilets at tourist destinations; 53.9% suggested providing a 24-hour emergency call facility for a public ambulance; and 51.9% suggested providing garbage bins and garbage disposal facilities at tourist destinations. CONCLUSIONS: TD still affects experienced Japanese tourists who visit Thailand. Although the proportions of the good levels of food and drink related behaviors were low, there were indications that Japanese tourists perceived the risk of contracting TD.

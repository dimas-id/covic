BACKGROUND: Globally, there have been many cases of COVID-2019 cases among medical staff, however, the main factors associated with the infection are not well understood. AIM: To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between Jan. 1st, and Feb. 30th, 2020, where front line members of medical staff that took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree = 572; closeness =25; betweenness centrality = 3·23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest influence (degree = 370; closeness = 29; betweenness centrality = 0·37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree = 201; closeness = 28; betweenness centrality = 5·64). For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two isolated nodes. CONCLUSION: High self-protection score was the main factor that prevented medical staff from contracting COVID-19 infection. The main factor that contributed to COVID-19 infections among medical staff was touching the cheek, nose and mouth while working.

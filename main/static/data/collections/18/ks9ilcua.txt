IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is nowadays an important target in cardiovascular diseases and we are currently on the verge of a new interpretation of its role in cardiovascular homeostasis, mainly due to the identification of the new axis ACE2/angiotensin 1 - 7/Mas receptor. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW The main aspects related to ACE2 role in cardiovascular physiology and possible pathological and therapeutic implications are reviewed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN A description of the new view of the RAS, along with the key findings that support it. In the cardiovascular system, the ACE2/angiotensin 1 - 7/Mas axis, mainly through the inhibition of fibrosis, inflammation, thrombosis and cell proliferation, modulates RAS activity with significant pathophysiological implications in clinical conditions such as hypertension, myocardial ischemia and heart failure. A more complete understanding of this axis has significant therapeutic relevance and a major effort is being carried out in order to pursue this objective. TAKE HOME MESSAGE There is increasing evidence that ACE2/angiotensin 1 - 7/Mas receptor axis has a key role in RAS activity regulation with significant pathophysiological implications in several disease states. A therapeutic intervention at this level may open new doors and change the current approach to RAS targeting.

This Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) Imaging Council Position Statement aims to guide local, regional and national clinical practice, and facilitate resource and echocardiographic service planning appropriately during the current COVID-19 global pandemic. General considerations include workforce arrangements and contingency plans, patient risk assessment for COVID-19 and level of care (personal protective equipment) for staff. Both outpatient and inpatient settings are addressed, including specific considerations in the in-patient setting including scanning protocols, screening modalities and indications for echocardiograms in the context of COVID-19 infection.

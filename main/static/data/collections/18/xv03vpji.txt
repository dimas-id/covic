Newcastle disease (ND), caused by virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains, has been one of the most problematic diseases affecting the poultry industry worldwide. Conventional vaccines provide effective protection for birds to survive ND outbreaks, but they may not completely suppress NDV shedding. NDV strains circulate on farms for a long time after the initial infection and cause potential risks. A new vaccine with fast clearance ability and low viral shedding is needed. In this study, we used interleukin-12 (IL-12) as an adjuvant and electroporation (EP) as an advanced delivery system to improve a DNA vaccine candidate. The fusion (F) protein gene from an NDV strain of the prevalent genotype VII.1.1 was cloned to prepare the vaccine. Chickens immunized with the F gene DNA vaccine co-delivered with an IL-12-expressing plasmid DNA showed higher neutralizing antibody levels and stronger concanavalin-A-induced lymphocyte proliferation than those treated with the F gene DNA vaccine alone. The co-delivered vaccine provided 100% protection, and less viral shedding and a shorter release time were observed in challenged chickens than when the F gene DNA vaccine was administered alone. The use of F gene DNA combined with IL-12 delivered by electroporation is a promising approach for vaccination against ND.

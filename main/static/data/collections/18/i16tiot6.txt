Two epidemics-Covid-19 and opioid use disorder (OUD) -are creating short- and long-term mental and physical health risks for vulnerable children and adolescents. Information about the risks to children from exposure to the coronavirus is still fragmentary, but even many healthy children are not getting appropriate health care, such as vaccinations or monitoring of developmental milestones during the Covid-19 pandemic. Children living in poverty are at heightened risk. Youngsters who are already dealing with OUD in their families-2.2 million as of 2017-face serious consequences stemming from trauma and stress. Although not officially designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as "adverse childhood experiences" ("ACEs"), these situations meet the CDC's criteria for inclusion, such as death or separation from a parent. It is important to recognize and meet the needs of all these children now and not just when the long-term consequences become apparent.

Abstract Viral pneumonia is a prevalent cause of respiratory infection in immunocompetent adults. It has varied presentation, from mild to severe respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. However, in Brazil, there have been few studies on the clinical presentation and diagnosis of this infection. Thus, the authors of the present article intend to review the main viral agents that cause community-acquired pneumonia and to discuss the currently available diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

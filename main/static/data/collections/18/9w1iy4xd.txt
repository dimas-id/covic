PURPOSE To determine if computed tomographic (CT) texture and histogram analysis measurements of the primary mass are independently associated with overall survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were previously treated with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel (TPF) induction chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 72 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF chemotherapy in 2004-2010. CT texture and histogram analysis of the primary mass on the pretherapy CT images were performed by using TexRAD software before and after application of spatial filters at different anatomic scales ranging from fine detail to coarse features. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between overall survival and the baseline CT imaging measurements and clinical variables. RESULTS Primary mass entropy and skewness measurements with multiple spatial filters were associated with overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis incorporating clinical and imaging variables indicated that primary mass size (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58 for each 1-cm increase; P = .018), N stage (HR, 8.77 for N3 vs N0 or N1; P = .002; HR, 4.99 for N3 vs N2; P = .001), and primary mass entropy (HR, 2.10 for each 0.5-unit increase; P = .036) and skewness (HR, 3.67 for each 1.0-unit increase; P = .009) measurements with the 1.0 spatial filter were independently associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION Independent of tumor size, N stage, and other clinical variables, primary mass CT texture and histogram analysis parameters are associated with overall survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF.

This study investigates the key antecedents affecting consumers’ continuance intention toward bike-sharing services in China. The theoretical framework clarifies the role of perceived value and trust in a service provider in enhancing customer’s continuance intention toward bike-sharing services. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment are considered vital factors in forming perceived value and trust in a service provider. Financial risk and privacy risk serve as inhibitors to consumers’ continuance intention. Our research model is validated using data from 224 bike-sharing consumers in China. Both perceived value and trust in a service have a significant impact on consumers’ continuance intention. However, financial risk significantly affects customer’s continuance intention, although privacy risk does not have a significant impact on it. The analysis results show that perceived usefulness has no significant effect on both perceived value and trust in a service provider. The results demonstrate that perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment play a significant role in enhancing both perceived value and trust in a service provider. Our results are expected to provide academic and practical implications for bike-sharing services.

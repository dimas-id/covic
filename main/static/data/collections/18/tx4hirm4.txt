Abstract Obstetricians and gynecologists are increasingly involved in primary care. Acute bronchitis is among the most common ambulatory complaints. Although the cause of acute bronchitis is predominantly viral, 50â€“70% of patients presenting with this condition are treated with antibiotics. Because of the increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics, the cost of prescription drugs, and the potential adverse reactions to them, the present management of acute bronchitis has important shortcomings. Also, inhaled bronchodilators are underused for symptomatic management. Improved awareness among physicians about the recommended management of acute bronchitis has been targeted as an important means of decreasing unnecessary antibiotic use. Patient satisfaction motivates physicians to prescribe antibiotics in managing acute bronchitis. However, patient satisfaction does not necessarily correlate with prescribing of antibiotics but rather with patient education. We present a review of the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of acute bronchitis and its management.

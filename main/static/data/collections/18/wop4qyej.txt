ABSTRACT Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) belong to the classical G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor family. They are mainly expressed in mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses. N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen- and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription. Despite these new developments, the in vivo functions of FPRs and their ligands in disease states are not yet fully understood. This chapter summarizes the pharmacological characterization of FPR ligands and their implications in pathophysiological conditions.

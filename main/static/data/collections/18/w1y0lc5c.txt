Abstract The replication of the murine coronaviruses MHV3 and JHM has been studied in somatic cell hybrids formed between murine fibroblast L2 cells which support lytic infections with both these agents, and rat RN2 Schwannoma cells which support the replication of JHM in a temperature-sensitive, persistent manner but are restrictive to the replication of MHV3. The results described in this report indicate that the totally permissive state is dominant over the persistent or restricted state since the hybrid cells permit the replication of both these viral agents in a lytic manner.

In fact, recent studies have shown that heparin, the most commonly used anticoagulant during HD procedures, had anti-inflammatory properties and a direct antiviral action, due to its ability to prevent SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into host cells. These activities, together with its anticoagulant action, could explain the ability of heparin to ameliorate COVID-19 clinical course.

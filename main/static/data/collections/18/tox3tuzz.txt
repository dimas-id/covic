The Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line is widely used as epithelial cell model in studies ranging from viral infection to environmental pollutants, and vaccines production. However, little is known about basal expression of genes involved in innate immunity, and the ability to respond to infectious and non-infectious stressors. Therefore, the aims of our study were to evaluate the basal level of expression of pivotal genes in the innate immune response and cell cycle regulation, as well as to evaluate the ability of this cell line to respond to infectious or non-infectious stressors. As surmised in our working hypothesis, we demonstrated the constitutive expression of genes involved in the innate immune response and cell defense alike, including TLRs, Interleukins, Myd88, p65/NF-kB and p53. Moreover, we described the ability of this cell line to respond to LPS and cadmium (Cd2+) in terms of gene expression and cytokine release. These data confirm the possibility of using this cell line as a model in studies of host/pathogen interaction and response to non-infectious stressors.

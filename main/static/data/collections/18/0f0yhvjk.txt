RECOMMENDATION The administration of prophylactic antibiotics before total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) potentially reduces the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) and/or periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Weight-based (of at least 2 g) cefazolin administered intravenously within 60 minutes before the procedure can be an adequate choice for antibiotic prophylaxis. If the patient has a beta-lactam anaphylaxis, we recommend an appropriate alternative antibiotic effective against Staphylococcus. It is unclear whether prophylaxis should be given as a single dose or as multiple doses. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Strong. DELEGATE VOTE Agree: 100%, Disagree: 0%, Abstain: 0% (Unanimous, Strongest Consensus).

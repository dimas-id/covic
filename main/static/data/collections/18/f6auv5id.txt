Background: Clinical guidelines on infection prevention strategies in healthcare workers (HCWs) play an important role in protecting them during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Poorly constructed guidelines that are not comprehensive and are ambiguous may compromise HCWs safety. We aimed to develop and validate a tool to appraise guidelines on infection prevention strategies in HCWs. Methods: A 3-stage, web-based, Delphi consensus-building process among a panel of diverse HCWs and healthcare managers was utilised. We validated the tool by appraising 40 international, specialty-specific and procedure-specific guidelines along with national guidelines from countries with a wide range of gross national income. Results: Overall consensus (>75%) was reached at the end of three rounds for all six domains included in the tool. The chosen domains allowed appraisal of guidelines in relation to general characteristics (domain-1), recommendations on engineering (domain-2) and administrative aspects (domain 4-6) of infection prevention, as well as personal protection equipment (PPE) use (domain-3). The appraisal tool performed well across all domains and inter-rater agreement was excellent. All included guidelines performed relatively better in domains 1-3 compared with domains 4-6 and this was more evident in guidelines originating from lower income countries. Conclusion: The guideline appraisal tool was robust and easy to use. Recommendations on engineering aspects of infection prevention, administrative measures that promote optimal PPE use and HCW wellbeing were generally lacking in assessed guidelines. This tool may enable health systems to adopt high quality HCW infection prevention guidelines during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and may also provide a framework for future guideline development.

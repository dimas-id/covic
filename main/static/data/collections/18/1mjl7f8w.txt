Recent days have seen growing evidence of cancer's susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and of the effect of genomic differences on the virus' entrance genes in lung cancer. Genetic confirmation of the hypotheses regarding gene expression and mutation pattern of target genes, including Angiotensin Converting Enzyme‐2 (ACE2), Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), Basigin (CD147/BSG) and Paired Basic Amino Acid Cleaving Enzyme (FURIN/PCSK3), as well as correlation analysis, were evaluated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) using in silico analysis. Not only were gene expression and mutation patterns detected, but also there was a correlation and survival analysis between ACE2 and other target genes expression levels. The total genetic anomaly carrying rate of target genes, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147/BSG and FURIN/PCSK3, was determined as 8.1% and 21 mutations detected, with 7 of these mutations having pathogenic features. p.H34N on the RBD binding residues for SARS‐CoV‐2 was determined in our LUAD patient group. According to gene expression analysis results in LUAD and LUSC patient groups, while the TMPRSS2 level was statistically significantly decreased in the LUSC patient group compared to healthy control, the ACE2 level was determined to be high in LUAD and LUSC. There were no meaningful differences in expression of CD147 and FURIN genes. The challenge for the today is building the assessment of genomic susceptibility to COVID‐19 in lung cancer, requiring detailed experimental laboratory studies, in addition to in silico analyses, as a way of assessing the mechanism of novel virus invasion that can be used in the development of effective SARS‐CoV‐2 therapy.

Mucosal protective agents may improve healing of patients with endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced ulcers. The present study systematically evaluated published clinical trials to determine whether combined therapeutic use of mucosal protective agents and proton pump inhibitors can improve the outcome of patients with endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced ulcers compared to treatment with proton pump inhibitors alone. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Igaku-Chuo-Zasshi database were searched to identify eligible randomized trials for systematic review. We identified 11 randomized trials for inclusion in our study (1,160 patients). Pooled endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced ulcer healing rates were 45.8% and 34.4% for patients with or without mucosal protective agents, respectively. The odds ratio was 2.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.57-3.31) with no significant study heterogeneity. In conclusion, the systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the combined therapeutic use of proton pump inhibitors and mucosal protective agents improved healing rates of endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced ulcers compared to treatment with proton pump inhibitor monotherapy.

Antibodies could be labeled with enzymes for use in histochemical staining procedures by enzyme-immunoassay (EIA). The use of EIA is an extension of previously used serological tests, using enzyme-labeled antibody or antigen to determine antibody content. Direct detection of antigen by EIA represents a more dramatic departure from previous methods based on culture. Also, the method has enabled detection of infectious agents that are difficult to cultivate, such as hepatitis A virus and rotavirus, or agents that cannot be cultivated, such as hepatitis B. The use of EIA tests for detection of microbial antigens provides an alternative to culture as a means for direct identification of a specific microbial agent. It also provides a means to detect microbial agents which have not been successfully propagated. The detection of circulating antigen or detection of antigen in other body fluids by EIA is more difficult than detection of antibody because of the sensitivity required, and because of interfering substances in specimens such as feces and respiratory secretions. For this reason, very few antigen detection assays have the sensitivity and specificity required to be used as a primary diagnostic test. The number of tests that have been developed, however, is impressive and because of the possibilities for rapid, specific diagnosis, the interest in antigen detection by EIA remains high.

We report here the complete genome sequence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain ZJ/ZX2018-C10, isolated from infected piglets in Zhejiang Province, China. The genome sequence was highly similar to AH2012, a highly virulent Chinese PEDV strain. It will help in understanding the molecular and evolutionary characteristics of PEDV in China.

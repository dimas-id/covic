Sequence-specific NMR assignments of the globular core comprising the residues 1066â€“1181 within the non-structural protein nsp3e from the SARS coronavirus have been obtained using triple-resonance NMR experiments with the uniformly [(13)C,(15)N]-labeled protein. The backbone and side chain assignments are nearly complete, providing the basis for the ongoing NMR structure determination. A preliminary identification of regular secondary structures has been derived from the (13)C chemical shifts.

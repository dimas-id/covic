The emergence of Covid-19 started in China and has rapidly spread across the globe, notably in Italy and more recently to Brazil. This is a very worrying situation for the affected countries. This Brief Communication aims to describe and correlate the number of confirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19 in Brazil and Italy. This is a descriptive and retrospective study that used data collated on the World Health Organization (WHO) online platform between 21 January and 19 April 2020. After analyzing the data, it was observed that the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Brazil is lower than that in Italy. There are certain factors in Brazil which see it in a lower risk position than Italy; however, despite the current slow spread of the virus, the situation in Brazil is difficult to predict.

The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is progressing at an unparalleled speed. As of the 29th of March, there were at least 68 vaccine candidates comprising several different vaccine designs, including whole killed virus, subunit, attenuated, viral vector, DNA and mRNA vaccines. Whilst it usually takes 10-15 years to develop a vaccine, it has only taken just over 9 weeks from the publication of the viral genetic sequence for the first vaccine candidate to reach clinical testing. Development has been expediated by using existing technological platforms and by performing preclinical and clinical testing simultaneously.

Amid the global outbreak of COVID-19, resilience is likely to be one of the many possible outcomes. Studies pertaining to resilience following potentially traumatic events including disease outbreak have shown that the vast majority of individuals are resilient, and that outcomes depend on a combination of resilience factors including exposure severity, individual differences, family context, and community characteristics. To better understand psychological dysfunction and resilience during the global outbreak of COVID-19, researchers are encouraged to investigate long-term patterns of mental health rather than cross-sectional prevalence rates, adopt prospective designs and analyses, integrate multiple risk and resilience factors to enhance outcome prediction, and consider the importance of flexibility as the situation unfolds.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the pathogens of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Guangzhou from 2006 to 2009. METHODS A total of 1554 cases of ARI patients in Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College from September 2006 to September 2009, were recruited in the survey. The sample of throat and pharyngeal swab were collected from each patient.11 types of virus including influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB), adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 1, type 2, type 3 (HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3), human metapneumovirus (MPV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) type 229E, type OC43 were detected by Fluorescence Quota PCR method. The epidemic feature and clinical characteristic of each virus were then analyzed. RESULTS Virus were found in 1024 samples in total, accounting for 65.9% (1024/1554). RSV was the most common virus, which was found in 261 samples (16.8%); and followed by HRV as 13.9% (216/1554), FluA as 11.6% (181/1554), MPV as 6.5% (101/1554), FluB as 6.4% (99/1554), HPIV as 4.9% (76/1554), ADV as 3.5% (55/1554) and HCoV as 2.3% (35/1554). HPIV and HCoV shared a similar infection ratio among different age groups. The infection ratio of FluA and FluB was highest among 15-24 years old group, accounting for 16.5% (29/176) and 7.4% (13/176) respectively. MPV, RSV and HRV were the main pathogens caused infection among children under 4 years old, accounting for 9.7% (49/503), 21.7% (109/503) and 18.9% (95/503). The infection ratio of ADV was 6.0% (19/318), which was the most common pathogen among 5-14 years old patients. The incidence rate of HPIV and HRV showed no obvious seasonal features; while the prevalence of FluA, FluB, RSV, ADV, MPV and HCoV changed significantly in different seasons.22.2% (227/1024) ARI patients co-infected other respiratory virus.90.1% (163/181) FluA patients, 88.9% (88/99) FluB patients and 92.7% (51/55) ADV patients had high fever symptoms. CONCLUSION RSV was the main pathogen of ARI, and the new-found virus MPV was also another crucial pathogen. Some pathogens' incidence rate were related to the season and patient's age. Co-infections of other respiratory virus were also detected in parts of ARI patients.

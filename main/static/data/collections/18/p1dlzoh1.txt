Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and frequently reported in Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is unclear if SARS-CoV-2 is associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Nevertheless, GIB in COVID-19 patients poses unique challenges to patients due to high-risk of concomitant respiratory failure and to endoscopy personnel due to risk of airborne transmission during endoscopic procedures. Many management issues related to COVID-19 are still being studied. In this case series, we attempt to discuss the important clinical implications related to the management of GIB in COVID-19 patients.

Many biological functions of RNA molecules are related to their pseudoknot structures. It is significant for predicting the structure and function of RNA that learning about the stability and the process of RNA pseudoknot folding and unfolding. The structural features of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot in different ion concentration, the unfolding process of the RNA pseudoknot, and the two hairpin helices that constitute the RNA pseudoknot were studied with all atom molecule dynamics simulation method in this paper. We found that the higher cation concentration can cause structure of the RNA molecules more stable, and ions played an indispensable role in keeping the structure of RNA molecules stable; the unfolding process of hairpin structure was corresponding to the antiprocess of its folding process. The main pathway of pseudoknot unfolding was that the inner base pair opened first, and then, the two helices, which formed the RNA pseudoknot opened decussately, while the folding pathway of the RNA pseudoknot was a helix folding after formation of the other helix. Therefore, the unfolding process of RNA pseudoknot is different from the antiprocess of its folding process, and the unfolding process of each helix in the RNA pseudoknot is similar to the hairpin structureâ€™s unfolding process, which means that both are the unzipping process.

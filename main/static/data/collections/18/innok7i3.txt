Models of local spread of COVID-19 are needed to assist local governments and health care providers to prepare for surges of clinical cases in their communities. National and state based models are inadequate because the virus is introduced and spreads at different rates in local areas. Models based on motor vehicle traffic measured by tracking cell phones movement in relation to daily numbers of confirmed cases are being developed but this study finds that indicator less effective in predicting future cases than time since the first case in a county. Each county has its own function of time since the first case that can be used to predict increases in reported cases two weeks in advance for each of 914 counties in the U.S. with populations of 50,000 or more inhabitants.

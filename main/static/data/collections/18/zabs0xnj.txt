CLINICAL SUMMARY Dental treatment was carried out in an 8.5-year-old castrated male domestic shorthair cat found to have tooth resorption. Right mandibular, and right and left maxillary nerve blocks were administered using a 1 ml syringe attached to a 25 G x 5/8 inch needle and an intraoral technique. The following day the cat displayed blepharospasm of the right eye. The ocular signs progressed and 5 days later an ophthalmologist confirmed a blind, glaucomatous right eye. It was suspected that the eye had suffered a penetrating injury during dental surgery. Enucleation of the right eye was performed and gross and histopathological examination revealed a penetrating wound consistent with a needle tract injury. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Complications arising from veterinary dental regional anaesthesia appear to be rare; however, it may be that they are under-reported. This case report highlights the risks involved and reviews the safest and most efficacious regional anaesthesia technique for the feline maxilla.

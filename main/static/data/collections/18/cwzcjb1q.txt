SUMMARY We describe the case of a 24-year-old pregnant woman with no history of note who was admitted with a diagnosis of bilateral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus.Due to clinical worsening, she required urgent cesarean section with general anaesthesia and intubationfor decubitus intolerance. After extubation, she presented altered mental statethat required a differential diagnosis of encephalitis/meningitis secondary to SARS-CoV-2.CT and CT-angiography were normal, spinal fluid tests were non-specific, and magnetic resonance imaging reported posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (due to radiological features suggestive of white matter vasogenic edema affecting the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, along with altered mental state) secondary to gestational hypertension. Eleven days after the cesarean section the patient began to develop hypertension that required treatment. PRES is associated with certain clinical (headache, altered mental state, visual disturbances and convulsions) and radiological (reversible changes in white substance mainly affecting the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes) characteristics suggestive of vasogenic oedema In pregnant SARS-CoV-2 patients, the differential diagnosis of hypertension and altered mental state is often extremely complicated because complementary tests can be normal and there is no immediate sign of peripartum hypertension. SARS CoV-2 genome sequencing in spinal fluid could have provided a definitive diagnosis, but the treatment would not have differed.

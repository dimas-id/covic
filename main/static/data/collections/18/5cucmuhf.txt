Adequate blood flow (Qb) is necessary for effective hemodialysis (HD). Aim of the study was to examine relationship between the actually delivered Qb (dQb) and reported Qb (rQb) with dialysis machine. One hundred HD patients with arteriovenous fistula were enrolled. Delivered Qb was measured at the beginning and end of each HD session. dQb/rQb < 1 indicated a discrepancy between actual dQb and rQb reported using a dialysis machine. In addition, dQb/rQb was examined in HD patients using needles of different gauges during treatment. The average levels of dQb/rQb at start and end of HD session were 1.01 ± 0.04 and 0.98 ± 0.05, respectively. In the 16 gauge and 17 gauge needle groups, the percentage of patients with dQb/rQb < 1 increased in accordance with the increase in rQb or as the HD session progressed. In the 15 gauge needle group, the percentage of patients with dQb/rQb < 1 was <50% at any level of rQb. Selection of needle gauge is important factors for determining actual dQb in HD patients.

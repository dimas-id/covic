ABSTRACT In seeking to limit the number of new infections of COVID-19, governments around the world have implemented national lockdowns and guidelines about safe behaviours. Lockdown requires people to stay home and only leave when essential such as to purchase groceries and medication. In low- and middle-income countries, many of which have large proportions of the population living in precarity, lockdown forces millions of people to spend prolonged periods of time together in close proximity to one another and with limited resources. In many ways, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 in densely populated communities with limited access to food, water and sanitation may seem counter-intuitive and even impossible under conditions of precarity. In this paper, we explore the barriers to implementation of lockdown rules in conditions of precarity. We conceptualise the structural barriers by drawing on the Theoretical Domains Framework to explain how these barriers influence adherence to lockdown rules. We argue that without sufficient support or intervention to help poor communities mitigate these structural barriers, adhering to lockdown rules is difficult, resulting in continued COVID-19 infections.

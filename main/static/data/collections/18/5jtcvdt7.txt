OBJECTIVES The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that some infectious diseases are related to the occurrence of PD. METHODS The case-control study, conducted in Belgrade during the period 2001-2005, comprised 110 subjects diagnosed for the first time as PD cases, and 220 controls chosen among patients with degenerative joint disease and some diseases of the digestive tract. RESULTS According to logistic regression analysis, PD was significantly related to mumps [odds ratio adjusted on occupation and family history of PD (aOR) = 7.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.77-16.36], scarlet fever (aOR = 12.18, 95% CI = 1.97-75.19), influenza (aOR = 8.01, 95% CI = 4.61-13.92), whooping cough (aOR = 19.90, 95% CI = 2.07-190.66) and herpes simplex infections (aOR = 11.52, 95% CI = 2.25-58.89). Tuberculosis, measles and chicken pox were not associated with PD. Other infectious diseases we asked for were not reported (12 diseases), or were too rare (four diseases) to be analysed. CONCLUSION The results obtained are in line with the suggestion that some infectious diseases may play a role in the development of PD.

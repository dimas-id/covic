Little is known about COVID-19 preventive behaviors among individuals with mental health problems. This study used cross-sectional online survey data from 2000 Japanese adults collected in April and May, 2020, to examine the association between anxiety and depression and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that both anxiety and depression were associated with lower odds for engaging in preventive behaviors such as wearing a face mask and hand washing. Our results highlight the importance of facilitating the performance of preventive behaviors in individuals with mental health problems to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in this population.

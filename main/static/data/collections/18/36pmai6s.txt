Abstract The CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) is important in coordinating the immune response following microbial infection by regulating T cell polarization as well as leukocyte migration and accumulation within infected tissues. The present study examines the consequences of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice lacking CCL2 (CCL2−/−) in order to determine if signaling by this chemokine is relevant in host defense. Intracerebral infection of CCL2−/− mice with MHV did not result in increased morbidity or mortality as compared to either wild type or CCR2−/− mice and CCL2−/− mice cleared replicating virus from the brain. In contrast, CCR2−/− mice displayed an impaired ability to clear virus from the brain that was accompanied by a reduction in the numbers of antigen-specific T cells as compared to both CCL2−/− and wild-type mice. The paucity in T cell accumulation within the central nervous system (CNS) of MHV-infected CCR2−/− mice was not the result of either a deficiency in antigen-presenting cell (APC) accumulation within draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) or the generation of virus-specific T cells within this compartment. A similar reduction in macrophage infiltration into the CNS was observed in both CCL2−/− and CCR2−/− mice when compared to wild-type mice, indicating that both CCL2 and CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) contribute to macrophage migration and accumulation within the CNS following MHV infection. Together, these data demonstrate that CCR2, but not CCL2, is important in host defense following viral infection of the CNS, and CCR2 ligand(s), other than CCL2, participates in generating a protective response.

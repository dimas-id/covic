The aim of this study was to investigate canine astrovirus (CaAstV) infection in southwest China. We collected 107 faecal samples from domestic dogs with obvious diarrhoea. Forty-two diarrhoeic samples (39.3 %) were positive for CaAstV by RT-PCR, and 41/42 samples showed co-infection with canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) and canine distemper virus (CDV). Phylogenetic analysis based on 26 CaAstV partial ORF1a and ORF1b sequences revealed that most CaAstV strains showed unique evolutionary features. Interestingly, putative recombination events were observed among four of the five complete ORF2 sequences cloned in this study, and three of the five complete ORF2 sequences formed a single unique group, suggesting that these strains could be a novel genotype. We successfully sequenced the complete genome of one CaAstV strain (designated 2017/44/CHN), which was 6628 nt in length. The features of this genome include putative recombination events in the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 genes, while the ORF2 gene had a continuous insertion of 7 aa in region II compared with the other complete ORF2 sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 2017/44/CHN formed a single group based on genome sequences, suggesting that this strain might be a novel genotype. The results of this study revealed that CaAstV circulates widely in diarrhoeic dogs in southwest China and exhibits unique evolutionary events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of recombination events in CaAstV, and it contributes to further understanding of the genetic evolution of CaAstV.

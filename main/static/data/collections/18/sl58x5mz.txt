BACKGROUND The quality of tissue repairs depends on tissue integrity, surgical technique, and material properties of the sutures used. Currently, there is no clear consensus on which is the best suture to use during cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of heat and chemotherapy on sutures' biomechanical properties. METHODS Six different 3.0 absorbable sutures (Biosyn, Dexon II, Maxon, Monocryl, PDS II, and Vicryl Plus) were tested. All suture strands were incubated for a 24-h period in saline, mitomycin-c, and oxaliplatin at 37 and 45°C. Suture loops were then loaded to failure using a servohydraulic testing machine. Data for tensile breaking force (TBF) and elongation rate were collected for all samples. RESULTS Under basal condition, Maxon was the strongest of all sutures with a TBF of 59.6 ± 4.3 N (P < 0.01), and no significant difference in TBF was observed between other sutures. Heat alone had no impact on sutures' biomechanical parameters. Exposition to mitomycin-c at 45°C did not significantly affect sutures' basal tensile properties, with Maxon remaining the strongest suture. When incubated in oxaliplatin at 45°C, the six suture types had a similar TBF. In all experimental conditions, multifilament sutures had a significantly lower elongation rate than monofilament sutures, and no correlations were demonstrated between elongation rate and the TBF of sutures. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that exposition to heated chemotherapy did not significantly affect absorbable sutures biomechanical properties.

In France, general rules have been issued nationally and implemented by each healthcare centre, both public and private, throughout France. Guidelines drafted by an expert group led by the French-speaking Association of Endocrine Surgery (AFCE) propose specific surgical management principles for thyroid, parathyroid, endocrine pancreas and adrenal surgery during and after the COVID-19 epidemic.

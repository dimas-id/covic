INTRODUCTION Transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery procedures are at the forefront of minimally invasive innovation, remarkable for shorter recovery times and decreased postoperative pain. We aim to demonstrate a novel technique of pure transvaginal laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in a series of patients performed in our institution. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION The patient was placed in lithotomy position and steep Trendelenburg. A 2-cm transverse colpotomy incision was made and a SILS port was introduced. One 12-mm trocar and two 5-mm trocars were placed through the SILS port and standard straight laparoscopic instruments were used. An appropriately sized round mesh was deployed within a specimen retrieval bag into the peritoneal cavity. Complete anterior circumferential fixation of the mesh was achieved using an AbsorbaTack device. The colpotomy incision was closed. RESULTS There were a total of 6 pure transvaginal ventral hernia repair procedures performed in our institution between November 2010 and February 2012. The first case was converted to an open procedure after a rectal injury was recognized and repaired. Two patients had transient urinary retention that resolved after 24 hours. One patient had vaginal wound granulation noted at 2 months postoperatively. No long-term complications or recurrences were noted with a median follow-up of 9 months. The mean operative time was 107 minutes. CONCLUSION Our initial experience with transvaginal ventral hernia repair in humans suggests that this procedure is feasible, safe, and associated with improved cosmetic results.

Social distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic has required many medical schools to adapt existing on-site medical education activities to delivery via online platforms. The sudden switch to a new, unfamiliar model of learning led to additional challenges for students. We observed that students requiring academic support often had ineffective learning strategies, poor motivation, and suboptimal communication skills, all of which were magnified by home-based learning. We therefore established a virtual academic coaching programme to engage these students and to address specific challenges that arose from an adapted educational programme.

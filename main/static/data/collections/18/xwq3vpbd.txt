In April 2013, a Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) epidemic began in the United States. As part of the response, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to detect PEDV were developed by several veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Our study evaluated RT-PCR PEDV assays that detect the N gene (gN) and S gene (gS) for their ability to detect PEDV infection and the transmission potential of pigs experimentally exposed to PEDV. Detection limits and quantification cycle (Cq) values of real-time RT-PCR were assayed for PEDV samples and positive controls for both gN and gS. The limit of detection for the gN assay was 10(-6) (mean Cq: 39.82 ± 0.30) and 10(-5) (mean Cq: 39.39 ± 0.72) for the gS assay with PEDV strain USA/Colorado/2013. Following recommended guidelines, rectal swabs (n = 1,064) were tested; 354 samples were positive by gN assay and 349 samples were positive by gS assay (Cq ≤ 34.99), 710 samples were negative by gN assay and 715 were negative by gS assay (Cq > 34.99) of which 355 and 344 were "undetermined" (i.e., undetected within a threshold of 40 RT-PCR cycles, by gN and gS assays, respectively). The coefficient of variation (intra-assay variation) ranged from 0.00% to 2.65% and interassay variation had an average of 2.75%. PEDV could be detected in rectal swabs from all pigs for ~2 weeks postinfection at which time the prevalence began to decrease until all pigs were RT-PCR negative by 5 weeks postinfection. Our study demonstrated that RT-PCR assays functioned well to detect PEDV and that the gN assay was slightly better.

Abstract The extraordinary demands of managing the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the world’s ability to care for patients with thoracic malignancies. As a hospital’s COVID-19 population increases and hospital resources are depleted, the ability to provide surgical care is progressively restricted - forcing surgeons to prioritize among their cancer populations. Representatives from multiple cancer, surgical and research organizations have come together to provide a guide for triaging patients with thoracic malignancies, as the impact of COVID-19 evolves as each hospital.

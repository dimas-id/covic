With the advent of cross-sectional imaging, the incidence of asymptomatic detected small renal masses, 'incidentalomas', has increased in the past 20 years. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with renal masses have worse renal function at baseline and have more comorbidities than the general population. Nephron-sparing surgery allows for maximal preservation of functioning nephrons with comparable oncologic outcomes. Recently, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy has emerged as a minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgical option for treating the appropriately selected renal mass. While open-partial nephrectomy has undisputedly become standard of care for the management of the small renal mass (<4 cm), laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is becoming the preferred option for select patients in institutions in which advanced laparoscopic experience is available.

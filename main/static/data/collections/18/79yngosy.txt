INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE Sharp recanalization of chronic venous occlusions is usually performed with targeting of wire-capture devices like loop snares or balloons. We describe sharp recanalization of chronic venous occlusions using self-expanding stents and vascular plugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all sharp venous recanalization procedures performed over an 11-month period and found Wallstent and Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP) targeting was performed in 16 patients. Patient demographics, occlusion site, targeting device, technical success of the targeting, and overall procedural success were recorded. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in twelve (86%) Wallstent and two (67%) AVP deployments. Procedural success was achieved in 15 (94%). Three minor complications occurred. CONCLUSION Wallstent and AVP targeting may be a useful technique when performing sharp recanalization for chronic venous occlusions. These devices expand the target space and present the same cross section viewed from any angle and can directly capture and extract the wire, features helpful in regions with crowded vascular anatomy.

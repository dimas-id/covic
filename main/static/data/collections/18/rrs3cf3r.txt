Hepatitis C virus non-structural NS5A protein inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated activation of the Ras-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway at a point upstream of Ras activation. To determine the mechanism of this inhibition, the events occurring between the EGF receptor and Ras in Huh-7 cells harbouring the HCV subgenomic replicon were investigated. It was shown that, following EGF stimulation, these cells exhibited decreased EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, aberrant recruitment of the adaptor proteins ShcA and Grb2 to the EGF receptor, reduced phosphorylation of ShcA and reduced Ras activation in comparison with control cells. These data are consistent with effects of NS5A and/or other components of the replicon on multiple events occurring upstream of Ras.

The lack of vaccines against several important viral diseases necessitates the development of therapeutics to save lives and control epidemics. In recent years, therapeutic antibodies have received considerable attention due to their good safety profiles and clinical success when used against viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus and Hendra virus. The binding affinity of these antibodies can directly impact their therapeutic efficacy. However, we and others have also demonstrated that the subtype of Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs) engaged influences the stoichiometric requirement for virus neutralization. Hence, the development of therapeutic antibodies against infectious diseases should consider the FcγRs engaged and Fc-effector functions involved. This review highlights the current state of knowledge about FcγRs and FcγR effector functions involved in virus neutralization, with emphasis on factors that can affect FcγR engagement. A better understanding of Fc-FcγR interactions during virus neutralization will allow development of therapeutic antibodies that are efficacious and can be administered with minimal side effects.

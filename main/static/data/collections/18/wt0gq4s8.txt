Studies have demonstrated that comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and endocrine diseases, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. However, the impact of digestive system diseases has not been issued. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) on hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We extracted clinical data regarding 95 patients in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, between 26 January and 21 February 2020. The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) was used to assess the presence and severity of LPRD. An RSI greater than 13 is considered to be abnormal. A total of 95 patients with COVID‐19 were enrolled, with 61.1% (58/95), 32.6% (31/95), and 6.3% (6/95) being moderately ill, severely ill, and critically ill, respectively. In this study, 38.9% (37/95) of the patient had an RSI score over 13, which was indicative of LPRD. In univariable analysis, the age and RSI scores of severely or critically ill patients were statistically significantly higher than patients with moderate disease (P = .026 and P = .005, respectively). After controlling for age difference in a multivariable model, the RSI greater than 13, compared to RSI equal to 0, was associated with significantly higher risk of severe infection (P < .001; odds ratio [OR] = 11.411; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95‐42.09) and critical infection (P = .028; OR= 19.61; 95% CI, 1.38‐277.99). Among hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, RSI scores greater than 13, indicative of LPRD, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. The prevalence of LPRD may be higher than the general population, which indicated that COVID‐19 can impair the upper esophageal sphincter and aggravate reflux.

A micromethod was used in order to quantitate intestinal D-xylose absorption in young and extremely small birds. This test was performed in broilers collected from two farms from which birds were extremely uneven in body size and were passing poorly digested or undigested feed. A similar syndrome had been seen on all grow-outs during the 6 months before this investigation. Broilers were also collected and tested from three farms where no clinical signs of disease were seen. D-Xylose absorption peaks and curves for normal broilers closely resembled those observed in normal humans. Mean plasma D-xylose concentrations for virus-infected broilers and for broilers with pale-bird syndrome were consistently lower than concentrations for normal broilers (P = 0.009). Reoviruses, small coronavirus-like particles, small round virus particles, and abundant bacterial flagellar fragments were seen in fecal samples from broilers with pale-bird syndrome. Production performance was lowest on farms showing clinical signs of this syndrome.

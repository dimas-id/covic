INTRODUCTION A laparoscopic procedure is used more and more frequently to treat incisional hernia with the potential benefits of shorter hospitalisation and a decrease in postoperative pain. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the results of the laparoscopic treatment of incisional hernia at our institution and to identify potential risk factors for recurrence. METHODS The medical data (pre-operative, peri-operative, and postoperative) of patients who received a laparoscopic repair of their incisional hernia between January 2003 and February 2007 were recorded. The follow-up was based on a retrospective analysis of the information found in the patients' medical records. RESULTS Seventy-four laparoscopic interventions were performed on 71 patients. Polyester implants with an average size of 412.16 cm2 were used to cover the hernia. The mean operative time was 76.8 +/- 55.6 min (range, 20 to 295 min) and the mean duration of post-operative hospitalisation was 3.75 +/- 2.3 days (range, 2 to 12 days). One breach in the small intestine (1.4%) (sutured with 3/0 silk thread) and 1 conversion to laparotomy (1.4%) for a voluminous incisional hernia occurred during surgery. The post-operative morbidity was 8.2%, the rate of long-term complications was 27%, and 13 recurrences (including 3 with complications) were noted (17.6%) during a mean follow-up of 13 months. There was no postoperative mortality. Recurrences were linked to the use of large meshes corresponding to large incisional hernia diameter (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Although the morbidity/mortality rates are acceptable, technical improvements must be found to reduce the recurrence rate, in particular for large incisional hernias.

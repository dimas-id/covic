The importance of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as a major complication in patients with severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we describe the proposed pathophysiology of the prothrombotic coagulation changes observed in patients with COVID-19. Further, based on a review of the currently available evidence on VTE prevalence in patients with COVID-19, we present and discuss the recommendations from the Danish Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis on the use of thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19.

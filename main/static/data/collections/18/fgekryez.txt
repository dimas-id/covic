Airborne transmission is of significance for a number of infectious diseases in pigs. The general principles of the airborne pathway, including aerosol production, decay and inhalation, are reviewed. Practical issues regarding aerosol sampling and sample analysis are also discussed. Details of the aerobiology of porcine diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, Aujesky's disease, and respiratory diseases, are explained. Some additional, potentially airborne diseases are discussed in terms of the evidence for their aerosol transmission. In order to prevent airborne diseases in pigs, dust reduction, air filtration, air disinfection, vaccination and the establishment of disease-free regions could be considered.

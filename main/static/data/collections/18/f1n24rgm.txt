The terms of the United Kingdom's (UK's) departure from the European Union (EU) are currently being negotiated. It is therefore uncertain exactly what effect they will have on planning the UK's oral healthcare workforce. Nevertheless, as 16% of dentists currently registered with the Genral Dental Council (GDC) have migrated to the UK from EU countries, this factor must be taken into consideration by workforce planners. However, it is far from being the only factor. This opinion piece therefore describes the current numbers of non-UK EU dentists and DCPs registered with the GDC and poses the question 'will they remain in the UK in the future'? It then comments on the current legislation on recognition of non-UK dental qualifications. It goes on to consider the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendation for dental practitioners, the oral healthcare needs of the population of the UK, who could address them and the implications for the Advancing Dental Care project

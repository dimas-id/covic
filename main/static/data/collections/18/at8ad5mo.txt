Abstract Three cases of the application of focused cardiac ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 infection are presented. Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), limited transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and critical care echocardiography (CCE) were applied in cases of heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and myocarditis with thrombus respectively. The impact upon patient management and the global context of each presentation are discussed.

INTRODUCTION Abdominal wall defects and incisional hernias represent a challenging problem. Currently, several commercially available biologic prostheses are used clinically for hernia repair. We compared the performance and efficacy of two non-crosslinked meshes in ventral hernia repair to two crosslinked prostheses in a rodent model. METHODS Animals were divided into 12 groups (4 matrix types and 3 termination time-points per matrix). A ventral defect was carefully created and overlapped with the biologic prosthesis. RESULTS Major complications were seroma induction (3 mesh types), implant extrusion (1 mesh type), severe inflammatory and immune responses (non-crosslinked mesh), fibrosis and mineralisation (3 mesh types). After inflammation resolution, 3 of the matrices tested supported hernia healing but with marked tissue and temporal differences. AlloDerm(®*) and Surgisis Gold™ showed tissue reactivity with the host and a rapid rate of matrix remodelling. Bard CollaMend™(*) Implant proved to be inept for hernia repair under the conditions tested. Permacol™ biological implant integration with host tissue increased over time, supporting hernia healing with strength of tissue, and appears to be a safe prosthetic material for ventral hernia repair based on the results of this rodent study.

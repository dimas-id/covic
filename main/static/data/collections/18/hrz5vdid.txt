Diaphragm plication has become the accepted treatment for major respiratory impairment caused by diaphragmatic eventration and paralysis. Various open and minimally invasive plication techniques have been described and while video-assisted thoracoscopic diaphragm plication appears to be a safe and effective alternative to open surgery, the workspace is limited. We describe how we performed complete thoracoscopic diaphragm plication using carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation for a patient with unilateral diaphragmatic eventration. Using CO2 insufflation seems to dramatically improve the workspace.

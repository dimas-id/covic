Neutralization assays allow for sensitive detection of functional antibody responses directed against the surface protein envelopes of many viruses. For high-containment viruses like SARS coronavirus (CoV), however, these assays are not widely applicable due to the requirement for high biosafety laboratory facilities and specially trained personnel. In order to effectively address this containment issue, retroviral pseudotypes have been used as surrogates of the live virus for neutralization assays. The pseudotype-based neutralization assay system is highly flexible, allowing for a choice of reporter systems, and is readily adaptable to newly emerging virus strains.

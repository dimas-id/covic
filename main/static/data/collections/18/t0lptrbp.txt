During the last few decades, attention has increasingly focused on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the treatment of chronic respiratory failure. The University of Leuven and the University Hospitals Leuven therefore chose this topic for a 2-day working group session during their International Symposium on Sleep-Disordered Breathing. Numerous European experts took part in this session and discussed (1) NIV in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (when to start NIV, NIV and sleep, secretion management, and what to do when NIV fails), (2) recent insights in NIV and COPD (high-intensity NIV, NIV in addition to exercise training, and NIV during exercise training), (3) monitoring of NIV (monitoring devices, built-in ventilator software, leaks, and asynchronies) and identifying events during NIV; and (4) recent and future developments in NIV (target-volume NIV, electromyography-triggered NIV, and autoregulating algorithms).

BACKGROUND Our aim was to compare single incision and conventional laparoscopic surgeries performed for benign adnexal masses with regard to their intraoperative characteristics and postoperative pain levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS The main outcome measures were laparoscopic entry time, total operation time, amount of bleeding, intraoperative complications, post-operative pain scores, additional analgesic requirements, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 71 women, 39 in the conventional laparoscopy group and 32 in the SILS group, participated in the study. Demographic findings did not differ between the two groups. Similarly, rates of intraoperative complications, rates of conversion to laparotomy, pre- and postoperative hematocrit levels were not significantly different between the groups. Laparoscopic entry time was shorter in the SILS group (10.4 ± 5.9 min. vs. 5.28 ± 1.7 min.). However, total operation time was similar in the two groups. The groups did not show significant differences regarding additional analgesic requirements, or postoperative pain scores after 24 h. However, pain scores in the recovery room and after six and 12 h were lower in the SILS group. CONCLUSION SILS seems to be effective and safe for the treatment of benign adnexal masses. SILS appears to be advantageous regarding postoperative pain especially in the early period.

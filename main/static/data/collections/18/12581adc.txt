OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of a single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) major pulmonary resection performed by surgeons experienced with the two-incision technique. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent single-incision VATS major pulmonary resection from March 2012 to May 2013 were included. The fifth intercostal space was incised (3-5 cm) at the anterior or posterior axillary line according to the tumour location. RESULTS In total, 60 patients (39 men, 21 women; median age, 61 years; interquartile range, 53-69 years) were included in this study. Malignant lung disease was diagnosed preoperatively in 56 patients (93%) and benign disease in 4 (7%) patients. Lobectomy was performed in the majority of patients (n = 55), bilobectomy in 1, sleeve lobectomy in 1 and segmentectomy in 3. Four patients (7%) required a second incision, and conversion to thoracotomy was required in 2 (3%). In 50 lung cancer cases completed using a single-incision technique, the median surgical duration was 145 min (interquartile range, 90-182 min), and the total number of dissected lymph nodes per patient was 22 (interquartile range, 10-28 min). The chest tube was removed 5 days (interquartile range, 3-6 days) postoperatively, and there were no cases involving major perioperative morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision VATS major pulmonary resection is feasible, and following a two-incision technique learning period, may yield results similar to those obtained with conventional VATS lobectomy.

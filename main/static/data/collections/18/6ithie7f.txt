Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) is the considerable contributor to major complications after pancreatectomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential risk factor contributing to CR-POPF following distal pancreatectomy (DP) and discussed the risk factors of pancreatic fistula in order to interpret the clinical importance. All the patients who underwent DP in between January 2011 and January 2020 were reviewed retrospectively in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The univariate and multivariate analysis was performed was performed to test an independent risk factors for pancreatic fistula. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. In all of the 263 patients with DP, pancreatic fistula was the most common surgical complication 19.0%. The univariate analysis of 18 factors showed that the patients with a malignant tumor, soft pancreas, and patient without ligation of the main pancreatic duct are more likely to develop pancreatic fistula. However, on multivariate analysis the soft texture of the pancreas (OR= 2.381, P= 0.001) and the ligation of main pancreatic duct (OR= 0.388, P= 0.002) were only an independent influencing factor for CR-POPF. As a conclusion, pancreatic fistula was the most common surgical complication after DP, and the texture of pancreas and ligation of main pancreatic duct can influence an incidence of CR-POPF.

BACKGROUND: Globally, in 2016, about 38% and 3% of all neonatal death were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and Ethiopia, respectively. In the same year, 47 neonates out of 1000 live births were not surviving in the first 28 days of age in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Despite the highest burden of neonatal death in the region, specific or the proximate determinants of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care unit were not well identified. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the determinants of neonatal mortality at neonatal intensive care unit in Dessie Referral Hospital, Northeast Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based unmatched case-control study was conducted on neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Dessie Referral Hospital, from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2017. A total of 390 charts (130 cases and 260 controls) were selected by simple random sampling technique. The data were abstracted from the facility-based data abstraction form. A binary logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify the determinants of neonatal mortality. RESULTS: Pregnancy-induced hypertension (AOR = 4.57; 95% CI 1.45–14.43), prolonged rupture of membrane (AOR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.13–3.68), very low birth weight (AOR = 7.00; 95% CI 2.10–23.35), and low birth weight (AOR = 2.12; 95% CI 1.10–4.20) were identified factors. Moreover, respiratory distress syndrome (AOR = 3.61; 95% CI 1.10–12.04), perinatal asphyxia (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI 1.18–4.39), meconium aspiration syndrome (AOR = 2.35; 95% CI 1.12–4.97), and infection (AOR = 2.26; 95% CI 1.34–3.82) were also significantly associated with neonatal death. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-induced hypertension, prolonged rupture of membrane, low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, perinatal asphyxia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and infections were the major determinants of neonatal mortality. Therefore, special attention will be given to small and sick babies. Moreover, early anticipation of complications and management of mothers who had pregnancy-induced hypertension and prolonged rupture of the membrane would save neonates.

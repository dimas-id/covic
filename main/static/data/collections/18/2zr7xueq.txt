Mitral valve prolapse is prevalent in about 6% of young healthy females yet two to three times as prevalent in patients with hyperthyroidism [1, 8]. Hyperthyroidism is often missed as an underlying diagnosis when mitral valve prolapse is visualized by echocardiogram. There are many cardiac findings reported in the literature associated with hyperthyroidism. However, hyperthyroidism may be difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease process without other classic signs and symptoms. We report a case of an adolescent female who presented to our cardiology clinic with palpitations and chest pain diagnosed with hyperthyroidism after subtle findings of mitral valve prolapse and trivial mitral regurgitation. This case report will review the classic cardiac changes which may be observed on echocardiography in patients with hyperthyroidism.

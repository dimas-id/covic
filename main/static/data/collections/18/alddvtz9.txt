The purpose of this paper is to review the recent literature related to invasive mechanical ventilation, NIV, pediatric mechanical ventilation, and aerosol therapy. Topics covered related to invasive mechanical ventilation topics include the role of PEEP in providing lung protection during mechanical ventilation, unconventional modes for severe hypoxemia, and strategies to improve patient-ventilator interactions. Topics covered related to NIV include real-life NIV use, NIV and extubation failure, and NIV and pandemics. For pediatric mechanical ventilation, the topics addressed are NIV, invasive respiratory support, and inhaled nitric oxide. Topics covered related to aerosol therapy include short-acting β-adrenergic agents, long-acting β-adrenergic agents, long-acting antimuscarinic agents, inhaled corticosteroid therapy, phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, long-acting β-adrenergic plus inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting antimuscarinic plus inhaled corticosteroid, nebulized hypertonic saline, inhaled mannitol, and inhaled antibiotic therapy. These topics were chosen and reviewed in a manner that is most likely to have interest to the readers of Respiratory Care.

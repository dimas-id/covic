COVID‐19, the disease caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), was first reported in January 2020 (1, 2). It has become apparent that coagulopathy is a hallmark of the disease (3, 4). Additionally, thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), have been reported to occur in 27‐69% of critically ill patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 (5‐9). As a result of these reports and other anecdotal evidence, many critically ill patients are receiving empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. Yet, experts generally recommend against the use of therapeutic anticoagulation prior to the development of VTE or another clinical indication (4, 10, 11).

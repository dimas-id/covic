Growing global viral infections have been a serious public health problem in recent years. This current situation emphasizes the importance of developing more therapeutic antiviral compounds. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue virus (DENV) belong to the Flaviviridae family and are an increasing global health threat. Our previous study reported that the crude venom of Scorpio maurus palmatus possessed anti-HCV and anti-DENV activities in vitro. We report here the characterization of a natural antiviral peptide (scorpion-like peptide Smp76) that prevents HCV and DENV infection. Smp76 was purified from S. m. palmatus venom and contains 76 amino acids with six residues of cysteine. Smp76 antiviral activity was evaluated using a cell culture technique utilizing Huh7it-1, Vero/SLAM, HCV (JFH1, genotype 2a) and DENV (Trinidad 1751, type 2). A potential antiviral activity of Smp76 was detected in culture cells with an approximate IC(50) of 0.01 Î¼g/ml. Moreover, Smp76 prevents HCV infection and suppresses secondary infection, by inactivating extra-cellular infectious particles without affecting viral replication. Interestingly, Smp76 is neither toxic nor hemolytic in vitro at a concentration 1000-fold higher than that required for antiviral activity. Conclusively, this report highlights novel anti-HCV and anti-DENV activities of Smp76, which may lay the foundation for developing a new therapeutic intervention against these flaviviruses.

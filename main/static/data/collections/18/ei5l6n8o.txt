We evaluated the rapid immunochromatographic test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection using 16 saliva specimens collected from 6 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and detected N-antigen in 4 of 7 RT-PCR positive specimens. The POCT antigen test using saliva is highly considered to be a game-changer for COVID-19 diagnosis.

Abstract Since the initial characterization of a novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19), the globe has been gripped by a disruptive and dangerous pandemic that continues to upheave economies and test the limits of health care system capacities. The pandemic’s effect on neurosurgical practice has been detailed in timely editorials highlighting various challenges facing neurosurgeons who continue to strive to provide the best possible care to their patients, despite incredibly difficult circumstances. In this brief report, we seek to contribute to the ongoing efforts to accurately detail the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical practice in the United States by presenting our health care system’s unique experience.

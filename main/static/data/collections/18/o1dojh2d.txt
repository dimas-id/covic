INTRODUCTION HIV-associated cryptococcal, TB and pneumococcal meningitis are the leading causes of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the primary aim of estimating mortality from major causes of adult meningitis in routine care settings, and to contrast this with outcomes from clinical trial settings. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for published clinical trials (defined as randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) or investigator-managed prospective cohorts) and observational studies that evaluated outcomes of adult meningitis in SSA from 1 January 1990 through 15 September 2019. We performed random effects modelling to estimate pooled mortality, both in clinical trial and routine care settings. Outcomes were stratified as short-term (in-hospital or two weeks), medium-term (up to 10 weeks) and long-term (up to six months). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seventy-nine studies met inclusion criteria. In routine care settings, pooled short-term mortality from cryptococcal meningitis was 44% (95% confidence interval (95% CI):39% to 49%, 40 studies), which did not differ between amphotericin (either alone or with fluconazole) and fluconazole-based induction regimens, and was twofold higher than pooled mortality in clinical trials using amphotericin based treatment (21% (95% CI:17% to 25%), 17 studies). Pooled short-term mortality of TB meningitis was 46% (95% CI: 33% to 59%, 11 studies, all routine care). For pneumococcal meningitis, pooled short-term mortality was 54% in routine care settings (95% CI:44% to 64%, nine studies), with similar mortality reported in two included randomized-controlled trials. Few studies evaluated long-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Mortality rates from HIV-associated meningitis in SSA are very high under routine care conditions. Better strategies are needed to reduce mortality from HIV-associated meningitis in the region.

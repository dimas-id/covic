This chapter is divided into five sections. Section 15.1 discusses the rationale for using mathematical models. Section 15.2 considers the specific areas where models may be useful in studying Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Section 15.3 reviews work on modeling the dynamics of tick-borne diseases and considers the relevance of this work for CCHF. Section 15.4 considers the problem of modeling the nosocomial transmission of CCHF. Section 15.5, lastly, suggests future directions for CCHF modeling work.

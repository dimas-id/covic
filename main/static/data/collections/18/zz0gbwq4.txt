This paper repurposes the classic insight from network theory that long-distance connections drive disease propagation into a strategy for controlling a second wave of Covid-19. We simulate a scenario in which a lockdown is first imposed on a population and then partly lifted while long-range transmission is kept at a minimum. Simulated spreading patterns resemble contemporary distributions of Covid-19 across nations, regions, and provinces, providing some model validation. Results suggest that the proposed strategy may significantly flatten a second wave. We also find that post-lockdown flare-ups remain local longer, aiding geographical containment. Public policy may target long ties by heavily focusing medical testing and mobility tracking efforts on traffic and transport. This policy can be communicated to the general public as a simple and reasonable principle: Stay nearby or get checked.

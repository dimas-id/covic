If tracheal intubation is not possible using direct laryngoscopy, one option is to use a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) through which an endotracheal tube (ETT) can be passed. In children, however, the size of an uncuffed ETT that can pass through the lumen of an LMA is sometimes too small for the trachea, resulting in gas leakage around the ETT. Using a cuffed ETT may reduce the gas leak but withdrawal of the LMA is then prevented by the pilot balloon. In this study, the largest sizes of cuffed and uncuffed Mallinckrodt™ ETTs that could pass with ease through various sizes of paediatric Classic™ and ProSeal™ LMAs were documented. For cuffed ETTs, withdrawal of the LMA was made possible by simply cutting off the pilot balloon. The ETT cuff-inflating mechanism was then repaired by passing a 20 or 22 gauge cannula into the cut end of the inflating tubing. The proximal end of the cannula was then connected to a one-way valve or a three-way stopcock. This technique of cutting off the pilot balloon of the cuffed ETT made it possible to use paediatric cuffed ETTs in exchange for the LMAs tested. The task was easy to perform. Subsequent repair of the cuff-inflation tubing was effective and could withstand high pressures. These findings indicate that it is possible to pass cuffed ETTs through paediatric LMA lumens, which can provide ventilation without gas leaks, unlike uncuffed ETTs.

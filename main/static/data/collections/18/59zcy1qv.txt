The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging causative agent that was first described in late December 2019 and causes a severe respiratory infection in humans. Notably, many of affected patients of COVID-19 were people with malignancies. Moreover, cancer has been identified as an individual risk factor for COVID-19. In addition, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of COVID-19, were aberrantly expressed in many tumors. However, a systematic analysis of ACE2 aberration remained to be elucidated in human cancers. Here, we analyzed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of ACE2 across over 30 tumors. Notably, overexpression of ACE2 have been observed in including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In addition, hypo DNA methylation of ACE2 has also been identified in most of these ACE2 highly expressed tumors. Conclusively, our study for the first time curated both genetic and epigenetic variations of ACE2 in human malignancies. Notably, because our study is a bioinformatics assay, further functional and clinical validation is warranted.

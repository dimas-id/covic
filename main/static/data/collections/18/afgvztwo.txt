Infectious diseases are a major cause of death and economic impact worldwide. A more robust, adaptable, and scalable infrastructure would improve the capability to respond to epidemics. Because engineers contribute to the design and implementation of infrastructure, there are opportunities for innovative solutions to infectious disease response within existing systems that have utility, and therefore resources, before a public health emergency. Examples of innovative leveraging of infrastructure, technologies to enhance existing disease management strategies, engineering approaches to accelerate the rate of discovery and application of scientific, clinical, and public health information, and ethical issues that need to be addressed for implementation are presented.

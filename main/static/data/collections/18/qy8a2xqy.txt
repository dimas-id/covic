PURPOSE To clarify the clinical value and pitfalls of fluorescent cholangiography (FC) during single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). METHODS Our SILC procedure utilized the SILS-Port with additional 5-mm forceps through an umbilical incision. A laparoscopic fluorescent imaging system developed by Karl Storz Endoskope was utilized for fluorescent cholangiography. RESULTS We performed fluorescent cholangiography during SILC in 21 patients. All procedures were completed successfully without biliary injury. The detectability of the running course of the cystic duct, the confluence between the cystic duct and the common hepatic duct, and the common hepatic duct before the dissection in Calot's triangle was 47.6, 71.4, and 81.0 %, respectively. The detectability of biliary structures was worse in 9 obese patients (body mass index ≥ 25.0 kg/m2) than in 12 non-obese patients. The mean operative time for the patients in whom fluorescent cholangiography could identify the running course of the cystic duct before dissection in Calot's triangle (68 ± 16 min) was shorter than that for the other patients (91 ± 35 min; p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS Fluorescent cholangiography can prevent biliary injury during SILC and facilitate SILC. Obesity is the most important factor that can prevent identification of biliary structures under fluorescent cholangiography.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy has become one of the most popular bariatric surgery types and helps treating not only obesity but also endocrinological diseases related to obesity. Therefore we aimed to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on the treatment of type 2 diabetes. METHODS All patients, who underwent morbid obesity surgery during 2013-2014 and had a HbA1c >6 % were included in this prospective study. Demographical data, usage of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin were recorded, and laboratory findings as HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at the 6th and 12th months. Diabetes remission criteria were used to assess success of the surgical treatment. RESULTS Totally 88 patients were included in this study. 55 patients were using oral antidiabetic drugs and 33 patients were using insulin. At the 6th month complete remission was observed in 80 (90.9 %), partial remission in 3 (3.4 %) and persistent diabetes in 5 (5.6 %) patients. At the 12th month complete remission was observed in 84 (95.4 %), partial remission in 1 (1.1 %) and persistent diabetes in 3 (3.4 %) patients. CONCLUSIONS This study indicated that laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved a complete remission of diabetes in 95.4 % patients having type 2 diabetes during a 1 year fallow up period. However, complete remission of type 2 diabetes has been reported as 80 % during long term fallow up in the literature. In our opinion this rate may change with longer follow up periods and studies involving more patients suffering type 2 diabetes.

In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in utilising antibody Fc functions to prevent and control viral infections. The protective and therapeutic potential of Fc-mediated antibody functions have been assessed for some clinically important human viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), haemorrhagic fever viruses and influenza virus. There is mounting evidence that influenza-specific antibodies with Fc-mediated functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), can aid in the clearance of influenza virus infection. Recent influenza challenge studies and intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) therapy studies in humans suggest a protective role for Fc effector functions in vivo. Broadly-reactive influenza antibodies with Fc-mediated functions are prevalent in the human population and could inform the development of a universally protective influenza vaccine or therapy. In this review, we explore the utility of antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions against viral infections with emphasis on influenza virus.

In the era of nephron-sparing surgery for small renal tumors, thermal ablation is gaining popularity. Both cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation have well-demonstrated short-term oncologic efficacy and safety. This article shares the current literature and the radiofrequency ablation technique at a high-volume institution. Cases are presented that illustrate solutions to obstacles frequently encountered during percutaneous ablation of renal masses.

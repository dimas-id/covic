We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-RNA clearance in 22 children . The estimation of positivity at day 14 from symptom onset is 52% for nasopharyngeal swab and 31% for stool swab. These data underline the significance of nasopharyngeal and stool swab for detecting infected children; further studies are needed for transmissibility.

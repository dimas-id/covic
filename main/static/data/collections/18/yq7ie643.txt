Abstract To assess specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus, a modified DimerX flow cytometry assay was performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from HLA-A2+ SARS-recovered donors at different time points post disease. CD8+DimerX-S1203+ CTLs were detected in the PBMC from these donors up to 3 months after recovery. The percentages of CD8+DimerX-S1203+ cells paralleled the numbers of interferon-Î³-positive spots in an ELISPOT assay using the same antigenic peptide. In conclusion, DimerX-based flow cytometry staining may prove to be a real-time method to screen for CTL directed at epitopes from a newly identified virus.

At present, there is scarce information regarding the global prevalence of chronic liver disease in individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, which is becoming a global pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the overall prevalence of chronic liver disease among patients with COVID-19 disease by meta-analysing data in observational studies and to investigate the relationship between liver damage and COVID-19 disease. We included 11 observational studies for a total of 2034 adult individuals (median age 49 years [IQR 45-54], 57.2% men). The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2%-4%; I2 = 29.1%). Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus. Further studies are needed to better investigate the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 disease and the effect of treatment for COVID-19 on the liver.

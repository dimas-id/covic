Introduction The two mechanisms postulated for cancer recurrence at the anastomosis site ('anastomotic recurrence' (AR)) after curative surgery for colorectal cancer are: (i) intraluminal dissemination of viable cancer cells; (ii) metachronous carcinogenesis related with changes in the local milieu provoked by the materials employed to carry out the anastomosis. Case History We describe a 79-year-old female who underwent a left hemicolectomy due to a stenotic lesion shown on colonoscopy: an adenocarcinoma (pT3NO, G2). One year after surgery, control colonoscopy revealed an AR, so a new resection was carried out. Pathology showed it to be a recurrent adenocarcinoma over the staple line (pT3N0, G2). One year after the second surgical procedure, control colonoscopy evinced a new AR, resulting in a new resection. Pathology revealed a new AR. Conclusions This is only the second time that a second isolated AR after curative resection for colorectal cancer has been reported.

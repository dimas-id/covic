PURPOSE OF REVIEW Liver biopsy continues to be an essential component in the evaluation of many widely prevalent liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis C, fatty liver, and liver tumors. This annual review of publications in hepatobiliary pathology highlights recent pathologic studies that can be applied to the daily practice of interpreting liver biopsy, explant, and postmortem specimens. RECENT FINDINGS The problem of the fatty liver was the subject of many studies. In chronic hepatitis C, genotype 3 infection results in moderate to marked fat that is ameliorated with successful antiviral therapy. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which the metabolic syndrome is often operative, gene microarray analysis showed altered expression of genes involved in insulin sensitivity and maintenance of mitochondrial function. Pathologic changes affecting centrilobular regions were described in the context of heart disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (venoocclusive disease). A mutation in ferroportin 1 produced a form of hemochromatosis with excessive iron in hepatocytes and also in Kupffer cells and macrophages. Immunostains for Hep Par 1 and polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen remain important cornerstones in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and its distinction from metastatic adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. SUMMARY This report reviews recent articles addressing hepatobiliary pathology. In the areas of viral and drug hepatitis, fatty liver, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, several biliary tract disorders, and pathology of liver tumors, the emerging data have important diagnostic applications.

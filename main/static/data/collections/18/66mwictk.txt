A 50-year-old female was administered with left lower lobe lesion for 10 days. A preoperative chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the left basilar segment of the lung, about 2.1 cm Ã— 1.7 cm in size. Therefore, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) left lower lobectomy was performed. The operation takes 60 minutes. During the operation, the estimated blood loss was 15 mL. The patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 6 with no complications. And the pathological results confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with no lymph nodes metastasis.

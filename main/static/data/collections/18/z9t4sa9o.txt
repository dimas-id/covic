: Multiple tissue samples were obtained during emergent abdominal surgery in four patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to examine for tissue involvement by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder empyema and died from severe respiratory failure. The second patient with Crohn's disease underwent emergent laparotomy for a perforation in the terminal ileum and recovered. The third patient underwent an open appendectomy and recovered. The fourth patient underwent emergent laparotomy for a perforated peptic ulcer and died from sepsis. While the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the feces of three patients and in the duodenal wall of the patient with perforated peptic ulcer, RT-PCR examination of abdominal fluid was negative for the virus. The RT-PCR did not detect viral RNA in the wall of small intestine, appendix, and gallbladder, bile, liver, and urine. Visceral fat (omentum) and abdominal subcutaneous fat of four patients were also not infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Although this limited experience did not show direct involvement of abdominal fluid and omentum, assessment in large series is suggested to provide answers about the safety of abdominal surgery in patients with COVID-19.

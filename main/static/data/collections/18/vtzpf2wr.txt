Artificial manipulation of antibody genes has facilitated the production of several unique recombinant antibody formats, which have highly important therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Although bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) are not new, they are coming to the forefront as our knowledge of the potential efficacy of antibody-based therapeutics expands. The next generation of bsAbs is developing due to significant improvements in recombinant antibody technologies. This review focuses on recent advances with a particular focus on improvements in format and design that are contributing to the resurgence of bsAbs, and in particular, on innovative structures applicable to next generation point-of-care (POC) devices with applicability to low resource environments.

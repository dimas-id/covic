Introduction Peritoneal tear (PT) is a frequent intraoperative event during totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP). We aimed to introduce our surgical technique for PT during TEP to avoid the more difficult TEP procedure.MethodsOne surgeon with 10 years of experience performed our TEP method in 147 TEP cases from January 2012 to June 2019. We investigated the repair time of each repair technique using endoscopic suturing (suturing group, SG) and endoscopic Hem-o-lok stapling (CG). Results Twenty-three (15.6%) PT cases occurred as TEP complication. The mean repair times (with standard deviation) of the PT were 16.2 ± 13 and 7.6 ± 7.0 min in the SG and CG, respectively, indicating a significant difference (P = 0.043). The repair time of the PT using Hem-o-lok (Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) stapling was shorter than that using endoscopic suturing, which was significantly different despite the length of the PT. Conclusion Hem-o-lok stapling is feasible in case of PT during TEP.

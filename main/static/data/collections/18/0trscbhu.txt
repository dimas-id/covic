INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a communicable disease caused by a novel coronavirus. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess self­reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19 in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross­sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, in 4516 nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19 in Poland. The questionnaire included 8 questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID­19, comorbidities, and smoking status. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1942 patients with COVID­19 with a response rate of 43%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2% were women. Among nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19, 21.3% had hypertension, 4.5% had diabetes, and 3.1% had a chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2% of patients with COVID­19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6% of patients. Almost half of patients (47%) with COVID­19 reported lack of appetite and 24.2% reported diarrhea. Among 1942 interviewed patients, 54.2% reported at least 1 olfactory or taste disorder and 42.5% reported both alterations. Self­reported olfactory and taste disorders were 49.2% and 47.5%, respectively. Self­reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders during COVID­19 was significantly higher (P <0.001) in women than men. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that olfactory and taste disorders are frequent symptoms in patients with mild­to­moderate COVID­19. Moreover, our study indicated sex differences in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders among nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19.

BACKGROUND Osteoid osteomas are benign bone neoplasms that may cause severe pain and limit function. They are commonly treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) through a needle inserted into the nidus of the lesion under CT guidance, which is associated with exposure of young patients to relatively high dose of radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the amount of radiation, effectiveness and safety of an alternative imaging approach, the 3D image-guided (O-arm) technology and the Stealth navigation. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 52 electronic medical files of patients (mean age 24.7 years, range 8-59 years) who were treated with thermal ablation of benign osteoid osteomas guided by the navigated O-arm-assisted technique in our institution between 2015 and 2017. Data were extracted on the associated complications, the reduction in pain at 3 months and one year postoperatively, and the amount of radiation administered during the procedure. RESULTS The level of pain on a visual analogue scale decreased from the preoperative average of 7.73 to 0 at the 3-month follow-up. The mean dose-length product was 544.7 mGycm2 compared to the reported radiation exposure of 1971-7946 mGycm2 of CT-guided radio ablations. The one intra-operative complication was a superficial burn in the subcutaneous lesion in a tibia that was treated locally with no major influence on recovery. CONCLUSIONS RFA ablation guided by 3D O-arm stealth navigation is as effective as the traditional CT-guided technique with the advantage of lower radiation exposure.

Background and Objectives Synthetic mesh reinforcement during laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair (LHHR) reduces recurrence. Biologically derived mesh is also associated with reduced recurrence. Urinary bladder matrix (UBM), a biologically derived extracellular matrix mesh, has shown clinical success. We wanted to determine the safety and efficacy of LHHR with porcine UBM reinforcement. Methods This retrospective, single-surgeon study reviewed clinical data on patients who underwent LHHR from August 2009 through May 2014, with diaphragmatic reinforcement with porcine UBM mesh. Primary outcomes were (1) recurrence-a >2-cm defect above the diaphragm at 3 months; (2) intra- and postoperative complications; (3) pre- and postoperative esophageal reflux (GERD) or dysphagia; and (4) cessation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Results Sixty-two patients who had LHHR with UBM mesh were studied (mean age, 62 years, 53 women, mean body mass index 32.7 kg/m2) Before surgery 98% had GERD, 19% had dysphagia, and 98% were on PPI. Postoperative UGIS was performed on 66% 3 months after surgery, and 19% had a recurrence of >2 cm; 56% remained on PPI, and 16% (P < .001) remained symptomatic. Dysphagia improved in 75% (P = .05). No intraoperative complications were recorded. One postoperative mortality occurred secondary to an unrelated cardiac event. Conclusions UBM mesh was effective and safe for LHHR. In addition to reducing the rate of recurrence compared to unreinforced primary repair, the properties of UBM, including site-specific constructive tissue remodeling, may add benefits over other biologic products. This study represents an evaluation of UBM mesh in a large cohort of patients who underwent LHHR.

Abstract Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) emerged in late 1970s from the feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and developed, since then, into novel genetic and antigenic variants (CPV-2a, -2b and -2c). Canine and feline parvoviruses cause an acute enteric disease in their hosts, with high level of viral shedding. In this study, a quantitative TaqMan PCR for detection and quantitation of canine and feline parvoviruses in serum and fecal samples was developed. The primers were designed based upon the entire GenBank content for CPV and FPLV. A standard curve was generated, and validation tests were performed using 10-fold serial dilutions of CPV-2 virus in CPV/FPLV-negative feces and CPV/FPLV-negative serum samples. As a result, the 100% detection limit of the PCR was 18 copies of the viral genome per Î¼l of serum and fecal sample. All canine parvovirus types as well as FPLV were detected. In conclusion, the real-time PCR represents an upgraded and useful tool to identify and quantify canine and feline parvoviruses in different sample matrices.

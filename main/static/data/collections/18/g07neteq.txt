OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of COVID-19 cases in Suzhou China. Biomarkers were screened out of hematological parameters for risk stratification. METHOD: Confirmed COVID-19 adult patients in Suzhou were included. The patient data was collected, and the results of laboratory examinations were compared between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. A ROC was calculated to compare the diagnostic performance of candidate indexes, and dynamic levels of hematological indexes were compared between the two groups. RESULT: 75 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46.6â¯±â¯14â¯years, and 45 patients were male. All patients were classified into two groups: the mild/moderate group and the severe group. WBC, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels of the severe group were significantly higher (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) than the mild/moderate, and the lymphocyte was lower. The ROC test showed that the hematological parameters had a larger AUC than that of inflammatory factors. There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels between the two groups on day 1 (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). However, NLR of the severe group was higher than the mild/moderate on days 1, 4 and 14 (Pâ¯<â¯0.01), and so was D-dimer on days 1, 7 and 14 (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). CONCLUSION: The common COVID-19 abnormal hematological indexes on admission included hyperfibrinogenemia, lymphopenia, the elevation of D-dimer, and leukopenia, which were significantly different between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. Furthermore, the dynamic change of NLR and D-dimer level can distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from the mild/moderate.

The pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is an extremely contagious respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Certain drugs have several protein targets and many illnesses share overlapping molecular paths. In such cases, reusing drugs for more than one objective and finding their novice uses can considerably decrease the time in finding new cures for unforeseen diseases. Remdesivir has been recently a strong candidate for the treatment of Covid-19. In this commentary, we have portrayed the structure of the coronavirus in a simple way as well as the site where remdesivir acts. We have also displayed the ongoing clinical trials, as well as a published study that was conducted on compassionate base. The covid-19 pandemic might wean down by the end of summer 2020, but the risk of seasonality exists. Therefore, future disposal of agents such as remdesivir might be crucial for ensuring an efficient treatment, decrease mortality and allow early discharge. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

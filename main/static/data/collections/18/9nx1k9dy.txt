The inpainting method implemented in this work was used to estimate the missing information in a range image from a single image, achieved independence of the RGB image of the scene or multiple range images to perform the restoration. The proposal is based on improving the results of restoring range images using the Gaussian Pyramid method. This, finding the best interpolation technique to use in this method to estimate the missing information. Different interpolation techniques were computed and applied in order to know the best option to implement. This is carried out considering the amount of information that can be estimated, processing time and the total of information missing in the image to be restored. The method was tested with five different databases, one of which was created specifically for this work. These databases include different interior scenarios with several objects. A qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of the obtained results was performed.

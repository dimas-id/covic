We conducted a 12-year retrospective study to determine the effects that the community respiratory-virus species and the localization of respiratory-tract virus infection have on severe airflow decline, a serious and fatal complication occurring after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Of 132 HCT recipients with respiratory-tract virus infection during the initial 100 days after HCT, 50 (38%) developed airflow decline ⩽1 year after HCT. Lower-respiratory-tract infection with parainfluenza (odds ratio [OR], 17.9 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.0–160]; P=.01) and respiratory syncytial virus (OR, 3.6 [95% CI, 1.0–13]; P=.05) independently increased the risk of development of airflow decline ⩽1 year after HCT. The airflow decline was immediately detectable after infection and was strongest for lower-respiratory-tract infection with parainfluenza virus; it stabilized during the months after the respiratory-tract virus infection, but, at ⩽1 year after HCT, the initial lung function was not restored. Thus, community respiratory virus–associated airflow decline seems to be specific to viral species and infection localization

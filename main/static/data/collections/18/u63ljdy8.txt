Congenital malaria is rare and usually indolent but can be fatal. Mortality risk is high in newborns with Plasmodium falciparum born to nonimmune women, who typically present at birth or soon thereafter. Semi-immune women are less likely to transmit malaria, and their children often become ill weeks after delivery with less severe symptoms. Cases in the USA usually trace to semi-immune immigrant mothers whose last exposure to malaria may have preceded the pregnancy, leading to misdiagnoses. Congenital malaria may be under-recognized in malaria-endemic areas since parasitemia occurring after the first week of life is usually attributed to mosquito transmission. Malaria prophylaxis and the absence of fever during pregnancy do not preclude congenital malaria in a newborn. Quinine plus clindamycin is commonly used to treat P. falciparum congenital malaria, and chloroquine is used to treat other malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium vivax. Severe cases should be managed with intravenous quinine (available as its enantiomer quinidine in the USA) or with intravenous artesunate, which was recently approved for investigational use by the US FDA. Primaquine is not required for infants with congenital P. vivax or Plasmodium ovale, but should be offered to their mothers after excluding G6PD deficiency.

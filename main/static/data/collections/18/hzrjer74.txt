OBJECTIVE To screen the severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) mimotopes with random phage peptide library and to investigate their immunogenicity. METHODS Using SARS sera as selective molecule, a 12 mer phage peptide library was biopanned and positive clones containing the mimic epitopes were selected. The immuno-characteriation of the epitopes were then investigated. RESULTS 2 positive clones that having specific affinity to SARS sera were obtained. The DNA sequencing data showed no homology between the sequences of the deduced amino acid of the two mimic antigen peptides and the sequence of SARS. CONCLUSION SARS mimotopes were obtained by phage peptide library screening. This method might provide a new approach for SARS therapy and vaccine development.

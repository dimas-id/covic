OBJECTIVE Unplanned extubation events (UPEs) in neonates are hazardous to patient safety. Our goal was to reduce UPE rate (#UPEs per 100 ventilator days) by 50% in 12 months at our 25-bed level III inborn unit. STUDY DESIGN Baseline data were gathered prospectively for 7 months. Three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles targeting main causes of UPEs were developed over the next 20 months. Causes of UPEs were analyzed using Pareto charts; and a U control chart was created with QI Charts(Â©). Standard rules for detecting special cause variation were applied. RESULT Mean UPE rate decreased from 16.1 to 4.5 per 100 ventilator days, a 72% decrease, exceeding our goal. Analysis of U-chart demonstrated special cause variation, with eight consecutive points below the mean. Improvement was sustained throughout the study period. CONCLUSION UPEs in neonates can be reduced with process standardization and frontline staff education, emphasizing vigilant endotracheal tube (ETT) maintenance.

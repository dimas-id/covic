Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)-box polypeptide 5 (DDX5), also called p68, is a prototypical member of the large ATP-dependent RNA helicases family and is known to participate in all aspects of RNA metabolism ranging from transcription to translation, RNA decay, and miRNA processing. The roles of DDX5 in cell cycle regulation, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, cancer development, adipogenesis, Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling, and viral infection have been established. Several RNA viruses have been reported to hijack DDX5 to facilitate various steps of their replication cycles. Furthermore, DDX5 can be bounded by the viral proteins of some viruses with unknown functions. Interestingly, an antiviral function of DDX5 has been reported during hepatitis B virus and myxoma virus infection. Thus, the precise roles of this apparently multifaceted protein remain largely obscure. Here, we provide a rapid and critical overview of the structure and functions of DDX5 with a particular emphasis on its role during virus infection.

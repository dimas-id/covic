INTRODUCTION Hypoxemic respiratory failure is a common problem in critical care. Current management strategies, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, can be efficacious but these therapies put patients at risk for toxicities associated with invasive forms of support. Areas covered: In this manuscript, we discuss intravenous oxygen (IVO2), a novel method to improve oxygen delivery that involves intravenous administration of a physiologic solution containing dissolved oxygen at hyperbaric concentrations. After a brief review of the physiology behind supersaturated fluids, we summarize the current evidence surrounding IVO2. Expert commentary: Although not yet at the stage of clinical testing in the United States and Europe, IVO2 has been used safely in Asia. Furthermore, preliminary laboratory data have been encouraging, suggesting that IVO2 may play a role in the management of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure in years to come. However, significantly more work needs to be done, including definitive evidence that such a therapy is safe, before it can be included in an intensivist's arsenal for hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Enteric disease in horses may be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including several clostridial species. Paeniclostridium sordellii (previously Clostridium sordellii) has been frequently associated with gas gangrene in humans and several animal species, including horses. However, its role in enteric diseases of animals has not been fully determined. We describe herein 7 cases of enteric disease in horses associated with P. sordellii infection. Grossly, the small and/or large intestines were necrotic, hemorrhagic, and edematous. Microscopically, there was severe mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage of the small and/or large intestine of all horses. P. sordellii was isolated and/or demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and/or PCR in the intestine of all horses. All other known causes of enteric disease in horses were ruled out in these 7 cases. P. sordellii should be considered among the differential diagnoses in cases of enteric disease in horses.

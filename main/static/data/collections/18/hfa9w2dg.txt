Abstract Viral pathogens have evolved a wide range of tactics to evade host immune responses and thus propagate effectively. One efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope. Therefore, it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Using this antibody, we found that two commercial vaccines contained statistically different amounts of the decoy epitope. The vaccine with lower levels of decoy epitope induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody after immunization. This antibody can be used as an analytical tool to monitor the quality of a vaccine from batch to batch.

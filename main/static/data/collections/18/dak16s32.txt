The delivery of endoscopic care is changing rapidly in the era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Endoscopy and Procedures Committee has formulated this statement to offer practical guidance to help standardize endoscopy services for pediatric patients with the aim of minimizing COVID-19 transmission to staff, patients, and caregivers and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during this critical time. Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply. Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification. This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet. In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk. To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures). This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide. It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.

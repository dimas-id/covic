OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intra-observer reliability of plain digital radiographs for assessing normal feline femoral and tibial joint reference angles in the sagittal and frontal planes. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cadaveric radiographic anatomical study. that involved 20 short-haired domestic adult cats. METHODS: Sagittal and frontal plane tibial and femoral joint angles of 40 limbs were measured twice by three observers with different levels of experience. Inter- and intraobserver reliability was determined by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). An ICC > 0.75 was considered high correlation, 0.74 > ICC > 0.60 good correlation, 0.59 > ICC > 0.4 fair correlation and an ICC < 0.40 poor correlation. RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation angles were anatomic lateral proximal femoral angle (aLPFA) 110.6 ± 3.6; anatomic lateral distal femoral angle (aLDFA) 91.9 ± 2.1; mechanical lateral proximal femoral angle; mLPFA (mLPFA) 107.3 ± 3.6; mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) 95.5 ± 1.7; femoral neck anteversion (FNA) 121.9 ± 4.1; anatomical caudal proximal femoral angle (aCPFA) 156.1 ± 3.9; anatomical caudal distal femoral angle (aCDFA) 101.4 ± 1.4; mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA) 93.5 ± 1.2; mechanical medial distal tibial angle (mMDTA) 100.5 ± 2.3; mechanical cranial proximal tibial angle (mCrPTA) 113.1 ± 3.2; tibial plateau angle (TPA) 23.1 ± 3.2; mechanical cranial proximal tibial angle (mCrDTA) 86.7 ± 3.1.The intra-observer ICC indicated high correlation for 70% or more of the measurements. The inter-observer agreement among observers was high. These results show that the radiographic method for measuring femoral and tibial joint angles was good or high, except for FNA and mCrDTA. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some radiographic anatomical and mechanical joint angles of the femurs and tibias of normal domestic short-haired cats. We found good reliability for both intra- and interobserver measurements.

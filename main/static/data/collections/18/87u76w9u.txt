Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a safe approach for cholecystectomy, with the potential to minimise the iatrogenic trauma sustained from the operation. However, a number of reports show SILS to be technically challenging and as such there is expected to be a significant learning curve for expert surgeons adopting the new technique, as well as for junior surgical trainees. There are inherent risks to patient safety associated with practicing and developing new skills in a real-life theatre environment. However, thus far, there have been no realistic SILS training models available. We tested the feasibility of conducting SILS cholecystectomies on a cadaveric porcine model with standard operating equipment, which may provide a platform to facilitate safe training and assessment protocols. In this paper we provide an account of the training model technique, and review the literature surrounding SILS training and performance evaluation.

With an increase in the number of travelers around the world in recent years, widespread efforts to control the human-transmissible influenza and increased surveillance among poultry and humans should be given the highest priority. The purpose of this article is to describe an examination of the passengers traveling via "mini links" from Xiamen (China) to Kinmen (Taiwan) with reference to their knowledge and practice on infection control measures and satisfaction with public health policies. A survey of perceptions, attitudes, and practices was accordingly carried out. Although some research has been conducted on selected health topics and patients, little research has examined the perceptions of normal travelers. The results demonstrate that travelers' perception of risk for infection control was high; by contrast, their practices were not sufficient. The content analysis of this study also provides an empirical starting point for future research into combining travelers' knowledge and practice on disease problems with the worldwide public health policies.

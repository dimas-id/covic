In this article, we perform an analysis of COVID-19 on one of the South Saharan countries (hot zone), the Senegal (West Africa). Many questions remain unanswered: why the African continent is not very contaminated compared to other continents. Factors of cross immunity, temperature, population density, youth, etc. are taken into account for an analysis of the contamination factors. Numerical simulations are carried out for a prediction over the coming week.

Abstract The versatility of colloidal particles endows the particle-stabilized or Pickering emulsions with unique features and can potentially enable the fabrication of a wide variety of derived materials. We review the evolution and breakthroughs in the research on the use of colloidal particles for the stabilization of Pickering emulsions in recent years for the particle categories of inorganic particles, polymer-based particles, and food-grade particles. Moreover, based on the latest works, several emulsions stabilized by the featured particles and their derived functional materials, including enzyme immobilized emulsifiers for interfacial catalysis, 2D colloidal materials stabilized emulsions as templates for porous materials, and Pickering emulsions as adjuvant formulations, are also summarized. Finally, we point out the gaps in the current research on the applications of Pickering emulsions, and suggest future directions for the design of particulate stabilizers and preparation methods for Pickering emulsions and their derived materials.

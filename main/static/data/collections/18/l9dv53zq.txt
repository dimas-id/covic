PURPOSE To verify if titanium spiral tacks may contribute to intra-abdominal adhesion formation in rabbits. METHODS Ten New Zealand white rabbits were used. Through videolaparoscopic surgery two titanium spiral tacks (ProTack(®), Covidien(®)) were applied in the right flank. After 30 days the animals were submitted to evaluate peritoneal cavity by videolaparoscopy. RESULTS No adhesion was found where the titanium spiral tacks were placed. CONCLUSION Titanium spiral tacks for fixation do not cause adhesions in rabbits.

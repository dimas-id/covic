CD40 ligation has been shown to promote antigen-presenting functions of dendritic cells, which express CD40 receptor. Here we reported significantly altered biodistribution and immune responses with the use of CD40-targeted adenovirus. Compared with unmodified adenovirus 5, the CD40-targeted adenovirus following intravenous administration (i.v.) resulted in increased transgene expressions in the lung and thymus, which normally do not take up significant amounts of adenovirus. Intradermal injection saw modified adenovirus being mainly processed in local draining lymph nodes and skin. Following intranasal administration (i.n.), neither unmodified nor targeted viruses were found to be in the liver or spleen, which predominantly took up the virus following i.v. administration. However, inadvertent infection of the brain was found with unmodified adenoviruses, with the second highest gene expression among 14 tissues examined. Importantly, such undesirable effects were largely ablated with the use of targeted vector. Moreover, the targeted adenovirus elicited more sustained antigen-specific cellular immune responses (up to 17-fold) at later time points (30 days post boosting), but also significantly hampered humoral responses irrespective of administration routes. Additional data suggest the skewed immune responses induced by the targeted adenoviruses were not due to the identity of the transgene but more likely a combination of overall transgene load and CD40 stimulation.

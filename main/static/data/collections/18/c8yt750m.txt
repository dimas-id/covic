The novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has created uncertainty in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). This population experiences high mortality from delays in treatment of valve disease but is largely overlapping with the population of highest mortality from COVID-19. We present strategies for managing patients with severe AS in the COVID-era. We suggest transitions to virtual assessments and consultation, careful pruning and planning of necessary testing, as well as fewer and shorter hospital admissions. These strategies center on minimizing patient exposure to COVID-19 and expenditure of human and health-care resources without significant sacrifice to patient outcomes during this public health emergency. Areas of innovation to improve our care during this time include increased use of wearable and remote devices to assess patient performance and vital signs, devices for facile cardiac assessment, and widespread use of clinical protocols for expedient discharge with virtual physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation options.

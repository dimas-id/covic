INTRODUCTION Perineal hernia is a protrusion of the pelvic floor which contains intra-abdominal viscera. The occurrence of perineal hernia after abdominoperineal resection (APR) is rare, but it has been reported in recent years that the incidence of perineal hernia after rectal cancer surgery has increased. This has been attributed to a shift towards extralevator abdominoperineal resection, together with more frequent and long-term use of neoadjuvant therapy. PRESENTATION OF CASE Here, we report a patient with perineal hernia 5 years after APR surgery for rectal cancer. We decided to perform robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery on this patient using the da Vinci Surgical System. The perineal hernia was repaired by primary closure with the placement of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh as reinforcement for the pelvic floor. No complications occurred during the operation, and the patient was discharged on the third day after the operation. Clinical follow-up proceeded at the designated time intervals without difficulties. DISCUSSION The recurrence rates of perineal hernia are still very high, and due to poor view, suturing, and mesh placement in the deep pelvis, surgeons face many challenges. Many methods have been described, but there is still no consensus as to the optimal repair technique for perineal hernia. CONCLUSION Perineal hernias can be repaired with robot-assisted laparoscopy. Furthermore, compared with the open and laparoscopic methods, suturing and mesh placement are easier with the robot approach.

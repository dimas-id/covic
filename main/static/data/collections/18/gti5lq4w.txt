Accelerated by the rapid advancements of our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathology of diseases and of the components and mechanisms of cellular and humoral immune responses, new vaccination strategies are being developed and explored for treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune disorders and allergies. Many newly developed vaccination strategies are already in clinical trials, some with very promising results. Although most of these strategies are still at very early stages of their development, it is foreseeable that vaccination will evolve to play an important role in prevention, treatment and management of all the above classes of diseases.

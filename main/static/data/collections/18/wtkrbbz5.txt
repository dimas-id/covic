To understand the difference between benign and severe outcomes after Coronavirus infection, we urgently need ways to clarify and quantify the time course of tissue and immune responses. Here we re-analyze 72-hour time-series microarrays generated in 2013 by Sims and collaborators for SARS-CoV-1 in vitro infection of a human lung epithelial cell line. Using a Transcriptogram-based top-down approach, we identified three major, differentially-expressed gene sets comprising 219 mainly immune-response-related genes. We identified timescales for alterations in mitochondrial activity, signaling and transcription regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems and their relationship to viral titer. At the individual-gene level, EGR3 was significantly upregulated in infected cells. Similar activation in T-cells and fibroblasts in infected lung could explain the T-cell anergy and eventual fibrosis seen in SARS-CoV-1 infection. The methods can be applied to RNA data sets for SARS-CoV-2 to investigate the origin of differential responses in different tissue types, or due to immune or preexisting conditions or to compare cell culture, organoid culture, animal models and human-derived samples.

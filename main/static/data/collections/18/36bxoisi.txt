INTRODUCTION Single port laparoscopic access could reduce morbidity associated with additional trocar placement and, through the development of a hybrid intermediate, facilitate the clinical adoption of evolving techniques such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Advanced trocar technology, as much as adapted surgical technique, seems necessary to best facilitate this, however. METHODS A novel port (Airseal, Surgiquest) that uses vortex technology to create an air-curtain seal to maintain the pneumoperitoneum while facilitating the simultaneous passage of multiple working instruments was trialed. For this, 6 pigs (30 kg each) underwent sigmoid resection and reanastomosis using the port as the sole laparoscopic access for conventional instrumentation. All animals were thereafter survived for observation during a 2-week convalescence before undergoing repeat general anesthesia, sigmoidoscopy for anastomotic assessment, and forensic laparotomy for determination of intraperitoneal healing and complications. RESULTS The operation was technically feasible via a single port within a short time in every animal (mean duration 12.3 minutes). One anastomosis had to redone because of staple misfire but this too was accomplishable without additional port placement. All animals survived and convalesced normally without evincing clinical complication. At follow-up, all anastomoses were patent at sigmoidoscopy and only 1 animal had evidence of complicated anastomotic healing (the same animal that had needed anastomotic refashioning). CONCLUSIONS Single port colonic resection and reanastomosis is readily achievable in this animal model. As an operative approach, it may both advance in its own right as much as facilitate the evolution and clinical incorporation of other developmental access routes.

Summary Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon complication after an asthma attack. The essential clinical sign is the presence of subcutaneous emphysema. In the great majority of cases, the treatment of pneumomediastinum corresponds to that of asthma, with resorption over several days. The situation is very different when the development of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is secondary to an aspiration syndrome.

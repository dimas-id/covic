Abstract Respiratory Pathogen 13 Detection Kit (13× kit) is able to simultaneously detect 11 respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydia in a single reaction. Using 572 Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from hospitalized children, the clinical performance of 13× kit for detecting 11 respiratory viruses was evaluated in comparison with a routinely used 2-tube multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay (2-tube assay) at provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China. The clinical performance of 13× kit for detecting MP and Chlamydia was evaluated by commercial real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits or sequencing. For tested viruses, the assay concordance was 95.98% and the kappa coefficient was 0.89. All the MP and Chlamydia positive samples detected by 13× kit were confirmed as true positives. The utilization of the 13× kit in clinical settings will be helpful for doctors to assess clinical outcome according to virus type or multiple infections, and to limit the use of antibiotics.

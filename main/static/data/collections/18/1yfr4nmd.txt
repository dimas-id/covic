A cDNA clone of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spike protein gene has been recombined into vaccinia virus. Cells infected with the recombinant virus synthesized IBV spike antigen which was recognized by antibody raised against purified spike protein. Immunofluorescence showed that the IBV spike antigen was transported to the infected cell surface membrane and immunoprecipitation showed the presence of the glycosylated 180K mol. wt. polypeptide precursor of the two spike subunits S1 and S2 that comigrated with this antigen from IBV-infected cells. Vaccinated mice produced antibody that recognized the IBV spike antigen by ELISA and which neutralized IBV infectivity as shown by ciliostasis tests on tracheal organ cultures.

Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the Nebraska calf diarrhea strain of bovine rotavirus (BRV) were characterized. Indirect fluorescent-antibody assay, immunodot assay, and immunoprecipitation were used to select hybridomas that produced anti-BRV MAbs. Seven of the MAbs were shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot assay to be reactive with the BRV outer capsid protein, VP7, which has a molecular mass of 37.5 kDa. None of the seven MAbs were reactive with canine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, or uninfected Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. Two clones, 8B4 (immunoglobulin G2a [IgG2a]) and 2B11 (IgG1), were found suitable for use in an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting BRV in bovine fecal samples. Both were subtype A specific (G6 subtype) but did not react with all isolates of BRV group A.

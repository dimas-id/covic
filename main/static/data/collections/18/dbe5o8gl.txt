Publisher Summary The need to better understand hostâ€“pathogen interactions has risen with the expansion in genomics and related technologies. This chapter focuses on two aspects of the host response to pathogens where major advances are being made using genomic approaches. The availability of complete genomic sequences of an expanding number of pathogens, the human and mouse genome sequences, and the advent of genome-wide genotyping and gene expression profiling has opened up new avenues of investigation in the field. The genotype of the pathogen plays a major role in the response of the host to infection with more virulent pathogenic strains possessing the capability to interfere with the host immune response. In addition, different individuals in a population can have very different responses to a genetically identical pathogen. Part of the differential response is governed by the underlying genetic differences between individuals. The advent of genome-wide genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms or microsatellite markers is leading to major advances in molecular epidemiology. The future impact of genomic approaches on the development of diagnostics and therapeutics is discussed for infectious diseases. This includes defining the basis of genetic susceptibility to infection and system-wide molecular response to a pathogen.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) is said to provide excellent long-term continence. In this study, we compared the early incontinence outcomes of our patients, who had undergone no reconstruction, posterior reconstruction only, or total anatomic restoration and posterior reconstruction. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the patients who underwent RALRP for localized prostate cancer by a single surgeon in our clinic from January 1, 2009-February 1, 2016. Continence was defined as no leakage or use of a safety pad for minimal leakage. The main outcome measure was continence at postoperative week 1 and months 1, 6, and 12. RESULTS Between 2009 and 2016, 239 patients underwent RALRP for localized prostate disease. Seventy-four patients underwent a standard approach (group 1), 88 had posterior reconstruction (group 2), and 77 had posterior reconstruction with total anatomic restoration (group 3). After 1 week, 24.3% of the patients in group 1 (18/74), 31.8% in group 2 (28/88), and 45.8% in group 3 (33/72) were continent (P = .02). One month after the surgery, continence rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 56.7, 67, and 75%, respectively (0.065). After 6 and 12 months, continence rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 72.9 and 87.8%, 81.8 and 89.7%, and 84.7 and 91.6%, respectively (P = .178 and .7484). CONCLUSION Anatomic restoration improves continence rates in the early period after RALRP. Even though other parameters were higher in the total restoration group, immediate continence (at 1 week) was significantly better.

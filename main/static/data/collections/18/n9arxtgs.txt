We recently presented evidence that the subunit eIF3-f of the eukaryotic initiation translation factor eIF3 that interacts with the E3-ligase Atrogin-1/muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) for polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation is a key target that accounts for MAFbx function during muscle atrophy. To understand this process, deletion analysis was used to identify the region of eIF3-f that is required for its proteolysis. Here, we report that the highly conserved C-terminal domain of eIF3-f is implicated for MAFbx-directed polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Site-directed mutagenesis of eIF3-f revealed that the six lysine residues within this domain are required for full polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In addition, mutation of these six lysines (mutant K(5-10)R) displayed hypertrophic activity in cellulo and in vivo and was able to protect against starvation-induced muscle atrophy. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the C-terminal modifications, believed to be critical for proper eIF3-f regulation, are essential and contribute to a fine-tuning mechanism that plays an important role for eIF3-f function in skeletal muscle.

Background: Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 respirators are an urgent concern in the setting of the global COVID-19 pandemic Decontamination of PPE could be useful to maintain adequate supplies, but there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of decontamination technologies Methods: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70 degrees C for 30 minutes We assessed the decontamination of 3 commercial N95 respirators inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2 and Phi6;the latter is an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses Three and 6 log10 reductions on respirators were considered effective for decontamination and disinfection, respectively Results: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s The high-level disinfection cabinet was effective for decontamination of the N95s and achieved disinfection with an extended 31-minute cycle Dry heat at 70 degrees C for 30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages Conclusions: UV-C could be useful to reduce contamination on N95 respirators However, the UV-C technologies studied did not meet pre-established criteria for decontamination under the test conditions used The high-level disinfection cabinet was more effective and met criteria for disinfection with an extended cycle

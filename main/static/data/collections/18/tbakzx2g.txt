PURPOSE Surgery with minimal scar has become a widely used surgical method during the last decade. Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) promises better cosmetic results and probably less pain compared with conventional laparoscopy. METHODS In a period of 5 months, data were collected and analyzed from patients, who underwent SILC using the Glove port. Another group of patients who underwent standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same period has been taken as control group. Demographic data, operative time, successfulness of operation, length of hospital stay, and postoperative findings were collected. RESULTS Twenty-five patients underwent SILC and 30 patients underwent the standard procedure. There were no conversions to open procedure in either group. No major complications occurred. Operative time in SILC cases was significantly more than the standard technique, whereas postoperative pain in the SILC group was considerably less. CONCLUSIONS It seems that in selected patients (with a low risk of adhesions or technical difficulty), SILC can be an acceptable alternative to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy with acceptable results.

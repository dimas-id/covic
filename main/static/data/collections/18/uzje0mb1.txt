We clarify the problem in which occasions can gravitational force be regarded emergent from thermodynamic, by proposing an entropic mechanism that can extract the entropic gradient existing in spacetime, due to the variation of the Casini-Bekenstein bound in specific non-unitary processes with the heat flux $\delta Q$ into the whole casual wedge. We explicitly formulate the derivation of inertial force as the emergent gravitational attraction from the Entanglement First Law. This entropic mechanism leads to a rigorous formulation of Entropic Gravity theories to generic situations, reproducing the Newton's Second Law in Rindler space and the gravitational force (together with derivation of the Einstein equation) beyond the near-horizon region. It also corresponds to a new holographic interpretation, which can be adapted into the AdS/CFT framework. Besides, the understanding of the gravitational attraction from this mechanism also suggests one simple function $S_{ext}=\frac{m_{rad}}{T_H}=8\pi G(M-m_{rad})m_{rad}$ for Page Curve of evaporating asymptotic flat black holes. Our theory from entanglement now overcomes several major criticisms towards Verlinde's original entropic force proposal, and can co-exist with Susskind's Complexity Tendency.

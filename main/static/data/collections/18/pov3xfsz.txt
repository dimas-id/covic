BACKGROUND A haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) reduces cerebral oxygenation in appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) preterm neonates. Reduced cerebral oxygenation has been associated with brain injury. Preterm small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates show higher cerebral oxygenation than AGA peers throughout the first postnatal days. To date, no studies have investigated the effect of hsPDA on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates. OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the effect of hsPDA on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates compared to AGA peers. We hypothesised that higher baseline cerebral oxygenation would reduce the impact of hsPDA on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates. METHODS We monitored regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) with near-infrared spectroscopy and calculated the cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) for 72 h after birth. Retrospective analysis compared 36 preterm SGA neonates (birth weight <10th percentile, 18 with hsPDA) to 36 preterm AGA neonates (birth weight 20th to 80th percentile, 18 with hsPDA). RESULTS In contrast to the other groups, SGA-hsPDA neonates demonstrated a significant fall in rScO2 [69% (SEM 2.5) at 4-8 h to 61% (2.7) at 68-72 h, p < 0.001] with a concurrent rise in cFTOE [0.26 (0.026) at 4-8 h to 0.34 (0.030) at 68-72 h, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to our hypothesis, hsPDA had a significant negative effect on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates. Future studies should explore the potential benefits of early screening and treatment for hsPDA on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm SGA neonates.

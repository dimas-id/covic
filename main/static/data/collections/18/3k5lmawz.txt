Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent RNA virus that spread around the planet in about 4 months. The consequences of this rapid spread on the virus evolution are under investigation. In this work, we analyzed ca. 9,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. We show that the virus is a complex of slightly different genetic variants that are unevenly distributed on Earth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is spatially structured. We hypothesize this could be the result of founder effects occurring as a consequence of, and local evolution occurring after, long-distance dispersal. In light of our results, we discuss how dispersal may constitute an opportunity for the virus to fix otherwise rare, and/or develop new, mutations. Based on previous studies, the possibility that this could significantly affect the virus phenotype is not remote. Relevance A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have died all around the planet. Quickly after the pandemic onset, metagenomic studies showed the causative agent, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonged to the Betacoronavirus genus, responsible for spillover events in 2002 and 2012 (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, respectively). The zoonotic origins of these viruses (possibly bats, camelids, pangolins and/or palm civets) have received much attention. However, other evolutionary aspects, such as spatial variation, have received comparatively little attention. This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 variants, which we call virotypes, are heterogeneously distributed on Earth and demonstrates that the virus phylogeny is geographically structured. We explain how this may be due to founder effects combined with high mutation rates.

The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2) were investigated. DNA vaccine plasmids, pcDNA-N and pcDNA-IL2, were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL2 by intramuscular injection. Cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by indirect ELISA, lymphocyte proliferation assays, ELISPOT and FACS. The nucleocapsid DNA vaccine had good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunity in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances specific immune responses. This study provides a frame of reference for the design of DNA vaccines against SARS-CoV.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at an approximately 0.5% to 3% increased risk of thromboembolism during and immediately after catheter ablation. Treatment guidelines recommend periprocedural oral anticoagulation plus unfractionated heparin during ablation. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran are the only non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants for which there are randomized controlled trials assessing uninterrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF. Edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is noninferior vs warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism with less major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular AF. The ELIMINATE-AF (Evaluation of Edoxaban Compared With VKA in Subjects Undergoing Catheter Ablation of Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation) trial is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, blinded-endpoint evaluation (PROBE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg in patients indicated for a dose reduction) vs vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing catheter ablation (http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02942576). A total of 560 patients are planned for randomization to edoxaban or VKA (2:1 ratio) to obtain 450 patients fully compliant with the protocol. Patients will complete 21 to 28 days of anticoagulation prior to the ablation and a 90-day post-ablation period. The primary efficacy endpoint is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, and major bleeding. The primary safety endpoint is major bleeding. A magnetic resonance imaging substudy will assess the incidence of silent cerebral lesions post-ablation. ELIMINATE-AF will define the efficacy and safety of edoxaban for uninterrupted oral anticoagulation during catheter ablation of AF.

At many breeding facilities, rats are housed at relatively high densities until they are 5 weeks old, at which point they are either shipped for research or rehoused at standard cage densities according to weight. The authors carried out a pilot study in Long Evans and in Fischer 344 rats to investigate whether continuing to house rats at high densities (24 in(2) floor space per rat) past the age of 5 weeks, through puberty and into adulthood would alter behavioral or physiological parameters compared with raising rats at standard densities (about 72 in(2) floor space per rat). After rats reached puberty, the authors rehoused them with unfamiliar cagemates. The researchers evaluated clinical and behavioral signs of stress, weight, blood glucose concentration, white blood cell count and serum corticosterone concentration. Overall, cage density had little effect on the parameters measured, though gender seemed to affect stress in Long Evans rats. The results suggest that rats of these strains can be raised at the higher densities tested until any age and regrouped with unfamiliar cagemates without compromising rats' welfare or subsequent experimental data.

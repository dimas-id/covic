BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus causes viral pneumonia characterized by lower respiratory tract symptoms and 19severe inflammatory response syndrome. Studies have suggested that the virus has a clinical course with the stepwise progression of clinical signs and symptoms and radiologic alterations. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present case report, we discuss two patients who presented with mild symptoms and CT imaging not suggestive of COVID-19, but subsequently had a rapid deterioration, with severe involvement happening in CT imaging. One of the patients survived the initial deterioration, but the other passed away. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the clinical course of the virus may be rapidly progressive in some patients, and special attention should be paid to patients being treated for the virus outside of the hospital as an outpatient.

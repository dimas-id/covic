This report documented the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of hepatolithiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma and cyanoacrylate glue in the management of post-ablation bronchobiliary fistula. A 47-year-old Chinese woman with 20 years history of extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholangiolithiasis and multiple hepatic segmentectomy, developed hepatolithiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma. The tumor was successfully treated with RFA but patient developed bronchobiliary fistula. Cyanoacrylate glue was used for occluding the bronchobiliary fistula. CT scan at 3 months showed complete restoration of physiological separation between the biliary and bronchial system. Repeat CT scan showed complete tumor ablation with no signs of tumor recurrence 10 months after RFA. In conclusion, RFA may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with hepatolithiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma who are poor candidates for surgical resection. Protection of the integrity of the bile duct and diaphragm during RFA can minimize postoperative complications. In case of development of post-ablation bronchobiliary fistula, cyanoacrylate glue can be used to occlude the fistula, before surgical resection is considered.

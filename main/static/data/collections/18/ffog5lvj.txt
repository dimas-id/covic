The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) has caused increasing number of infected cases globally. This study was performed to analyze information regarding the transmission route and presence of viral nucleic acids on several clinical samples. Confirmed 2019-nCov-infected cases were identified in Dongyang and were treated according to guidelines for the diagnosis of 2019-nCov infection released by the National Health Commission. Information regarding the contacts that the infected people had was collected to determine whether it caused clustered cases. A series of successive nucleic acid examination of feces, oropharyngeal swabs, and sputum was also performed, and the results were analyzed. A total of 19 confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection were identified in Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, China. Five cases showed severe symptoms, and the remaining ones showed mild manifestations. Ten cases infected from two asymptomatic individuals were clustered into two groups. Among 14 cases with consecutive nucleic acid test results, four patients showed positive results in feces after their negative conversion in oropharyngeal swabs. Asymptomatic individuals with the virus could cause 2019-nCov clustered cases, and the clustered cases may differ from sporadic cases on age and length of hospitalization. In addition, nucleic acids in feces last longer than those in oropharyngeal swabs.

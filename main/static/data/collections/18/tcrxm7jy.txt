Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a pandemic that has shocked the world twice over the last two decades caused by a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus (CoV). It causes disease in the lower respiratory tract in humans that was first reported in late 2002 in Guangdong province, China, and later on in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The two viruses designated as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, originated probably from the bat and infected humans via carrier animals. The constant recombination and evolution in the CoV genome may have facilitated their cross-species transmission resulting in recurrent emergence as a pandemic. This chapter intends to accumulate recent findings related to CoV transmission and tentative molecular mechanisms governing the process.

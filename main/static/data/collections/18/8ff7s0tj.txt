Background The COVID-19 pandemic has within months turned the world upside down. With personal distancing and shortage of personal protective equipment, face-to-face health care encounters are increasingly becoming problematic. Neurological manifestations are also being observed in clinical presentations. Objective Worldwide most countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control (USA) have recommended use of Telemedicine during the current pandemic.With acute shortage of neurologists and neurosurgeons and their lopsided distribution, it becomes more difficult to provide neurological care to those who need it the most, particularly with travel restrictions. The author has since 2002 been advocating use of Telemedicine in Neurosciences. Materials and Methods This article reviews the increasing deployment of Telemedicine in neurological practice in the last few years, particularly the radical exponential use in the last few months due to COVID-19. Conclusions With possible reduction in face-to-face consultations, remote evaluation may become mainstream. Webinars will play an increasing role. CME's and resident training will become more and more digital. The world will never be the same again. It is imperative that we accept and start deploying the "New Normal".

Surgical resection is the current standard of therapy for the treatment of arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Endovascular embolization is commonly used as an adjunct prior to surgical resection because it is believed to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding. Embolization has been associated with other complications including visual deficits, vessel perforation, and catheter adhesion. Catheter adhesion in which retained segments are contained within the embolization cast are not necessarily cause for concern, but retention of larger portions may confer an increased risk of thrombus formation. Such cases warrant the removal of the retained segments or the patient may suffer serious complications including death related to cerebrovascular events. In this case report, we describe a unique case of catheter adhesion in which the extension of the feeding catheter and the length of the introducer was left in its entirety down to the entry portion at the level of the groin and later retrieved in its entirety by craniotomy.

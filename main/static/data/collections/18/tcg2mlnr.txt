In the present article a mathematical model is proposed to research the current coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) in Paraguay, describing the multiple transmission paths in the infection dynamics, following the susceptible, exposed, infectious, hospitalized, with lost immunity and recovered individuals, as well as the role of the virus in the environment and deaths from COVID-19 or other reasons. In order to reflect the impact of the control measures adopted by the government and the population, the model employs variable transmission rates that change with the epidemiological status and environmental conditions. The model is validated, and its application is demonstrated with data publicly available.

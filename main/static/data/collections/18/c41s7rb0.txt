Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a central role in modern days technology. From simple thermostat controllers to more advanced autonomous cars, their versatility makes them perfect candidates for many applications, in particular for safety critical ones. Thus, their certification is a key issue and formal methods are good candidates to assess safety and produce associated certificates. Hybrid systems show continuous-time dynamics depending on mode that is required in several stages of the architecture of Cyber-Physical Systems. Our work addresses the problem of formally verifying hybrid systems using refinement and proof with Event-B. Our previous work [14] presented formally verified generic architecture patterns for designing centralised hybrid systems, based on our generic approach [15]. We extend this work and give a formally verified architecture pattern aimed at modelling distributed hybrid systems, featuring multiple plants and multiple controllers. We validate the approach and illustrate the use of the defined pattern on an extension of a very common case study, borrowed from literature.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is presented for the detection of the K99 antigen of Escherichia coli in calf faeces. False-positive reactions were not observed with K99-negative strains and with several viral antigens. Only bovine coronavirus caused slight positive reactions which could be eliminated by a blocking test. As compared with the conventional procedure for the detection of the K99 antigen, ELISA seemed to be a least as sensitive and had the advantage that samples could be stored at --20 degrees C before testing. In addition many samples could be handled at the same time and the results became available quickly. By carrying out the assay as a blocking test, specific antibody against K99 in serum or colostrum could be detected and titrated.

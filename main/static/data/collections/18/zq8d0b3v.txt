OBJECTIVE To report a technique of minimally invasive radical nephrectomy for a native renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and nonischemic open partial nephrectomy for a transplant kidney RCC with only a laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) incision. Concomitant RCCs in a native and transplant kidneys are very rare. Conventional surgical approach requires a long incision. METHODS A 50-year-old man 14 years after renal transplant was found incidentally to have concomitant RCCs in his native right kidney and transplant kidney. A right lower abdomen Gibson incision, along his transplant wound, was used initially for LESS right radical nephrectomy and lymphadenectomy, and that same wound was used for a nonischemic open partial nephrectomy in the transplant kidney. RESULTS The LESS right radical nephrectomy took 3.25 hours with estimated blood loss (EBL) of 80 mL and the partial nephrectomy for the transplant kidney took 3 hours with EBL of 220 mL. No transfusion was required. Pathologic examination revealed both tumors to be RCC, clear cell type, and 6.5 cm in the right native kidney and 2.8 cm in the transplant kidney. The final wound measured 9 cm. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with inpatient narcotic requirement of 37 mg morphine sulfate equivalent, and oral intake of food resumed in 2.5 days. His allograft function was well preserved with a serum creatinine unchanged (1.4 mg/dL) at discharge. CONCLUSION In a patient with concomitant tumors in a native kidney and a transplant kidney, this unique approach provides exceptional benefits of minimally invasive tumor excision for both tumors, and good preservation of renal function.

OBJECTIVE Angiographic dissection is considered to be associated with restenosis. However, little is known about the impact of the severity of angiographic dissection on future restenosis. METHODS A total of 319 consecutive de novo femoropopliteal lesions were treated by balloon angioplasty alone. All of these lesions were divided into three groups: group A, no angiographic dissection; group B, mild dissection, the width of the dissection was less than one-third of the lumen; and group C, severe dissection, the width of the dissection was more than one-third of the lumen. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the primary patency rate at 3 years between the groups. RESULTS The primary patency rates at 3 years were 66.0% in group A, 63.8% in group B, and 32.5% in group C (log-rank, P < .001). Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that a lesion length >100 mm (hazard ratio, 1.734; 95% confidence interval, 1.099-2.735; P = .018) and severe angiographic dissection (hazard ratio, 1.956; 95% confidence interval, 1.276-2.997; P = .002) were predictors of primary patency loss at 3 years. When the lesions were divided into two groups according to the lesion length >100 mm or not, angiographic dissection had a larger impact on restenosis in a long lesion >100 mm (â‰¤100 mm: 65.5% in group A, 75.6% in group B, and 48.0% in group C [log-rank, P = .015]; >100 mm: 68.8% in group A, 42.5% in group B, and 24.2% in group C [log-rank, P = .017]). CONCLUSIONS Severe angiographic dissection was associated with future restenosis after balloon angioplasty for femoropopliteal lesions, but mild angiographic dissection was not. Angiographic dissection had more impact on future restenosis particularly in treated long lesions. Stents might not be necessary in short lesions with mild dissection.

The present work describes the state of art in India with respect to the development of low-cost mechanical ventilators. It highlights the bare minimum specifications that are required in a ventilator to fight the COVID-19 menace. With respect to this, CSIR-CMERI is developing a motorized bellow-based ventilator, which has inbuilt intelligence to assist a patient who is trying to breathe or supply a prescribed volume at a defined pressure to a passive patient.

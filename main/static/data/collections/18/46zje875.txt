Abstract Aim To assess the benefits and challenges of remote reporting using an intra-departmental teleradiology system. Materials And Methods A pilot of an in-hospital Trust radiologist reporting on in-hospital Trust patients via a remote login was undertaken. Reporting output, training impact, and quality improvement were measured. Results Reporting output increased by 140%. Trainee satisfaction was high in a qualitative survey, particularly for out-of-hours support and teaching. Clinicians found the service to be similar to the same service provided by a locally based radiologist. Conclusion In the COVID-19 era, remote working has developed rapidly. This study shows that radiology departments can provide remote reporting that is equal in standard to reporting from within the hospital, and in addition, that there are advantages to output and training.

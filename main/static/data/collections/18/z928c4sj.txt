In the 1 May 2006 issue of the Journal in the article by Poccia et al. (Poccia F, Agrati C, Castilletti C, et al. Anti–severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus immune responses: the role played by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. J Infect Dis 2006; 193:1244–9), there was a deficiency in the “Financial support” footnote, at the bottom of the left-hand column of the title page (page 1244); the sources of support listed in this footnote should have included the European Commission EPISARS (contract NSP22-CT-2004-511063). The authors regret this error

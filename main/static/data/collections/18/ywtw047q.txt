OBJECTIVE Postoperative visual dysfunction (POVD) after cardiovascular surgery rarely is reported, since it is more likely underdetected and underreported. This study was designed to verify the presence of POVD, including a variety of asymptomatic as well as symptomatic visual dysfunctions after cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING Cardiothoracic surgery in a medical university hospital. PARTICIPANTS Seventy-one patients undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery with CPB. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All patients were assessed by a battery of 7 neuro-ophthalmic examinations preoperatively and postoperatively, including fundus, visual field, eye movement, color vision, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and critical flicker frequency. Patients were considered to have POVD if they had postoperative new abnormal findings of neuro-ophthalmic examinations. One patient was excluded due to a failure of postoperative neuro-ophthalmic examinations. In 16 of 70 patients analyzed in this study, selective cerebral perfusion was required for aortic arch surgery. Of 70 patients, a total of 8 patients (11.4%) had postoperative new abnormal findings in neuro-ophthalmic examinations, including new visual field deficits in 4, reduced visual acuity in 4, and/or increased intraocular pressure in 1 patient. Of these 8 patients, symptomatic POVD was recognized in 1 patient (1.4%) with postoperative visual field deficit and reduced visual acuity. There were no new abnormal findings compared with preoperative results in postoperative funduscopy, eye movement, color vision, and critical flicker frequency. CONCLUSIONS These results indicated that the asymptomatic as well as symptomatic POVD can develop after cardiovascular surgery with CPB, and their incidence may be relatively high.

COVID-19 has recently become a major pandemic with associated socioeconomic dimensions. Mortality statistics suggest that COVID-19 is more lethal in aged patients with comorbid conditions including hypertension. There is ongoing debate about whether the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are useful or hazardous in patients with COVID-19, with both narratives supported by researchers with different hypotheses. The researchers supporting the use of these medications believe ACE2 functional blockers may block cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus improve patient outcomes. The counter viewpoint argues that continuous use of these drugs results in hyperexpression of ACE2 receptors on respiratory epithelium allowing easier SARS-CoV-2 intracellular entry, resulting in enhanced viral replication and tissue damage. This short review discusses the available research on the subject with the objective to consolidate data to allow formulation of recommendations on their use or otherwise. Moreover, the authors also suggest areas for future research on the subject.

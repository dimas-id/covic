Vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) link to desmosomes (intercellular junctions) on the membrane and dense bodies in the cytoplasm, which provides a structural base for intercellular and intracellular force transmission in smooth muscle. There is evidence to suggest that the vimentin framework plays an important role in mediating smooth muscle mechanical properties such as tension and contractile responses. Contractile activation induces vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 and vimentin network reorientation, facilitating contractile force transmission among and within smooth muscle cells. p21-activated kinase 1 and polo-like kinase 1 catalyze vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56, whereas type 1 protein phosphatase dephosphorylates vimentin at this residue. Vimentin filaments are also involved in other cell functions including migration and nuclear positioning. This review recapitulates our current knowledge how the vimentin network modulates mechanical and biological properties of smooth muscle.

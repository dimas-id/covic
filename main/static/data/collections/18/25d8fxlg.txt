Sorting algorithms are an important part of most standard libraries, and both, their correctness and efficiency is crucial for many applications. As generic sorting algorithm, the GNU C++ Standard Library implements the introsort algorithm, a combination of quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort. The Boost C++ Libraries implement pdqsort, an extension of introsort that achieves linear runtime on inputs with certain patterns. We verify introsort and pdqsort in the Isabelle LLVM verification framework, closely following the state-of-the-art implementations from GNU and Boost. On an extensive benchmark set, our verified implementations perform on par with the originals.

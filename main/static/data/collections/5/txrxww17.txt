I wrote this as a narrative piece for school, but it is a very honest description of how I'm feeling at this time. I just wanted to reassure people that I am ok. For anyone else who is feeling the same as I am, it's ok. I think it is good for us to be honest about how we are feeling, and it is perfectly reasonable for us to feel confusion during this time. I also think it is good for us to not let any anxiety overwhelm us. So let it out. Talk to someone. Write it down. And breathe. For me, watching the sunrise this morning was a good way to focus on something other than the chaos, other than my feelings.

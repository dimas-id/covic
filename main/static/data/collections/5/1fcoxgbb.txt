BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery has been developed in attempt to further reduce the morbidity and scarring associated with surgical intervention. OBJECTIVE To describe the technique and report the surgical outcomes of LESS radical nephrectomy (RN) in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS LESS-RN was performed in 33 patients with renal tumours. The indications to perform a LESS-RN were represented by renal tumours not greater than T2 and without evidence of lymphadenopathy or renal vein involvement. SURGICAL PROCEDURE The Endocone (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was inserted through a transumbilical incision. A combination of standard laparoscopic instruments and bent grasper and scissors was used. The sequence of steps of LESS-RN was comparable to standard laparoscopic RN. MEASUREMENTS Demographic data and perioperative and postoperative variables were recorded and analysed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The mean operative time was 143.7±24.3 min, with a mean estimated blood loss of 122.3±34.1 ml and a mean hospital stay of 3.8±0.8 d. The mean length of skin incision was 4.1±0.6 cm and all patients were discharged from hospital with minimal discomfort, as demonstrated by their pain assessment scores (visual analogue scale: 1.9±0.8). The definitive pathologic results revealed a renal cell carcinoma in all cases and a stage distribution of four T1a, 27 T1b, and 2 T2 tumours. All patients were very satisfied with the appearance of the scars, and at a median follow-up period of 13.2±3.9 mo, all patients were alive without evidence of tumour recurrence or port-site metastasis. CONCLUSIONS LESS is a safe and feasible surgical procedure for RN in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and has excellent cosmetic results.

In these times of insufficient resources for all there can be no shared decision-making, that is, a shared plan of care. Without attempting to subtly induce the patient to believe that it is the best decision for him. In the case of CoViD-19, we must rely on professionals: it is not the time for the anticipated treatment plan, for self-determination. Of course, we can always say "no"; but we hope that as soon as possible we will be able to take back all the freedoms that has just been conquered: that of end-of-life choices, after a process of sharing with the carers. But in this difficult moment someone can also feel a relief - that of the old paternalistic choices - that someone else decides for us.

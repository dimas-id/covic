AIM The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel hernia repair glue fixation device (LiquibandFix8™) in laparoscopic IPOM repair for incisional hernias. METHODS All ventral incisional hernia patients requiring laparoscopic IPOM repair were included in the study. A retrospective review of the data was performed. RESULTS 137 patients underwent 138 laparoscopic IPOM repairs for incisional hernias using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (LiquibandFix8™) for mesh fixation over a 40-month period by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon. There were 70 males and 67 females, median age 54 years (range 23-80 years). Defects were predominantly midline n = 123/138 (89%) and were closed by transfascial sutures in 126/138 (91%) prior to IPOM repair (IPOM plus). Mesh fixation was successful in all 138 repairs. Synthetic meshes (Symbotex™ [polyester/collagen composite, Medtronic] n = 80, and Dynamesh® [polypropylene/PVDF composite, FEG Textiltechnik mbH] n = 5) and biologic meshes (Surgimend® [bovine collagen dermal matrix, Integra] n = 53) were used. Median follow-up was 32 months (range 12-48 months). There were 16 adverse events in 12 patients (9%): conversion to open surgery (inadvertent enterotomy) 2 (1.5%), bladder perforation 1, intraperitoneal bleeding 2, port-site haematoma 2, port site wound infection 1, post-op ileus 2, chest infection 1, seroma 1 (1%), hernia recurrence 3 (2%) and chronic pain 2 (1.5%). CONCLUSION This retrospective study shows that mesh fixation in laparoscopic IPOM using cyanoacrylate glue with the Liquiband Fix8™ device is feasible, safe, easy to learn, and is associated with a low risk of seroma, hernia recurrence and chronic pain with short-medium term follow-up.

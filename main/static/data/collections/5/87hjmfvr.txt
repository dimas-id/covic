We describe here the successful scheduled treatment of varicose veins by radiofrequency segmental thermal ablation in a 43-year-old patient with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Her venous disease started at the age of 16 years, 1 year prior to her first major Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-related event which led to the diagnosis of her genetic condition. Surgical stripping was contra-indicated because of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at the age of 18 years. More than 20 years later, her venous disease had become highly symptomatic despite daily compression and pain medication. Venous reassessment evidenced incompetent right and left great saphenous and left small saphenous veins, with increased diameters of both sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions. Radiofrequency endovenous ablation rather than surgery was considered because of its minimally invasive nature and because of standardized energy delivery.All intended-to-be-treated incompetent saphenous vein segments were occluded successfully, followed by an important improvement of clinical disease severity at day 30, persistent at 1 year post-treatment. Duplex ultrasound confirmed closure and fibrotic retraction of all treated venous segments at 1 year. This report shows that radiofrequency endovenous ablation may be a safe and effective therapy of varicose veins in patients with diagnosed vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Mechanical thrombectomy has been proposed to expand the treatment time window and enhance revascularization. However, it is unclear whether its use can be extended to patients with occlusions in acute aortic dissection, especially the thoracic aorta. A 55-year-old man underwent graft replacement for acute aortic dissection type A. On postoperative day 2, he developed stroke and computed tomography showed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed by transbrachial approach. Although successful recanalization was achieved, he suffered hemorrhagic stroke. Since there is no other effective treatment and the neurologic outcome with conservative management is poor, we consider mechanical thrombectomy to be a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of postoperative stroke in patients with acute aortic dissection type A. However, further study is warranted regarding the safety of this technique.

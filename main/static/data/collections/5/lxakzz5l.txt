OBJECTIVES We performed this study to investigate the association of prehospital supraglottic airway (SGA) on neurologic outcome in cardiac arrest victims with adjustment of postresuscitation variables as well as prehospital and resuscitation variables. METHODS This study was a retrospective study based on a multicenter prospective cohort registry from December 2013 to April 2016. According to the 28-day cerebral performance categories (CPCs) scale, patients were divided into the good-outcome group (CPC 1-2) and the poor-outcome group (CPC 3-5). We compared the two groups with respect to demographic variables, prehospital and in-hospital resuscitation variables, and postresuscitation variables. RESULTS A total of 869 cardiac arrest victims who received in-progress cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were delivered to the emergency department of three hospitals, and 310 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. The use of a prehospital SGA was independently associated with 28-day good neurologic outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 7.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-46.53; p = 0.023] when postresuscitation variables were adjusted, although there were no significant association with the acquisition of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (OR = 0.992; 95% CI = 0.591-1.666; p = 0.976). Furthermore, a prehospital SGA was significantly associated with good neurologic outcome, especially in patients who received prolonged CPR (low flow time > 15 minutes; OR = 3.41; 95% CI = 1.23-9.45; p = 0.018) rather than in patients with nonprolonged CPR (OR = 4.50; 95% CI = 0.75-27.13; p = 0.101). CONCLUSIONS When postresuscitation variables were adjusted, the prehospital SGA was independently associated with 28-day good neurologic outcome in cardiac arrest victims.

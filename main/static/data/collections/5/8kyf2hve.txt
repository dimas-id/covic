Different strategies are being worked out for engineering the original baculovirus expression vector (BEV) system to produce cost-effective clinical biologics at commercial scale. To date, thousands of highly variable molecules in the form of heterologous proteins, virus-like particles, surface display proteins/antigen carriers, heterologous viral vectors and gene delivery vehicles have been produced using this system. These products are being used in vaccine production, tissue engineering, stem cell transduction, viral vector production, gene therapy, cancer treatment and development of biosensors. Recombinant proteins that are expressed and post-translationally modified using this system are also suitable for functional, crystallographic studies, microarray and drug discovery-based applications. Till now, four BEV-based commercial products (Cervarix(®), Provenge(®), Glybera(®) and Flublok(®)) have been approved for humans, and myriad of others are in different stages of preclinical or clinical trials. Five products (Porcilis(®) Pesti, BAYOVAC CSF E2(®), Circumvent(®) PCV, Ingelvac CircoFLEX(®) and Porcilis(®) PCV) got approval for veterinary use, and many more are in the pipeline. In the present chapter, we have emphasized on both approved and other baculovirus-based products produced in insect cells or larvae that are important from clinical perspective and are being developed as preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic agents. Further, the potential of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) as gene delivery vector has been described. This system, due to its relatively extended gene expression, lack of pathogenicity and the ability to transduce a wide variety of cells, gained extensive popularity just after the approval of first AAV-based gene therapy drug alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera(®)). Numerous products based on AAV which are presently in different clinical trials have also been highlighted.

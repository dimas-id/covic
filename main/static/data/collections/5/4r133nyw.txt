The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of selenium (Se) deficiency on the expression of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction pathway in the spleen of chickens and explore the relationship between the TLR4/TRIF/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway and inflammatory spleen injury. A total of 200 one-day-old healthy broilers were allocated to two groups. The experimental group was fed a self-made low-Se diet (0.004 mg/kg) while the control group was fed a complete formula feed (0.2 mg/kg) for 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 days, respectively. We observed histopathological changes in the chicken spleens. The messenger RNA(mRNA) expression levels of 8 kinds of ChTLRs, myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), toll-interleukine-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-ß (TRIF), nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B), and cytokine (IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IL-2, and IFN-Î³) were detected via quantitative real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression level of TLR4. Then principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the correlation between the ChTLRs, MyD88, TRIF, and NF-&#954;B. The results showed that the boundary between red pulp and white pulp was unclear, the number of lymphocytes decreased, and the nucleus was fragmented and dissolved in the experimental group at 25-55 days. At 15-45 days, the relative expression of TLR4 mRNA was higher than in the control group, and the difference was extremely significant on day 15 (P < 0.01).The relative expression of TRIF mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 25-55 days, and the relative expression of NF-&#954;B mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The relative expression of IL-6 mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The protein expression level of TLR4 in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The PCA results showed that there was a strong correlation between TLR4, TRIF, and component 1. The results suggest that TLR4 plays an important role in regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spleens of Se-deficient chickens, and Se deficiency may cause inflammatory injury through the TLR4/TRIF/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway in chicken spleen.

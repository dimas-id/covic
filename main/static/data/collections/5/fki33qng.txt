LSm1-7 complexes promote cellular mRNA degradation, in addition to translation and replication of positive-strand RNA viruses such as the Brome mosaic virus (BMV). Yet, how LSm1-7 complexes act on their targets remains elusive. Here, we report that reconstituted recombinant LSm1-7 complexes directly bind to two distinct RNA-target sequences in the BMV genome, a tRNA-like structure at the 3'-untranslated region and two internal A-rich single-stranded regions. Importantly, in vivo analysis shows that these sequences regulate the translation and replication of the BMV genome. Furthermore, both RNA-target sequences resemble those found for Hfq, the LSm counterpart in bacteria, suggesting conservation through evolution. Our results provide the first evidence that LSm1-7 complexes interact directly with viral RNA genomes and open new perspectives in the understanding of LSm1-7 functions.

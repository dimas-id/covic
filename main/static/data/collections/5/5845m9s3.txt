In Mexico, there is a lack of up-to-date published data that show viruses to be the main cause of acute respiratory infection (ARI). The objective of this study was to estimate the comparative viral frequency between children under the age of 5 years with and without ARI (n = 179 in each group) in a suburban community (Nezahualc√≥yotl City). A nasopharyngeal sample was collected for viral culture and identification was carried out by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using mAbs. There were no sex differences between the two groups. Children under 1 year of age with ARI showed a higher frequency (56 %) of viral infections; this was statistically significant (P < 0.05) when compared with the same age group in ARI-free children (17 %). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most prevalent type of virus isolated from both groups (38 vs 18 %). A statistically significantly higher number of subjects with ARI (33/179) than without (12/179) were infected with RSV (P < 0.003). Prevalences of four other viruses studied were similar in the two groups. The highest viral incidence of ARI in children was detected in the winter-spring seasonal period.

The pandemic infection caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has determined a severe imbalance between demand and actual supply of intensive care. The shortage of intensive care units (ICU) beds and ventilators for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory failure produced angst in the clinicians/intensivists who have to decide which patients admit to ICU and in which patients to implement palliative care. They have to apply specific clinical and ethical criteria, in emergency conditions. Proportionality and appropriateness criteria should be integrated with equity, equality, utility criteria, widening the distributive justice concept from the right of the patient to receive all available therapies to a right resources allocation during shortage, guided by public health ethic. The clinical criteria should include the disease severity, the number and severity of comorbidities, frailty, the organ failures and their stage, the patient's age, the functional autonomy and cognitive status. Consequently the first come-first served rule to ICU admission should not be applied. The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life. Finally particular attention should be paid to the bereavement management of the family/caregivers and in the right approach of psychological problems and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of health workers involved in the pandemia.

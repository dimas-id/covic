PURPOSE The aim of this retrospective study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the laparoscopic technique for treatment of massive incisional hernias (MIHs) and to compare three different fixation devices. METHODS From January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2014, we collected retrospective data from patients with large incisional hernias (IHs). Laparoscopic IH repair is performed by applying a three-dimensional polyester knit structure mesh with a resorbable collagen barrier on peritoneal side (Parietex™ Composite Mesh; Covidien, New Haven, CT). Patients were divided into three groups according to the different fixation devices. The mean follow-up was 19 (12-156) months. RESULTS The mean defect size was 12.83 cm (10-26 cm) and the mean body mass index was 30.8 kg/m2 (26-39 kg/m2). The EMS stapler™ was used on 260 patients, the Protack® on 210 patients, and the AbsorbaTack™ on 30 patients. The mean operative time was 69.9 minutes (38-130 minutes). Intraoperative morbidity rate was 1.6% (8 cases). Early reoperation rate was 0.2% (1 case). The mean length of hospital stay was 2.3 days (range 2-7 days). Seromas were observed in 20 patients (4.0%) and neuralgia in 10 patients (2.0%). Recurrence was observed in 12 patients (2.4%) with the majority in the absorbable tack group (10%). There were no conversions (0%) to open technique. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach seems to be safe and appropriate for treatment of MIH. The Parietex composite mesh we used guarantees excellent intraabdominal laparoscopic repair of abdominal wall defects. Absorbatack system seems to give less postoperative neuralgia, but it is related to a high recurrence rate. Protack system seems to give more postoperative neuralgia than the Endopath EMS. In our experience, the best fixation system is the latter.

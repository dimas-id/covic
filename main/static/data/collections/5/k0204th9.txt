This chapter presents remarks on viruses, phanerogram, cryptogram, and gymnogram. It discusses various characteristics of the families of viruses. Viruses are defined by the sum of the distinctive traits of the virion. These distinctive traits are as follows: (1) presence of a single nucleic acid; (2) incapacity to grow and to divide; (3) reproduction from the genetic material only; (4) absence of enzymes for energy metabolism; (5) absence of ribosomes; (6) absence of information for the production of enzymes in the energy cycle; (7) absence of information for the synthesis of the ribosomal proteins; and (8) absence of information for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. The viral infectious particle presents a great diversity in composition and structure. Order could be achieved only through a classification, which is a system of order. The goal of biological classification is to group together organisms presenting certain analogies and certain affinities and, if possible, to also bring out phylogenic relationships. The conceptions relative to the methodology of taxonomy, which is the science of classification, are diverse. A virus may have evolved from a given sector of DNA within the host cell. It could also very well have derived from the corresponding RNA messenger that contains the same information, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, theoretically, different viruses could have originated from nucleic acids of different but complementary nature. The nucleic acid of viruses is either single- or double-stranded. Viruses, as is generally accepted, derive from the nucleic acid of their host. Thus, RNA viruses could possibly have their origin in the RNA messenger.

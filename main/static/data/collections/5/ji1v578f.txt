Unexplained abdominal pain is an increasing phenomenon after laparoscopic bariatric surgery, with an occurrence of 7.4%. The pain could be explained by the anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES). However, the incidence of ACNES after laparoscopic bariatric surgery is unclear. We report the cases of two patients with unexplained abdominal pain after laparoscopic bariatric surgery and a significant delay in the diagnosis of ACNES. In both cases, clinical signs of ACNES were demonstrated by a centralized trigger point in the abdominal wall and specific neuropathic aspects during examination. Both patients were temporary pain-free after a diagnostic local lidocaine injection. A neurectomy was performed in both cases, after which they remained pain-free. There was a significant delay (six months and three years, respectively) in the diagnosis of ACNES, and many additional imaging procedures including a diagnostic laparoscopy were performed. ACNES is difficult to diagnose due to its relatively unknown entity. This case report confirms that the diagnosis of ACNES is still frequently overlooked as a cause of chronic abdominal pain. Earlier diagnosis recognition can probably prevent unnecessary investigations and may improve the quality of life in bariatric patients with unexplained abdominal pain.

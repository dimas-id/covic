Novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) may be associated with thrombocytopenia which might have different mechanisms in different patients and in different phases of the disease. Cytokine release, thrombotic consumption or autoimmune destruction are some leading etiologies of thrombocytopenia in COVID‐19. This case report presents a 41‐year‐old male COVID‐19 patient who had petechiae and purpura as the referral symptoms. Laboratory tests revealed isolated thrombocytopenia with no other additional pathologic findings. Most probable diagnosis was COVID‐19 induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment generated a good response. There were four other recent publications with a total of eight cases in the literature. The presented case was discussed in comparison with those similar cases.

We evaluated the association between the timing of tracheostomy and clinical outcomes in patients with infratentorial lesions. We performed a retrospective observational cohort study in a neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary academic medical center from January 2014 to December 2018. Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU who underwent resection of infratentorial lesions as well as tracheostomy were included for analysis. Early tracheostomy was defined as performed on postoperative days 1–10 and late tracheostomy on days 10–20 after operation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the characteristics and outcomes between both cohorts. A total of 143 patients were identified, and 96 patients received early tracheostomy. Multivariable analysis identified early tracheostomy as an independent variable associated with lower occurrence of pneumonia (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09–0.73; p = 0.011), shorter stays in ICUs (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3–0.6; p = 0.03), and earlier decannulation (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4–0.8; p = 0.003). However, no significant differences were observed between the early and late tracheostomy groups regarding hospital mortality (p > 0.999) and the modified Rankin scale after 6 months (p = 0.543). We also identified postoperative brainstem deficits, including cough, swallowing attempts, and extended tongue as well as GCS < 8 at ICU admission as the risk factors independently associated with patients underwent tracheostomy. There is a significant association between early tracheostomy and beneficial clinical outcomes or reduced adverse event occurrence in patients with infratentorial lesions.

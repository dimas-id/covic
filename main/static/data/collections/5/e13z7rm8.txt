Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease affecting the central nervous system, thought to be an autoimmune disease mediated by autoreactive lymphocytes. The pathogenesis of MS is multifactorial and is thought to be triggered by multiple environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Viruses have long been postulated as potential environmental triggers in MS, and there is increasing evidence of a link between viruses and MS. Some of the most compelling data have been found in human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) research. HHV-6 is a ubiquitous, neurotropic herpesvirus; HHV-6 DNA has been found in MS plaques compared to healthy brain tissue. Studies have also shown that MS patients have higher viral titers and higher DNA detection in serum and CSF compared to controls, and that the virus seems to be more actively replicating in MS patients. Potential mechanisms for HHV-6 leading to autoimmunity include molecular mimicry, bystander activation, and epitope spreading, among others.

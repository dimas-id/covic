The outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into an unprecedented global pandemic. Clinical investigations in patients with COVID-19 has shown a strong upregulation of cytokine and interferon production in SARS-CoV2- induced pneumonia, with an associated cytokine storm syndrome. Thus, the identification of existing approved therapies with proven safety profiles to treat hyperinflammation is a critical unmet need in order to reduce COVI-19 associated mortality. To date, no specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines are available to treat COVID-19 patients. This review evaluates several options that have been proposed to control SARS-CoV2 hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, eincluding antiviral drugs, vaccines, small-molecules, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotides, peptides, and interferons (IFNs).

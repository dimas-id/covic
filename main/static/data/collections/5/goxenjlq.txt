BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is no specific cure for this disease, and the clinical management mainly depends on supportive treatment. Traditional Chinese medicines (CHM) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. METHODS A comprehensive literature search will be conducted. Two methodological trained researchers will read the title, abstract, and full texts and independently select the qualified literature according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After assessment of the risk of bias and data extraction, we will conduct meta-analyses for outcomes related to COVID-19. The heterogeneity of data will be investigated by Cochrane Ï‡ and I tests. Then publication bias assessment will be conducted by funnel plot analysis and Egger test. RESULTS The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION Our study aims to systematically present the clinical evidence of CHM in the treatment of COVID-19, which will be of guiding significance for further research and clinical practice.

In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the city of Wuhan, China causing severe morbidity and mortality. Since then, the virus has swept across the globe causing millions of confirmed infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. To better understand the nature of the pandemic and the introduction and spread of the virus in Arizona, we sequenced viral genomes from clinical samples tested at the TGen North Clinical Laboratory, provided to us by the Arizona Department of Health Services, and at Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, collected as part of community surveillance projects. Phylogenetic analysis of 79 genomes we generated from across Arizona revealed a minimum of 9 distinct introductions throughout February and March. We show that >80% of our sequences descend from clades that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the outbreak in the United States. In addition, we show that the first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak that was discovered in late February. Notably, none of the observed transmission clusters are epidemiologically linked to the original travel-related cases in the state, suggesting successful early isolation and quarantine. Finally, we use molecular clock analyses to demonstrate a lack of identifiable, widespread cryptic transmission in Arizona prior to the middle of February 2020.

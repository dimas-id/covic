Systemic causes of cholestasis constitute a diverse group of diseases across organ systems. The pathophysiology of cholestasis in systemic disease can be a consequence of direct involvement of a disease process within the liver or extrahepatic biliary system or secondary to immune-mediated changes in bile flow. Evaluating a patient with cholestasis for a systemic cause requires an understanding of the patient's risk factors, clinical setting (eg, hospitalized or immunosuppressed patient), clinical features, and pattern of laboratory abnormalities.

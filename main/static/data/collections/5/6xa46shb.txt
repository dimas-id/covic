Numerous outbreaks of shellfish-borne enteric virus illness have been reported worldwide. Most notable among the outbreaks are those caused by NoV and HAV. Lessons learned from outbreak investigations indicate that most outbreaks are preventable. Anthropogenic sources of contamination will continue to invade shellfish growing waters. Shellfish, by their very nature, will continue to bioconcentrate these contaminants, including enteric viruses. There is no quick fix for enteric virus contamination of shellfish; however, vigilance on behalf of the industry, regulatory agencies, and the consumer could substantially reduce the incidence of illness. Enhanced monitoring in all areas of shellfish production, harvesting, distribution, and processing would help to reduce viral illnesses. Pollution abatement and improved hygienic practices on behalf of the industry and consumers are needed. Improved analytical techniques for the detection of enteric viruses in shellfish will lead to enhanced shellfish safety and better protection for the consumer and the industry. Better reporting and epidemiological follow-up of outbreaks are keys to reducing the transmission of foodborne viral infections. It is anticipated that recent advances in analytical techniques, particularly for NoV, will lead to better monitoring capabilities for food and water and a reduction in the incidence of enteric virus illness among shellfish consumers.

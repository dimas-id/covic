A previously unknown coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been shown to cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey has been declared in March 11th, 2020 and from there on, more than 150,000 people in the country have been diagnosed with the disease. In this study, 62 viral sequences from Turkey, which have been uploaded to GISAID database, were analyzed by means of their nucleotide substitutions in comparison to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome from Wuhan. Our results indicate that the viral isolates from Turkey harbor some common mutations with the viral strains from Europe, Oceania, North America and Asia. When the mutations were evaluated, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G were found to be the most common nucleotide substitutions among the viral isolates in Turkey, which are mostly seen as linked mutations and are part of a haplotype observed high in Europe.

OBJECTIVE To describe a single-port laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomy (LOHE) with a modified glove-port technique in dogs and compare it with previously published laparoscopic techniques for LOHE in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical study and technique description. ANIMALS Forty-two healthy female dogs. METHODS Laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomy was performed with a custom-made single-port device. The total duration of surgery from first incision to skin closure was compared with previously published durations of LOHE in dogs. Short-term complications were recorded. RESULTS The median total duration of surgery was 24 minutes (range, 17.5-39.5; mean, 25.73; SD, 6.12), which was shorter than that described in most previously reported studies of LOHE in dogs (range, 20.8 ± 4.00-60.0 ± 18.45 minutes; P < .001). Intraoperative complications were minor, but wound complications occurred in 12 of 42 (29%) dogs. CONCLUSION Single-port LOHE with the glove-port technique in combination with a wound retractor and nonarticulated instruments was completed in all dogs. This technique was faster than what has been previously reported for other LOHE, but local wound complications were common. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The glove-port technique described here offers a low-cost alternative to other commercially available single-port devices.

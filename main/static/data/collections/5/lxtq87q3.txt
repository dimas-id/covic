Abstract Respiratory viral infections including human rhinovirus (RV) infection have been identified as the most important environmental trigger of exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. While well established as the most common viral infections associated with exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, RVs and other respiratory viruses are also now thought to be important in triggering exacerbations of cystic fibrosis and the interstitial lung diseases. Here, we summarize the epidemiological evidence the supports respiratory viruses including RV as triggers of exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. We propose that certain characteristics of RVs may explain why they are the most common trigger of exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. We further highlight the latest mechanistic evidence supporting how and why common respiratory viral infections may enhance and promote disease triggering exacerbation events, through their interactions with the host immune system, and may be affected by ongoing treatments. We also provide a commentary on how new treatments may better manage the disease burden associated with respiratory viral infections and the exacerbation events that they trigger.

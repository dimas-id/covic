A 32-year-old medical practitioner presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, 1 week after the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient did not report any comorbid conditions, alcohol usage, or gallstone disease. Laboratory and radiological investigations revealed the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. He underwent conservative management and was discharged after 3 days of hospital admission. This case highlights a possible association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis, and the need for clinicians to carefully evaluate patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints during the current pandemic.

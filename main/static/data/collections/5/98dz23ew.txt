The efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in decoding antizyme mRNA is the sensor for an autoregulatory circuit that controls cellular polyamine levels in organisms ranging from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to Drosophila to mammals. Comparison of the frameshift sites and flanking stimulatory signals in many organisms now permits a reconstruction of the likely evolutionary path of the remarkably conserved mRNA sequences involved in the frameshifting.

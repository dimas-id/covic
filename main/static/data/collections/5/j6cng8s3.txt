Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most serious public health problem in China. Children with diabetes are also among the population susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Traffic problems caused by epidemic prevention and control increase the difficulty in the management of children with severe diabetes. In order to control the spread of epidemic, children with mild diabetes are advised to be managed at home and in the community. However, how to treat children with severe diabetes effectively and safely during the outbreak of COVID-19 brings great challenges to primary doctors. The Subspecialty Group of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association and the Subspecialty Group of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Doctor Association have developed the recommendations on the identification and transfer of children with critical diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak, which provide a reference for primary doctors to quickly assess the severity of patient's condition and treat the illness accordingly, thus reducing the risk of referral infection and improving clinical prognosis.

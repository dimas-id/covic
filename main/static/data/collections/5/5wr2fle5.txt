BACKGROUND There is limited research for xenograft biologic mesh performance in the setting of infection despite widespread use and significant associated costs. DESIGN The authors retrospectively reviewed an FDA database for reported xenograft adverse events (AEs). All meshes were used in the setting of abdominal wall reconstruction from 1997 to 2008. RESULTS The authors identified 150 AEs. Permacol and Collamend comprised 75% (n = 112) of reported cases. Main AEs included acute mechanical failure (42%; n = 63), mesh disintegration (32%; n = 48), and poor mesh integration (13%; n = 20); 80% of cases were described as infected, and nearly 90% of AEs required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Major complications are reported to the FDA for xenograft biologic meshes. Cross-linked meshes had the most AE reports to the FDA. The intrinsic properties of meshes and how they relate to infection-related outcomes are poorly understood. The findings from this FDA database review point toward a need to carefully evaluate these products.

We investigated the expression profiles of miRNAs in acute lung injury (ALI) rats after hypothermia treatment. ALI rats were induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and maintained with hypothermia (HT) or normothermia (NT) for 6 hours. HT attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung and improved biochemical indicators of multi-organ dysfunction. Nineteen miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the HT group compared with the NT group. miR-142, miR-98, miR-541, miR-503, miR-653, miR- 223, miR-323 and miR-196b exhibited opposite patterns of expression between the two groups. These dysregulated miRNAs were mainly involved in the immune and inflammatory response on functional annotation analyses. This study shows that HT has lung protective effects and influences expression profiles of miRNAs in ALI. And dysregulated miRNAs after HT modulate the immune and inflammation in ALI. These results suggest that dysregulated miRNAs play a role in the mechanism of the lung protective effects of HT in ALI.

The Berlin Conference of 1885 has influenced the way native Africans, and the African Diaspora live their daily lives. France contractually controls several resources generated by the continent of Africa. Herein lies a technical proposal to free Africa from the financial and economic agreements coerced upon the continent over a century ago by utilizing decentralized collaboration through advanced technology. AfricaOS (AOS) aims to provide a philosophical, and fundamental framework for implementing a simple, distributed, collaborative computer for agreement amongst peers. The work also demonstrates an algebra over transactions, use of the protocol for privatization, a method for tokenizing barter economies, and methods to design mechanisms for use in implementing protocol behavior.

Abstract Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention from researchers worldwide in recent years due to their high aspect ratio, high surface area, and excellent material properties, such as electrical and thermal conductivities and mechanical strength. These rolled-up seamless cylinders of graphene sheets possess nanosized hollow-tube-shaped structures. The CNTs can be single-walled, double-walled or multi-walled, depending upon the number of graphene layers from which a single nanotube is composed. The CNTs, favoring encapsulation of drug molecules or by possible attachment of theranostic agents on the nanotube walls, have enabled their use in controlled drug delivery, and in targeting of drug molecules to specific sites such as the lymphatic system, brain, ocular system, and cancerous tissue. This chapter provides an overview of various types of CNTs, methods utilized for their commercial production, and the functionalization approaches employed in drug-delivery applications. In addition, the chapter also endeavors to provide a thoughtful insight into the toxicity and regulatory concerns that need to be addressed before the CNTs can be launched in the market.

The purpose of this study was to detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) subclinically infected pigs shipped from non-case farms to slaughterhouses. Systematic sampling was conducted at two slaughterhouses. A total of 1,556 blood samples were collected from 80 case and non-case farms from pigs over 6 months old. Blood samples were centrifuged to obtain sera. Serial serum dilutions were subjected to serological examination for PEDV presence using Neutralization test (NT). The cut-off titer was set at titer of 1:2 dilution and farms with at least one positive sample in duplicate were classified as PED-positive farms. Several non-case farms (9.4%, 6/64) and 100% (16/16) of the case farms were indeed positive for PEDV. The proportion of seropositive animals from case farms was 63.7%, significantly different from that of non-case farms (4.3%, P<0.05). In both case and non-case farms, the proportion of seropositive animals in farrow-to-finish farms was significantly higher than in wean-to-finish farms (P<0.05). Seropositive animals in non-case farms were detected by NT in a sero-survey by sampling at slaughterhouses. Therefore, subclinically infected pigs should be considered prior to shipment.

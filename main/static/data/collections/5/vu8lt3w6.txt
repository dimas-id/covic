This chapter reviews the naturally occurring viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and parasitic diseases of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) with an emphasis on those diseases found in captive guinea pigs. For each organism, etiology, epizootiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, pathology, diagnosis, prevention, and therapy are discussed. Major viruses include adenoviruses, herpesviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, paramyxoviruses (including Sendai virus), and cavian leukemia virus. Common bacterial organisms are Clostridia sp., Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bordetella, Chlamydia, Klebsiella, Lawsonia intercellularis, Leptospira, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella, Streptobacillus moniliformis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Common fungal organisms include Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Major protozoal diseases are Amoebiasis, Balantidiasis, Cryptosporidiosis, Eimeria, Giardiasis, Klossiella cobayae, Leishmaniasis, Toxoplasmosis, and Tritrichomonas caviae. Common external parasites include lice (Gyropus ovalis, Gliricola porcelli and Trimenopon hispidum) and mites (Chirodiscoides caviae and Trixacarus caviae). Internal parasites are cestodes, Pelodera strongyloides, Baylisascaris, Paraspidodera uncinata, Trichinella, and Fasciola spp.

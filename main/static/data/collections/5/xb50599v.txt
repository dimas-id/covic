March 2020, it seemed as if my world was turned upside down. I opened an email from my medical school dean of student affairs stating: Match Day, cancelled. The day that would determine where we trained as postgraduate residents, the day my class had worked towards for 4 years, cancelled due to this new virus that we seemed to know so little about: COVID-19. However, as important as that day was to my fellow 4th year medical students and I, we quickly learned that the impact was much larger. What about our electives, our mandatory rotations, and even the Sub-Internship's students still had to complete? Not just that, but "what can we do to help," became a common statement echoed by all students. We don't want to see this as a detriment to our education but a learning experience. A learning experience for how to be best prepared to help now, and in the future. One way to help is to make changes in medical education to ensure all students are still getting the absolute best level of education possible. This starts with recognizing the options we have and utilizing all of the tools at our disposal, despite the boundaries created by COVID-19.

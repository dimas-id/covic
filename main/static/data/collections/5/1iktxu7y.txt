Several factors must be considered in deciding which mesh to use for a ventral hernia repair. Open hernia repairs with no exposure of mesh to viscera can be performed with unprotected synthetic mesh, preferably a "lightweight" option. For open repair with high risk for fascial dehiscence and visceral exposure to mesh, and for open underlay repair and laparoscopic underlay repair, recommendations call for a tissue-separating mesh that prevents ingrowth of intra-abdominal contents into the mesh. Although no long-term data are available about biologic (acellular collagen scaffold) meshes, these may have good results when used in contaminated or well-drained infected fields, and do best when used according to the principles of a high-quality synthetic mesh repair (wide mesh overlap, frequent fixation points). Evidence is still insufficient to support the use of biologic materials for primary hernia repair.

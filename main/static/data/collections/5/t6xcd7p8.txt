BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been gaining acceptance because it has shown good short- and mid-term results as a single procedure for morbid obesity. The aim of this study was to compare short- and mid-term results between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and LSG. METHODS Observational retrospective study from a prospective database of patients undergoing LRYGB and LSG between 2004 and 2011, where 249 patients (mean age 44.7 years) were included. Patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, and annually thereafter. Short- and mid-term weight loss, comorbidity improvement or resolution, postoperative complications, re-interventions, and mortality were evaluated. RESULTS One hundred thirty-five LRYGB and 114 LSG were included. Significant statistical differences between LRYGB and LSG were found in operative time (153 vs. 93 min. p < 0.001), minor postoperative complications (21.5 % vs. 4.4 %, p = 0.005), blood transfusions (8.8 % vs. 1.7 %, p = 0.015), and length of hospital stay (4 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001). There were no differences regarding major complications and re-interventions. There was no surgery-related mortality. The percentage of excess weight loss up to 4 years was similar in both groups (66 ± 13.7 vs. 65 ± 14.9 %). Both techniques showed similar results in comorbidities improvement or resolution at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS There is a similar short- and mid-term weight loss and 1-year comorbidity improvement or resolution between LRYGB and LSG, although minor complication rate is higher for LRYGB. Results of LSG as a single procedure need to be confirmed after a long-term follow-up.

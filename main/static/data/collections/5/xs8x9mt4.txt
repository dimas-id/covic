Abstract This review presents the early history, the motivation, the research and some of the backstories behind the discovery and development of sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin as a novel parenterally safe solubilizer and stabilizer. A specific sulfobutylether- β -cyclodextrin with an average degree of 6.5 sulfobutyl-groups variably substituted on the 2-, 3- and 6-hydroxyls of the seven glucopyranose (dextrose) units of β -cyclodextrin, is known by its commercial name, Captisol®. Today it is in 13 FDA approved injectables and numerous clinical candidates. It is also an example of a novel product discovered and initially preclinically developed at an academic institution.

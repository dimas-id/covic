The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a worldwide sanitary emergency. The viral biology is only partially known, although it has some aspects in common with other coronaviruses, and the damage observed in the most severe cases is due to intense inflammation. Immunotherapy restores immunological activity against cancer cells and has become a standard treatment for several cancers. We carried out an examination of available data on the effects exerted by both SARS-CoV-2 and the most widespread immunotherapy treatments on the immune system in order to hypothesize mechanisms underlying potential and mutual interaction. We analyzed laboratory, clinical and therapeutic data related to SARS coronaviruses. We finally focused on the implications of immunotherapy treatments in clinical practice.

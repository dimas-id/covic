Silver nanoparticles (SN) of particle size of less than 50nm were redispersed in aqueous solution of Pluronic F127 and complexed with the phytoceutical, glyzyrrhizic acid (GLY). Radioprotecting ability of the obtained nanoparticle-glyzyrrhizic acid complex (SN-GLY) was evaluated in an in vivo model using Swiss albino mice. Oral administration of SN-GLY, SN and GLY one hour prior to radiation exposure reduced the radiation induced damage in peripheral blood leucocytes, bone marrow cells and spleen cells of mice as revealed by comet assay. Exposure of mice to whole body gamma irradiation resulted in formation of micronuclei in blood reticulocytes and chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells while SN-GLY, SN or GLY administration resulted in reduction in micronucleus formation and chromosomal aberrations indicating radioprotection. In SN-GLY treated mice the cellular DNA was found protected to a greater extent compared to GLY or SN treated mice. The studies, under in vivo radiation exposure conditions, showed effective radiation protection.

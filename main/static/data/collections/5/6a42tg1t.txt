This study aims to learn the characteristics of morbidity and mortality of notifiable diseases reported in children aged 0–14 years in Zhejiang Province in 2008–2017. We collated data from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention in Zhejiang province between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2017 of children aged 0–14 years. From 2008 to 2017, a total of 32 types and 1,994,740 cases of notifiable diseases were reported in children aged 0–14 years, including 266 deaths in Zhejiang Province. The annual average morbidity was 2502.87/100,000, and the annual average mortality was 0.33/100,000. Male morbidity was 2886.98/100,000, and female morbidity was 2072.16/100,000, with the male morbidity rate higher than the female morbidity rate (χ(2) = 54,033.12, p < 0.01). No Class A infectious diseases were reported. The morbidity of Class B infectious diseases showed a downward trend, but that of Class C infectious diseases showed an upward trend. There were 72,041 cases in 22 kinds of Class B infectious disease and 138 death cases, with a morbidity rate of 90.39/100,000, and a mortality rate of 0.17/100,000. There were 1,922,699 cases in 10 kinds of Class C infectious disease and 128 death cases, with a morbidity rate of 2412.47/100,000, and a mortality rate of 0.16/100,000. The main high-prevalence diseases included hand-foot-and-mouth disease (1430.38/100,000), other infectious diarrheal diseases (721.40/100,000), mumps (168.83/100,000), and influenza (47.40/100,000). We should focus on the prevention and control of hand-foot and mouth disease, other infectious diarrheal diseases, mumps and influenza in children aged 0–14 years in Zhejiang Province. It is recommended to strengthen epidemic surveillance and undertake early prevention and control measures in order to reduce the younger children incidence rate of infectious diseases. Immunization planning vaccines can help achieve a significant preventive decline of infectious diseases.

CONTEXT Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with (111)In-pentetreotide (SRS) is used to detect duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (dpNETs) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). However, SRS has limited sensitivity for this purpose. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC has a higher rate of sporadic dpNETs detection than SRS but there is little data for dpNETs detection in MEN1. PURPOSE To compare the performances of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT, SRS and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) to diagnose dpNETs in MEN1. DESIGN AND SETTING Single-institution prospective comparative study PATIENTS AND METHODS Nineteen consecutive MEN1 patients (aged 47 ± 13 years) underwent (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT, SRS, and CE-CT within 2 months in random order. Blinded readings of images were performed separately by experienced physicians. Unblinded analysis of CE-CT, combined with additional magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic-ultrasound, (18)F-2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT or histopathology results served as reference standard for dpNETs diagnosis. RESULTS The sensitivity of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT, SRS, and CE-CT was 76, 20, and 60 %, respectively (p < 0.0001). All the true-positive lesions detected by SRS were also depicted on (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT. (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT detected lesions of smaller size than SRS (10.7 ± 7.6 and 15.2 ± 5.9 mm, respectively, p < 0.03). False negatives of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT included small dpNETs (<10 mm) and (18)F-FDG PET/CT positive aggressive dpNETs. No false positives were recorded. In addition, whole-body mapping with (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT identified extra-abdominal MEN1-related tumors including one neuroendocrine thymic carcinoma identified by the three imaging procedures, one bronchial carcinoid undetected by CE-CT and three meningiomas undetected by SRS. CONCLUSIONS Owing to higher diagnostic performance, (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT (or alternative (68)Ga-labeled somatostatin analogues) should replace (111)In-pentetreotide in the investigation of MEN1 patients.

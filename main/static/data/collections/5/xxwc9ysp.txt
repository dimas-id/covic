The ichthyoplanktonic community of Tamiahua Lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico, was studied throughout an annual cycle. Major concentrations of larvae occurred in the central portion of the lagoon, occasionally along the channels, but never at the inlets. The cycle of larva abundance was correlated with cycles of salinity and temperature. In spite of the greater number of species then, the spring and summer periods had low species diversity and evenness, due to the marked domination by larvae of Anchoa mitchilli. The number of larval fish species and individuals entering the lagoon from the adjacent offshore waters was minimal. The greatest portion of species diversity is generated within the lagoon itself. The community structure identified corresponds to the physically controlled type, as indicated by the poor diversity values obtained.

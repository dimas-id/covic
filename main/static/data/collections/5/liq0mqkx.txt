Some species of fish have been used as bioindicators of aquatic environmental pollution all over the world. Pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) was selected for the current study due to its sensitivity to pollutants and because is one of the emblematic fish species that inhabits shallow lakes of the Pampa region (Argentina). Recently, in Chascom√∫s lake were recorded concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu and Zn with values above the Argentine National Guidelines for the Protection of the Aquatic life. Regarding this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of environmental concentrations of these metals on the sperm quality, fertilization and hatching rates, and embryo and larval survival of pejerrey. Also, the same endpoints were analyzed with concentrations ten times higher to simulate a polluted worst-case scenario. The results showed that the presence of some metals in aquatic environments reduced pejerrey sperm motility (in ~50%) and velocity (in ~30%). These results were obtained using a computer assisted sperm analyzer enforcing the application of this analysis as a tool or bioindicator of aquatic pollution. In addition, fertilization rate was diminished (in ~40%) for all treatments. Besides, the hatching rate, and embryo and larval survival were drastically affected being zero for the highest metal concentrations assessed. All together these results, showed that even lower metal concentrations can negatively affect different reproductive parameters of one of the most emblematic fish species of the Argentinean water bodies.

Several cytokines and chemokines including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) are induced in HIV-1 infection. However, the impact of HIV-1 viremia on CCL2 regulation is largely unknown. We utilized a DNA oligonucleotide microarray covering 110 inflammatory genes. Five genes were induced by at least 2-fold in PBMCs of HIV-1 viremic (>100.000 RNA copies ml(−1)) as compared with aviremic (<50 RNA copies ml(−1)) individuals. These genes were CCL2, CXC chemokine ligand-10, IFN-γ, GTP-cyclohydrolase-1 and C-C chemokine receptor-1. In addition to microarray data verification by real-time PCR, analysis of independent patient samples revealed a similar expression pattern. CCL2 was the most strongly regulated gene at mRNA level and its serum concentration was significantly elevated in viremic compared with aviremic and HIV-1 seronegative controls, indicating a positive correlation between viremia and CCL2. Flow cytometric studies demonstrated a higher percentage of CCL2-expressing CD14+ monocytes in viremic compared with aviremic individuals. These results suggest a highly restricted modulation of host inflammatory gene response by HIV. Genes up-regulated in the viremic state, in particular CCL2, presumably serve as potential enhancing factors in HIV-1 replication, represented by high viral load in HIV-1 viremic patients. Inhibition of increased CCL2 production could provide a new therapeutic intervention in HIV-1 infection.

BACKGROUND Obesity is an independent risk factor for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is often associated with the presence of a hiatal hernia (HH). Despite increasing popularity of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in bariatric surgery, its effect on GERD is still unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of LSG with or without hiatal hernia repair (HHR) on GERD in obese patients. METHODS Seventy-eight patients with HH underwent LSG with concomitant HHR (LSG+HHR group). Their data were compared with that of 102 patients without HH, who underwent only LSG (LSG-group). All patients underwent a standardized questionnaire, a double-contrast barium swallow, and an upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy before the surgical procedure and at least 6 months later. RESULTS At baseline, the prevalence of GERD symptoms and their frequency-intensity scores did not differ between groups. At follow up, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of typical GERD symptoms only in the LSG-group (P = .003). LSG+HHR patients showed a significantly higher heartburn frequency-intensity score compared with LSG patients (P = .009). CONCLUSION This finding confirms that LSG has a beneficial effect on relieving GERD symptoms, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear; conversely, the procedure of HHR did not produce any improvement in GERD symptoms.

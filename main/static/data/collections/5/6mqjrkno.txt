The lack of quantitative risk assessment of airborne transmission of COVID-19 under practical settings leads to large uncertainties and inconsistencies in our preventive measures. Combining in situ measurements and numerical simulations, we quantify the exhaled aerosols from normal respiratory behaviors and their transport under elevator, small classroom and supermarket settings to evaluate the risk of inhaling potentially virus-containing aerosols. Our results show that the design of ventilation is critical for reducing the risk of aerosol encounters. Inappropriate design can significantly limit the efficiency of aerosol removal, create local hot spots with orders of magnitude higher risks, and enhance aerosol deposition causing surface contamination. Additionally, our measurements reveal the presence of substantial fraction of crystalline aerosols from normal breathing and its strong correlation with breathing depth.

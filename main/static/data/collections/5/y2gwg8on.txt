This study includes a retrospective analysis of the diagnosis and treatment of a case of severe pneumonia from fulminant psittacosis with multiple organ failure. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the pathogen was conducted. The purpose of this study was to summarize the clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of the case and to improve understanding of the value of NGS in the diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Fulminant psittacosis can be manifested as severe pneumonia with rapid progression, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and multiple organ failure. Imaging shows unilateral lung consolidation, which is difficult to differentiate from CAP caused by common pathogens. The NGS technology can early detect rare pathogens, thus reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics and shortening the course of the disease.

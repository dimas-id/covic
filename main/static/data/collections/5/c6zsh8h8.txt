The current assortment of microcatheters widely used for aneurysm coil embolization may not be well suited for several anatomic variants, including excessive vascular tortuosity and small aneurysms less than 3 mm. Longer microcatheters designed with a smaller caliber that can accommodate and deliver coils may be of use in these situations. This case series and literature review illustrates the advantages and limitations of the Marathon microcatheter (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) when used for coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms. Despite some technical compromises including the distal marker, length, and the risk of buckling, the Marathon microcatheter was able to adequately deliver coils to achieve satisfactory occlusion of cerebral aneurysms. We found unique advantages with regards to length and smaller distal outer diameter (OD). These results may serve as a guide for the further development of a microcatheter used for coil embolization that has the features of a smaller distal OD and longer length.

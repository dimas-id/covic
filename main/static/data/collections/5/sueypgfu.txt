Spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy has challenged the practice of liver transplantation in an unprecedented way. We report on initiatives implemented at a high-volume transplant center to handle an anticipated increase in waiting list time, deferral of pre-transplant care and temporary postponement of routine post-transplant follow up. All of the strategies we implemented were derived from the chronic care model and based on productive interaction across healthcare professionals, communities, authorities and patients.

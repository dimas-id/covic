The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to make some estimations for the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic dynamics in Ukraine, Italy and Austria. The volume of the data sets and the influence of the information about the initial stages of the epidemics were discussed in order to have reliable long-time predictions. The final sizes and durations for the pandemic in these countries are estimated.

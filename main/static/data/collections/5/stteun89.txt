Vaccination of health care workers (HCWs) is recommended as a strategy for preventing influenza in elderly patients in long-term care. However, there have been no controlled studies to show whether this approach is effective. During the winter of 1994–1995, 1059 patients in 12 geriatric medical long-term-care sites, randomized for vac.cination of HCWs, were studied. In hospitals where HCWs were offered vaccination, 653 (61%) of 1078 were vaccinated. Vaccination of HCWs was associated with reductions in total patient mortality from 17% to 10% (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40–0.80) and in influenza-like illness (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34–0.94). Vaccination of patients was not associated with significant effects on mortality (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.81–1.64). Results of this study support recommendations for vaccination against influenza of HCWs in long-term geriatric care. Vaccination of frail elderly long-term-care patients may not give clinically worthwhile benefits.

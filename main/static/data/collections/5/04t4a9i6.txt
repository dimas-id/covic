Despite an excellent view of the glottis, technical difficulties with endotracheal tube delivery remains in GlideScope intubation. We evaluated whether a spiral-shape twisted tube can facilitate placement of the tracheal tube tip at the center of glottis opening compared to conventional tube for GlideScope intubation in infants. Eighty-six infants were randomly placed in either the conventional tube group (group C) or the twist tube group (group T). In group T, the shaft of the tube was manually twisted into a loose spiral shape. The primary outcome was the initial center location of the tube tip at the glottis opening, and the secondary outcome was total tube handling time. The initial center location rate of the tube tip at the glottis opening was significantly higher in group T than in group C (88% [38/43] vs. 47% [20/43], P < 0.001). In addition, total tube handling time (sec) was significantly shorter in group T than in group C (15.4 ± 4.7 vs. 18.2 ± 5.3, P = 0.012). In this study, the spiral shape twist tube successfully improved the rate of initial center location of the tube tip at glottis opening and facilitated tube delivery in GlideScope intubation in infants.

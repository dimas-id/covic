Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) removes a single residue from Ang I to yield Ang (1-9) and cleaves a single residue from Ang II to generate Ang (1-7). Thus ACE2 counterbalances ACE function decreasing Ang II levels1 . Consequently, this enzyme has a protective role against excessively high blood pressure values and high level of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation2 . This article is protected by copyright.

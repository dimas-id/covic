DNA viruses and retroviruses are well established as vectors for the expression of heterologous genes, but there is increasing interest in the possibilities of using RNA viruses, which do not replicate through a DNA intermediate, for this purpose. This article summarizes some of the general properties of RNA viruses and concentrates on one class of RNA viruses — the alphaviruses — and their potential as expression vectors.

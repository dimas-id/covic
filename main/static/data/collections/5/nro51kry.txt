PURPOSE We report our experience of using stent-retrievers for recurrent cerebral vasospasm (CVS) secondary to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). METHODS We performed a retrospective review of our prospectively maintained institutional database to identify all patients with recurrent CVS and treated with stent-retrievers between April 2011 and May 2017. All patients were initially treated with intra-arterial (IA) vasodilators and were subsequently re-treated with stent-retrievers if they developed recurrent vasospasm. Patients were categorized into two groups, those in which IA vasodilators were given again prior to the stent-retriever deployment (VD-first) and those in which the stent-retriever was deployed first and IA vasodilators were given subsequently (SR-first). RESULTS We identified 12 patients (7 females, mean age 54.9 years), 5 in the VD-first and 7 in the SR-first cohorts. Stent-retriever lumen dilatation was attempted in 53 segments (VD-first 14, SR-first 39). Stent-retriever deployment was technically feasible in all cases. Vasodilation occurred in 71.4% (10/14 segments) in the VD-first group and 82.1% (32/39 segments) in SR-first group. Additional treatment was required in 5 segments. There was no recurrent vasospasm in the SR-first group; however, 3 patients (60%) in the VD-first group showed recurrent vasospasm. No angiographical abnormality was found at long-term follow-up (7 patients, mean 29.1 months). CONCLUSION The use of stent-retrievers to treat cerebral vasospasm is technically feasible and can cause long-term vasodilatation; however, this effect is maximized if stent-retrievers are used prior to infusion of IA vasodilators.

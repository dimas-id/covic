We report the compassionate use of humanized Virus Suppressing Factor-variant 13 (hzVSF-v13) in two patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Both patients, including an 81-year-old man who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, showed clinical improvement. These results warrant placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the hzVSF-v13 efficacy against COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

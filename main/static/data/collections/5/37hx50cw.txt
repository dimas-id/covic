A previous metagenomic analysis of the turkey gut RNA virus community identified novel enteric viruses that may play roles in poultry enteric diseases or in performance problems noted in the field. As part of the molecular characterization of these novel enteric viruses, a reverse transcriptase-PCR diagnostic assay was developed, targeting a novel turkey-origin picobirnavirus (PBV) initially identified in a pooled intestinal sample from turkey poults in North Carolina. Little detailed molecular information exists regarding the family Picobirnaviridae, particularly for the PBVs that have been described in avian species. This diagnostic assay targets the turkey PBV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and produces an 1135-bp amplicon. This assay was validated using in vitro transcribed RNA and was tested using archived enteric samples collected from turkey flocks in the southeastern United States. Further, a phylogenetic analysis suggests the turkey PBV is unique because it does not group closely with the recognized PBV genogroups circulating in mammalian hosts.

Natural killer (NK) cell deficiency (NKD) is a subset of primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) in which an abnormality of NK cells represents a major immunological defect resulting in the patientâ€™s clinical immunodeficiency. This is distinct from a much larger group of PIDs that include an NK cell abnormality as a minor component of the immunodeficiency. Patients with NKD most frequently have atypical consequences of herpesviral infections. There are now 6 genes that have been ascribed to causing NKD, some exclusively and others that also cause other known immunodeficiencies. This list has grown in recent years and as such the mechanistic and molecular clarity around what defines an NKD is an emerging and important field of research. Continued increased clarity will allow for more rational approaches to the patients themselves from a therapeutic standpoint. Having evaluated numerous individuals for NKD, I share my perspective on approaching the diagnosis and managing these patients.

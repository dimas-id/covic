BACKGROUND Overweight and obesity independently increase cardiovascular risk, while even modest weight loss can result in clinically significant improvements in cardiovascular risk and reduce long-term mortality. Lowering the body mass index (BMI) threshold for bariatric surgery to those with moderate obesity might be one way to lower the burden of this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LAGB) in moderately obese subjects with or without obesity-related co-morbidities. METHODS Thirty-four patients with BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m(2) (5 males/29 females, mean age 36 ± 10 years, mean preoperative weight 87.9 ± 7.1 kg, mean BMI 32.6 ± 1.6 kg/m(2) and mean percentage excess weight 48.7 ± 9 %) who underwent LAGB via pars flaccida between June 1, 2002 and August 31, 2010 were included. Good response was defined as BMI <30 kg/m(2) or percentage estimated weight loss (%EWL) >50. Poor response was defined as BMI >30 kg/m(2) or %EWL less than 50 after a minimum of 1 year. RESULTS Mean weight, BMI and %EWL were recorded at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years and were 77.4 ± 7.6, 69.9 ± 10.8, 70.9 ± 9.3 and 73.3 ± 12.0 kg; 28.8 ± 2.9, 26.4 ± 3.2, 26.5 ± 3.4 and 27.4 ± 5.0 kg/m(2); and 36 ± 23, 46.1 ± 33.8, 58.6 ± 31.5 and 45 ± 57, respectively (p < 0.01). Co-morbidities were diagnosed in 17/34 (50 %) patients at baseline and underwent remission or improvement in all cases after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS LAGB in a safe and effective procedure in patients with a BMI <35 kg/m(2).

Abstract In spite of the development of the medical science, during the twentieth century, individuals have observed the spread of new or reemerging diseases, from plague, cholera, and flu; measles, cancer, and malaria; to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, West Nile fever, resistant tuberculosis, virus of Ebola, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and others. As individual illness is rooted in society and the environment, human life is tied up with the history of main endemic and epidemic diseases. Human health is very sensitive and adaptable to changes, so the history of disease and hygiene is the core of the new ecological history.

OBJECTIVE This study retrospectively compared the clinical and angiographic outcomes of treating cerebral aneurysms with Neuroform (NEU), Enterprise (EP), and Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS/LVIS Jr) stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of a procedural database. All aneurysm procedures using any of the three types of self-expanding nitinol stents (NEU, EP and LVIS/LVIS Jr) were included. Intra-procedure complications, post-procedure complications, and angiographic results (Raymond-Roy grade scale, RRGS) were analyzed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of intra-procedure and post-procedure complications. RESULTS Two hundred and forty-three aneurysms in 229 patients treated with stent-assisted coiling were included (NEU group: 109 aneurysms; EP group: 61 aneurysms; LVIS/LVIS Jr: 73 aneurysms). The LVIS/LVIS Jr group was associated with the lowest rate of initial complete occlusion (RRGS I: 47.9%; 35/73). Follow-up showed the proportion of RRGS I increased for all stent groups but was greatest in the LVIS/LVIS Jr group. Overall, 17 intra-procedural complications were seen in 229 patients (7.4%) and 15 post-procedural complications were found in 198 patients at follow-up (7.6%), with no differences between stent groups. Thrombotic events were the most common complications and occurred in 13 patients (13/229, 5.7%). CONCLUSIONS All three types of stents used to treat cerebral aneurysms with unfavorable neck were safe and effective, providing suitable support for the coil mass. LVIS/LVIS Jr promotes better progressive aneurysm complete occlusion than the other two stents but seems to cause more common intra-procedural stent-related thrombotic events and fewer post-procedural complications.

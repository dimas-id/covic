Naturally produced droplets from humans (such as those produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing) include several types of cells (e.g., epithelial cells and cells of the immune system), physiological electrolytes contained in mucous and saliva (e.g. Na+, K+, Cl-), as well as, potentially, several infectious agents (e.g. bacteria, fungi, and viruses). In response to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, which has become a major public health issue worldwide, we provide a didactic overview of airborne germ transmission as seen from a physics perspective. We also provide a recommendation that could help to slow down the spread of the virus.

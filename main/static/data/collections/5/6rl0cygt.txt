This paper follows the question to what extent the compatibility of work and family life and gender inequalities in the domestic division of labour change when working with digital technologies in a flexible manner in terms of time and place. It is based on the results of the research project “Changing gender relations through digital transformation” (Hans Böckler Foundation). Various effects have been observed: For example, mobile working and home office enable part-time workers to increase their contractual working hours; flexible digital work provides emotional and time relief in the event of spontaneous emergencies such as child illness; however, the extent of invisible and unpaid overtime is also increasing. In most cases, this does not lead to a reorganisation or redistribution of unpaid domestic and care work. Nevertheless, there are signs of shifts in the domestic division of labour. This article presents the central results of the project and discusses them with regard to their implications for gender inequality. Practical Relevance: The text provides information on current experiences with flexible working times and places from a gender perspective. It provides indications of conducive and obstructive conditions for reducing inequalities in the responsibility for care work and in domestic division of labour. The results can be used for the design of conditions and regulations for flexible work in terms of time and place in companies.

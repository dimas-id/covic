A 10-month-old male presented with new-onset seizure activity, a 6-week fever of unknown origin, and a left-sided frontoparietal subdural fluid collection. The child’s mother reported tonic-clonic movements that lasted for about 15 min and that resolved with one dose of lorazepam. At 9 months of age, the infant’s pediatrician had noted an increase in the patient’s head circumference.

We have developed a new experimental system based on a microfluidic chip to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). The system includes a laser‐induced fluorescence microfluidic chip analyzer, a glass microchip for both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis, a chip thermal cycler based on dual Peltier thermoelectric elements, a reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) SARS diagnostic kit, and a DNA electrophoretic sizing kit. The system allows efficient cDNA amplification of SARS‐CoV followed by electrophoretic sizing and detection on the same chip. To enhance the reliability of RT‐PCR on SARS‐CoV detection, duplex PCR was developed on the microchip. The assay was carried out on a home‐made microfluidic chip system. The positive and the negative control were cDNA fragments of SARS‐CoV and parainfluenza virus, respectively. The test results showed that 17 positive samples were obtained among 18 samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from clinically diagnosed SARS patients. However, 12 positive results from the same 18 samples were obtained by the conventional RT‐PCR with agarose gel electrophoresis detection. The SARS virus species can be analyzed with high positive rate and rapidity on the microfluidic chip system.

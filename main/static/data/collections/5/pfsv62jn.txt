OBJECTIVE The technique called Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT)-LOUD has previously been used to improve voice quality in people with Parkinson's disease. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an alternate intervention, LSVT-BIG (signifying big movements), to improve functional mobility. DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized trials. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AgeLine, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to September 2017 using multiple search terms related to Parkinson's disease and LSVT-BIG. REVIEW METHOD Two researchers searched the literature for studies of the LSVT-BIG intervention of 16 sessions, delivered by a certified instructor over four weeks, to any other intervention. Outcomes related to functional ability were included. Study quality was appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS Four studies were included, reporting on three randomized trials of 84 participants with mild Parkinson's disease. Compared to physiotherapy exercises, or a shorter training protocol, there was a significant improvement in motor function assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (mean difference = -3.20, 95% confidence interval = -5.18 to -1.23) and a trend towards faster Timed Up and Go performance (mean difference = -0.47, 95% confidence interval = -0.99 to 0.06) and 10-metre walk test (mean difference = -0.53, 95% confidence interval = -1.07 to 0.01). CONCLUSION Compared to shorter format LSVT-BIG or general exercise, LSVT-BIG was more effective at improving motor function. This provides preliminary, moderate quality evidence that amplitude-oriented training is effective in reducing motor impairments for people with mild Parkinson's disease.

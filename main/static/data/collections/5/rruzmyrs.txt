BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It was highly contagious spreading all over the world, with a rapid increase in the number of deaths. COVID-19 is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea with variable chest imaging features which have been detected. In our study, we shared our experience of CT findings in proven cases of COVID-19 to recognize the different CT patterns to help in proper and accurate diagnosis. RESULTS: The most common CT features detected in COVID-19 cases were ground glass patches (93.3%) followed by subpleural linear abnormality (53.3%), air bronchogram (23.3%), and consolidation patches (23.3%), as well as bronchial wall thickening (16.7%), crazy paving pattern (13.3%), and discrete nodules surrounded by ground glass appearance (10%). Only one case had pleural effusion (3.3%). No cavitary lesions or specific lymph nodes were detected in any of the examined patients. The lung lesions showed typical diffuse, basal, and subpleural involvement with less affection of the upper lobes. CONCLUSION: CT imaging findings of COVID-19 can help in early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 and proper assessment of the severity of the disease.

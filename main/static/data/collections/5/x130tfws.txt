Abstract Background: Critical shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) especially N95 respirators, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a source of great concern among health care workers (HCWs). Novel methods of N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) decontamination that can be scaled-up for in-hospital use can help address this concern and keep HCWs safe. Methods: A multidisciplinary pragmatic study was conducted to evaluate the use of an ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system (HLDS) that generates aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators. A cycle duration that consistently achieved disinfection of N95 respirators (defined as >6 log10 reductions in bacteriophage MS2 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores inoculated onto respirators) was identified. The treated masks were then assessed for changes to their hydrophobicity, material structure, strap elasticity, and filtration efficiency (FE). Assessment of PAA off-gassing from a treated mask was also performed. Results: The PAA room HLDS was effective for disinfection of N95 respirators in a 2447 cubic feet room with deploy and dwell times of 16 and 32 minutes respectively, and a total cycle time of 1 hour and 16 minutes. After 5 treatment cycles, no adverse effects were detected on filtration efficiency, structural integrity, or strap elasticity. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA from the treated masks. Conclusion: The PAA room disinfection system provides a rapidly scalable solution for in-hospital decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators to meet the needs of HCWs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

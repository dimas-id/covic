SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of wide contagion and quick velocity of propagation. To analysis the visual information of it, we build a SARS-CoV-2 image dataset with 48 electron microscopic images and also prepare their ground truth images. Furthermore, we extract multiple classical features and novel deep learning features to describe the visual information of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, it is proved that the visual features of the SARS-CoV-2 images which are observed under the electron microscopic can be extracted and analysed.

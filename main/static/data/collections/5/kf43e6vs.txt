Positively charged photodegradable nanoparticles that simultaneously encapsulated various compounds including small and large molecules were prepared. The nanoparticles were internalized to the cell by endocytosis and were stable within the cells for at least 4 days. The encapsulated molecules were released into the cytosol using light stimuli.

Summary Despite the high risk of acquiring respiratory infections, healthcare workers who treat pilgrims at Hajj have not been studied in previous research on respiratory diseases during Hajj. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of different respiratory viruses among healthcare workers who treated pilgrims during Hajj 2009, the year of the influenza A H1N1 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was performed just before and after Hajj (25â€“29 November, 2009). Nasal and throat swabs were tested for 18 respiratory virus types and subtypes. A total of 184 healthcare workers were examined. Most were men (85%) with an average age of 41 years. Before the Hajj, rates of seasonal influenza vaccination were higher (51%) than rates of pandemic influenza A H1N1 vaccination (22%). After the Hajj, participants reported high rates of maintaining hand hygiene (98%), cough etiquette (89%), and wearing a face mask (90%). Among all the viruses tested, only two were detected: rhinovirus was detected in 12.6% and Coronavirus 229E in 0.6%. Rhinovirus was detected in 21% of those who had respiratory symptoms during Hajj. Influenza A (including H1N1), influenza B. respiratory syncytial virus, other coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus were not detected. The finding of high rates of rhinovirus infection corresponds to their frequent occurrence in adults. None of the participants had influenza A H1N1 2009, possibly because it was also infrequent among the 2009 pilgrims.

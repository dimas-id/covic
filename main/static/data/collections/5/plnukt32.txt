In infectious diseases, the routes of transmission play major roles in determining the rate and extent of disease spread. Though fomites and aerosol droplets are major sources of SARS-CoV-2 human to human transmission, studies have also reported possible involvement of other routes of transmission like fecal-oral. Multiple studies around the world have reported shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in certain COVID-19 patient fecal samples. Hence, the major objective of this study was to get the experimental evidence whether in Indian COVID-19 patients fecal dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 genome occurs or not. Information obtained from twelve number of patients from a COVID-19 hospital of Odisha has demonstrated that both symptomatic and asymptomatic Indian patients could be positive for the SARS-CoV-2 genome in their fecal component. The findings have also established a protocol to collect and extract viral RNA for SARS-CoV-2 detection in fecal samples. Together, the study supports the hypothesis of possible fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus and provides a rationale to extend this study in a larger cohort of patient samples and correlate the significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome detection in fecal samples with disease severity and transmission.

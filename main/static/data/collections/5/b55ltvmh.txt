BACKGROUND Portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT) is a potentially lethal complication of splenectomy for hematologic disease. Known risk factors for PSVT include malignancy and splenomegaly. While these patients are believed to be hypercoagulable, the specific mechanism is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether specific acquired prothrombotic risk factors contribute to the development of PSVT following laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing LS were prospectively studied between 2005 and 2013. Preoperatively, patients were screened for prothrombotic states and surveillance duplex ultrasonography was performed between 1 week and 1 month postoperatively to assess for PSVT. The association between baseline prothrombotic disorders and PSVT was explored using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were included in the analysis, and 17 (25 %) of these developed PSVT. There were no differences in patients with and without PSVT with respect to age, body mass index, gender or surgical time. Preoperative spleen size, as determined by diagnostic imaging, and intraoperative blood transfusion were associated with PSVT. Seven of 9 patients (78 %) with massive splenomegaly (>20 cm) developed PSVT compared with 4 of 13 patients (31 %) with moderate splenomegaly (15-20 cm) and 6 of 45 patients (13 %) without (p < 0.001). Abnormalities in baseline prothrombotic screening tests were common, with 52 patients (75 %) demonstrating at least one; however, none were associated with the development of PSVT. CONCLUSION In patients scheduled for LS, screening for prothrombotic states is not useful to identify patients at risk of development of PSVT. Preoperative spleen size and blood transfusion were predictive of PSVT formation.

BACKGROUND & AIM: As on date, no specific treatment is available for devastating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This pandemic viral infection has affected over 200 countries within a very short time and created a calamitous situationacross the globe. As per WHO guidelines, the treatment is mainly symptomatic andsupportive. This clinical protocol has not proven sufficient to save the lives of COVID-19 patients suffering from diabetes or having underlying liver diseases; hence there isutmost need to tackle this situation by other means such as Convalescent Plasma (CP)therapy. METHODS: A comprehensive literature survey was carriedout using Elsevier, PubMed, Taylor & Francis, Springer, Nature and Google searchengines. RESULTS: The patients suffering from diabetes or liverdysfunction or any other underlying diseases are at greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2infection. From the study, it is proved that plasma collected from the recovered patientsof viral infection has considerable potential to treat the viral disease without theoccurrence of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The CP therapy can bea possible life saving alternative to treat critical COVID-19 patients having diabetes orunderlying liver dysfunction. Hence, randomised clinical trials are recommended at theearliest to save the lives of infected individuals of COVID-19.

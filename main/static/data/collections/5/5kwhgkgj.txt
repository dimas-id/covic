We present fuzzy-rough-learn, the first Python library of fuzzy rough set machine learning algorithms. It contains three algorithms previously implemented in R and Java, as well as two new algorithms from the recent literature. We briefly discuss the use cases of fuzzy-rough-learn and the design philosophy guiding its development, before providing an overview of the included algorithms and their parameters.

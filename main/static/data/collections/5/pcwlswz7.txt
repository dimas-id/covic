Abstract Background The WHO estimates 10-30% of hospital admissions are associated with poor infection prevention and control (IPC). There are no reliable data on IPC status in Tanzanian healthcare facilities; hence the Star Rating Assessment (SRA) was established to address this. This study compared the health facility performances on adherence to IPC principles using baseline and reassessment data of SRA. Methods A retrospective analysis of data from eight randomly selected regions across Tanzania. Data was gathered from an SRA database in which records of baseline assessments (2015/16) and reassessments (2017/18) were documented. Each healthcare facilityâ€™s ownership and service level were investigated as independent variables. Results A total of 2,131 healthcare facilities at baseline and 2,185 at reassessment were analysed. Median adherence to IPC principles increased from 31% (IQR: 20%, 46%) to 57% (IQR: 41.4%, 73.2%) after interventions (p<0.001). Privately-owned facilities had higher adherence to IPC principles compared to publicly-owned facilities during baseline (p<0.001) however, the difference was not significant after intervention (p=0.751). On average, hospitals scored highest followed by health centres and then dispensaries during both assessments. Being a privately-owned facility was a predictor of attaining a recommended IPC score of 80% at baseline (POR=1.92 CI=1.06-3.48) but not after the intervention. Facility level was not a predictor during baseline assessment; however after intervention hospitals were twice as likely to attain the recommended score compared to dispensaries (POR=2.27 CI=1.15-4.45) Conclusion Assessment and rating of quality and organization of health services plus management support to healthcare facilities, leads to improved adherence to IPC principles.

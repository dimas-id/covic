Robotic mirror therapy (MT), which allows movement of the affected limb, is proposed as a more effective method than conventional MT (CMT). To improve the rehabilitation effectiveness of post-stroke patients, we developed a sensory stimulation-based continuous passive motion (CPM)-MT system with two different operating protocols, that is, asynchronous and synchronous modes. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measured brain activation through relative and absolute power spectral density (PSD) changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) mu rhythm in three cases with CMT and CPM-MT with asynchronous and synchronous modes. We also monitored changes in muscle fatigue, which is one of the negative effects of the CPM device, based on median power frequency (MPF) and root mean square (RMS). Relative PSD was most suppressed when subjects used the CPM-MT system under synchronous control: 22.11%, 15.31%, and 16.48% on Cz, C3, and C4, respectively. The absolute average changes in MPF and RMS were 1.59% and 9.78%, respectively, with CPM-MT. Synchronous mode CPM-MT is the most effective method for brain activation, and muscle fatigue caused by the CPM-MT system was negligible. This study suggests the more effective combination rehabilitation system for MT by utilizing CPM and magnetic-based MT task to add action execution and sensory stimulation compared with CMT.

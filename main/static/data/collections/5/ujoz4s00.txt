Digestive proteases were partially characterized in sheepshead juveniles, using biochemical and electrophoretic techniques. Results showed higher activity level of the stomach proteases (2.39 ± 0.02 U mg protein-1) compared to the intestinal proteases (1.6 ± 0.1 U mg protein-1). The activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase A was also recorded. The optimum temperature of the stomach proteases was recorded at 45 °C, while for intestinal proteases was recorded at 55 °C. Stomach proteases showed less stability to temperature changes than intestinal proteases. An optimum pH of 2 was recorded for stomach proteases with high stability under acidic conditions, while an optimum pH of 9 was recorded for intestinal proteases showing high stability under alkaline conditions. Stomach proteases were inhibited around 78% with Pepstatin A, indicating the presence of pepsin as the main protease. The stomach proteases zymogam revealed one active band with Rf of 0.49, this enzyme was completely inhibited by Pepstatin A. The intestinal proteases zymogram revealed four active proteases (51.3, 34.9, 27.8 and 21.2 kDa) that were inhibited by TLCK, which mainly represent a trypsin-like serine proteases. It can be conclude that digestion in sheepshead can be considered as a carnivorous species with an omnivorous tendency.(AU)

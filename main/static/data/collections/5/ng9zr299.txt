In contrast to high-throughput screening, in virtual ligand screening (VS), compounds are selected using computer programs to predict their binding to a target receptor. A key prerequisite is knowledge about the spatial and energetic criteria responsible for proteinâ€“ligand binding. The concepts and prerequisites to perform VS are summarized here, and explanations are sought for the enduring limitations of the technology. Target selection, analysis and preparation are discussed, as well as considerations about the compilation of candidate ligand libraries. The tools and strategies of a VS campaign, and the accuracy of scoring and ranking of the results, are also considered.

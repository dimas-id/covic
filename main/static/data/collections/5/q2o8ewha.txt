Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV) infection has recently emerged as a cause of severe potentially fatal pneumonia. The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and acute renal failure. Data on the clinical presentation in solid organ transplant recipients are lacking. We report two cases of MERS CoV infections in two renal transplant recipients with variable clinical presentations and outcomes. The first patient presented with progressive respiratory symptoms, acute renal failure and died. While the second patient presented with respiratory tract symptoms, remained stable and had an excellent clinical recovery despite recent reception of thymoglobulin induction. This is a rare report of MERS CoV infection in renal transplant recipients. Further data are needed to gain better understanding of the impact of anti‚Äêrejection immunosuppressive therapy on the clinical presentation, severity and outcome of MERS CoV infections in solid organ transplant recipients.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led the scientific community to breach new frontiers in the understanding of human physiology and disease pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzyme receptor may be a functional target for the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since DPP4-inhibitors are currently used for the treatment of patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM), there is currently high interest in the possibility that these agents, or incretin-based therapies (IBTs) in general, may be of benefit against the new coronavirus infection. Diabetes is associated with increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, and accumulating evidence suggests that IBTs may favorably alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their inherent mechanisms of action. Further research into prognostic variables associated with various antidiabetic treatment regimens, and in particular the IBT, in patients with T2DM affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is therefore warranted.

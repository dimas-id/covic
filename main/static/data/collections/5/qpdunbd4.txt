Intra- and inter-hospital transport is common due to the need for advanced diagnostics and procedures, and to provide access to specialized care. Risks are inherent during transport, so the anticipated benefits of transport must be weighed against the possible negative outcome during the transport. Adverse events are common in both in and out of hospital transports, the most common being equipment malfunctions. During inter-hospital transport, increased transfer time is associated with worse patient outcomes. The use of specialized teams with the transport of children has been shown to decrease adverse events. Intra-hospital transports often involve critically ill patients, which increases the likelihood of adverse events. Radiographic diagnostics are the most common in-hospital transport destination and the results often change the course of care. It is recommended that portable ventilators be used for transport, because studies show that use of a manual resuscitator alters blood gas values due to inconsistent ventilation. The performance of new generation transport ventilators has improved greatly and now allows for seamless transition from ICU ventilators. Diligent planning for and monitoring during transport may decrease adverse events and reduce risk.

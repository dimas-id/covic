The worldâ€™s population growth and economic development result in the increased requirement of land, water, and energy. This increased demand leads to the deforestation, loss in biodiversity, imbalance in agriculture and food supply, climate change, and increase in food and travel trade, which result in emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. This chapter discussed various emerging infectious diseases and their causative agents (Buruli ulcer and Bunyvirus). Furthermore, this chapter further illustrates the emergence of superbugs and the associated threat due to the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment. The prevalence of pharmaceuticals in the environment exerts ecotoxic effects on living organisms and causes thousands of death every year. The threats associated with the pharmaceutical presence in the environment were briefly discussed in this chapter. Finally, this chapter provides the alternative methods to avoid the use of antibiotics and to develop novel treatment technologies (such as Phage therapy) to degrade and remove the pharmaceutical compounds.

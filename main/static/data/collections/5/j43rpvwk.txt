Summary It isnâ€™t every day that a doctor becomes a patient. It is more peculiar when it occurs with an unknown mysterious epidemic respiratory illness that kills. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) gripped the world in 2003, spreading via air-links and throwing the global economy into disarray. As a practicing physician in Singapore, one of the first countries affected, I describe my first-hand account of my battle with this illness, how I acquired this illness in Singapore, and eventually quarantine in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

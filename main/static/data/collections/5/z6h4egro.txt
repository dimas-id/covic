More than 250 continuous flow LVADs have been implanted in Japan during the last 3 years, with 1-year survival rates of 90%. These excellent results cannot be achieved without VAD teams who know the detail of surgical techniques and perioperative management. Preoperative optimization of RV function is essential and intraoperative managements are focused on adequate balance between right and left ventricle to prevent right ventricular (RV) failure. For postoperative RV failure early institution of temporary RV mechanical support improves outcomes. Immediate CT scanning is crucial if LVAD patients complain of new neurological symptoms. When CT reveals cerebral hemorrhage, INR should be reduced as soon as possible. The driveline (DL) exit site remains a significant source of LVAD-related infections, and orientation and immobilization of the DL is important. Although vacuum assisted closure is useful to facilitate drainage and healing in pump pocket as well as DL infections, urgent heart transplantation, bridging to recovery, or pump exchange may become the only options to eradicate LVAD-related infections. Patients with continuous flow LVAD are more prone to developing de novo aortic insufficiency. Although majority of them can be managed medically, some require surgical intervention. The cause of pump thrombosis is multifactorial, including lowered INR and pump speed, and implantation techniques. It is important to exchange pumps in a timely manner either through a median sternotomy or subcostal incision in highly suspected patients indicated by elevated LDH and left-sided heart failure.

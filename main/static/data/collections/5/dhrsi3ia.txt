BACKGROUND Recently, single port laparoscopic surgery has begun to develop as an extension of minimally invasive surgery, but there have been only a few reports of single port laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (SPLTEP) hernioplasty. In addition, there are few comparative studies with conventional laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (CLTEP) hernioplasty. The aim of the present study was to report our experience with SPLTEP hernioplasty and to compare short-term outcomes for SPLTEP hernioplasty with CLTEP hernioplasty. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for all patients undergoing SPLTEP hernioplasty for inguinal hernia at Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon, Korea. Data for the SPLTEP group (n = 76 patients enrolled between June 2010 and May 2011) were compared retrospectively with data for the CLTEP group (n = 93 patients enrolled between June 2009 and May 2010). RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics. This study showed no significant difference in terms of operative time between the two groups (SPLTEP group 54.0 min vs. CLTEP group 47.8 min; p = 0.07). There were no conversions to conventional TEP hernioplasty or transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty or open surgery in SPLTEP hernioplasty. Morbidity rates were 7.9 % (n = 6) in the SPLTEP group and 10.8 % (n = 10) in the CLTEP group, and the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS Single port laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernioplasty is technically feasible and the short-term operative outcome is comparable to that of CLTEP hernioplasty. Future large-scale prospective controlled studies and long-term analysis are needed to establish the cosmetic outcomes, quality of life, long-term recurrence rate, and long-term complication rate of SPLTEP hernioplasty.

OBJECTIVE Patients with May-Thurner syndrome presenting with acute deep vein thrombosis benefit from early lysis of clot and endovascular treatment. We evaluated the outcome of patients with May-Thurner syndrome who presented with deep vein thrombosis, managed with pharmacomechanical thrombolysis as the primary mode of intervention, in combination with angioplasty and stent placement. METHODS We reviewed all patients with May-Thurner syndrome managed in our institution between January 2009 to December 2015. Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome were evaluated as primary end points. RESULTS A total of seven patients (6 females, 1 male) with a mean ± SD age of 48 ± 17 years and mean ± SD body mass index of 29.64 ± 7.25 kg/m were identified. Six patients presented with acute deep vein thrombosis and one presented with chronic venous insufficiency. Five patients underwent pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (TRELLIS and altepase) with concomitant stenting of the common iliac vein, one had only angioplasty with stent placement, and one had only pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Median time from presentation to pharmacomechanical thrombolysis was 4 days (range = 1-9). Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome at 12 months were 100% and 0%, respectively. No patient experienced major bleeding or pulmonary embolism. The median length of stay was 3 days (range = 0-4). There was no mortality associated with the procedure. The mean ± SD follow-up was 26 ± 15 months. CONCLUSIONS In patients with May-Thurner syndrome, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis is an effective approach for the management of acute deep vein thrombosis, decreasing thrombus burden, and long-term postthrombotic syndrome when used in conjunction with stenting.

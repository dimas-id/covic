Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop respiratory failure and septic shock. Extracorporeal blood purification is proposed as an adjuvant therapy for sepsis and aims at controlling the dysregulated autoimmune system. We describe our experience in treating COVID-19 patients with the oXiris(®) hemofilter which adsorbs both cytokines and endotoxins, provides renal replacement therapy and has anti-thrombogenic properties. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization for COVID-19 patients in April 2020. In our study, the use of the oXiris(®) filter decreased levels of inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), and improved clinical outcomes in two out of three patients.

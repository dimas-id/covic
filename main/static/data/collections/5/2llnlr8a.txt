Understanding the COVID-19 pandemic is a multidisciplinary effort that requires a significant number of variables. This dataset comprises (i) sociodemographic characteristics, compiled from 35 datasets obtained at UN Data; (ii) mobility metrics that can assist the analysis of social distancing, from Google Community Mobility Reports and; (iii) daily counts of cases and deaths by COVID-19, from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This unified dataset ranges from February 15, 2020 to April 26, 2020, a total of 72 days, and is provided as a collection of time series for 131 countries with 192 variables. The pipeline to preprocess and generate the dataset, along with the dataset itself, are versioned with the Data Version Control tool (DVC) and are thus easily reproducible.

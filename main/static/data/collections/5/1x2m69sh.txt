Laparoscopic cystogastrostomy is a well-accepted minimally invasive modality to treat pancreatic pseudocysts. There has been one prior report of cystogastrostomy via single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in which specialized instrumentation and access platforms were used.We report the challenges encountered in a low resource setting with the SILS approach to drainage using only standard laparoscopic instruments. To the best of our knowledge this is the second report of SILS cystogastrostomy and the first to be performed in a resource poor setting without specialized instruments or platforms.

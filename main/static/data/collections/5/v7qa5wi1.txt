PURPOSE This study presents findings on the clinical usefulness of an overlap method that is another modification for the currently well-known intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG). METHODS We studied 42 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer who underwent TLDG between December 2011 and March 2013. Endoscopic linear staplers were used for intracorporeal anastomosis and patients were observed with endoscopic tracking six months after surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of the operation, the clinical pathological results, and the endoscopy results. RESULTS The mean duration of the operation for 42 patients was 228.3 ± 42.5 minutes and the mean time to complete the anastomosis was 12.18 ± 2.3 minutes. There were no mortalities and no cases of open conversion. Following the operation, 37 patients had stage IA, 5 in stage IB, and 3 in stage II gastric cancer. Abscesses were seen in 3 patients and 5 cases of stasis during the postoperative period. Duodenoscopy 6 months after the operation showed 11 cases of gastric stasis, 28 cases of bile reflux, and 1 new case of erosive gastritis. We did not observe contraction in any of the patients. CONCLUSION The overlap method for intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy, using an endoscopic linear stapler, can be considered a feasible and safe technique for the treatment of stomach cancer. However, a long-term comparative study is required to sufficiently evaluate our findings.

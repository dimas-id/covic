BACKGROUND Recent case studies have demonstrated the feasibility of single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SILC). Few comparative studies for SILC and multiport laparoscopic colectomy (MLC) have been conducted. The aim of this case-controlled study was to compare the short-term surgical outcomes between SILC and MLC for right-sided colectomies. METHODS Between January 2010 and February 2012, data from the first 50 consecutive patients that underwent right SILS at one of the two institutions were compared with a group of 50 consecutive patients that underwent right MLC in the same period. RESULTS Median operative time was significantly shorter in SILC (97 vs. 112 min; p < 0.001). Between both groups, no statistically significant differences were found regarding number and nature of short-term complications, number of reoperations [4 (8%) vs. 6 (12%)], and mortality rate [1 (2%) vs. 2 (4%)]. Median postoperative hospital stay was 6 days for both groups. CONCLUSION SILC is a safe and feasible procedure when performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Length of hospital stay and overall complication rates are comparable with MLC. Until today, no clear advantages of SILC over MLC have been demonstrated. However, due to its smaller incisional trauma, SILC could be a major step in improving cosmetic outcomes.

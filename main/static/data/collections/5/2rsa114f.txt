Since its detection in 2001 the human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, was observed to be a serious pathogen in human respiratory infections during childhood. Meanwhile, several animal models have been established to study the virus-host interactions and pathogenic effects. Mainly, small laboratory animals like mice and cotton rats have been used, although the usage of these two species for HMPV research is controversially discussed and contradictious results were obtained by different groups. Further trials with ferrets, hamsters and non human primates were performed revealing different success in their individual usage. In this review we present the different animal models, summarize their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss the controversial results from different studies.

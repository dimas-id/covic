In this paper we report a case of an incarcerated hernia occurring through the peritoneal and muscular defect caused by a previous trocar insertion. The patient developed the hernia eight days after bilateral laparoscopic adnexectomy and presented small bowel obstruction signs. This hernia occurred despite correct closure of the internal oblique fascia. The patient was re-operated and exploratory laparoscopy confirmed the diagnosis. The hernia was reduced via a small extension of the previous incision, and the defect was repaired by separated stitches. This case shows that a trocar site hernia can appear despite correct closure of the fascia, which is poorly described except for obese patients. It suggests the need for careful closure of the abdominal wall including the peritoneum after a laparoscopic procedure. Trocar site hernia has to be considered in cases of post laparoscopic small bowel obstruction. We reviewed the literature and found no randomized control study concerning this problem: only reviews, retrospective studies, case reports and technical notes. These papers are discussed and compared with our case.

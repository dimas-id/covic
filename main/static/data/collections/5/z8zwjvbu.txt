Abstract RNA was extracted from the diseased brain of a case of human subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and analysed for the expression of measles-specific RNA. Measles virus-specific mRNAs were present, but the amount of matrix (M) protein mRNA was greatly reduced in comparison to lytically infected cells and phospho- (P) protein mRNA was hardly detectable whereas the level of the corresponding intermediate-sized (is-) RNA was greatly increased. RNA obtained from the human brain was also translated in vitro and measles virus nucleocapsid and P protein was produced. However, in marked contrast to control reactions M protein was not detected in the products formed by translation in vitro. These results indicate an impaired measles virus M protein mRNA synthesis in infected brain tissue.

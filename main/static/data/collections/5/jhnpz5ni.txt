BACKGROUND Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is commonly associated with morbid obesity. Laparoscopic fundoplication is a standard surgical treatment for GERD, and laparoscopic gastric bypass has been shown to effectively resolve GERD symptoms in the morbidly obese. We sought to compare the in-hospital outcomes of morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication for the treatment of GERD versus laparoscopic gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity and related conditions, including GERD, at U.S. academic medical centers. METHODS Using the "International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision" procedural and diagnoses codes for morbidly obese patients with GERD, we obtained data from the University HealthSystem Consortium database for all patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication or laparoscopic gastric bypass from October 2004 to December 2007 (n=27,264). The outcome measures included the patient demographics, length of stay, in-hospital overall complications, mortality, risk-adjusted mortality ratio (observed to expected mortality), and hospital costs. RESULTS Compared with the patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass, those who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication had a lower severity of illness score (P<.05). The overall in-hospital complications were significantly lower in the laparoscopic gastric bypass group (P<.05). The mean length of stay, observed mortality, risk-adjusted mortality, and hospital costs were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic gastric bypass is as safe as laparoscopic fundoplication for the treatment of GERD in the morbidly obese. Hence, morbidly obese patients with GERD should be referred for bariatric surgery evaluation and offered laparoscopic gastric bypass as a surgical option.

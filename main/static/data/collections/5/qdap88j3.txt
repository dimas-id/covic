The ongoing viral outbreak labeled COVID-19 is spreading rapidly across states and is posing a great threat to public health. Rapid identification of the virus in the population plays a crucial role in isolating the individual and breaking the transmission chain, apart from initiating an appropriate treatment procedure. Here, we discuss an electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology that uses a microprocessor-controlled electrode array to merge a possibly infected sample carried by a liquid drop with a drop of a reagent to carry out the testing process. Changes in color occurring during the mixing process of the drops are imaged using a camera.

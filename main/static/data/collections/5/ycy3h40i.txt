The diagnosis of asthma can be particularly difficult in young children, in whom wheezing is not always synonym with asthma. It is also difficult to predict which preschool children with wheeze will go on to be true asthmatics. In this chapter, we will characterize preschool wheezing and asthma and discuss early risk factors for the development of severe asthma. We will also review risk factors for severe acute wheezing in young children. Finally, we will describe the natural history and prognosis of wheezing and some of the attempts at early identification of children who will develop severe asthma.

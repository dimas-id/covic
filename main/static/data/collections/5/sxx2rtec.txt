OBJECTIVES Evaluation of the feasibility, safety and oncological validity of video-assisted thoracic lobectomy (VATS). The VATS study exclusion criteria included T3 or T4 tumours, central hilar tumours, tumours visible on bronchoscopy requiring sleeve resection, hilar lymphadenopathy, N2 disease, history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation, previous thoracic surgery or pleurodesis. METHODS A retrospective study of 410 patients (143 women, mean age 61.5 Â± 13.1 years (84-15) treated by VATS lobectomy between 1996 and 2011 was performed at our institution. VATS lobectomy was performed for lung cancer (n = 364, 88.9%), pulmonary metastasis (n = 25, 5.8%) and non-neoplastic diseases (n = 21, 5.1%). In lung cancer, a systematic radical lymph node dissection was performed. RESULTS There was no intraoperative death. The conversion rate was 6.1% (n = 25): bleeding (n = 4), extended pleural adhesion (n = 6, 1.4%), technical difficulty (n = 6, 1.4%), tumour extension to the fissure or mediastinum or adenopathy (n = 7, 1.7%) and intolerance to one-lung ventilation (n = 2, 0.4%). The postoperative mortality rate was 1.2% (n = 5). Major complications occurred in 21 patients (5.1%). The mean number of mediastinal nodes removed was 14.6 (5-44) and 42 patients (10.2%) presented N2 disease at the definitive staging. The mean operating time was 152 (85-315) min. The mean drainage duration was 3.2 days (1-15). Mean postoperative length of hospital stay before return at home was 6.8 days (3-75) and 5.5 days in patients without major complications. There was no port site recurrence. Kaplan-Meier 3-year survival rates were 76.5% for Stage I and 87.3% for Stage IA, 58% for Stage II and 61% for Stage III. CONCLUSIONS VATS lobectomy is an acceptable alternative and seems equivalent to open lobectomy in terms of complications and oncological value. Our experience prompts us to consider VATS lobectomy for early stage NSCLC as the first surgical approach in view of the improvement in outcome, provided that the procedure is performed by a surgeon with adequate experience with this approach.

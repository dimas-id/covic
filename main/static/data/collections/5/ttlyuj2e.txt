The extensive efforts around the globe are being made to develop a suitable vaccine against COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). An effective vaccine should be able to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies to prevent the virus from attaching to the host cell receptors. However, to elicit the protective levels of antibodies, a vaccine may require multiple doses or assistance from other immunostimulatory molecules. Further, the vaccine should be able to induce protective levels of antibodies rapidly with the least amount of antigen used. This decreases the cost of a vaccine and makes it affordable. As the pandemic has hit most countries across the globe, there will be an overwhelming demand for the vaccine in a quick time. Incorporating a suitable adjuvant in a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may address these requirements. This review paper will discuss the experimental results of the adjuvanted vaccine studies with similar coronaviruses (CoVs) which might be useful to select an appropriate adjuvant for a vaccine against rapidly emergingSARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the current progress in the development of adjuvanted vaccines against the disease.

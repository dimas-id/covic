Because SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has been found in the feces of confirmed COVID-19 patients, wastewater-based epidemiology might be an effective way to track the extent of the disease in a population Wastewater epidemiology is most commonly used to monitor drug usage in a community It can also provide information about the spread of infection when individual tests are limited A team led by Eric J Alm of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Biobot Analytics has now used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to measure SARS-CoV-2 in sewage from a wastewater treatment facility in Massachusetts (medRxiv 2020, DOI: 10 1101/2020 04 05 20051540) The Biobot team analyzed four samples taken before the first known US case of COVID-19, and all tested negative for the virus All 10 samples taken between March 18 and March 25 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, at levels higher than the researchers expected based on

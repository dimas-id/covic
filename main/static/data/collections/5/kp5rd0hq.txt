In light of today's COVID-19 crisis, it is argued that new ways to collaborate among all nations for pandemic preparedness may be the next big thing. A workable solution for pandemic preparedness requires leaders of all nations to be on the same page (all for one), aiming at a swift turnaround of the crisis in tandem that can only benefit everyone on a global scale (one for all). After all, a public health crisis of this magnitude involves all humankind, demanding not only the most sensible and intelligent adoption of progressive policies and innovative technology, but an effective balancing of emergency supply chain management (SCM) reserve of personal protective equipment (PPE), professional workers and/or other urgently needed resources (e.g., ICU beds) to save lives. Above all, accurate sharing of information and massive-scale testings vis-Ã -vis targeted isolations must be sustained. Notably, such a framework may not just be limited to infuenza. Here, the authors elaborate on several key strategies and aim to provide grounds for scientific innovations and clearer policy thinking across international boundaries to combat a global public health pandemic via a league of nations conceived as IPPO: Intercontinental Pandemic Preparedness Organization.

Abstract Nanocomposites based on Keggin-type polyoxometalate H5PV2Mo10O40 (POM) and porous bamboo charcoal (BC) were prepared by activation and immobilization processes. The physical properties of the BC/POM composites were examined using FTIR, UVâ€“Vis spectroscope, 31P MAS-NMR, SEM and TEM. These techniques indicated that the POM was intact on the surface of the BC matrix after impregnation. The POM particle size was found to be less than 150nm based on TEM. The antibacterial effects of the BC/POM composites were assessed from the zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and plate-counting method, and an excellent antibacterial performance was discovered.

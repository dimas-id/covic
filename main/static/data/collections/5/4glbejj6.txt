It has been hypothesised that antiallergic medications (AAMs) like montelukast and levocetirizine both the two bitter chloro compounds could be repurposed either alone or combinedly as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2, like chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ), anorher two bitter chloro compounds. Both AAMs and CQ/HCQ are bitter tasted chloro compounds. Depending on their these two similar physical properties and the safety and efficacy of AAMs by controlling over post viral episodes as comparing with viral inhibitory activities including SARS-CoV-2 by CQ/HCQ, a reposition of AAMs either alone/combinedly could be rationalised as an antiviral approach to nCoV.

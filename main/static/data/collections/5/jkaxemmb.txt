This chapter focuses on depression and stress-related conditions to discuss possible strategies for the prevention or early management of such conditions. Health education constitutes the first important strategy, and we outline a school-based educational activity using a case-method approach. We next illustrate the impact of stressful events on psychological health with the results of a survey among Chinese individuals conducted after an unexpected epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. Communication plays an important role in the assessment and management services provided by medical practitioners to sick individuals, with very diverse backgrounds and levels of medical knowledge, who consult health care providers with concerns about their health. In this context, we introduce a recent advance in patientâ€“doctor communication. Finally, we address the cognitive and behavioral features of those who suffer from depression and psychosocial stress. Based on our recent activities and on evidence pertaining to health promotion and education, we emphasize the importance of health education and communication in the prevention of stress-related diseases and the promotion of physical and psychological health.

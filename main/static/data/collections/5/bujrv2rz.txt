PURPOSE Recently, single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been popular in use with its progress studied for more minimally invasive surgery and cosmetic improvement. We investigated the feasibility and efficacy of SILS for appendectomy (SILS-A) in children and compare it with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (C-LA). METHODS We studied, retrospectively, adolescent patients who underwent C-LA or SILS-A. There were 25 patients in the C-LA group and 30 patients in the SILS-A group. The clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS The SILS-A procedures were performed successfully in adolescent patients . There were no significant difference between the C-LA and SILS-A group with respect to demographic data and post-operative outcomes. There was one complication (4%) in the C-LA group and two complications (6.6%) in the SILS-A group, but there was no significant difference. CONCLUSION SILS-A was technically feasible and safe in children. Considering little postoperative scar and no difference in post-operative outcomes compared to C-LA, SILA could be applicable in adolescent patients. Larger studies and further technical implements will be necessary to assess the true benefit of this approach.

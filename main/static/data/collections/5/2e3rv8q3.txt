The present review considered: (a) the factors that conditioned the early transition from non-life to life; (b) genome structure and complexity in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and organelles; (c) comparative human chromosome genomics; and (d) the Brazilian contribution to some of these studies. Understanding the dialectical conflict between freedom and organization is fundamental to give meaning to the patterns and processes of organic evolution.

Abstract For recovery from infection, the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) must eliminate or control virus replication without destroying nonrenewable, essential cells. Thus, upon intracellular virus detection, the infected cell must initiate clearance pathways without triggering neuronal cell death. As a result, the inflammatory response must be tightly regulated and unique mechanisms contribute to the immune response in the CNS. Early restriction of virus replication is accomplished by the innate immune response upon activation of pattern recognition receptors in resident cells. Infiltrating immune cells enter from the periphery to clear virus. Antibodies and interferon-Î³ are primary contributors to noncytolytic clearance of virus in the CNS. Lymphocytes are retained in the CNS after the acute phase of infection presumably to block reactivation of virus replication.

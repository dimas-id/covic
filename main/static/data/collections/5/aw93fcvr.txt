BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Despite rapid advances in the development of materials and techniques for endovascular intracranial aneurysm treatment, occlusion of large broad-neck aneurysms remains a challenge. Animal models featuring complex aneurysm architecture are needed to test endovascular innovations and train interventionalists. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven adult female New Zealand rabbits were assigned to 3 experimental groups. Complex bilobular, bisaccular, and broad-neck venous pouch aneurysms were surgically formed at an artificially created bifurcation of both CCAs. Three and 5 weeks postoperatively, the rabbits underwent 2D-DSA and CE-3D-MRA, respectively. RESULTS Mortality was 0%. We observed no neurologic, respiratory, or gastrointestinal complications. The aneurysm patency rate was 91% (1 aneurysm thrombosis). There was 1 postoperative aneurysm hemorrhage (9% morbidity). The mean aneurysm volumes were 176.9 ± 63.6 mm(3), 298.6 ± 75.2 mm(3), and 183.4 ± 72.4 mm(3) in bilobular, bisaccular, and broad-neck aneurysms, respectively. The mean operation time was 245 minutes (range, 175-290 minutes). An average of 27 ± 4 interrupted sutures (range, 21-32) were needed to create the aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of creating complex venous pouch bifurcation aneurysms in the rabbit with low morbidity, mortality, and high short-term aneurysm patency. The necks, domes, and volumes of the bilobular, bisaccular, and broad-neck aneurysms created are larger than those previously described. These new complex aneurysm formations are a promising tool for in vivo animal testing of new endovascular devices.

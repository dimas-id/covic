Bacillus subtilis is a widely distributed aerobic Gram-positive species of bacteria. As a tool in the lab, it has the advantages of nonpathogenicity and limited likelihood of becoming drug resistant. It is a probiotic strain that can be directly used in humans and animals. It can be induced to produce spores under nutrient deficiency or other adverse conditions. B. subtilis spores have unique physical, chemical, and biochemical characteristics. Expression of heterologous antigens or proteins on the surface of B. subtilis spores has been successfully performed for over a decade. As an update and supplement to previously published research, this paper reviews the latest research on spore surface display technology using B. subtilis. We have mainly focused on the regulation of spore coat protein expression, display and application of exogenous proteins, and identification of developing research areas of spore surface display technology.

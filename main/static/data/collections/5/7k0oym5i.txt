We implemented a pilot home HIV self-testing program one week after a stay-home order for SARS-CoV2 was enacted in Oregon. We advertised the program on a geospatial networking app and community partner websites targeting men who have sex with men; nine percent of web visits resulted in an order. Over 70% of the kits initially allotted to the program were ordered in the first 24 h of launch. One-third of participants had never tested for HIV. We found enthusiasm for discreet, free, home-based testing and uncovered an unmet need for HIV testing as clinical and outreach programs shuttered in Oregon.

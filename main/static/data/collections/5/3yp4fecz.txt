Abstract Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and in much of the Westernized World, contributing to considerable morbidity. Several of these obesity-related morbidities are associated with greater risk of death with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) penetrates human cells through direct binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors on the cell surface. ACE2 expression in adipose tissue is higher than that in lung tissue, which means that adipose tissue may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Obese patients also have worse outcomes with COVID-19, including respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. Clinicians need to be more aggressive when treating obese, especially severely obese, patients with COVID-19.

Background: The outbreak caused by SARS CoV-2 of the recent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been marked as a public health concern with a significant mortality at the global level. Lignocaine a common anesthetic agent being used for pain free surgeries for over a long period of time has expressed extensive characteristic of being an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, direct spasmolytic, ion channel blocking and repolarization agent. We did a literature review Methodology: Currently compiled over-view has for the first time evaluated the probable curative and therapeutic role of nebulized lignocaine drug against SARS CoV-2 by utilization of PubMed, MEDLINE, NHS Evidence and Web of Science databases. Results: With evidence of nebulized lignocaine being used successfully in respiratory illness before and the established role of low concentration lignocaine as ion channel repolarization agent, we try to interpret and deduce the possible implication of nebulized lignocaine as possible therapeutic agent and a potential cure against SARS-CoV-2 caused respiratory illness by acting as an anti-inflammatory agent during SARS-CoV-2 caused acute lung injury and also possibly as an antiviral drug. Conclusion: By the virtue of possessing anti-inflammatory effect and potential antiviral effects, nebulized lignocaine can be a breakthrough in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

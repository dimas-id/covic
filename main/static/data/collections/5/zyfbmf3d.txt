Viral infections of the respiratory system represent one of the most important complications in hematological patients in terms of both the severity of the clinical picture and its related impact on the duration of hospitalization, and of mortality. The most implicated viruses are those that commonly cause community-based respiratory diseases: respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza virus and rhinovirus. However, in some cases the clinical picture may be triggered by first infection with or reactivation of pathogens normally not responsible for clinically relevant diseases in immunocompetent subjects. This issue is currently being taken into greater consideration within the scientific community. However, the strong heterogeneity in the epidemiology and clinical expression of these infections and the lack of adequate therapeutic options imply that there is currently no uniform consensus on the best management of these patients. The main purpose of this review is to highlight which viruses are currently most implicated in the onset of these infections, what is their incidence in so heterogeneous and fragile patients and the factors that lead to disease's onset and evolution. Possible or available clinical management options, diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and preventive and prophylaxis measures are also discussed.

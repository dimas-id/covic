INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of non-emergent surgeries throughout New York. Our tertiary care children's hospital pivoted towards a trial of non-operative management (NOM) for all patients presenting with acute appendicitis to limit operating room use. We describe our pandemic-based NOM strategy for appendicitis, with expanded inclusion criteria and limited intravenous antibiotics. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children treated for acute appendicitis at our center from 3/31/2020â€“5/3/2020 during the peak of the New York pandemic. We compared appendicitis volume to similar months in prior years. We evaluated failure of NOM, length of stay, and compared characteristics of children we successfully treated with our expanded NOM protocol to previously published inclusion criteria for NOM. RESULTS: 45.5% of children (25/55) with acute appendicitis underwent NOM. Of the 30 who underwent surgery, 13 had complicated appendicitis while 17 had simple appendicitis. Three patients were COVID-positive, although none had respiratory symptoms. The majority of patients presenting with acute appendicitis (78.2%) did not meet previously published criteria for NOM. CONCLUSIONS: We treated a similar volume of children with acute appendicitis during the pandemic compared to prior years. We applied NOM to nearly half of patients, even as we expanded published inclusion criteria to minimize operative resources. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective study, level of evidence: IV.

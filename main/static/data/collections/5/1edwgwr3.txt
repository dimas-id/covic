This report presents a series of five patients unsuitable for surgery who had nonretrievable self-expanding metallic stents deployed along the cystic duct as treatment for benign and malignant causes of gallbladder obstruction. Techniques are described for draining cholecystitis, removing gallstones, bypassing gallbladder obstructions, and inserting metallic stents across the cystic duct to restore permanent antegrade gallbladder drainage in acute and chronic cholecystitis. Symptoms resolved in all cases, and stents remained patent for as long as 22 months. This procedure may be an effective alternative to cholecystectomy or long-term gallbladder drainage for patients in inoperable condition.

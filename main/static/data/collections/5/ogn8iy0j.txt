Enhancing cellulase production in Trichoderma reesei is of great interest for an economical biorefinery. Artificial transcription factors are a potentially powerful molecular strategy for improving cellulase production in T. reesei. In this study, enhanced transcriptional activators XYR1VP, ACE2VP, and ACE1VP were constructed by linking the C terminus of XYR1, ACE2, or ACE1 with an activation domain of herpes simplex virus protein VP16. T. reesei transformants T(XYR1VP), T(ACE2VP), and T(ACE1VP) showed improved cellulase and/or xylanase production. T(XYR1VP) has a cellulase-free phenotype but with significantly elevated xylanase production. Xylanase I and xylanase II activities [U/(mg biomass)] increased by 51% and 80%, respectively, in T(XYR1VP) in comparison with parental strain RUT C30. The filter paper activity of T(ACE2VP) in the Avicel-based medium increased by 52% compared to that of RUT C30. In the Avicel-based medium, T(ACE1VP) manifested an 80% increase in FPase activity and a 50% increase in xylanase activity as compared to those of RUT C30. Additionally, when pretreated corn stover was hydrolyzed, crude enzymes produced from T(ACE1VP) yielded a greater glucose release than did the enzymes produced by parental strain RUT C30.

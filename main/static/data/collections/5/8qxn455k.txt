Since the initial description in 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 infection (COVID-19) pandemic has swept the globe. The most severe form of the disease presents with fever and shortness of breath, which rapidly deteriorates to respiratory failure and acute lung injury (ALI). COVID-19 also presents with a severe coagulopathy with a high rate of venous thromboembiolism. In addition, autopsy studies have revealed co-localized thrombosis and inflammation, which is the signature of thromboinflammation, within the pulmonary capillary vasculature. While the majority of published data is on adult patients, there are parallels to pediatric patients. In our experience as a COVID-19 epicenter, children and young adults do develop both the coagulopathy and the ALI of COVID-19. This review will discuss COVID-19 ALI from a hematological perspective with discussion of the distinct aspects of coagulation that are apparent in COVID-19. Current and potential interventions targeting the multiple thromboinflammatory mechanisms will be discussed.

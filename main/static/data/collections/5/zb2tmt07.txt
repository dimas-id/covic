Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has a specific morbidity profile in which gastric leak (GL) is the main complication. With a view to defining a standardized protocol for GL management, the present retrospective study sought to describe the clinical patterns of post-LSG GL and treatment of the latter in our university medical center. From July 2004 to December 2010, 25 patients were included. GL was described in terms of clinical presentation, time to onset, and location in the staple line. Treatment of GL with pharmacologic, radiologic, endoscopic, and/or surgical procedures was always validated by a multidisciplinary care team. "Treatment success" was defined as the absence of contrast agent leakage on CT and endoscopy after removal of covered metallic stent or pigtail drains. Systemic inflammation and peritonitis were the main signs for early-onset GL (56%), whereas pulmonary symptoms and intra-abdominal abscesses revealed delayed-onset GL (44%). Surgery was always performed for early-onset GL. In the total study population, the median number of endoscopic procedures was five (range, 1-11) per patient, of covered SEMS was three (range, 1-8), and of pigtail drains was three (range, 1-4). Nine (36%) patients presented endoscopic-related complications. Four (16%) patients with treatment failure underwent radical surgery. The mortality rate was 4% (n = 1). The management of post-LSG GL is challenging. Surgery was always performed for early-onset GL, whereas treatment of delayed-onset GL was based on endoscopy. Pigtail drains required fewer procedures per patient, were better tolerated, and had lower morbidity-mortality than covered SEMS.

This study uses qualitative interviews with leaders of 34 mental health clinics in the context of a statewide rollout of clinical and business innovations to explore how clinics first learn about innovations and which external sources of information they access. Clinic leaders reported accessing information about innovations mainly from government agencies, professional associations, peer organizations, and research literature. Leaders mentioned an average of two external sources of information. There was evidence of variation in how leaders accessed information and how information about innovations was communicated within clinics. Findings have implications for improving dissemination of information about innovations in mental health systems.

Despite recent advances, our knowledge of potential and rare human pathogens is far from exhaustive. Current molecular diagnostic tools mainly rely on the specific amplification of marker sequences and may overlook infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; but, due to the extremely low fraction of pathogen genetic material in clinical samples, its application is only cost-effective in special, rather than routine, cases. In this study, we present a method for the semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in a HTS library by hybridization in solution with genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Moreover, enterovirus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Enterovirus) sequences were successfully enriched using foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Aphthovirus) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to the background nucleic acid was about 1,000-fold. As hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide match requirements than PCR, few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover the potential sequence variation in the whole genus and may even enrich nucleic acids of viruses of other related genera. Efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes its use in diagnostics cost-efficient.

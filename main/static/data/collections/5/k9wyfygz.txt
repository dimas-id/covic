Whether gender influences the outcome of severe sepsis remains a matter of debate. Because many confounding variables may affect observed associations between gender and mortality, high-quality statistical analyses are essential to carefully adjust the two groups of patients. About 55% to 65% of patients with sepsis have chronic co-morbidities associated with immune dysfunction (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, and alcohol abuse), which increase the susceptibility to sepsis [1]. Genetic polymorphisms that affect the susceptibility to infection and/or the severity of the systemic response to infection [2] may lead to variability among individuals and between males and females [3]. Access to healthcare, another determinant of the incidence and outcome of sepsis, varies according to age, ethnic group, and gender, although a recent study conducted in the USA found only relatively small quality-of-care differences between males and females or across income groups compared to the gap for each subgroup between observed and desirable quality of health care [4]. Here, we review the data on the existence of, and reasons for, associations between gender and outcome of severe sepsis (Fig. 1).

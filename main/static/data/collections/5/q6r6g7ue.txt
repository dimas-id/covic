PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our goal is to provide a review of the impact, global estimates, and projection of vision impairment as well as ongoing systems for eye care delivery. RECENT FINDINGS: Many of the blinding diseases in developing countries are preventable or curable, but the lack of ophthalmologists, the lack of education, and the lack of access to any eye care are some of the major obstacles encountered. SUMMARY: As our world becomes more interconnected through globalization, the interactions between different cultures and populations increase. Global ophthalmology is a field dedicated to building sustainable eye care delivery systems to deliver high-quality care in minimal resource settings, with the aim of reducing blindness around the world.

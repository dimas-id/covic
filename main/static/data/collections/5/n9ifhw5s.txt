Most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in pediatric patients are mild or asymptomatic. However, infants have emerged at higher risk of hospitalization and severe outcomes in pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case series of four full term neonates hospitalized with fever and found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection with a spectrum of illness severities. Two neonates required admission to the intensive care unit for respiratory insufficiency and end organ involvement. Half of the patients were found to have a co-infection. One neonate received antiviral therapy with remdesivir and is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient to receive this drug for COVID-19. All neonates had favorable outcomes.

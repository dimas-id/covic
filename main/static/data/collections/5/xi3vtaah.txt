OBJECTIVE High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy is increasingly used in preterm infants despite a paucity of physiological studies. We aimed to investigate the effects of HFNC on respiratory physiology. STUDY DESIGN A prospective randomised crossover study was performed enrolling clinically stable preterm infants receiving either HFNC or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). Infants in three current weight groups were studied: <1000 g, 1000-1500 g and >1500 g. Infants were randomised to either first receive HFNC flows 8-2 L/min and then nCPAP 6 cm H2O or nCPAP first and then HFNC flows 8-2 L/min. Nasopharyngeal end-expiratory airway pressure (pEEP), tidal volume, dead space washout by nasopharyngeal end-expiratory CO2 (pEECO2), oxygen saturation and vital signs were measured. RESULTS A total of 44 preterm infants, birth weights 500-1900 g, were studied. Increasing flows from 2 to 8 L/min significantly increased pEEP (mean 2.3-6.1 cm H2O) and reduced pEECO2 (mean 2.3%-0.9%). Tidal volume and transcutaneous CO2 were unchanged. Significant differences were seen between pEEP generated in open and closed mouth states across all HFNC flows (difference 0.6-2.3 cm H2O). Infants weighing <1000 g received higher pEEP at the same HFNC flow than infants weighing >1000 g. Variability of pEEP generated at HFNC flows of 6-8 L/min was greater than nCPAP (2.4-13.5 vs 3.5-9.9 cm H2O). CONCLUSIONS HFNC therapy produces clinically significant pEEP with large variability at higher flow rates. Highest pressures were observed in infants weighing <1000 g. Flow, weight and mouth position are all important determinants of pressures generated. Reductions in pEECO2 support HFNC's role in dead space washout.

Introduction. Laparotomy in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with an increased risk of morbidity. Furthermore, standard protocol recommends removal of the PD catheter when surgery on the intestine is required. As far as we are aware, this is the first case report of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in a patient on automated PD where the PD catheter was left in situ. Case Report. A 61-year-old man man on APD who presented with a caecal carcinoma was stabilised on temporary haemodialysis (HD) prior to undergoing a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy without removal of the PD catheter. He made an uneventful recovery and APD was resumed successfully 2 weeks after surgery. Discussion. PD patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery are at increased risk of complications. While the benefits of laparoscopic surgery in the standard surgical population are well established, there is limited experience of the technique in PD patients. Possible advantages could theoretically be early resumption of PD as well as less PD failure due to the formation of adhesions. Conclusion. Our experience with this case indicates that laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in a background of PD can be undertaken without removal of the PD catheter and is associated with early resumption of PD.

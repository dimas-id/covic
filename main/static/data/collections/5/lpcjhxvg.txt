Abstract Background Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as PCR, are preferred for respiratory virus testing, due to superior diagnostic accuracy and faster turnaround time. Panther Fusion® Respiratory Assays (Fusion), which includes FluA/B/RSV (FFABR), Paraflu and AdV/hMPV/RV, offers a modular approach to syndromic testing on a fully automated platform while improving gene targets and expanding the test menu. Objectives and study design We evaluated Fusion using 275 consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens previously used in an analysis of five PCRs, as well as 225 archived specimens. Results Of the combined 500 specimens, 134 were positive for influenza A (FluA), 54 for FluB, 65 for RSV, 64 for parainfluenza (PIV), 24 for adenovirus (AdV), 21 for humanmetapneumovirus (hMPV), and 40 for rhinovirus (RV) with Fusion. Of the positive samples Fusion correlated with historical results for all but one, despite multiple freeze-thaws cycles of this collection. Fusion was positive for an additional 33 samples, including 11 FluAs, 7 RSVs, 3 PIV3s, 3 AdV, 6 hMPV and 3 RVs. These samples were retested with corresponding Prodesse (Pro) assays using quadruple sample volume. This resolver test confirmed Fusion results for an additional 4 FluAs, 4 RSVs, 1 PIV3 and 3 AdVs. The sensitivity and specificity ranges of Fusion were 99–100% and 98–100%. Limit of detection (LOD) analyses were performed on a variety of Flu isolates. The LODs ranged from 2.69 to 2.99 log copies/ml and demonstrated superior LOD as compared to previously published data for some assays or to concurrent analyses with two new commercial tests.

Abstract Due to an increasing global awareness of the need for sustainable development in academia and business, closed-loop supply chains in hospitals have become an important area of focus. Process reengineering in purchasing, materials management, work practices, and waste management can reduce environmental hazards and contain costs at the healthcare facilities. This paper demonstrates an application of the RFID-enabled process reengineering in sustainable healthcare system design, and presents a case study in the linens division of central sterilization services department at a Singaporean hospital using ARENA simulation.

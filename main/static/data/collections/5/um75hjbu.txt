The infection of the novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China in December 2019 converted rapidly into a pandemic by March 11, 2020. Whereas the infection mortality rate is not completely understood, it seems to be significantly beyond that of other recent pandemics (e.g., H1N1 pandemic). This paper discusses moral injury in the context of disaster and epidemic and how easily the moral psychology of individuals and society can be shaken. Moral injury is a multiscientific concept involving psychology, culture, and religion. Amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, immoral behaviors and events such as violence, injury, and illness have also caused different degrees of impact on the moral standards of individuals, confusing moral cognition, destroying moral emotion, and weakening moral toughness, resulting in varying degrees of moral injury. If there is no national health, there will be no positive society for all. Based on this, the public needs to pay close attention to the moral health of the whole people and effectively avoid the occurrence of moral injury.

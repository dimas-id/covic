PURPOSE Surgical site infections (SSI) are a common complication of gastrointestinal tract surgery. In this study, we explored the correlation between the anastomosis method and the incidence of SSI. METHODS A total of 110 patients underwent ileocecal resection or right hemicolectomy for the excision of colon cancer. Two methods (open and closed, 28 and 82 patients, respectively) of functional end-to-end anastomosis were adopted. RESULTS Increased perioperative blood loss (p = 0.029214), a longer hospital stay (p = 0.026668) and the development of SSI (p = 0.000181) were significantly correlated with the open method. There was no correlation between SSI and the body mass index, or between SSI and the length of the surgery or diabetes mellitus. However, patients that developed SSI tended to be obese. CONCLUSION The open method was associated with a higher incidence of SSI. Therefore, it is necessary to consider potential contamination of the surgical field at the time of anastomosis to reduce the incidence of SSI.

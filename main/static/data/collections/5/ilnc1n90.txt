Abstract Context The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China and has now spread worldwide. In the affected countries, physicians and nurses are under heavy workload conditions and are at high risk of infection. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of burnout between physicians and nurses on the front line and those working in usual wards. Methods A survey with 49 questions total was administered to 220 medical staff members from the COVID-19 front lines and usual wards, with a ratio of 1:1. General information such as age, gender, marriage status, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Medical Personnel (MBI), were gathered and compared. Results The group working on the front lines had a lower frequency of burnout (13% versus 39%, P < .0001), and were less worried about being infected compared to the usual ward group. Conclusion Compared to medical staff working on their usual wards for uninfected patients, medical staff working on the COVID-19 front line had a lower frequency of burnout. These results suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, both front line and usual ward staff should be considered when policies and procedures to support the well-being of health care workers are devised.

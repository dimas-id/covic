Clinical application of molecular technologies to elucidate, diagnose, and monitor human diseases is referred to as molecular diagnosis. It is a broader term than DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) diagnostics and refers to the use of technologies that use DNA, RNA (ribonucleic acid), genes, or proteins as bases for diagnostic tests. The scope of the subject is much wider and includes in vivo imaging and diagnosis at the single-molecule level. A more detailed description of molecular diagnostics is presented elsewhere (Jain 2012a).

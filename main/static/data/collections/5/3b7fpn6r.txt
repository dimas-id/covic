There are an increased number of pulmonary nodules discovered on CT scan images in part due to those performed for lung cancer screening. Risk stratification and patient involvement is critical in determining management ranging from interval imaging to invasive biopsy or surgery. A definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy. The choice of a particular biopsy technique depends on the risks/benefits of the procedure, the diagnostic yield and local expertise. This review will focus on the evaluation and management of pulmonary nodules based on the Fleischner Society and American College of Chest Physician guidelines. There have been recent changes to both societies' recommendations for incidental detection of solid and subsolid nodules, risk stratification, imaging, minimally invasive diagnostic techniques and definitive surgical options.

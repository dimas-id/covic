In order to construct a recombinant Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) expressing the spike glycoprotein of Canine coronavirus (CCV), the S1 gene fragment of CCV strain DXMV, encoding major antigenic region A, B, C and D of S protein, was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pVAX1 vector. The complete S1 expression cassette was subcloned into the shuttle vector pVAXE3, then further cloned into the backbone vector pPoly2-CAV2 containing complete genome of CAV-2. To gain the recombinant Canine adenovirus, the recombinant plasmid pCAV-2-CCV-S1 was linearized by Cla I/Asc I to release recombinant genome, and then transfected into MDCK cell. The recombinant virus CAV-2-S1 was gained through 4 passages in MDCK, which showed classical CPE of CAV-2. The expressed S1 protein of CCV, which was identified by RT-PCR and Western blot, can be specifically recognized by polyclonal antibody against CCV. The immunization in dogs indicated that the recombinant CAV-2 could effectively induce the specific antibodies against CCV and CAV.

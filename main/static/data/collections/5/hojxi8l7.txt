This manuscript aims to highlight the risk of Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia (VAP) in COVID-19 inpatients. The co-infection has the potential to worsen clinical condition and increase mortality in these patients, as well as to prolong and increase the costs of hospitalization. Preventing, identifying and treating early VAP can increase the chances of successful treatment in patients with COVID-19.

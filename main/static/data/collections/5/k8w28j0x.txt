Achieving accurate inframammary fold (IMF) position and definition during breast reconstruction is a critical step toward obtaining optimal aesthetic outcomes. This article presents a simple technique for IMF reconstruction after implant-based breast reconstruction with an internal running, barbed suture. The results of this technique are retrospectively reviewed in 45 patients, with only 2 patients requiring additional procedures to adjust IMF position for a total revision rate of 4.4%. There have been neither instances of permanent contour deformity due to suture placement nor any instances of suture extrusion through the skin. Thus, this technique appears to be safe and effective and should be considered when surgeons are faced with an IMF asymmetry.

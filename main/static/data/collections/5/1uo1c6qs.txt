BACKGROUND Laparoscopic groin hernia repair is an increasingly common procedure with benefits of reduced post-operative pain and infection. Post-operative chronic pain remains an ongoing concern in about 10% of patients. Parietex ProGripâ„¢, a polyester self-gripping mesh, has a theoretical benefit of avoiding tacks for mesh-fixation. This case series reflects our long-term experience of this technique. METHODS We conducted a retrospective case series from November 2011 to December 2017. Patients were identified through an operative Medicare Benefits Schedule item number search. Clinical documentation was reviewed with length of stay, mesh infection, chronic pain, recurrence and re-operation as primary data points. RESULTS A total of 514 patients underwent 780 laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs with self-gripping polyester mesh during this period. There were 53 female (10.3%) and 461 male patients (89.7%). Unilateral hernia repair was performed in 248 patients (48.2%) and bilateral repair in 266 patients (51.8%). Almost all repairs (779, 99.8%) were primary hernias. There were no mesh infections. Four recurrences were noted (0.51%) and three of these subsequently underwent open redo-hernia repairs (0.38%). Post-operative follow-up was up to 4.4 years. CONCLUSIONS Our series of laparoscopic groin hernia repair with self-gripping mesh demonstrate this is a safe and reliable mesh and effective technique with low recurrence rates.

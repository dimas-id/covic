Lockdown due to the COVID‐19 pandemic doesn't necessarily result in an across‐the‐board increase in alcohol consumption, according to research commissioned by Alcohol Change UK and released last month. The study found that 21% of adults who drink alcohol are drinking more often since the March 23 lockdown began in England, but that 35% reduced their frequency of consumption or stopped drinking altogether. Of those surveyed, 6% of previous drinkers chose to stop drinking altogether during lockdown. The study, a representative survey of more than 2,000 people, extrapolates to 8.6 million adults in the United Kingdom drinking more frequently since lockdown, while 14 million are drinking less often or have stopped drinking entirely. In addition, many people are seeking help based on visits to the “Get help now” section of Alcohol Change UK's website increasing 355% between March 23 and April 13, compared to the same period last year.

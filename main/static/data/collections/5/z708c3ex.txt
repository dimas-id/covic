Numerous drugs are being investigated for the treatment of COVID‐19, including antivirals and therapies targeting complications related to COVID‐19. The clinical presentation of COVID‐19 varies from mild fever, cough, and dyspnea in the early stages of disease to severe complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic hyperinflammation, and sepsis. A thorough understanding of the disease pathogenesis and the disease complications is essential to developing effective therapies to treat this potentially life‐threatening disease. This review offers key clinical pharmacology considerations involved in the development of small molecules for the treatment of COVID‐19. They are based on the major observed disease complications that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. We also address considerations regarding potential drug interactions, alternative routes and methods of administration, and dosing in patients on hemodialysis.

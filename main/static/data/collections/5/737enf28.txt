Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public is currently living through a collective continuous traumatic stressor. Objective risk levels shift with each new piece of data regarding the coronavirus. These data points are communicated through public health officials and the media, easily accessible through modern advanced technology including online news and push notifications. When objective risk changes, individuals must reappraise their subject risk levels. Updating subjective risk levels several times per week is linked to ambiguity of the situation and uncertainty in daily life. The uncertainty and potential feelings of uncontrollability is linked to heightened anxiety. The continuous stress, anxiety, and uncertainty may have several negative downstream mental and physical health effects nationwide. The health care sector must begin preparing for the long-term consequences of the pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

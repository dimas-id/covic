QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel V2 (RP) is a novel molecular-method-based syndromic test for the simultaneous and rapid (âˆ¼70-min) detection of 18 viral and 3 bacterial pathogens causing respiratory infections. This report describes the first multicenter retrospective comparison of the performance of the QIAstat-Dx RP assay to the established ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) assay, for which we used 287 respiratory samples from patients suspected with respiratory infections. The QIAstat-Dx RP assay detected 312 (92%) of the 338 respiratory targets that were detected by the ePlex RPP assay. Most of the discrepant results have been observed in the low-pathogen-load samples. In addition, the QIAstat-Dx RP assay detected 19 additional targets in 19 respiratory samples that were not detected by the ePlex RPP assay. Nine of these discordant targets were considered to represent true positives after discrepancy testing by a third method. The main advantage of the QIAstat-Dx system compared to other syndromic testing systems, including the ePlex RPP assay, is the ability to generate cycle threshold (C(T)) values, which could help with the interpretation of results. Taking the data together, this study showed good performance of the QIAstat-Dx RP assay in comparison to the ePlex RPP assay for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The QIAstat-Dx RP assay offers a new, rapid, and accurate sample-to-answer multiplex panel for the detection of the most common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens and therefore has the potential to direct appropriate therapy and infection control precautions.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide as of May 2020. Healthcare providers are at increased risks of infection when caring for patients with COVID-19. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. However, there is growing evidence for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to direct droplet spread and indirect contact. Here, we report on the design, construction, and testing of the BADGER (Box for Aerosol and Droplet Guarding and Evacuation in Respiratory Infection), an affordable, scalable device that can contain droplets and aerosol particles. The BADGER has multiple hand-ports for healthcare providers to perform essential tasks on a patient's airway and head. A semi-sealed environment is created inside the BADGER, which maintains at least twelve-air changes per hour using in-wall vacuum suction. Qualitative testing demonstrates that under conditions typical of non-invasive supplemental oxygen treatment, the BADGER can contain nebulized denatonium benzoate and smoke. Quantitative aerosol testing shows more than 90% containment of sub-micrometer aerosolized particles. Overall, the BADGER has the potential to contain large droplets and small airborne particles, and to provide an additional layer of protection for healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients.

Abstract Objective To identify cell types in the male and female reproductive systems at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to expression of host genes and proteins used by the virus for cell entry. Design Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. Setting Academic research department and clinical diagnostic laboratory. Patients/Animals None. Focused on previously generated gene and protein expression data. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Identification of cell types co-expressing the key ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes and proteins, as well as other candidates potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Results Based on single cell RNA sequencing data, co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not detected in testicular cells, including sperm. A subpopulation of oocytes in non-human primate ovarian tissue were found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but co-expression was not observed in ovarian somatic cells. RNA expression of TMPRSS2 in 18 samples of human cumulus cells was shown to be low or absent. There was general agreement between publicly available bulk RNA and protein datasets in terms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression patterns in testis, ovary, endometrial and placental cells. Conclusion These analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is unlikely to have long-term effects on male and female reproductive function. While the results cannot be considered definitive they imply that procedures in which oocytes are collected and fertilized in vitro are associated with very little risk of viral transmission from gametes to embryos and may indeed have the potential to minimize exposure of susceptible reproductive cell types to infection when compared to natural conception.

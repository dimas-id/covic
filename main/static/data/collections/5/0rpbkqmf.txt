BACKGROUND AND AIMS Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) currently serves as a surrogate for portal pressure measurement but has many limitations. We developed a novel technique for rapid and direct portal pressure measurements using a digital pressure wire delivered through an EUS-guided 22-gauge FNA needle. Our aims were to evaluate (1) the short-term safety and technical feasibility, (2) procedural duration and subjective workload assessment, and (3) accuracy compared with a transjugular criterion standard approach. METHODS The subjects were Yorkshire pigs, weighing 40 to 55 kg. The portal vein was identified by using a linear array echoendoscope and accessed with a commercially available 22-gauge FNA needle preloaded with a digital pressure wire. Access was confirmed by portal venography. Mean digital pressure measurements were recorded over 30 to 60 seconds, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index was scored. The control measurements were conventional transjugular catheterization with a balloon occlusion catheter to obtain free and wedged hepatic pressures, with subsequent HVPG calculation. RESULTS The total time required for EUS identification and needle access of the portal vein, venography, and digital pressure measurement was less than 5 minutes in 5 of 5 pigs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores revealed a low subjective workload. Baseline portal pressure measurements via EUS ranged from 5 mm Hg to 10 mm Hg (mean, 6.4 mm Hg). HVPG measurements were consistently Â±1 mm Hg of portal pressure. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first report of direct EUS-guided portal pressure measurements by using a digital pressure wire. This method is routinely performed in minutes and provides real-time pressure tracings via wireless transmission. This novel approach for direct portal pressure measurement has the potential to replace traditional indirect HVPG measurements.

New technologies for vaccine development and infectious disease diagnosis are likely to be introduced in the near future. With this new technology comes the opportunity to vaccinate companion animals against even more infectious agents than is currently practiced in the United States. As we look forward, it becomes particularly important to review current vaccination standards applied to dogs with respect to current knowledge of duration of immunity, awareness of incidence, and likelihood of injurious or even fatal adverse events associated with vaccination, and individual risk factors that dictate which vaccines are most appropriate at which stage of life.

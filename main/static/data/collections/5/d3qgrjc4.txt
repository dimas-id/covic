INTRODUCTION: Presently the COVID-19 pandemic is raging through the United States and worldwide. This enigmatic virus characteristically affects the respiratory system. Atypical presentations, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, and cases of encephalopathy have also been reported. However, psychiatric symptoms as the initial presenting feature is novel. We describe one such case. CASE PRESENTATION: 53-year-old man with no prior psychiatric or significant medical history was brought to the emergency department after ingesting bleach in an apparent suicide attempt. On initial presentation, the patient was uncooperative and withdrawn, though alert and oriented. He subsequently developed fever, tachycardia, elevated blood urea nitrogen and transaminases. SARS CoV-2 was confirmed on RT-PCR. Neurological examination was non-contributory. As his clinical condition improved, the patient reported that his initial symptom was an auditory hallucination telling him to jump from a bridge or ingest bleach. He reported that the increasing intensity of his auditory hallucinations led him to act upon it. He denied mood symptoms or suicidal ideation. The hallucinations did not recur during the hospital course, but he required 3 doses of antipsychotic medication for agitation. After improvement of his SARS CoV-2 infection, he was free of psychiatric symptoms and was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation center. CONCLUSION: This case indicates that what appears as a sudden onset of a psychiatric illness in the current context may be an initial manifestation of a developing COVID illness.

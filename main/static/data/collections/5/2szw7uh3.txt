Starting with the power law for the total number of infections during the middle stages of epidemics, we propose differential equations describing the process of momentum epidemic management, which is a set of measures aimed at reducing the epidemic spread via timely response to the dynamic of the number of infections. In the most aggressive mode, the saturation of the number of infections can be achieved sufficiently quickly. Our 2-phase formula matches very well the total numbers of infections for Covid-19 in many countries; modeling the first phase is based on Bessel functions. We discuss Austria, Germany, Japan, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the USA.

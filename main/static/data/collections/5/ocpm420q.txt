Acute bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is an extremely rare event in the natural history of cirrhosis. The treatment recommendations include portal pressure reduction strategies including pharmacotherapy with vasoactive agents and beta-blockers and interventional strategies such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. In this report, we present the case of a patient with cirrhosis in whom acute PHG-related bleed was managed with endoscopic band ligation, a therapeutic modality which has not been described in current literature. Our decision to re-purpose a technique for variceal bleeding stems from the fact that during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the technical assistance, resource availability, and sourcing of materials that were required for us to follow recommended management guidelines for acute PHG-related bleed was severely affected due to imposed lockdown between districts and states.

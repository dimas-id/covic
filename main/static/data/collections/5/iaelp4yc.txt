BACKGROUND AND AIMS Appendectomy is a common surgical procedure, but no overview of the long-term consequences exists. Our aim was to systematically review the long-term complications of appendectomy for acute appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017064662). The databases PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original reports on appendectomy with n â‰¥ 500 and follow-up >30 days. The surgical outcomes were ileus and incisional hernia; other outcomes were inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, fertility, and mortality. RESULTS We included 37 studies. The pooled estimate of the ileus prevalence was 1.0% over a follow-up period of 4.6 (range, 0.5-15) years. Regarding incisional hernia, we found a pooled estimate of 0.7% prevalence within a follow-up period of 6.5 (range, 1.9-10) years. Ulcerative colitis had a pooled estimate of 0.15% prevalence in the appendectomy group and 0.19% in controls. The opposite pattern was found regarding Crohn's disease with a pooled estimate of 0.20% prevalence in the appendectomy group and 0.12% in controls. No clear pattern was found regarding most of the examined cancers in appendectomy groups compared with background populations. Pregnancy rates increased after appendicitis compared with controls in most studies. Mortality was low after appendectomy. CONCLUSION Appendectomy had a low prevalence of long-term surgical complications. We did not find any significant other long-term complications, though the prevalence of Crohn's disease was higher and the prevalence of ulcerative colitis was lower after appendectomy than in controls. Appendectomy did not impair fertility.

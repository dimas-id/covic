BACKGROUND: So far, many studies have shown that Human Bocavirus ( HBoV) is the main pathogen of the respiratory tract. Until now, there is no study that proves the association between HBoV and hepatitis. HBoV viremia/DNAemia has been associated closely with acute primary infection and moderate-to-severe illness but, more detailed clinical data about HBoV dissemination are still unavailable. CASE REPORT: Here we report a 2-years-5-months-old girl suffering from respiratory distress and heptitis followed in our intensive care unit. HBoV was detected in our patients nose and throat swabs concurrent with whole blood sample by positive polymerase chain reactions. After a through investigation no causative agent other than HBoV viremia was found. CONCLUSION: Human Bocavirus viremia with high viral loads may be associated with hepatitis.

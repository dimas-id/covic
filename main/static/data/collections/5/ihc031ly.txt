Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) has been shown to have a capability to propagate via neural circuits to the central nervous system after peripheral inoculation, resulting in acute deadly encephalomyelitis in natural host piglets as well as in experimental younger rodents. This study has systematically examined the assembly and dissemination of HEV 67N in the primary motor cortex of infected rats and provides additional evidence indicating that membranous‐coating‐mediated endo‐/exocytosis can be used by HEV for its transsynaptic transfer. In addition, our results suggested that this transsynaptic pathway could adapted for larger granular materials, such as viruses. These findings should help in understanding the mechanisms underlying coronavirus infections as well as the intercellular exchanges occurring at the synaptic junctions. J. Comp.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic of 2019-2020 has resulted in multiple hospitalizations, deaths and economic hardships worldwide. Though respiratory involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is well-known, the potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular manifestations are less-understood. We performed a PubMed and Google Scholar search and reviewed relevant literature regarding COVID-19 and cardiovascular system involvement. SARS-CoV-2 possesses high-affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly concentrated in the lungs and cardiovascular tissue, thereby provoking concern for cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 cases. Pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease has been shown in previous reports to be a risk-factor for severe infection. Based on our review of published studies, COVID-19 patients may be more likely to experience acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, coagulation defects and acute stroke and are likely to have poorer outcomes as a result. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more data regarding potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease is required.

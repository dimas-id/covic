Abstract Immunity against viral infection is different from that for other infections. The virus utilizes the hostâ€™s immune mechanism for its survival and infection. Innate immune reaction is initially activated by conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, pattern recognition receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I, MDA5, LGP2, and toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3 and TLR7. Some important molecules responsible for viral infection include cytokines and chemokines. The current chapter includes the basic mechanism of action of immune-response genes and a list of important genes and their protein IDs. Chemokines include CCL19 and CCL21, and reactivate antiviral CCR7, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, a CC chemokine, and interleukin 8, an interferon-stimulated gene.

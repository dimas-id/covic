Although acute leukemias are infrequent diseases, they are highly malignant neoplasms responsible for a large number of cancer-related deaths. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia in adults, yet continues to have the lowest survival rate of all leukemias. While results of treatment have improved steadily in younger adults over the past 20 years, there have been limited changes in survival among individuals of age >60 years [1, 2].

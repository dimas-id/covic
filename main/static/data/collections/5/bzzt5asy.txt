Purpose To evaluate AngioJet-assisted transvenous portal vein (PV) thrombectomy for non-cirrhotic patients with total portal vein and mesenteric vein thrombosis (PVMVT). Material and methods From 2015 to 2016 four patients (3 male, mean 43.9 years, range 33-52 years) with acute (3 cases) and acute-on-chronic (1 case) PVMVT underwent transvenous thrombolysis. All patients received initial AngioJet (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) thrombectomy followed by continuous catheter directed thrombolysis with Urokinase (Medac, Wedel, Germany) for 22-52 hours. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), using Viatorr stent grafts (W.L. Gore and Associates, AZ, USA; mean diameter: 10 mm, length: 60-80 mm), were implanted in all patients. Patients were followed clinically and with imaging (mean 646 days, range 392 to 936 days). Results Technical success was 100%. Therapeutic success was achieved in 75% of cases. AngioJet-assisted thrombectomy substantially reduced thrombus load in the acute cases, while only slight improvement was achieved in the acute-on-chronic case. Continuous thrombolysis subtotally re-established PV flow in the acute cases, while only minimal improvement was seen in the acute-on-chronic case. Following TIPS implantation complete PV recanalisation could be achieved in all acute cases. In the acute-on-chronic case initial stagnant PV flow was seen; however, PV and TIPS re-occluded 10 days after implantation. During follow-up PV remained patent in acute cases. Conclusions AngioJet-assisted thrombectomy was technically feasible and uncomplicated in all of our patients. The initial results suggest that AngioJet-assisted thrombectomy facilitates recanalisation in acute and severe cases of PVMVT.

OBJECTIVE To probe into the mechanism on TCM treatment of infectious atypical pneumonia (severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS) and evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness. METHOD Twelve TCM prescriptions of herbal drugs (orally or i.v.) were used to treat 16 cases of SARS without using glucocorticoids, anti-viral agents, immune-regulators or antibiotics (in case there was no definite bacterial infections). The symptoms, signs, chest roentgenograms and lab examinations were carefully monitored and recorded for evaluation of the effectiveness. RESULTS The average fever abatement time was 4.44 +/- 1.46 days and the mean absorption time of gross pulmonary infiltration was 10.87 +/- 2.92 days. No exacerbation occurred during the treatment. CONCLUSION TCM intervention could effectively control and alleviate the symptoms and prevent the disease from exacerbation.

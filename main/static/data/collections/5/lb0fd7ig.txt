The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In response, governments have implemented measures to slow transmission through "social distancing." However, the practice of social distancing may depend on prevailing socioeconomic conditions and beliefs. Using 15-17 million anonymized cell phone records, we find that lower per capita income and greater Republican orientation were associated with significantly reduced social distancing among U.S. counties. These associations persisted after adjusting for county-level sociodemographic and labor market characteristics as well as state fixed effects. These results may help policymakers and health professionals identify communities that are most vulnerable to transmission and direct resources and communications accordingly.

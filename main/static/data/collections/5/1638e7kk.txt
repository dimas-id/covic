BACKGROUND Sub-total colectomy and restorative proctocolectomy with j-pouch ileo-anorectal anastomosis is the treatment of choice in children with ulcerative colitis uncontrolled with medical therapy. OBJECTIVE To present some technical considerations about children undergoing laparoscopic ileal-J-pouch anorectal anastomosis. SETTINGS AND PATIENTS All patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing laparoscopic ileal-J-pouch anorectal anastomosis were evaluated from January 2006 to February 2011. INTERVENTION The new technical innovations herein are (1) total laparoscopic approach, (2) a very short 3-cm J-pouch ileal reservoir created outside the stoma incision, (3) preservation of the entire anal canal and the Knight-Griffen double stapled anastomosis, less than 3 cm from the dentate line, (4) use of a Multiple Instrument Access Port system in the stoma skin incision to reduce the number of port site incisions and (5) proctectomy performed using only an electrosurgical vessels sealing device thus avoiding clips to close rectal pedicle. RESULTS Seventeen laparoscopic ileo J-pouch low rectal anastomosis were performed by the same surgical staff. Three complications occurred postoperatively: one bowel obstruction, one ileostomy prolapse, and one anastomotic stricture. Satisfactory functional results were achieved in all, there was no significant perineal excoriation and quality of life was excellent. CONCLUSIONS A Multiport Instrument Access Port placed in the stoma site allowed the use of more instruments through a single incision. The very short ileo J-pouch low rectal anastomosis has been shown to be a safe, feasible, and effective reconstructive procedure.

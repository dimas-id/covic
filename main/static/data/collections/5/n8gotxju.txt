TGN38 and TGN41 are isoforms of a monotopic integral membrane protein which recycles between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the cell surface, but which, at steady state, is predominantly located in the TGN. Full‐length and truncated versions of rat TGN38/41 have been expressed in monkey (COS) and human (Heb7a) cells under the control of the heavy metal inducible Metallothionein IIA promoter. This has allowed the regulated expression of TGN38/41 protein constructs to different levels in the transfected cells. These studies show that (i) controlled overexpression of TGN38/41 results in mislocalisation to parts of the endocytic pathway, (ii) a truncated version of TGN38/41, lacking the cytoplasmic domain, remains in the TGN, and (iii) there is a direct or indirect interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41 and γ‐adaptin.

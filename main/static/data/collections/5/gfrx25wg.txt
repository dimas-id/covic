BACKGROUND Elderly patients are often considered as a high-risk population for major abdominal surgery due to reduced functional reserve and increased comorbidities. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and curability of laparoscopic gastrectomy in elderly patients with gastric cancer compared with short- and long-term outcomes in non-elderly patients. METHODS We retrospectively investigated 386 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2007 and December 2015 at the Digestive Disease Center, Showa University, Northern Yokohama Hospital. We categorized the patients into two groups by age: the elderly patients (≥ 75 years old) and the non-elderly patients (< 74 years old). Patient characteristics, clinicopathologic and operative findings, and short- and long-term outcomes were investigated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS The elderly group showed a significantly higher rate of comorbidities (73.1 vs. 49.2%, P < 0.001), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores ≥ 2 (76.3 vs. 43.7%, P < 0.001), and using anticoagulant agents (25.8 vs. 7.9%, P < 0.001) than the non-elderly group. The postoperative morbidity and mortality did not differ between the two groups (19.4 vs. 18.8%; P = 0.880, 2.2 vs. 0%; P = 0.058). In the multivariate analysis, male sex was the only risk factor for postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic gastrectomy. However, age was not found to be a risk factor. The 5-year overall survival ratio was significantly lower in the elderly group than in the non-elderly group (67.7 vs. 85.0%; P < 0.001). However, the 5-year disease-specific survival ratio was similar in the two groups (84.8 vs. 89.1%; P = 0.071). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer could be safely performed in elderly patients with acceptable postoperative morbidity and curability.

ABSTRACT The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global health emergency and we need to know more about it.Patients with cardiovascular risk (CVD) and previous kidney risk have been identified as especially vulnerable for greater morbidity and mortality when they suffer from COVID-19. A considerable proportion of patients can develop a vascular lesion in the context of the disease that entails a greater lethality. Cardiovascular and renal complications represent a problem and, probably in the near future, may pose a threat to patients who have survived COVID-19.As physicians, we cannot forget that during an epidemic like this, other chronic diseases are present, and patients continue to require care. We are obliged to monitor even more intensely their treatments and control degree. Furthermore, we must not forget that urgent situations continue to arise in this pandemic situation and require prompt attention. In this current situation, it is very likely that many patients, out of fear, have not sought medical attention.The situation during the epidemic and the uncertainty of the post-COVID-19 period, requires intensification in the control and monitoring of CVD and kidney in our patients. Primary care constitutes a key level of care for the care of the population with CVD. Likewise, and in the face of this new health scenario, we need to promote the prevention and control measures that emanate from the studies currently underway. Now, more than ever, we need research, crucial to improve the cardiovascular and renal prognosis of our patients.

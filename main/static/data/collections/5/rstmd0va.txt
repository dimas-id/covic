Molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 is the mainstay for accurate diagnosis of the infection, but the diagnostic performances of available assays have not been defined. We compared 12 molecular diagnostic assays, including 8 commercial kits using 155 respiratory samples (65 nasopharyngeal swabs, 45 oropharyngeal swabs, and 45 sputum) collected at 2 Japanese hospitals. Sixty-eight samples were positive for more than one assay and one genetic locus and were defined as true positive samples. All the assays showed a specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 95.8 to 100). The N2 assay kit of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the N2 assay of the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) were the most sensitive assays with 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 94.7 to 100), followed by the CDC N1 kit, E assay by Corman, and NIID N2 assay multiplex with internal control reactions. These assays are reliable as first-line molecular assays in laboratories when combined with appropriate internal control reactions.

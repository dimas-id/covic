The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus, that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) threatens global health. Emerging evidence and past experience from other coronaviruses suggests that people with underlying liver disease including viral hepatitis could be at risk of disease severity and mortality. However, with the present relatively low screening rates for the most prevalent viral hepatitis – Hepatitis B and C, many COVID‐19 cases especially in low middle income countries are unlikely to be screened for viral hepatitis coinfection. Without active screening, little will be known about the clinical and epidemiological manifestations which could negatively impact public health efforts. In this commentary, we call for systematic and integrated screening of Hepatitis B and C for COVID‐19 confirmed patients. We also call for guidelines for management and treatment as well as research to understand the epidemiology of coinfection This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

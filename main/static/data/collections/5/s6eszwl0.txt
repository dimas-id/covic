OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper was to determine the effect of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) on working space in a porcine laparoscopy model. BACKGROUND Conflicting results on the effect of NMB on laparoscopic working space are found in literature. Almost all studies are limited by absence of objective assessment of working space or use surrogate outcomes. METHODS In a standardized porcine laparoscopy model, laparoscopic working-space dimensions with and without NMB were investigated in 16 animals using computed tomography at intra-abdominal pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg during multiple runs of abdominal insufflation. RESULTS No statistically significant effect of NMB on abdominal dimensions and laparoscopic working-space volume was found during CO2 pneumoperitoneum. In contrast, the effect of pre-stretching of the abdominal wall by a previous abdominal insufflation was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS This experimental study confirms the results from several clinical studies that NMB does not influence laparoscopic working space. Studies dealing with working space during laparoscopy should take note of pre-stretching bias.

The Solitaire stent is a self-expanding nitinol, fully retrievable stent that was originally designed for applications in cerebral circulation. Expanded indications for its use in mechanical embolectomy during acute ischemic stroke have proven safe and effective. Herein, we describe a novel use of this stent to perform a mechanical thrombectomy of a large left main coronary artery thrombus. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

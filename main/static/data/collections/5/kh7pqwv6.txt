Miniaturization of genetic tests represents the convergence of molecular biology and engineering and is leading to a new class of small analyzers and test systems for genetic testing with improved analytical characteristics. Miniaturization initially focused on devices that contained micrometer-sized features designed for a particular analytical purpose (e.g., filters for cell isolation and chips for capillary electrophoresis). Now, the focus is shifting to analytical applications based on nano-sized objects such as nanotubes, nanochannels, nanoparticles, nanopores and nanocapacitors. These nanofabricated objects provide new tools for sequencing of nucleic acids and rapid, multiplexed, nucleic acid detection.

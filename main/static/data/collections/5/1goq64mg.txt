Surgeons constantly try to achieve optimal surgical outcome, number, or extent of postoperative complications being an important part of it. Oncological surgeries are conventionally more challenging and complex compared with most nononcological ones. Gawande et al. devised SAS in 2007 in Boston as a predictor tool for postoperative complications (J Am Coll Surg 204:201–208, 2007). A validation study was done by in another cohort of 100 patients; however, only 70% of them had pathologically confirmed malignancies (Ann Surg 240(2):205–213, 2004). We attempt to assess SAS as a tool to predict postoperative complications in a series of 100 gynecological oncological patients operated at tertiary care center. SAS score of 100 patients with gynecologic malignancies, undergoing surgery at a tertiary care center, was prospectively collected over 4 years. These patients were observed for development of any complications occurring up to 30 days postsurgery. The complication events were graded as per Clavien-Dindo classification (Indian J Gynecol Oncolog 15:49, 2017). The data obtained was statistically analyzed by chi-square test. Thirty complication events were recorded in these 100 patients over a period of 4 years. Majority of complication events were grade IIIa or less (22 out of 30); there was only one death on 8th postoperative day. Fifty percent of patients were with SAS score of 5 or less developed complications compared with just 22.9% in patients with a score of 6 or more. Lower SAS score might be associated with higher postoperative complications in patients undergoing gynecologic oncological surgeries. Thus, patients with lower scores may benefit from a triage to more intensive postoperative care.

BACKGROUND To evaluate the feasibility and clinical outcomes of robotic single-site myomectomy (RSSM) for uterine myoma. METHODS Medical records of 101 consecutive women who underwent RSSM were retrospectively reviewed, and patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were evaluated. The surgical outcomes were compared by the phase in learning curve (early phase of <10 cases vs late phase of ≥10 cases) and time flow. RESULTS A total of 47 (46.5%) women had multiple myomas, and a median two (1-12) myomas were retrieved. The largest myoma was averagely measured as 6.2 ± 1.7 cm, and the mean weight of the total retrieved myomas was 114.0 ± 84.4 g. No patients received a transfusion or had operation-related complications. Cases in the late phase showed shorter port placement time and docking time than those in the early phase. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that robotic single-site surgery is a feasible therapeutic option for uterine myoma.

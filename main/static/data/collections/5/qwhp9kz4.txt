In recent commentaries from Lancet Rheumatology and The Journal of Rheumatology 1,2, the authors eloquently illustrated the connection between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, the subsequent cytokine storm (CS) that ensues in a number of patients, and the potential efficacy of biologics that rheumatologists routinely use in their practices. Moreover, those biologics were originally investigated by rheumatologists for the treatment of numerous rheumatic conditions, including macrophage activating syndrome (MAS), a similar form of storm that resembles the one occurring in patients with COVID-193.

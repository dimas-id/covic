This study aimed to explore the patterns of community health risk perception of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea using Internet search data. Google and NAVER relative search volume data were collected using COVID-19-related terms in Korean language. Online queries were compared with the number of new COVID-19 cases and tests. Time series trends and Spearmans rank correlation coefficients showed that the number of COVID-19-related queries in South Korea increased during the local and international events; higher in women, certain age groups; and higher in affected areas, which represented the community health risk perception. Greater correlations were found in mobile searches compared to that of desktop searches, indicating the changing behavior in searching health online information. The use of both Google and NAVER RSV to explore the patterns of community health risk perception could be beneficial for targeting risk communication in several perspectives including time, population characteristics, and location.

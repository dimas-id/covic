As COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to expand globally, there is an urgent need to develop, test and approve effective antiviral therapies. Currently a majority of clinical trials are evaluating therapies in patients who are already hospitalized with SARS Co-V-2 infection. Given that the median time between development of symptoms and need for hospitalization is a week, a golden opportunity to intervene early is being missed. Indeed, for many other viral infections, early treatment soon after development of symptoms is associated with decreased mortality, lower hospitalization rates and lower likelihood of transmission to others. Here, we advocate for randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials to evaluate promising agents early during SARS Co-V-2 infection.

COVID‐19 can be associated with coagulopathy (CAC, COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy) with a high prothrombotic risk based on an intense inflammatory response to viral infection leading to immunothrombosis through different procoagulant pathways[1]. Emerging evidence suggests that the use of heparin in these patients could be associated with lower mortality[2].

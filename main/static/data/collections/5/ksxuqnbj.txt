Multiplex molecular techniques can detect a diversity of respiratory viruses and bacteria that cause childhood acute respiratory infection rapidly and conveniently. However, currently available techniques show high variation in performance. We sought to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the novel multiplex NxTAG respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) RUO test versus a routine multiplex Anyplex II RV16 assay in respiratory specimens collected from children <18 years of age hospitalized with nonspecific symptoms of acute lower respiratory infection. Parallel testing was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates prospectively collected at referral Children's Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u (Barcelona, Spain) between June and November 2015. Agreement values between the two tests and kappa coefficients were assessed. Bidirectional sequencing was performed for the resolution of discordant results. A total of 319 samples were analyzed by both techniques. A total of 268 (84.0%) of them yielded concordant results. Positive percent agreement values ranged from 83.3 to 100%, while the negative percent agreement was more than 99% for all targets except for enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV; 94.4%). Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.83 to 1.00. Discrepancy analysis confirmed 66.0% of NxTAG RPP RUO results. A total of 260 viruses were detected, with EV/RV (n = 105, 40.4%) being the most prevalent target. Viral coinfections were found in 44 (14.2%) samples. In addition, NxTAG RPP RUO detected single bacterial and mixed viral-bacterial infections in seven samples. NxTAG RPP RUO showed high positive and negative agreement with Anyplex II RV16 for main viruses that cause acute respiratory infections in children, coupled with an additional capability to detect some respiratory bacteria.

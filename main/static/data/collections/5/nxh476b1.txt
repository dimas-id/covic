This study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic safety of laparoendoscopic single-site ovariectomy (LESS-OVE) and 3-portal laparoscopic ovariectomy (Lap-OVE) in dogs. Ten female mixed breed dogs were included in the study. Dogs were divided into group 1 (LESS-OVE; n = 5) and group 2 (Lap-OVE; n = 5). All procedures were performed by laparoscopic-skilled surgeons, and the anesthetic protocol was the same for all patients. In both groups, the ovarian vascular pedicle and ligaments were transected using a bipolar vessel sealer/divider device. The mean total surgical time was slightly longer in LESS-OVE (36.6 ± 3.5 min) than Lap-OVE (32.0 ± 3.0 min); however, the differences were not significant. Perioperative complications were not reported in any group. Both laparoscopic techniques were shown to be equally feasible and safe for patients. However, surgeons found LESS-OVE to require more skill than Lap-OVE. Therefore, additional studies should be conducted to evaluate this novel approach in clinical veterinary practice, and a proper laparoscopic training program for veterinary surgeons should be developed.

There is a lack of consensus on quality indicators suitable for neonatal transport. The aim of this study is to make a proposal for specific quality indicators for newborn transport. A retrospective descriptive study was performed (2009 to 2015) where twenty-four indicators were selected, evaluated and classified according to the 6 dimensions of quality of the Institute of Medicine. Among the 24 evaluated quality metrics, there were 3 of them which needed a correction when evaluating neonatal transport performance, because they were significantly correlated with gestational age. They were (a) stabilisation time, (b) prevalence of newborn arterial hypotension (defined by gestational age) and (c) unnoticed hypothermia at referral hospital. Conclusion: Quality evaluation through the definition of specific metrics in newborn transport is feasible. These indicators should be defined or adjusted for newborn population to measure the actual performance of the transport service.

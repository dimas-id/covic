Triazavirin (2-methylsulfanyl-6-nitro[1,2,4]triazolo[5,1-c][1,2,4]triazin-7(4H)-one, TZV) is an antiviral drug synthesized. TZV is being investigated for potential application against the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV. In order to find candidate drugs for 2019-nCoV, we have carried out a computational study to screen for effective available drug Triazavirin (C5H4N6O3S) which may work as inhibitor for the Mpro of 2019-nCoV. In the present work, first time the molecular structure of title molecule has been investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT/B3LYP/MidiX) in gas phase. The molecular HOMO-LUMO, excitation energies and oscillator strengths of investigated compound have also been calculated and presented. The interaction of TZV compound with the Coronavirus was performed by molecular docking studies. Therefore, TZV can be used for potential application against the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

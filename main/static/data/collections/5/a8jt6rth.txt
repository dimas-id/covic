Patients with novel corona virus infection (COVID-19) can develop acute respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Cytokine storm is suggested as one of underlying mechanisms for the rapid clinical decline. Immunocompromised patients and cancer patients are at particular risk for poor outcomes due to COVID-19 infection. This case report describes the presentation and clinical course of a cancer survivor who became critically ill and required mechanical ventilation. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone; however, he remained febrile, hypoxemic, continued to require full mechanical ventilator support and his chest X-ray showed increased bilateral infiltrates. The patient was treated with tocilizumab, after which he improved and was successfully extubated. This report illustrates a possible role of tocilizumab in management of cytokine storm in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection.

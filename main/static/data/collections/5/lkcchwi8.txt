the potential toxicity to human and aquatic receptors of petroleum fuel biodegradation metabolites (oxygen containing organic compounds; OCOCs) in groundwater has been investigated as part of a multi-year research program. Whole mixtures collected from locations upgradient and downgradient of multiple fuel release sites were tested using (1) in vitro screening assays for human genotoxicity (the gamma-h2ax assay) and estrogenic effects (estrogen receptor transcriptional activation assay) and (2) chronic aquatic toxicity tests in 3 species (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Raphidocelis subcapitata, and Pimephales promelas). In vitro screening assay results demonstrated that the mixtures did not cause genotoxic or estrogenic effects. No OCOC-related aquatic toxicity was observed and, when aquatic toxicity did occur, upgradient samples typically had the same response as samples downgradient of the release, indicating that background water quality was impacting the results. This information provides additional support for previous work that focused on the individual compounds and, taken together, indicates that OCOCs from petroleum degradation at fuel release sites are unlikely to cause toxicity to human or freshwater receptors at the concentrations present.

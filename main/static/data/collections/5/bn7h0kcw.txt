BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbation (IPF-AE) constitutes IPFâ€™s most devastating event, representing the unexpected superimposition of diffuse alveolar damage of unknown etiology. Guidelines recommend high-dose steroids treatment despite unproven benefit. We hypothesized that previous immunosuppression and the administration of high-dose steroids adversely affect IPF-AE outcome. METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized in our department for IPF deterioration from 2007 to June 2013. Our protocol consisted of immediate cessation of immunosuppression (if any), best supportive care, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and thorough evaluation to detect reversible causes of deterioration. Patients were followed-up for survival; post-discharge none received immunosuppression. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 85 admissions (28 %) fulfilled IPF-AE criteria. IPF-AE were analyzed both as unique events and as unique patients. As unique events 50 % survived; 3 out of 12 (25 %) in the group previously treated with immunosuppression whereas nine out of 12 (75 %) in the group not receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.041). As unique patients 35.3 % survived; 3 out of 6 (50 %) in the never treated group whereas three out of 11 (27.3 %) in the group receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.685). The history of immunosuppression significantly and adversely influenced survival (p = 0.035). Survival was greater in the never treated group compared to the immunosuppressed patients (p = 0.022). Post-discharge, our IPF-AE survivors had an 83 % 1-year survival. CONCLUSIONS: By applying the above mentioned protocol half of our patients survived. The history of immunosuppression before IPF-AE adversely influences survival. Avoiding steroids in IPF patients may favor the natural history of the disease even at the moment of its most devastating event.

BACKGROUND Febrile infections in children with leukemia are common. The occurrence of possible mixed bacterial-viral infections is unknown. METHODS We searched for viruses in leukemic children with blood culture-positive bacterial infections. The prospective multicenter survey included 156 febrile episodes in 51 children with acute leukemia. The mean follow-up time was 1.5 years per patient (27,743 patient-days at risk). Sixteen viruses were searched for from nasal swab and stool samples using virus culture, virus antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction tests. RESULTS Bacterial blood cultures were positive in 19 (11%) febrile episodes among 17 children. In half of the septic episodes (11 of 19), a virus was also found. Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common viruses detected. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that invasive bacterial infections are commonly associated with viral infections in children with leukemia.

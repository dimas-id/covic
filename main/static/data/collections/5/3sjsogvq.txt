A whole blood stimulation assay with Escherichia coli (O111:B4) endotoxin was established to measure the capacity of dairy cows to produce the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) ex vivo. Initially, a time‐ and dose‐dependent study was carried out to find the optimal stimulation conditions for the TNF‐α response. The TNF‐α response peaked between 3 and 4 h at 38.5 °C. A dose in the range of 5–10 g of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ml whole blood was found to give the maximum TNF‐α response. Thirty‐eight Danish–Holstein dairy cows were investigated for their TNF‐α responsiveness ex vivo in the periparturient period. Heparin‐stabilized blood samples were collected seven times over a period of 4 months (weeks −3, −1, 2, 3, 5, 9 and 13 around calving) and stimulated with 5 g/ml of E. coli LPS. Indeed, fluctuations in the TNF‐α responsiveness occurred over time. Moreover, the mean TNF‐α responsiveness of 38 cows was found to be significantly increased (P < 0.001) in the weeks close to calving. However, in the more stabile physiological periods, some cows had a consistently low TNF‐α response, whereas others had high a TNF‐α response. We are currently investigating whether high and low TNF‐α responders to E. coli LPS also exist in dairy cows in vivo. Moreover, the importance of TNF‐α responsiveness ex vivo to dairy cows' susceptibility and clinical response to experimental E. coli infections in the udder is being investigated.

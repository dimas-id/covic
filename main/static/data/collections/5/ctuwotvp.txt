Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers non-invasive, in-vivo, real-time monitoring of tissue oxygenation. Changes in regional tissue oxygenation as detected by NIRS may reflect the delicate balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. Originally used predominantly to assess cerebral oxygenation and perfusion perioperatively during cardiac and neurosurgery, and following head trauma, NIRS has gained widespread popularity in many clinical settings in all age groups including neonates. However, more studies are required to establish the ability of NIRS monitoring to improve patient outcomes, especially in neonates. This review provides a comprehensive description of the use of NIRS in neonates.

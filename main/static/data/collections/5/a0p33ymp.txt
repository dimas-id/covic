The study aims to investigate the current prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD among self-isolating general population, mainly college students, in the context of COVID-19 from January 26, 2020 to February 2, 2020, and to provide guidance for the general public. A total of 515 self-isolating people completed the online questionnaire including questions asking for demographic information and the impact of COVID-19 on their (mental and physical) health. The results showed that prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD was 14.4, 29.7, and 5.6%, respectively. Given the high prevalent but poorly recognized psychological disorders among self-isolating population under COVID-19, suggestions are provided in enhancing the media management in hope to improve self-isolating peopleâ€™s understanding of the epidemic and themselves and, ultimately, the health and emotional well-being of the society.

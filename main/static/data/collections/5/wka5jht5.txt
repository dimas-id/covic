Dendritic cells (DCs) act not only as sentinels for detection of, but also as target cells for viruses, and this can be important for viral transport and spread. All subsets of DCs are equipped with a battery of receptors recognizing virus‚Äêassociated molecular signatures, and recognition of those launches a maturation programme that results in substantial alterations of morphology, motility and the DCs' interactive properties with the extracellular matrix and scanning T cells. In addition to being sensed, viruses are internalized into DCs and, for the major proportion, processed into peptides that are subsequently presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Transmission of virus to T cells can occur after completion of their replication cycle if the intracellular milieu of the DC permits that. Alternatively, viruses can remain protected from degradation following entrapment by pattern recognition receptors in intracellular compartments, also referred to as virosomes, which translocate towards the DC/T cell interface. Most likely, transfer of virus to T cells occurs in these junctions, referred to as infectious synapses. In addition to promoting DC maturation, many viruses are able to downmodulate DC development and functions in order to evade immune recognition or to induce a generalized immunosuppression.

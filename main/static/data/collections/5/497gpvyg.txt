A 32-year-old woman with ocular-typed myasthenia gravis (MG) without thymoma was admitted to the hospital to undergo surgical treatment. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) extended thymectomy was successfully performed with three small ports using manual manipulators, the Radius Surgical System (RSS). The device may facilitate many degrees of freedom to general thoracic surgery.

General anaesthesia is sometimes favoured over regional anaesthesia in ophthalmic surgery. The use of supraglottic airway (SGA) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA) as the primary airway device is increasing due to numerous advantages over tracheal intubation. Compared with 1st generation SGAs, 2nd generation SGAs have an added benefit of isolating the airway from the alimentary tract. However, the vertical profile of SGAs may encroach into the surgical field and hence interfere with surgery. We investigated the vertical projections of 1st generation SGAs (LMA Classic, Ambu AuraFlex) and commonly used 2nd generation SGAs in our institution (LMA ProSeal, LMA Supreme, LMA Protector, Ambu AuraGain and I-gel) in a manikin model. Each device was connected to a corrugated catheter mount or angled connector following insertion as per usual clinical practice in our institutions. Vertical projections of all devices were measured from the chin using a centimetre ruler. Securing of airway device to the chin with an adhesive tape was possible for the LMA Classic and Ambu AuraFlex with straight corrugated connector, whereas the stiffer 2nd generations SGAs required the addition of an angled connector or straight corrugated tubing to direct the airway tube caudally, away from the surgical field. The LMA ProSeal had the lowest vertical projection amongst the 2nd generation SGAs and may be the suitable choice for ophthalmic surgery. We also describe a novel technique of utilising a 1st generation SGA with placement of an orogastric tube, although with some reservations. This study has several limitations and transferability of our findings into clinical practice is questionable as the use of a manikin may not fully imitate the real condition of the patient. Our study is the first study comparing vertical projected height of different SGAs in manikin, but future studies should investigate the use of SGA in the clinical setting during ophthalmic surgery.

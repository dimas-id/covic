The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease extended from China across the north-temperate zone, and more recently to the tropics and southern hemisphere. We find no evidence that spread rates decline with temperatures above 20 oC, suggesting that the COVID-19 disease is unlikely to behave as a seasonal respiratory virus.

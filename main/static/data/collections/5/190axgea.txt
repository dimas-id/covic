The American Psychological Association (APA) on March 24 called on states and insurers to move quickly to allow people to connect with their mental health providers remotely using telehealth as the need for mental health services rises during the COVID‐19 pandemic. “We are asking state policymakers to temporarily suspend state licensing requirements for telepsychological services, which would allow patients greater access to their providers and ensure continuity of care during this crisis,” Arthur C. Evans Jr., Ph.D., APA's CEO, said in a statement. “The federal government has just identified psychologists as critical, essential workers in the U.S. response to COVID‐19. But this does not mean that psychologists and psychology trainees must do work in person,” he said. “Essential psychological services can, and in many cases, should be delivered through telehealth. It is critically important that psychologists are able to meet the needs of their patients and communities during this difficult time, without further increasing the risk of contagion.”

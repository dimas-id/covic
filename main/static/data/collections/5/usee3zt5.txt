Corona virus disease 2019 started in December 2019 as an outbreak of unexplained pneumonias in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province of China. This illness emerged as an epidemic in China and later spread to almost all countries over the globe except Antarctica. This is caused by a beta Corona virus, which is genetically similar to SARS virus. The predominant mode of transmission is via droplet spread, when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks the virus is released in the respiratory secretions. As there are only a few cases of COVID 19 in neonates, there is no convincing evidence to support the possibility of vertical transmission. Clinical presentation in neonates is nonspecific, commonly observed are temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific. Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters. Since there is no approved treatment or drug for this disease, prevention of infection and breaking the chain of transmission plays a crucial role.

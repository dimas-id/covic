In this paper, we present a mathematical model of trigonometric type for transmissibility and deaths as a result of COVID-19. In the model, we analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering a new parameter, the motorcycle as a means of public transport, which has not been considered in several other models for COVID-19. We use the mathematical model to predict the spread and deaths and we suggest strategies that can be put in place to prevent the spread caused by motorcycle as a means of public transport.

This case series describes early experience, intraprocedural safety, and technical success of the MVP Micro Vascular Plug (MVP; Covidien, Irvine, California) for embolization of 20 pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) using 23 plugs in seven patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There was no device migration, and all devices were successfully detached electrolytically. Immediate cessation of flow through the feeding artery was achieved in 21 of 23 (91%) deployments. There was one minor complication. This series demonstrates the MVP to be safe and technically successful in the treatment of PAVMs.

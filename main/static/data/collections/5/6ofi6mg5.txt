Contemporary China is plagued by a wide range of human rights related issues and problems. In addition to those arising in the areas of religious toleration, judicial practice, treatment of labor and forced abortion, which were extensively reported by the media in the past, some newly emerged problems concerning human rights violation are much more alarming, due to the size of population affected and the degree of challenge caused to the public’s psychological endurance and confidence in the social ethnics and administration of the nation. Most of all, these problems concern nearly every Chinese citizen’s well-being and impact on their personal prosperity, as well as the prosperity of the nation as a whole. These problems are mainly associated with failures in environmental protection, food safety, and medical security.

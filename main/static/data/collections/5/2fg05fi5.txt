Between March and July 1987, a study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with toxigenic type D Pasteurella multocida infection in New South Wales pig herds. Toxigenic type D P. multocida was isolated from the nasal cavities of pigs in one (2%) of 50 randomly selected herds. Toxigenic isolates were also recovered from 2 (8%) of a separate group of 25 herds that had purchased pigs from a known infected piggery in South Australia (herd SA). Snout abnormalities were present in 9.4%, 3.2% and 1.8% of grower pigs in the 3 affected herds. Isolation of toxigenic P. multocida was significantly associated (p < 0.0001) with the occurrence of clinically affected pigs in the herd. Purchase of at least 5 pigs from herd SA was associated with an elevated risk (p < 0.05) of isolation of toxigenic P. multocida.

Smart environments and technology used for elder care, increases independent living time and cuts long-term care costs. A key requirement for these systems consists in detecting and informing about abnormal behavior in usersâ€™routines. In this paper, our objective is to automatically observe the elderly behavior over time and detect anomalies that may occur on the long term. Therefore, we propose a learning method to formalize a normal behavior pattern for each elderly people related to his Activities of Daily Living (ADL). We also adopt a temporal similarity score between activities that allows to detect behavior changes over time. In change behavior period we focus on each activity to detect anomalies. A use case with real datasets are promising.

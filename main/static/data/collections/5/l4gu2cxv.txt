The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-term results and patient's satisfaction of a new approach using the LigaSure™ 5 mm instrument for treatment of Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) and to compare with other long-term results using traditional treatment modalities. Between December 2011 and August 2013, a total of 23 patients with ZD underwent endoscopic surgery using the LigaSure™ technique in our department. A retrospective evaluation of the surgery was based on medical records and additionally a long-term follow-up was performed using a standardized questionnaire that was send to all patients. The questions dealt with complaints according to a visual analog scale (VAS) and were sent a minimum of one year after the surgery (mean time 22 months, range 12-32 month). The overall response rate was 91%. The mean age of the patients was 69 years (range 37-89 years). The patients reported nine for overall satisfaction on the VAS (range 0-10: 10 being very content and 0 very uncontent, 25 and 75% quartiles: 7 and 10) regarding the final outcome of their surgery, although several of the patients had continuous symptoms within the first postoperative year. Eight patients (38%) reported no symptoms at all. Our results suggest that endoscopic management of ZD with the LigaSure™ 5 mm instrument is a minimally invasive, fast and safe method with solid long-term outcome with relief of symptoms and patient satisfaction. This new operative instrument was not found inferior to traditional endoscopic techniques and is now the standard treatment method for ZD in our departments.

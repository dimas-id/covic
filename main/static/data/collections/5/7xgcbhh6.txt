The novel coronavirus has challenged medical systems worldwide to provide optimal medical care in the setting of limited resources. Although we are uncovering many facets of its disease spectrum, with rapidly emerging data, there is still limited knowledge of the sequelae of this infection, making treatment guidelines incomplete and resulting in serious unpredictable outcomes in patients at seemingly low risk, especially ones afflicted by neurological consequences. We present a case of a cortical stroke in a 31-year-old coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) positive female with otherwise no stroke risk factors. We noted a correlation between cytokine release, encephalopathy, and the onset of stroke symptoms. Patients with marked pro-thrombotic and inflammatory markers may benefit from closer neurological monitoring and thromboprophylaxis at therapeutic doses. The establishment of acute care pathways to manage critically ill patients with neurological consequences may reverse the suboptimal outcome trends seen during the pandemic.

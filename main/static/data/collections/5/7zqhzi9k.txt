OBJECTIVE To investigate the incidence of port-site adhesions following use of radially expanding trocars (RETs) at laparoscopic myomectomy by observation via second-look laparoscopy (SLL). METHODS In a retrospective study, data from patients who underwent SLL after laparoscopic myomectomy between January 2007 and June 2012 at Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, were assessed for the incidence of port-site adhesions forming below RET incisional scars when fascial and peritoneal defects had not been closed. RESULTS During the study period, 554 patients underwent SLL, and 2176 incisional scars were examined. Adhesions were detected in 15 patients (2.8%); thus, the incidence of port-site adhesions under scars was 0.7% (15/2176). Among these 15 patients, the wounds with adhesions were located as follows: 6 (1.1%) under the umbilical scar, 5 (0.9%) under the right lower abdominal scar, 2 (0.4%) under the left upper abdominal scar, and 2 (0.4%) under the left lower abdominal scar. According to multiple regression analysis, the duration of laparoscopic myomectomy was positively associated with port-site adhesions (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.94; P=0.02). CONCLUSION The present data suggest that the incidence of port-site hernias and adhesions under RET incisional scars is low despite the non-closure of fascial and peritoneal defects.

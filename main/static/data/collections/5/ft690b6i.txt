Virus infections are the root cause of epidemics in the world. Vaccines and antiviral agents have been the two important methods to control viral diseases; in recent times, RNA-mediated therapeutics and prevention have received much attention. In this review, we provide an overview of the current information regarding the use of vaccines, antiviral agents, and RNA-mediated methods in controlling or preventing viral infections. We stress specifically on the potential of existing RNA-mediated methods in clinical applications.

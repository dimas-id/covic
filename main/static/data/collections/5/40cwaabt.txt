The physiologic importance of autophagy proteins for control of mammalian bacterial and parasitic infection in vivo is unknown. We show that expression of the essential autophagy protein Atg5 in granulocytes and macrophages is required for in vivo resistance to infection with L. monocytogenes and T. gondii. In primary macrophages, Atg5 was not required for IFNγ/LPS-mediated transcription, induction of nitric oxide, or inhibition of T. gondii replication. However, Atg5 was required for IFNγ/LPS-induced damage to the T. gondii parasitophorous vacuole membrane and parasite clearance. While we did not detect autophagosomes enveloping T. gondii, Atg5 was required for recruitment of the IFNγ-inducible p47 GTPase IIGP1 (Irga6) to the vacuole membrane. This work shows that Atg5 expression in phagocytic cells is essential for cellular immunity to intracellular pathogens in vivo and that an autophagy protein can participate in immunity and intracellular killing of pathogens via autophagosome-independent processes such as GTPase trafficking.

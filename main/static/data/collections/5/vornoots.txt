Chronic relapsing polyneuropathy was diagnosed in a 15‐month‐old cat with a 12‐week history of limb weakness. The clinical course was punctuated by spontaneous remissions and relapse. There were two striking physical findings, weak withdrawal reflexes and atrophy of the proximal and distal limb muscles. Electrophysiological findings typical of a demyelinating motor neuropathy were present, namely small, dispersed compound muscle action potentials, markedly slow motor conduction and denervation potentials that were more prominent dis‐tally. Muscle biopsies showed changes consistent with denervation and a paucity of myelinated axons in intramuscular nerve bundles. The neuropathy responded rapidly and completely to prednisolone administration, which was slowly tapered over several months.

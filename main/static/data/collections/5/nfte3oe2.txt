Stress in mental health nursing has long been recognised as impacting on individual performance, sickness and employment retention (see Edwards, D. & Burnard, 2003). Schwartz Rounds (SR) are interdisciplinary fora designed for staff to come together to reflect on the emotional and challenges associated with working in healthcare. They are utilised to promote compassion and to prevent burnout among caregivers across care services (Pepper et al, 2012), including mental health services (Farr & Barker, 2017).

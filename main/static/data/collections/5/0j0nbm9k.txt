A 57-year old man with cold symptoms and muscle pain, with elevated blood glucose of 200mg/dL, was prescribed paracetamol (500mg every 6 hours) and naproxen (550mg daily for 5 days) and continued to take 850mg of metformin twice a day for the treatment of 10-year-old type 2 diabetes. Due to a persistent cough, 500 mg of azithromycin was added for three days, but the symptoms continued, and he had to go to his community hospital, where he got a pharyngeal exudate, to do a real-time PCR test for SARS-Cov-2 which was positive.

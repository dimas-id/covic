The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While much of the focus has been on the cardiac and pulmonary complications, there are several important dermatologic components that clinicians must be aware of. OBJECTIVE: This brief report summarizes the dermatologic manifestations and complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on Emergency Medicine clinicians. DISCUSSION: Dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly recognized within the literature. The primary etiologies include vasculitis versus direct viral involvement. There are several types of skin findings described in association with COVID-19. These include maculopapular rashes, urticaria, vesicles, petechiae, purpura, chilblains, livedo racemosa, and distal limb ischemia. While most of these dermatologic findings are self-resolving, they can help increase one's suspicion for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It is important to be aware of the dermatologic manifestations and complications of COVID-19. Knowledge of the components is important to help identify potential COVID-19 patients and properly treat complications.

Duodenal diverticula are relatively common and usually asymptomatic (95%). Their perforation is a rare but harmful event. Traumatic perforation is exceptional. We report the case of a patient with such a lesion following a blunt trauma secondary to a car accident, and review the literature. Clinical presentation is aspecific and diagnosis is based upon CT scan imaging. Surgery is the recommended treatment consisting of diverticulectomy with transverse duodenal closure of the duodenum associated with retroperitoneal drainage.

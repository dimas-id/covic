We prove Chen and Grätzer’s construction theorem for Stone algebras in Isabelle/HOL. The development requires extensive reasoning about algebraic structures in addition to reasoning in algebraic structures. We present an approach for this using classes and locales with implicit carriers. This involves using function liftings to implement some aspects of dependent types and using embeddings of algebras to inherit theorems. We also formalise a theory of filters based on partial orders.

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) play an indispensable role in biomedical research because of their similarities in genetics, physiological, and neurological function to humans. Proteomics profiling of monkey heart could reveal significant cardiac biomarkers and help us to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of heart disease. However, the proteomic study of monkey heart is relatively lacking. Here, we performed the proteomics profiling of the normal monkey heart by measuring three major anatomical regions (vessels, valves, and chambers) based on iTRAQ‐coupled LC‐MS/MS analysis. Over 3,200 proteins were identified and quantified from three heart tissue samples. Furthermore, multiple bioinformatics analyses such as gene ontology analysis, protein–protein interaction analysis, and gene‐diseases association were used to investigate biological network of those proteins from each area. More than 60 genes in three heart regions are implicated with heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. These genes associated with heart disease are mainly enriched in citrate cycle, amino acid degradation, and glycolysis pathway. At the anatomical level, the revelation of molecular characteristics of the healthy monkey heart would be an important starting point to investigate heart disease. As a unique resource, this study can serve as a reference map for future in‐depth research on cardiac disease‐related NHP model and novel biomarkers of cardiac injury.

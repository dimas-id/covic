This chapter discusses the functions of gastrointestinal tract. The principal functions of the gastrointestinal tract are assimilation of nutrients and excretion of the waste products of digestion. Within the gastrointestinal tract, these substances are solubilized and degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. The distribution of the different types of secretory cells in the salivary glands varies among species. The mandibular and sublingual glands are mixed salivary glands containing both mucous and serous types of cells, and produce a viscous secretion that contains large amounts of mucus. The cytoplasm of the secretory cells contains numerous zymogen granules that vary in size and number depending on the activity of the gland. These granules contain the precursors of the hydrolytic enzymes responsible for digestion of the major dietary components. The cells of the terminal ducts probably secrete the bicarbonate ion responsible for neutralizing hydrochloric acid that enters the duodenum from the stomach.

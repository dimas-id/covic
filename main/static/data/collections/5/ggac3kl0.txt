Abstract This chapter deals with the advancement of nanomaterial-based sensors in the last 10 years. The use of different types of nanomaterials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and metallic nanoparticles, was described, highlighting that graphene represents a rising star in the plethora of nanomaterials. Among the different transducers, the chapter describes the electrochemical and optical (bio)sensors, being the most promising devices. The use of materials at the nanodimension scale provides several improvements in terms of analytical features including sensitivity, rapidity of response, selectivity, and robustness, demonstrating the huge advantage of using the nanomaterials over the micromaterials in the development of smart and high-performant analytical tools.

Devices that monitor the depth of hypnosis based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) have long been commercialized, and clinicians use these to titrate the dosage of hypnotic agents. However, these have not yet been accepted as standard monitoring devices for anesthesiology. The primary reason is that the use of these monitoring devices does not completely prevent awareness during surgery, and the development of these devices has not taken into account the neurophysiological mechanisms of hypnotic agents, thus making it possible to show different levels of unconsciousness in the same brain status. An alternative is to monitor EEGs that are not signal processed with numerical values presented by these monitoring devices. Several studies have reported that power spectral analysis alone can distinguish the effects of different hypnotic agents on consciousness changes. This paper introduces the basic concept of power spectral analysis and introduces the EEG characteristics of various hypnotic agents that are used in sedation.

Abstract Introduction: Vitamin D supplements are recommended for elderly care home residents with little sunlight exposure. However, their use in care homes is limited and vitamin D deficiency in residents is widespread. This study aimed to understand perceived responsibility for the vitamin D status of residents and the determinants of current practice around supplementation. Methods: Thirteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants in two areas of Southern England including care home managers, general practitioners (GPs) and public health professionals. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results: Inductive thematic analysis identified four themes: medical framing; professional and sector boundaries; awareness of national guidance; and ethical and practical issues. Vitamin D supplements were not routinely given to residents, and most participants, including the GPs, believed the vitamin D status of residents was the responsibility of the GP. Care home managers felt unable to make decisions about vitamin D and vulnerable to suggestions of wrongdoing in administering over-the-counter vitamin tablets. This results in vitamin D requiring prescription by medical professionals and few care home residents receiving vitamin D supplements. Conclusion: The medical framing of vitamin D supplements in care homes is a practical barrier to residents receiving them and is out of step with public health recommendations. Vitamin D levels in care home residents could be improved through universal supplementation. This requires a paradigm shift so that vitamin D is understood as a protective nutrient as well as a medicine, and a public health as well as a medical responsibility. The failure to ensure vitamin D adequacy of residents may emerge as a factor in the spread and severity of COVID-19 in care homes and gives increased urgency to addressing this issue.

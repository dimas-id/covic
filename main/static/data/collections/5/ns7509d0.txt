The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic that swiped across the globe led many countries to apply 14 heavy nationwide restrictions and control measures. Analyzing aggregate and anonymized 15 mobility data from the cell-phone devices of >3 million users in Israel, we identified that poorer 16 regions exhibited lower and slower compliance with the restrictions. We integrated these mobility 17 patterns into age-, risk- and region-structured transmission model, and showed how we can explain 18 the spatiotemporal dynamics of 250 regions covering Israel. Model projections suggest that 19 applying localized and temporal interventions that focus on high-risk groups can substantially 20 reduce mortality, particularly in poorer regions, while enabling daily routine for a vast majority of 21 the population. These trends were consistent across vast ranges of epidemiological parameters, 22 possible seasonal forcing, and even when we assumed that vaccination would be commercially 23 available in 1-3 years. Our findings can help policymakers worldwide identify hotspots and apply 24 designated strategies against future COVID-19 outbreaks.

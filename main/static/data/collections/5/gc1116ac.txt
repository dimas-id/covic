Thymic carcinoma is a rare epithelial tumor of the thymus with a poor prognosis, and multimodal approaches are important for its treatment. Recently, a number of studies have indicated that S-1 treatment is effective against thymic carcinoma. S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy is a commonly used treatment for other malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, its safety has been confirmed, and it has been reported to have a marked effect against thymic carcinoma. Therefore, we conducted a phase II study of S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for locally advanced thymic carcinoma, in which the overall response rate was employed as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and safety.

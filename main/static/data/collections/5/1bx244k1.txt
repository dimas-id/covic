Patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia may develop stress cardiomyopathy, also known as Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), at different stages during the disease and with different degrees of left ventricular dysfunction. We describe three cases of TTS in COVID-19-positive patients with different clinical presentations and outcomes. One of them died, while in the other two coronary angiography confirmed the diagnosis but was postponed until after pneumonia resolution because of the risk of virus spread. LEARNING POINTS: An association between COVID-19 and cardiac involvement is highlighted. The incidence of Takotsubo syndrome has increased during this pandemic, possibly because it is caused by acute stress.

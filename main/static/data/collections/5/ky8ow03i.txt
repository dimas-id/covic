Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an unexpected outbreak affecting people of all ages. The first data showed that COVID-19 could cause severe pulmonary disease, cardiac injury, and death in adults, especially the elderly and those with concomitant diseases. Currently, it was demonstrated that severe COVID-19 may also develop in neonatal age, although rarely. Newborns with CHD are known to be at high risk for increased morbidity from viral lower respiratory tract infections because of underlying anatomical cardiac lesions. There are limited data on the implications of COVID-19 on patients with cardiovascular disease, especially for those with CHD. Herein, we aimed to summarise the COVID-19-specific perioperative management issues for newborns with CHD by combining available data from the perspectives of neonatology and paediatric cardiovascular surgery.

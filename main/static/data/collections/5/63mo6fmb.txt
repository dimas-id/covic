AIM To date, to our knowledge there are no studies regarding attitudes and experiences of outpatient medical personnel during a pandemic. This study's aim was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 on German psychiatrists and neurologists. METHODS An e-mail and fax-based short survey of 2,072 practice-based psychiatrists and neurologists was performed including Likert-type questions on personal burden and concerns, anticipated risk of infection, practice management as well as anxiety and sleep problems. RESULTS 396 physicians returned the questionnaire (19 %). More than 60 % of the participants felt restricted strongly or very strongly, more than 30 % were strongly and very strongly concerned. They anticipated a high own risk of infection. However, 91 % did not report any contact with patients positively screened for COVID-19, which they were aware of. One third felt financially threatened and loss of business volume was anticipated. 18 % reported, that the pandemic triggers substantial anxiety. Sleep problems, which occur at least almost every night, were rarely reported (9 %). CONCLUSION Practice-based psychiatrists and neurologists are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

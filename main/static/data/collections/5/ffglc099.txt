PURPOSE Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil can suppress coughing during emergence from general anesthesia; nevertheless, previous studies under different clinical conditions recommend significantly different effective effect-site concentrations (effective Ce) of remifentanil for 50% of patients (EC₅₀). The differences among these studies include type of surgery and patient sex. In recent years, study of sex differences in regards to anesthetic pharmacology has drawn greater interest. Accordingly, we attempted to determine the effective Ce of remifentanil for preventing cough for each sex under the same clinical conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty female and 25 male ASA physical status I-II grade patients between the ages of 20 and 46 years who were undergoing thyroidectomy were enrolled in this study. The effective Ce of remifentanil for preventing cough was determined for each sex using the isotonic regression method with a bootstrapping approach, following Dixon's up-and-down method. RESULTS Isotonic regression with a bootstrapping approach revealed that the estimated EC₅₀ of remifentanil for preventing coughing during emergence was significantly lower in females {1.30 ng/mL [83% confidence interval (CI), 1.20-1.47 ng/mL]} than in males [2.57 ng/mL (83% CI, 2.45-2.70 ng/mL)]. Mean EC₅₀ in females was also significantly lower than in males (1.23±0.21 ng/mL vs. 2.43±0.21 ng/mL, p<0.001). Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate over time were not significantly different between the sexes. CONCLUSION When using remifentanil TCI for cough prevention during anesthetic emergence, patient sex should be a considered for appropriate dosing.

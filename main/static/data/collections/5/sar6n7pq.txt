The most common hepatic procedures performed in companion animals are liver biopsies and partial hepatectomies. Surgery of the biliary tract most often involves the gallbladder, although surgical intervention of the bile duct may also be performed. Hepatobiliary surgery is often challenging, being performed in patients with significant systemic illness and associated with potentially life-threatening complications. An in-depth understanding of the regional anatomy, use of a team concept for patient management, particularly for patients undergoing partial hepatectomy surgery, and provision of intensive perioperative monitoring and support helps minimize complications and maximize outcome.

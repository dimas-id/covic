Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting approximately 5.6 million patients annually in the USA, where the annual cost exceeds US$12 billion. Optimal management should be based on knowledge of the most likely etiologic pathogens for each patient, based on an assessment of specific risk factors. It is also essential to assess severity of illness, to determine the appropriate site of care, and to order appropriate diagnostic testing. New developments in CAP management have focused on recognizing newly identified pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and novel H1N1 influenza, understanding when to utilize new microbiological diagnostic techniques, and how to use biomarkers to direct the appropriate utilization of antibiotics and to define the duration of therapy. This paper reviews recent advances in our knowledge about the diagnosis and optimal management of CAP.

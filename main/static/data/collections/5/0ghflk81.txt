Hypoglycaemia is a common, life‐threatening complication that occurs as a component of a wide variety of disease processes. Despite its frequent occurrence, information concerning the aetiology, characteristics and outcomes of hypoglycaemic crises in veterinary medicine is limited. This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoglycaemia, the body's counter‐regulatory response, underlying aetiologies, diagnosis and treatment. Disease mechanisms are discussed and published evidence in veterinary literature regarding prognostic indicators, prevalence, diagnosis and treatment is examined for hypoglycaemia‐related disease processes including insulinoma, glucose‐lowering toxins and medications.

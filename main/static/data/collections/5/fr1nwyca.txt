4â€², 6-Dichloroflavan, a potent inhibitor of rhinovirus replicationin vitro, was tested in a double-blind placebo controlled volunteer trial for its protective effect against experimental rhinovirus infection. Dichloroflavan was given orally (1 mg/kg, 3 times per day) for 3 doses before, and 13 doses after intransasal challenge with rhinovirus type 9, a type known to be highly sensitive in tissue culture. A total of 63 volunteers were included in the analysis for efficacy. Dichloroflavan did not produce any consistent or significant reduction in quantitative clinical or laboratory evidence of infection, and there was no apparent negative correlation of such data with drug concentrations in plasma. It is concluded that administration of dichloroflavan in the oral formulation tested is not of value in the treatment of human rhinovirus infection.

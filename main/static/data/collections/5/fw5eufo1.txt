Initial reports at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that the obstetric population did not appear to be at higher risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 than the general population.[1] However, following recent publications showing that pregnancy and the postpartum period might indeed pose additional risks for both women and babies, these preliminary observations urgently require review.[2] Explanations for heightened risk may include relative immunodeficiency associated with maternal physiological adaptations, as well as organic response to virus infections.

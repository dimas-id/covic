UNLABELLED To investigate the epidemiological features and types of human adenoviruses (ADV) in children with acute respiratory tract infection in Nanjing area, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 644 outpatients or hospitalized pediatric patients with ARTI at the Children Hospital of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, between August 2010 and July 2011. Adenoviruses were identified and typed from the collected clinical specimens by nested-PCR based on the partial region of the hexon gene. Other 12 respiratory viruses including human bocavirus (HBoV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (PIV1-4), influenza virus A/B (IFVA/B), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) were also identified by PCR method. All PCR positive products were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was conducted. It was showed that adenoviruses were detected in 171 patients out of 644 (26. 55%) children, 120 (70.18%, 120/171) for ADV3, 16 (9.36%,16/171) for ADV7, 12 (7.02%, 12/171) for ADV1, 10 (5.85%, 10/171) for ADV2, 6 (3.51%, 6/171) for ADV5, 3 (1.75%, 3/171) for ADV6, 3 (1.75%, 3/171) for ADV57, and 1 (0.58%,1/171) for ADV41. ADV infection could occur in any season. There was a higher possibility of ADV infection from April to July in 2011. Most cases (96.49%) were younger than 7 years old. A total of 99 of the 171 ADV-positive children (57.89%) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were the most common additional respiratory viruses, Lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent diagnoses made in the hospital, in which there were 52 pneumonia (30.4%) cases. CONCLUSION ADV is one of the most important pathogens of acute respiratory tract infection in children in Nanjing area, and adenovirus type 3 was the most prevalent serotype. It is important to develop long-term surveillance.

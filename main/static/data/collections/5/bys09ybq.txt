The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been wreaking havoc all over the planet. In a precautionary measure, populations have been forced and kept under quarantine to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease. The quarantine primary goal is to avoid the overload to the hospitals, which should be available for the care of COVID-19 patients. However, the virus does not have a uniform spread throughout the planet, and Brazil is no different. Although all the world's attention is now on the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no similar pattern of spread, and other diseases are still a real problem. Given the risks of transmission between patients and healthcare providers, there is a great challenge for healthcare institutions who must balance resources to assure safe care to patients and professionals while they take care of other disease patients, and perform surgical procedures that need to be carried out. Under such circumstances, as COVID-19 can also present pre- or asymptomatic transmission, it can be challenging to identify patients who are carrying and spreading the virus. Studies and information on mandatory testing for who are candidates to undergo elective surgery are scarce. Thus, the authors have reviewed the literature, and discuss the need to test these patients under the current context.

Physician burnout influences physician mental health, staff stress, safety events, and patient outcomes. The association of burnout with compassion satisfaction, secondary stress, emotional coping strategies and many psychosocial variables, such as institutional support, friendship, and spirituality, have not been well studied. A convenience sample of internal medicine physicians was emailed a survey using validated instruments to explore these associations. The response rate was 337/1021 (33%), with a burnout prevalence of 175/337 (52%). Grit, acceptance, active coping, positive reframing, and strategy planning were associated with lower burnout domains and greater compassion satisfaction. Certain emotional coping strategies such as denial, disengagement, self-blame, substance abuse, and venting were associated with greater burnout and lower compassion satisfaction. Greater institutional support was associated with lower burnout (r = − .35, p < .001), secondary stress (r = − .14, p < .05), and compassion satisfaction (r = .28, p < .0001). Friendship was associated with lower burnout (r = − .25, p < .0001) and greater compassion satisfaction (r = .28, p < .0001). This study suggests that amelioration of burnout requires both intrinsic strategies that emphasize physician coping skills as well as extrinsic strategies that address institutional support.

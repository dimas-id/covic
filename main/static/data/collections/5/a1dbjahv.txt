We investigated endovascular treatment for 10 mm or larger aneurysms in the internal carotid artery (IC), including the cavernous portion, the paraclinoid portion, and the posterior communication artery (PC). Between 2011 and 2014 at our hospital, there were 35 cases of aneurysms that were 10 mm or larger in the carotid artery. We analyzed these 35 cases retrospectively based on the size and location of the aneurysms, method of treatment, number of coils implanted, use of a stent, complications, rupture after treatment, ophthalmologic symptoms, and need for re-treatment. There was no bleeding after treatment. Of the 35 cases, four cases (11%) had permanent complications. Re-treatment was indicated in 11 cases (31%), including eight cases localized in the paraclinoid portion, two cases in the IC-PC, and one case in the cavernous portion. Among these re-treatment cases, two cases required a third treatment. Of the 16 cases with paraclinoid aneurysms, half required re-treatment. Of the 12 cases with ophthalmologic symptoms prior to treatment, 9 (75%) improved or had no change and 3 (25%) became worse. There were no complications in the 13 re-treatment procedures. Re-treatment is not uncommon, and a scheduled follow-up is needed. Coil embolization has been one of the main options for aneurysms that are 10 mm or larger in the IC. In the future, these large aneurysms will be treated with a flow diverter stent (FD).

Rapid identification of uropathogens is needed to determine appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This study evaluated performance of the Alfred 60 system combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology for rapid identification of uropathogens. The Alfred 60 system was used to screen urine cultures, followed by identifying the microbial pathogen in positive cultures using MALDI-TOF MS. The Alfred 60 detected positive cultures by measuring the turbidity of urine samples, which were transferred automatically to vials containing liquid medium and incubated for 3.5 h at 35 Â°C in the Alfred 60 system. Vials that showed growth were removed and centrifuged. The pellet was subjected to MALDI-TOF MS identification. In parallel, positive urine samples were inoculated onto agar plates for identification by conventional culture. The time required to detect positive urine cultures with Alfred 60 and identify the uropathogens with MALDI-TOF MS ranged from 15 min to 3.5 h. Among 146 positive urine samples tested, conventional cultures showed three culture groups: group 1 included 101 samples with growth of a single type of microorganism; group 2 included 34 samples with 2 types of microorganisms; and group 3 included 11 samples with &#8805; 3 types of microorganisms. Direct identification by MALDI-TOF MS was concordant with 95% of the samples in group 1, 100% of the principal microorganism in group 2, but could not identify microorganisms in group 3. This combination of methods provides rapid, reliable microbial identification for most positive urine cultures.

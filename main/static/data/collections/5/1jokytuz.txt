BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to reveal the effect of fibroblast or mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) coating on the mesh-induced production of IL-1β, IL-6, and VEGF by macrophages. METHODS Four commonly used surgical meshes were tested in this study, including Parietex, SoftMesh, TIGR, and Strattice. One-square-centimeter pieces of each mesh were placed on top of a monolayer of human fibroblasts or rat MSCs. The coating status was monitored with a light microscope. The human promonocytic cell line U937 was induced to differentiate into macrophages (MΦ). Three weeks later, meshes were transferred to new 24-well plates and cocultured with the MΦs for 72 h. Culture medium was collected and analyzed for IL-1β, IL-6, and VEGF production using standard ELISA essays. Parallel mesh samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde for histology or transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analyses, respectively. RESULTS Uncoated meshes induced increased production of all three cytokines compared with macrophages cultured alone. HF coating further increased the production of both IL-6 and VEGF but reduced IL-1β production. Except for the SoftMesh group, MSC coating significantly blunted release of all cytokines to levels even lower than with MΦs cultured alone. MΦs tended to deteriorate in the presence of MSCs. Both histology and TEM revealed intimate interactions between cell-coated meshes and MΦs. CONCLUSIONS Cytokine response to fibroblast coating varied, while MSC coating blunted the immunogenic effect of both synthetic and biologic meshes in vitro. Cell coating appears to affect mesh biocompatibility and may become a key process in mesh evolution.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a diarrheal disease of swine caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). It is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets. The spike protein of PEDV plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells, and recent studies also reported that the neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were mainly located in the S1 subunit, which makes it a candidate for vaccine development and clinical diagnosis. In this study, we successfully constructed an immune phage display single-domain antibody library with a library size of 3.4 Ã— 10(6). A single-domain antibody, named S7, specific for the spike protein of PEDV was identified from the phage display single-domain antibody library. S7 could be expressed in a soluble form in E. coli, bound to the spike protein of PEDV in ELISA and stained the PEDV virus in Vero cells, but it showed no neutralization activity on PEDV. These results indicated the potent application of the S7 antibody as an imaging probe or as a candidate for the development of a diagnostic assay.

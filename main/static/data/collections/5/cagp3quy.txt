The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of transrectal guidance of the ovaries by an assistant on operative time during bovine laparoscopic ovariectomy. Twenty four clinically healthy Holstein dairy cows were divided randomly into two groups. In the transrectal guidance group, an assistant grasped the ovaries via the transrectal route and pulled them to a position where they could be visualized with a camera. On the other hand, the control group was operated without guidance. The time required to remove both ovaries in the guidance group was shorter than that in the control group (P<0.01). We concluded that laparoscopic ovariectomy with transrectal guidance of the ovaries can substantially shorten operative time, thereby greatly contributing to animal welfare and to reducing the burden on the operator.

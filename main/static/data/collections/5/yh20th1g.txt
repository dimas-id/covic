BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Computed tomography perfusion imaging can estimate the size of the ischemic core, which can be used for the selection of patients for endovascular therapy. The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) thresholds chosen to identify ischemic core influence the accuracy of prediction. We aimed to analyze the accuracy of various rCBV and rCBF thresholds for predicting the 27-hour infarct volume using RAPID automated analysis software from the SWIFT PRIME trial (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment) data. METHODS Patients from the SWIFT PRIME study who achieved complete reperfusion based on time until the residue function reached its peak >6 s perfusion maps obtained at 27 hours were included. Patients from both the intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator only and endovascular groups were included in analysis. Final infarct volume was determined on magnetic resonance imaging (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images) or computed tomography scans obtained 27 hours after symptom onset. The predicted ischemic core volumes on rCBV and rCBF maps using thresholds ranging between 0.2 and 0.8 were compared with the actual infarct volume to determine the most accurate thresholds. RESULTS Among the 47 subjects, the following baseline computed tomography perfusion thresholds most accurately predicted the actual 27-hour infarct volume: rCBV=0.32, median absolute error (MAE)=9 mL; rCBV=0.34, MAE=9 mL; rCBF=0.30, MAE=8.8 mL; rCBF=0.32, MAE=7 mL; and rCBF=0.34, MAE=7.3. CONCLUSIONS Brain regions with rCBF 0.30 to 0.34 or rCBV 0.32 to 0.34 thresholds provided the most accurate prediction of infarct volume in patients who achieved complete reperfusion with MAEs of â‰¤9 mL.

Pretreatment of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGE) (coronavirus) with trypsin increased the yield of the infectious virus approximately 100-fold when propagated in roller cultures of SPEV cells, the time required for the development of marked CPE being twice shorter than without treatment. The method of concentration and purification of TGE virus is described which yields a preparative amount of highly purified virions retaining their structure. Such preparations were used for immunization of guinea pigs. It is concluded that purified preparations of TGE virus possess marked antigenic potency and may be used for generation of highly active and specific hyperimmune sera.

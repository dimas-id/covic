In this chapter, I first dwell briefly on important events in the field of career counseling over the past few decades and explain why innovation in the field is needed. I draw on one of my earliest recollections to set the scene for what is to follow in later chapters and elaborate on my own personal Damascene moment—a moment that convinced me forever of the need for as well as the power and value of an integrative QUALITATIVE-quantitative approach to career counseling, particularly at a time when many speculate that work itself is at risk. I conclude by outlining the contents of the book and explaining its aims—to help people connect what they know about themselves consciously with what they are aware of subconsciously (elicited by activities such as asking clients for their most hurtful experiences or for their earliest recollections).

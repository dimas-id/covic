Abstract Programmed ribosomal frameshifting in viral messenger RNA occurs in response to neighboring sequence elements consisting of: a frameshift site, a spacer, and a downstream enhancer sequence. In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNA, this sequence element has a potential to form either a stem-loop or a pseudoknot structure. Based on many mutational studies, the stem-loop structure has been proposed for the downstream enhancer region of the HIV-1 mRNA. This stimulatory stem-loop structure is separated from the shift site by a spacer of seven nucleotides. In contrast, a recent report has proposed an alternative model in which the bases in the spacer sequence form a pseudoknot structure as the downstream enhancer sequence [Du et al., Biochemistry 35 (1996) 4187â€“4198.]. Using UV melting and enzymatic mapping analyses, we have investigated the conformation of the sequence region involved in ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1. Our S1, V1, and T1 endonuclease mappings, together with UV melting analysis, clearly indicate that this sequence element of the HIV-1 mRNA frameshift site forms a stem-loop structure, not a pseudoknot structure. This finding further supports the stem-loop structure proposed by many mutational studies for the downstream enhancer sequence of the HIV-1 mRNA.

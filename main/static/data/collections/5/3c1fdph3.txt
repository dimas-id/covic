Abstract Tracheostomy in COVID-19-related severe acute respiratory syndrome is at high risk of viral dissemination. The percutaneous dilatation technique could reduce this risk, being performed at the bedside and minimizing airway opening. In the COVID-19 context, however, with precarious respiratory status, it requires specific preparation. We designed a 3-hour training module, and here provide a step-by-step schedule, including video analysis, a demonstration of the kit, the recommended precautions related to COVID-19, and several simulation scenarios of increasing difficulty, using a high-tech mannequin. A low-tech procedural simulator was also developed for practicing the steps of the procedure. Our experience (3 sessions with 14 participants) highlighted the difficult points of the procedure in the COVID-19 context, and defined a check-list for clinical practice and an assessment grid. This type of simulation helps to prepare teams for a potentially delicate technical act.

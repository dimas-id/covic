PURPOSE To perform technically the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) using a unique Intragastric Single Port (IGSG) in animal swine model, evidencing an effective and safe procedure, optimizing the conventional technique. METHODS IGSG was performed in 4 minipigs, using a percutaneous intragastric single port located in the pre-pyloric region. The gastric stapling of the greater curvature started from the pre-pyloric region towards the angle of His by Endo GIAâ„¢ system and the specimen was removed through the single port. In the postoperative day 30, the animals were sacrificed and submitted to autopsy. RESULTS All procedures were performed without conversion, and all survived 30 days. The mean operative time was 42 min. During the perioperative period no complications were observed during invagination and stapling. No postoperative complications occurred. Post-mortem examination showed no leaks or infectious complications. CONCLUSION Intragastric Single Port is a feasible procedure that may be a suitable alternative technique of sleeve gastrectomy for the treatment of morbid obesity.

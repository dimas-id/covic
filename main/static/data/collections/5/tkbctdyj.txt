Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the WHO Despite being mainly a respiratory virus, cardiac complications have been described These range from sudden cardiac death to subtle diastolic dysfunction after recovery from COVID-19 The commonest cardiac presentation to date is acute heart failure resulting from biventricular or left ventricular hypokinesis and elevation of cardiac troponins It has been shown that COVID-19 downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, which has protective effects on the endothelium and cardiomyocytes It has also been proven that COVID-19 induces a state of hypercytokinaemia, some cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have an injurious effect on the myocardium and endothelium, respectively Such pathogenic mechanisms might play a crucial role in induction of cardiomyocyte injury and impaired myocardial perfusion probably through coronary endothelial dysfunction The understanding and linking of such mechanisms might help in tailoring drug repurposing for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 cardiovascular complications Received 6 April 2020 Accepted 14 April 2020 Correspondence to Antoine Fakhry AbdelMassih, MD, Pediatrics’ Department, Pediatric Cardiology unit, Cairo University Children Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Kasr Al Ainy Street, Cairo 12411, Egypt, E-mail: antoine abdelmassih@kasralainy edu eg © 2020Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams Wilkins

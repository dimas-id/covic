BACKGROUND Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), first described by Buess enables a less aggressive approach of benign rectal lesions, or even early rectal cancer in a curative intent. MATERIALS AND METHODS The SILS Port, initially designed for laparoscopic surgery, was successfully used for 20 TEM procedures in 16 patients. Local resection was sufficient in 15 procedures (benign tumours or pT1) out of 20, whereas 5 TEM operations required additional surgery: 3 rectal resections (pT1Nx, pT1sm3Nx and pT2N1) and 1 TEM revision (1 patient refused the rectal resection (pT1Nx). Postoperative complications following Dindo-Clavien were: grade II in 4 patients (pain: 2; fever: 1; bleeding: 1) and grade IIIb in 2 patients (bleeding). No long-term faecal incontinence was noted. CONCLUSION TEM using the SILS Port is a safe and effective procedure for local resection of benign and certain malignant tumours. Using such a cheaper device, TEM procedure could be available in any operating theatre.

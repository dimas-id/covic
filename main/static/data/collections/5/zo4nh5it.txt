Whenever a disease emerges, awareness in susceptibles prompts them to take preventive measures, which influence individualsâ€™ behaviors. Therefore, we present and analyze a time-delayed epidemic model in which class of susceptible individuals is divided into three subclasses: unaware susceptibles, fully aware susceptibles, and partially aware susceptibles to the disease, respectively, which emphasizes to consider three explicit incidences. The saturated type of incidence rates and treatment rate of infectives are deliberated herein. The mathematical analysis shows that the model has two equilibria: disease-free and endemic. We derive the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the model and study the stability behavior of the model at both disease-free and endemic equilibria. Through analysis, it is demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] , unstable when [Formula: see text] , and linearly neutrally stable when [Formula: see text] for the time delay [Formula: see text] . Further, an undelayed epidemic model is studied when [Formula: see text] , which reveals that the model exhibits forward and backward bifurcations under specific conditions, which also has important implications in the study of disease transmission dynamics. Moreover, we investigate the stability behavior of the endemic equilibrium and show that Hopf bifurcation occurs near endemic equilibrium when we choose time delay as a bifurcation parameter. Lastly, numerical simulations are performed in support of our analytical results.

BACKGROUND Neuroendovascular intervention has become a key treatment option for acute ischemic stroke. The Sofia (6F) PLUS catheter was designed for neurovascular access for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. OBJECTIVE To report the first series describing use of the Sofia PLUS intermediate/distal access reperfusion catheter in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS In this retrospective study, 41 stroke cases were identified in which the catheter was utilized for thrombolysis/thrombectomy. Mean preprocedure National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16.5 ± 5.2 (range 4-29). Occluded vessels included the M1 segment, M2 segment, internal carotid artery terminus, cervical internal carotid artery, and basilar artery. RESULTS Successful positioning of the Sofia PLUS catheter near the occlusion site was achieved in 38 (92.7%) of 41 cases in which thrombectomy or thrombolysis was attempted using intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator, a direct aspiration first-pass technique, and/or stent retrieval. A postprocedure thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 2b/3 was achieved in 37 of 41 cases. Of 15 cases where the Sofia PLUS was used for a direct aspiration first-pass technique, TICI 2b/3 was achieved in 11 (73.3%). In one case where intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator was used as the only treatment modality, TICI 2a was achieved. No device-related or catheter-related complications were observed. The mean 7-d-postprocedure National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score among the 39 survivors was 8.5 ± 7.3 (range 0-23). CONCLUSION Initial results with use of the Sofia (6F) PLUS for endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been encouraging. Experience with a larger series is warranted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of this device and compare it with other reperfusion catheters.

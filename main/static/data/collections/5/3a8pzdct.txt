BACKGROUND Recruitment manoeuvres generate a transient increase in trans-pulmonary pressure that could open collapsed alveoli. Recruitment manoeuvres might generate very high inspiratory airflows. We evaluated whether recruitment manoeuvres could displace respiratory secretions towards the distal airways and impair gas exchange in a porcine model of bacterial pneumonia. METHODS We conducted a prospective randomised study in 10 mechanically ventilated pigs. Pneumonia was produced by direct intra-bronchial introduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Four recruitment manoeuvres were applied randomly: extended sigh (ES), maximal recruitment strategy (MRS), sudden increase in driving pressure and PEEP (SI-PEEP), and sustained inflation (SI). Mucus transport was assessed by fluoroscopic tracking of radiopaque disks before and during each recruitment manoeuvre. The effects of each RM on gas exchange were assessed 15 min after the intervention. RESULTS Before recruitment manoeuvres, mucus always cleared towards the glottis. Conversely, mucus was displaced towards the distal airways in 28.6% ES applications and 50% of all other recruitment manoeuvres (P=0.053). Median mucus velocity was 1.26 mm min-1 [0.48-3.89] before each recruitment manoeuvre, but was reversed (P=0.007) during ES [0.10 mm min-1 [-0.04-1.00]], MRS [0.10 mm min-1 [-0.4-0.48]], SI-PEEP [0.02 mm min-1 [-0.14-0.34]], and SI [0.10 mm min-1 [-0.63-0.75]]. When PaO2 failed to improve after recruitment manoeuvre, mucus was displaced towards the distal airways in 68.7% of the cases, compared with 31.2% recruitment manoeuvres associated with improved PaO2 (odds ratio: 4.76 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-19.97). CONCLUSIONS Recruitment manoeuvres dislodge mucus distally, irrespective of airflow generated by different recruitment manoeuvres. Further investigation in humans is warranted to corroborate these pre clinical findings, as there may be limited benefits associated with lung recruitment in pneumonia.

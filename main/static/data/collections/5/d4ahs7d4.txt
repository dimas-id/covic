The nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses occupy the top of the upper respiratory tract and form pneumatic spaces connected with the atmosphere. They are located immediately beneath the base of the cranium, where crucial vital structures are harbored. From this region, very much exposed to airborne agents, arise some of the more complex and rare benign and malignant lesions seen in humans, whose difficulties in interpretation make this remarkable territory one of the most challenging in the practice of surgical pathology. Contents of this chapter cover inflammations and infections, polyps and pseudotumors, fungal and midfacial destructive granulomatous lesions, as well as benign, borderline, and malignant neoplasms. Among the neoplasms, emphasis is made on those entities characteristic or even unique for the sinonasal region, such as Schneiderian papillomas, glomangiopericytoma, intestinal- and non-intestinal-type adenocarcinomas, olfactory neuroblastoma, nasal-type NK-/T-cell lymphoma, and teratocarcinosarcoma. Moreover, recently recognized entities involving this territory, i.e., HPV-related non-keratinizing carcinoma, NUT carcinoma, and SMARCB1-deficient basaloid carcinoma, are also discussed in the light of their specific molecular findings. Furthermore, the text is accompanied by numerous classical and recent references, several tables, and 100 illustrations.

During the past year, genetic studies of picornaviruses, vastly facilitated by the application of infectious picornaviral cDNAs and RNAs, have contributed to our understanding of the function of individual picornavirus polypeptides and to the genetic processes that operate in these small RNA viruses. Especially notable were the demonstrations that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase may have a function in RNA synthesis as an uncleaved precursor polypeptide, and that a mutation in the polymerase can be complemented in trans, in contrast to data obtained from previously studied polymerase mutants. A new in vitro system, in which positive-strand sythesis, negative-strand synthesis and RNA packaging were all observed, will facilitate further studies into the mechanism of these processes.

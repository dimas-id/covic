BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in restriction of face to face consultations and mechanisms to access health care. Osteoporosis and fragility fractures forms a significant proportion of adult trauma and orthopaedic workload even during the pandemic. AIMS: We assess the challenges and strategies used in the management of osteoporosis and fragility fracture care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We have done a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in the first week of May 2020 on developments and guidance during the current COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures management has been hampered by lock down and infection transmission strategies used to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to diagnostic tests, treatment facilities with the need to use clinical and prediction tools to guide management Telemedicine has an evolving role. CONCLUSION: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures in elderly individuals pose a real challenge for an appropriate diagnosis and management, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A clinical decision along with use of clinical prediction tools for osteoporosis should be used to direct treatment. Obligatory fractures such as hip fractures require operative intervention. Non-obligatory fractures such as distal radius fractures can be managed conservatively with use of telemedicine applications in monitoring both types of patients.

This is the first report of success in numerically quantifying and visualizing cardiac cycle-related intracranial vessel motion and pulse waves in human subjects by using 320-detector CTA and a newly developed motion-detection algorithm to better understand the physiologies of intracranial arteries. This new technique promises to provide significant novel information for analyzing the elasticity of cerebral vessels and should be incorporated in the analysis of vessel fluid dynamics.

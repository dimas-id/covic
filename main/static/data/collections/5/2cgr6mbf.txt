In the context of digital transformation, speeding up the time-to-market of high-quality software products is a big challenge. Main challenges. Software quality correlates with the success of requirements engineering (RE) sessions. RE sessions demand software analysts to collect all relevant material usually specified on written notes, flip charts, pictures, etc. Afterwards comprehensible requirements need to be specified for software implementation and testing. These activities are mostly performed manually, which causes process delays and software quality attributes like reliability, usability, comprehensibility, etc., are diminished causing software devaluation. Innovative aspects. This research idea paper proposes a framework for automating the tasks of requirements specification. The proposed framework involves computational mechanisms to enable the automatic generation of software design while requirements are discussed. The innovative aspect of this research comes from digitally transforming the software development life cycle (SDLC) where requirements are generated “on the fly” and virtual reality systems are in place. Potential to make change. The proposed framework has the potential to renovate the role of software analysts, which can experience substantial reduction of manual tasks, more efficient communication, dedication to more analytical tasks, and assurance of software quality from conception phases. This research idea paper introduces the framework for automating the task of requirements specification, and report our progress. We conclude the paper by outlining lessons learnt and future lines of work.

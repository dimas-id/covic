Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is a rare disorder characterized by type I lissencephaly and a distinctive facial appearance that may include prominent forehead, bitemporal hollowing, and micrognathia. MDS is associated with epilepsy. We here report an 18-month-old girl with MDS who required general anesthesia. The child had an extremely low Bispectral Index (BIS) value prior to undergoing general anesthesia. Her perioperative course was uneventful. This case highlights some of the important anesthetic concerns in patients with MDS, which include potentially difficult airways and extremely low BIS values.

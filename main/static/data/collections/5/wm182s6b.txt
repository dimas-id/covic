The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly, forcing some drastic changes not only in our daily lives, but also in our clinical and surgical activities. Given our extensive Italian experience, we hereby describe how our surgical unit activity has changed and how, in some cases, it was necessary to modify surgical strategies. We hope our experience can be shared with our global colleagues who are suffering under similar condition.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers the best potential for full rehabilitation in patients with end-stage kidney disease who are treated with dialysis. However, due to organ shortage which is a universal phenomenon, most patients need to be maintained on a period of dialysis therapy before the prospect of transplantation. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) could be an ideal form of renal replacement therapy due to its favorable profile toward preservation of residual renal function, patient survival, lower overall burden on cardiovascular morbidity and infection risks. METHODS: With extensive experience in PD therapy from Hong Kong where PD-first is a mandatory health policy, we reviewed the literature and present current evidence that favors PD as an optimal form of bridging renal replacement therapy prior to kidney transplantation. RESULTS: PD provides a viable and advantageous form of renal reaplcement particularly in terms of preservation of residual renal function, patient survival and quality of life, and cost among many other factors. Potential misconceptions that PD-related peritonitis and dialysis inadequacy are potentially deterrent factors for initiating PD therapy are clarified. CONCLUSION: PD is a practical and noninferior form of renal replacement that serves as an ideal bridge from conservative therapy to kidney transplantation.

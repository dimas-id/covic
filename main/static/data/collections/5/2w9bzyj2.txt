OBJECTIVE Abuse and misuse of prescription opioids is a significant public health concern. This review examines the strategies used to confer abuse-deterrent properties on opioid abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs), the characteristics and supporting data for each of the available ADFs, and the role of opioid ADFs as part of a comprehensive opioid risk management plan. METHODS A PubMed search was performed for articles published within the last 10 years using the search terms "abuse deterrent opioids". Articles were limited to clinical studies and reviews focusing on United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved opioid ADFs in the US. RESULTS There are currently nine extended-release and one immediate-release opioid pain medications with US FDA-approved ADF labelling. All use either physical and chemical barriers or agonist/antagonist combinations to deter manipulation and abuse. Evidence is mounting that introduction of opioid ADFs has been associated with decreased rates of abuse and diversion of opioids in the US. CONCLUSIONS Although not sufficient by themselves to prevent prescription opioid abuse and misuse, opioid ADFs are an important component of a healthcare provider's comprehensive opioid risk management plan (along with utilization of prescription drug monitoring programs, clinical assessment tools, urine tests, co-prescribing of naloxone to patients at risk of an overdose, access to non-pharmacological treatments and addiction/mental health resources, among others). Adoption of opioid ADFs should be considered as part of an overall public health opioid risk management plan involving all stakeholders to balance legitimate safe and effective use of opioids against misuse and abuse.

Within otolaryngology, scribes have been utilized as a means of increasing clinic efficiency and easing workload on physicians. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of otolaryngology clinic appointments at academic institutions have been moved to telemedicine in order to limit interpersonal contacts. At the height of the pandemic, our institution has protocolized scribe participation from in-person to remote. Scribes have virtually participated in telemedicine appointments in an effort to facilitate documentation and enhance the patient-physician relationship. Beyond the pandemic, as patients start being evaluated in-person, the risk of contamination and spread through aerosol generating procedures has limited the number of ancillary support staff that can be present in the examination rooms. As such, virtual scribing from a separate location within the clinic has been deemed warranted. This paper documents the protocols on virtual scribing for both telemedicine and a hybrid approach for in-clinic appointments where high-risk procedures are being performed.

SUMMARY Patients with a history of massive weight loss have compromised and poor-quality skin and fascia. Various body contouring surgeries aim to improve appearance and shape of the trunk and restore fascial integrity. These patients may be at increased risk of recurrent fascial laxity or bulges after conventional techniques. Here, the author presents a case where a silk-based bioresorbable scaffold was used prophylactically in a massive weight loss patient undergoing a circumferential body lift.

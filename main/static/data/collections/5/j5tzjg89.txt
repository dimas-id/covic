INTRODUCTION Liver hemangiomas are benign liver lesions that require surgical excision when large and symptomatic. Often, these tumors are removed through large anatomical resections which sacrifice more liver parenchyma than needed. Tumor enucleation, which takes advantage of a digitoclasia-like technique along the plane between the tumor pseudo-capsule and liver parenchyma, poses challenges when performed laparoscopically. We propose a parenchymal sparing, minimally invasive, robotic-assisted technique to remove liver hemangiomas. PRESENTATION OF CASES Three male patients with symptomatic hemangiomas were treated in our center between 2015 and 2018. The lesions were located in segment II, III and segment IV-V respectively. Robotic-assisted hemangioma enucleation was accomplished successfully in all three patients. The procedures were performed with a parenchyma-sparing intent and a formal segmentectomy was not required. There were no conversions to open surgery. DISCUSSION The robotic platform provides a powerful tool in the enucleation of liver hemangiomas. The enhanced vision and the superior suturing ability allow to develop safely the plane between the tumor pseudo-capsule and the liver parenchyma, with outstanding selective control of all the vascular supply and drainage encountered during the dissection. Furthermore, precision of the hilar dissection allows selective lobar or sectorial arterial control which helps minimize intraoperative bleeding. CONCLUSION In our experience, robot-assisted enucleation of liver hemangiomas offers low morbidity, fast recovery, excellent cosmetic results, and it could become a therapeutic option when the location of the hemangioma allows this approach.

BACKGROUND Paramyxovirus (PV) infections are increasingly recognized in lung transplant recipients and have been linked to subsequent graft failure and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Ribavirin represents a possible treatment option although the outcome on graft function and BOS incidence is unknown. METHODS We analysed outcomes of all PV infections in lung/heart-lung recipients between September 2006 and April 2009 in a single centre. PV-infected recipients treated with oral ribavirin were compared with those unable to receive ribavirin due to contraindications. Recovery of graft function, time to recovery and new development of BOS were compared. RESULTS A total of 38 patients (ribavirin group) were treated with ribavirin for a median of 9 days (IQR 8-12), whilst 29 patients (non-ribavirin group) received best supportive care including corticosteroids. The median forced expiratory volume in 1 s dropped 20% (IQR 15-32) from baseline in the ribavirin group versus 18% (IQR 13-30) in the non-ribavirin group during infection. In 84% of patients treated with ribavirin and 59% of the non-ribavirin group, graft function recovered within 30 days (P=0.02). New onset of BOS developed within 6 months in 5% of the ribavirin group versus 24% of the non-ribavirin group (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS Treatment of PV after lung/heart-lung transplantation with oral ribavirin seems to be associated with earlier recovery of graft function and to prevent BOS.

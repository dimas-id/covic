Human blood plasma has been reported to possess nonspecific antiviral activity. This activity is due to several preexisting naturally occurring molecules that are either active against individual members or a family of viruses. These molecules, however, have not been adequately studied to reveal their molecular structures and mechanisms of action presumably because of their low and nonspecific antiviral action. Therefore, their possible role against viraemia remains unknown. Recently, two naturally occurring nonspecific broad‐spectrum antiviral agents, University of Texas Inhibitor β (UTIβ) glycoprotein and high density lipoprotein, have been described in human serum. They are active against DNA and RNA viruses and one of them, UTIβ, possesses significant antiviral activity of 40 units/mL. Since preexisting antiviral molecules in serum appear to be the only defence mechanisms available at the onset of viral infection they may have protective significance against viraemia. In view of this potential, we have undertaken to review the properties of these innate viral inhibitory molecules. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

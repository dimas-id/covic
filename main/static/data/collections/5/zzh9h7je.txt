The effect of antibiotics during the perioperative period of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is still controversial. A total of 297 patients who underwent the PDT procedure were divided into 2 groups:those administered antibiotics perioperatively and those not administered antibiotics. Wound infections were noted in 7 cases (incidence rate, 2.36%) and no death was recorded. Of the 69 patients without antibiotics, 5 developed wound infections (incidence rate, 7.25%), while only 2 of the 228 patients with antibiotics developed wound infections (incidence rate, 0.88%) (pÔºù0.002;risk ratio, 8.82;95% confidence interval, 1.67-46.6). Of the 7 cases of wound infection, 5 cases occurred during the early period after PDT (within 7 days). Collectively, the present results suggest that prophylactic administration of antibiotics may prevent the incidence of PDT-induced wound infection, especially in the early phase after the PDT procedures. The need for antibiotics in PDT should be reconsidered.

The World Health Organization has recently defined the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections as a pandemic. The infection, which may cause a potentially very severe respiratory disease, now called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has airborne transmission via droplets while less attention focused on aerosol transmission. Surgical smoke and plumes in laser clinics represent a source for aerosol particles. The aim of this article is to provide the authors' opinion for the correct use of "laser devices" in the COVID-19 emergency and to reduce potential risks of laser airborne contaminants.

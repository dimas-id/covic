Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) commonly infects children and is usually asymptomatic. Lethal outcomes of PVB19 infection are unusual; nevertheless, the two cases reported here are rare examples of PVB19-induced hemophagocytic syndrome and myocarditis in infants and children. The two cases show the indisputable usefulness of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in the detection of PVB19. In the death investigations, histopathological examinations provided stronger evidence than did serology or molecular biology. The cases also highlight the importance of forensic autopsy in vaccine-related death. As vaccine-related deaths are what people fear and may cause declines in vaccination rates, it is important to clarify deaths temporally or causally associated with vaccine administration.

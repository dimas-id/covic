Treatment of throat cancers have improved due to minimally-invasive trans-oral approaches. Surgeons rely on preoperative imaging to guide their resection; however, large tissue deformations occur during trans-oral procedures due to placement of necessary retractors and laryngoscopes which hinders the surgeon's ability to accurately assess tumor extent and location of critical structures. We propose an image-guided framework utilizing intraoperative imaging and deformation modeling to improve surgeon accuracy and confidence. A CT-compatible laryngoscopy system previously developed was evaluated in this framework. Intraoperative images were acquired during laryngoscopy; force-sensing capabilities were enabled in the laryngoscope; and tracking of the scope and anatomic features was trialed. Tissue deformation and displacement were quantified and determined to be extensive, with values <; 4.6 cm in the tongue, <; 1.8 cm in bony structures, and <; 108.9 cm3 in airway volume change. Surgical navigation using intraoperative imaging and tracking was evaluated. Preliminary assessment of deformation modeling showed potential to supplement intraoperative imaging. Future work will involve streamlined integration of the components of this framework.

Objective To develop a valid research tool to measure infant respiratory illness severity using parent-reported symptoms. Study design Nose and throat swabs were collected monthly for 1 year and during respiratory illnesses for 2 years in a prospective study of term and preterm infants in the Prematurity, Respiratory Outcomes, Immune System and Microbiome study. Viral pathogens were detected using Taqman Array Cards. Parents recorded symptoms during respiratory illnesses using a Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) scorecard. The COAST score was validated using linear mixed effects regression modeling to evaluate associations with hospitalization and specific infections. A data-driven method was also used to compute symptom weights and derive a new score, the Infant Research Respiratory Infection Severity Score (IRRISS). Linear mixed effects regression modeling was repeated with the IRRISS illness data. Results From April 2013 to April 2017, 50 term, 40 late preterm, and 28 extremely low gestational age (<29 weeks of gestation) infants had 303 respiratory illness visits with viral testing and parent-reported symptoms. A range of illness severity was described with 39% of illness scores suggestive of severe disease. Both the COAST score and IRRISS were associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection and hospitalization. Gestational age and human rhinovirus infection were inversely associated with both scoring systems. The IRRISS and COAST scores were highly correlated (r = 0.93; P < .0001). Conclusions Using parent-reported symptoms, we validated the COAST score as a measure of respiratory illness severity in infants. The new IRRISS score performed as well as the COAST score.

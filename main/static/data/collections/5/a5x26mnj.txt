RESEARCH QUESTION: Discontinuation of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles has been part of the radical transformation of healthcare provision to enable reallocation of staff and resources to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to estimate the impact of cessation of treatment on individual prognosis and United States population live-birth rates. DESIGN: Data from 271,438 ovarian stimulation UK IVF cycles was used to model the effect of age as a continuous, yet non-linear, function on cumulative live-birth rate. We recalibrated this model to cumulative live-birth rates reported for the 135,6733 stimulation cycles undertaken in the USA in 2016, with live-birth follow-up to October 2018. We calculated the effect of a one-month, three-month and six-month shutdown in IVF treatment as the effect of the equivalent increase in a woman's age, stratified by age group. RESULTS: The average reduction in cumulative live-birth rate would be 0.3% [95% CI: 0.3, 0.3], 0.8% [0.8, 0.8] and 1.6% [1.6, 1.6] for a one-month, three-month and six-month shutdown, respectively. This corresponds to a reduction of 369 [95% CI; 360, 378), 1,098 [1071, 1123] and 2,166 [2,116, 2,216] live-births in the cohort, respectively. The greatest contribution to this reduction was from older mothers. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the discontinuation of fertility treatment for even 1 month in the USA could result in 369 fewer women having a live-birth, due to the increase in patientsâ€™ age during the shutdown. As a result of reductions in cumulative live-birth rate, more cycles may be required to overcome infertility at an individual and population level.Introduction

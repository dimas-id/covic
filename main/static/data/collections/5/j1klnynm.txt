Viruses are considered as causative agents and contributors to lesion expression in autoimmune disease, notions best supported by studies in animal model systems. This review discusses relationships between virus infection and autoimmunity focusing on mechanisms by which they could induce autoreactivity. The popular idea of molecular mimicry is viewed skeptically with the reviewers taking the viewpoint that viruses contribute to autoimmunity mainly by inducing several nonspecific inflammatory events that together are sufficient to trigger autoreactivity in genetically receptive hosts.

The use of barbed sutures for constructing an anastomosis is favoured by a few bariatric surgeons as compared to conventional sutures. The aim of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of barbed sutures to close the gastric pouch-jejunal anastomosis (GPJA) in laparoscopic gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass-RYGB, and One-Anastomosis gastric bypass-OAGB) using propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic gastric bypasses between January 2012 and December 2017 was performed. Patients were divided into two different groups (RYGB-G and OAGB-G). PSM analysis was performed to minimize patient selection bias between the two types of sutures (barbed-BS and conventional-CS) in each group. A total of 808 patients were reviewed. After PSM, 488 (244 BS vs 244 CS) patients in RYGB-G and 48 in OAGB-G (24 BS vs 24 CS) patients were compared. Median operative time was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) for BS in RYGB-G. In OAGB-G, BS were associated with a shorter operative time, although no significant difference was observed (p = 0.183). Post-operative hospital stay was significantly shorter for BS in both the groups (p < 0.001). Post-operative 30th-day complications were comparable: no leakage or bleeding of GPJA was observed in BS groups. At median follow-up of 28.78 months, no late complications were observed. Barbed sutures appear to be effective to close GPJA during gastric bypass and as safe as conventional suture. Further studies are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.

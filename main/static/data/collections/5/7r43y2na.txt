Nonstructural protein (nsp) 3 is the largest of 16 nsps translated from the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) genome. The N-terminal most domain of nsp3, nsp3a, has been identified by reverse genetics as a likely binding partner of MHV nucleocapsid protein. Here we report the backbone and side chain resonance assignments of MHV nsp3a (residues 1â€“114).

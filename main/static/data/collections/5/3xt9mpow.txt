Ten and seven years ago respectively, the two high-isolation units in Denmark became prepared to receive highly contagious and potential severely ill patients. The units are located in the departments of infectious diseases in Hvidovre Hospital and Aarhus University Hospital. Both departments had little experience until the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, 2013-2015. Altogether, 15 possible Ebola patients were examined in the two departments, but the diagnosis was ruled out for all of them. Besides, a few possible candidates for Middle East respiratory syndrome patients were examined. Always being prepared in a busy clinical everyday environment is a challenge, and it takes regular training and exercises involving all personnel.

In this study, several in vivo and in vitro comparisons were performed to test the possibility of using adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), a more convenient cell source than dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), in tooth regeneration. Using an efficient, non-engineering implantation method, we first demonstrated that both implants of ADSCs and DPSCs were able to grow self-assembled new teeth in adult rabbit extraction sockets with high success rate. The stem cells were necessary because the implants grew no tooth without them. A stepwise comparison showed that the regenerated teeth from these two types of adult stem cells were living with nerves and vascular system and remarkably similar to a normal tooth in many details. Further strictly controlled, side-by-side comparisons between the two types of stem cells also showed that the expression patterns of gene markers and the broad differentiation potentials induced by specific methods in vitro were very similar. Although a few differences were found, they did not affect the tested tooth regeneration in vivo or differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, rabbit ADSCs had a higher growth rate and a better senescence resistance in culture. All these findings suggest that ADSCs, one of the richest adult stem cells in mammals, are very similar and useful as DPSCs for regenerative dentistry.

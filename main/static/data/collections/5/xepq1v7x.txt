The novel coronavirus COVID-19 originally identified in December 2019, based on the data issued by March 30, 2020 daily report, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 so far has caused 693224 cases and resulted in 33106 deaths in more than 200 countries. Referring to the data reported, World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. We considered the chain-binomial type of the model which involves short stages of high infectivity and approximately constant incubation periods. This research paper is to study and analyze the COVID-19 Virus spreading statistics on the examples of the cases from the different counties. High correlation coefficients (91.64%) and determinants (83.98%) between the total volumes of virus spread and recovery are considered to be high and indicate the correctness of the Bailey model. Thus, as of March 30, with the results of statistical and mathematical data processing, it is difficult to predict the future spread-reduction variables of the pandemic.

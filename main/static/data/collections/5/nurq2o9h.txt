INTRODUCTION There is an ongoing debate on which procedure provides the best treatment for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the pathomechanisms of diabetes improvement of partly anatomically differing operations is not fully understood. METHODS A loop duodenojejunostomy (DJOS) with exclusion of one third of intestinal length, a sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or a combination of DJOS + SG was performed in 8-week-old male ZDF rats. One, three, and six months after surgery, an oral glucose tolerance test and measurements of GLP-1, GIP, insulin, and bile acids were conducted. RESULTS After an initial (4 weeks) equal glucose control, DJOS and DJOS + SG showed significantly lower glucose levels than SG 3 and 6 months after surgery. There was sharp decline of insulin levels in SG animals over time, whereas insulin levels in DJOS and DJOS + SG were preserved. GIP levels were significantly larger in both groups containing a sleeve at all three time points, whereas GLP-1 was equal in all groups at all time. Bile acid levels were significantly higher in the DJOS compared to the SG group at all time points. Interestingly, the additional SG in the DJOS + SG group led to lower bile acid levels 1 and 6 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION The effect of SG on glucose control was transient, whereas a duodenal exclusion was the more effective procedure in this model due to a sustained pancreatic function with a preserved insulin secretion.

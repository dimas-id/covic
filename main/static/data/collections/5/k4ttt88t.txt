Abstract The US government (USG) has not fully implemented a robust system to evaluate dual-use research (DUR). In particular, the USG has failed to effectively fund, support, and expand the role of the local Institutional Biosafety Committee in the oversight of DUR and in the changing scientific landscape; a comprehensive education program for all in life sciences research with regard to the dual-use dilemma has not been forthcoming; and finally, there has been no systematic evaluation of the impact of USG policy, regulations, and guidance on an institutionâ€™s cost structure and on scientific discovery. We detail our judgments on current USG DUR policy and provide recommendations for future oversight of DUR from our perspective as senior administrators and laboratory scientists charged with the responsibility of conducting life-sciences research in an era of increasing regulatory requirements and decreasing federal support.

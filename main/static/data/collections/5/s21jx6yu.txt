BACKGROUND Although effective, duodenal switch can be a complicated and time-consuming operation for surgeons. PURPOSE The purpose of this article is to present our technique of biliopancreatic diversion and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, creating a 150-cm common channel and a 100-cm alimentary limb. MATERIAL AND METHODS A robot-assisted technique was utilized in creating a biliopancreatic diversion and vertical sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS Laparoscopy was used for marking stitches and then the robot was docked. After creating a window behind the duodenum, sleeve gastrectomy is performed followed by duodeno-ileal anastomosis and ileo-ileal anastomosis. CONCLUSION With the adoption of robots and the described technique, it can be easier to be achieved in less time.

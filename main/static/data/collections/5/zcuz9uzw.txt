Abstract Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) causes diarrhoea in young turkey poults but little is known about its prevalence in the field. To address this, a portion of the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein of TCoV carrying relevant B cell epitopes (amino acid positions 54â€“395) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. This protein was purified and used to develop an indirect ELISA for detection of antibodies against TCoV. Using experimentally derived positive and negative turkey serum samples this ELISA showed high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (92%) for TCoV. To further evaluate the potential of the ELISA, 360 serum samples from commercial turkey farms in Ontario were tested for TCoV-specific antibodies using the recombinant TCoV ELISA. High seroprevalence of TCoV was found with 71.11% of breeders and 56.67% of meat turkeys testing seropositive. Although there was significant positive correlation with a TCoV-N protein-based ELISA, there was little to no correlation with the whole IBV antigen-based ELISA when field sera were tested for antibodies against TCoV.

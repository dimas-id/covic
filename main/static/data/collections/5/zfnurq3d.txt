Abstract Recombinant antibodies and their derivatives are increasingly being used as therapeutic agents. Clinical applications of antibodies often require large amounts of highly purified molecules, sometimes for multiple treatments. The development of very efficient expression systems is essential to the full exploitation of the antibody technology. Production of recombinant protein in the milk of transgenic dairy animals is currently being tested as an alternative to plasma fractionation for the manufacture of a number of blood factors (human antithrombin, human alpha-1-antitrypsin, human serum albumin, factor IX). The ability to routinely yield mg/ml levels of antibodies and the scale-up flexibility make transgenic production an attractive alternative to mammalian cell culture as a source of large quantities of biotherapeutics. The following review examines the potential of transgenic expression for the production of recombinant therapeutic antibodies.

Recently emerged beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the current pandemic designated COVID-19. COVID-19 manifests as severe illness exhibiting systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombotic events, and shock, exacerbated further by co-morbidities and age1â€“3. Recent clinical reports suggested that the pulmonary failure seen in COVID-19 may not be solely driven by acute ARDS, but also microvascular thrombotic events, likely driven by complement activation4,5. However, it is not fully understood how the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms mediate thrombotic events, and whether such mechanisms and responses are unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other respiratory infections. We address these questions here, in the context of normal lung epithelia, in vitro and in vivo, using publicly available data. Our results indicate that plasmin is a crucial mediator which primes interactions between complement and platelet-activating systems in lung epithelia upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a potential for therapeutic intervention.

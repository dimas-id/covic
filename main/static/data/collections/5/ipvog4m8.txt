Objectives: To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study regarding use of IFN beta-1a in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial efficacy and safety of IFN {beta}-1a has been evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Forty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN beta-1a in addition to the standard of care. Each 44 micrograms/ml (12 million IU/ml) of interferon beta-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks. The control group received only the standard of care. Primary outcome of study was time to reach clinical response. Secondary outcomes duration of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects and complications during the hospitalization. Results: As primary outcome, time to the clinical response was not significantly different between the IFN and the control groups (9.7 +/- 5.8 vs. 8.3 +/- 4.9 days respectively, P=0.95). On day 14, 66.7% vs. 43.6% of patients in the IFN group and the control group were discharged, respectively (OR= 2.5; 95% CI: 1.05- 6.37). The 28-day overall mortality was significantly lower in the IFN then the control group (19% vs. 43.6% respectively, p= 0.015). Early administration significantly reduced mortality (OR=13.5; 95% CI: 1.5-118). Conclusion: Although did not change time to reach the clinical response, adding to the standard of care significantly increased discharge rate on day 14 and decreased 28-day mortality.

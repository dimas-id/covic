The relative safety of unruptured aneurysm treatment with coiling versus flow diversion therapy is unknown. Most data available on flow diversion reflect highly focused patient groups and very experienced operators. We evaluated a national, multihospital patient database to examine periprocedural morbidity and mortality in patients treated with endovascular flow diversion therapy. The Premier Perspective database was used to identify patients hospitalized between May 2011 and March 2013 for unruptured aneurysm who underwent flow diversion therapy with a Pipeline embolization device. The risk of in-hospital mortality and morbidity was determined using ICD 9 codes. A total of 279 unruptured aneurysm patients at 18 medical centers underwent endovascular therapy with a Pipeline device. Adverse outcomes included in-hospital mortality in two cases (0.7%), discharge to long-term care in 22 cases (7.9%), ischemic complications in 14 cases (5.0%), hemorrhagic complications in four cases (1.4%), and postoperative neurological complications in nine cases (3.2%). This study of a large cohort of patient hospitalizations in the United States provides preliminary data on flow diversion in a "real world" scenario and demonstrates that the periprocedural morbidity and mortality is not negligible and must be considered in the context of the natural history of the aneurysms that are being treated.

Here, we report a case of adenoviral pneumonia associated with critical ARDS treated with Cidofovir, prone ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patient responded well to therapy and recovered without further complications. Cidofovir, with early prone ventilation and ECMO support, may be a therapeutic option for patients with critical ARDS related to adenoviral pneumonia.

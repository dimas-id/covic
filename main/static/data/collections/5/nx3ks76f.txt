Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid-origin cells which have immunosuppressive activities in several conditions, such as cancer and inflammation. Recent research has also associated MDSCs with numerous obstetrical and gynecological diseases. During pregnancy, MDSCs accumulate to ensure maternal-fetal immune tolerance, whereas they are decreased in patients who suffer from early miscarriage or preeclampsia. While the etiology of endometriosis is still unknown, abnormal accumulation of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid, alongside an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been observed in these patients, which is central to the cellular immune regulations by MDSCs. Additionally, the regulation of MDSCs observed in tumors is also applicable to gynecologic neoplasms, including ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. More recently, emerging evidence has shown that there are high levels of MDSCs in premature ovarian failure (POF) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this review, the generation and mechanisms of MDSCs are summarized. In particular the modulation of these cells in immune-related obstetrical and gynecological diseases is discussed, including potential treatment options targeting MDSCs.

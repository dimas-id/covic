Antimicrobial peptides are an essential component of innate immunity and play an important role in host defence against microbial pathogens. They have received increasing attention recently as potential novel pharmaceutical agents. To meet the requirement for necessary basic science studies and clinical trials, large quantities of these peptides are needed. In general, isolation from natural sources and chemical synthesis are not cost‐effective. The relatively low cost and easy scale‐up of the recombinant approach renders it the most attractive means for large‐scale production of antimicrobial peptides. Among the many systems available for protein expression, Escherichia coli remains the most widely used host. Antimicrobial peptides produced in E. coli are often expressed as fusion proteins, which effectively masks these peptides' potential lethal effect towards the bacterial host and protects the peptides from proteolytic degradation. Although some carriers confer peptide solubility, others promote the formation of inclusion bodies. The present minireview considers the most commonly used carrier proteins for fusion expression of antimicrobial peptides in E. coli. The favourable properties of SUMO (small ubiquitin‐related modifier) as a novel fusion partner are also discussed.

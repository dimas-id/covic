Three precipitin reactions associated with bovine rotavirus infection were demonstrable by immunodiffusion. One of the reactions has been utilized in a diagnostic test for the detection of rotavirus in faeces, or specific antibody to rotavirus group antigen in serum or faeces. The test, based on bovine materials, appeared to be group-specific and effective in demonstrating rotaviral antigen or antibody in other species of animals, including human beings. The procedure was as efficient as electron microscopy in detecting evidence of rotavirus in faeces of calves and a range of other species.

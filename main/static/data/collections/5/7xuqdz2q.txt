The clinical and epidemiologic management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is critically dependent on molecular assays with short turn-around time. We validated the novel Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay using a commercial nucleic acid testing (Roche Cobas 6800). We found an excellent concordance over a range of SARS-CoV-2 loads and across established human coronaviruses.

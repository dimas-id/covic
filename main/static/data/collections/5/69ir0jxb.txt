Abstract The constituents of Cimicifuga plants have been extensively investigated, and the principal metabolites are 9, 19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides, which often exhibit extensive pharmacological activities. 9, 19-Cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides are distributed widely in genus Cimicifuga rather than in other members of the Ranunculaceae family. So far, more than 140 cycloartane triterpene glycosides have been isolated from Cimicifuga spp.. The aim of this review was to summarize all 9, 19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides based on the available relevant scientific literatures from 2000 to 2014. Biological studies of cycloartane triterpene glycosides from Cimicifuga spp. are also discussed.

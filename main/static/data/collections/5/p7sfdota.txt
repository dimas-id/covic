This chapter introduces the topics of the book and summarizes all of the other chapters. We take the broadest possible view of what constitutes a bailout or bail-in in order to ensure that we leave no stone unturned. We also cover methods to reduce the need for such costly procedures. We place a large focus on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout because of its importance and depth of research, but the coverage of other alternatives is quite extensive.

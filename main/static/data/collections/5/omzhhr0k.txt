Abstract Infectious diseases are caused from pathogens, which need a reliable and fast diagnosis. Today, expert personnel and centralized laboratories are needed to afford much time in diagnosing diseases caused from pathogens. Recent progress in electrochemical studies shows that biosensors are very simple, accurate, precise, and cheap at virus detection, for which researchers find great interest in this field. The clinical levels of these pathogens can be easily analyzed with proposed biosensors. Their working principle is based on affinity between antibody and antigen in body fluids. The progress still continues on these biosensors for accurate, rapid, reliable sensors in future.

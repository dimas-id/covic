In this paper, we propose online algorithms for multiclass classification using partial labels. We propose two variants of Perceptron called Avg Perceptron and Max Perceptron to deal with the partially labeled data. We also propose Avg Pegasos and Max Pegasos, which are extensions of the Pegasos algorithm. We also provide mistake bounds for Avg Perceptron and regret bound for Avg Pegasos. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches by experimenting on various datasets and comparing them with the standard Perceptron and Pegasos.

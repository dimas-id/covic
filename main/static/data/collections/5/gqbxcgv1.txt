We performed integrative analysis of genes associated with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) associated complications by automated text mining with manual curation and also gene expression analysis from Gene Expression Omnibus. They were analysed for pathogenic or protective role, trends, interaction with risk factors, Gene Ontology enrichment and tissue wise differential expression. The database T2DiACoD houses 650 genes, and 34 microRNAs associated with T2DM complications. Seven genes AGER, TNFRSF11B, CRK, PON1, ADIPOQ, CRP and NOS3 are associated with all 5 complications. Several genes are studied in multiple years in all complications with high proportion in cardiovascular (75.8%) and atherosclerosis (51.3%). T2DM Patientsâ€™ skeletal muscle tissues showed high fold change in differentially expressed genes. Among the differentially expressed genes, VEGFA is associated with several complications of T2DM. A few genes ACE2, ADCYAP1, HDAC4, NCF1, NFE2L2, OSM, SMAD1, TGFB1, BDNF, SYVN1, TXNIP, CD36, CYP2J2, NLRP3 with details of protective role are catalogued. Obesity is clearly a dominant risk factor interacting with the genes of T2DM complications followed by inflammation, diet and stress to variable extents. This information emerging from the integrative approach used in this work could benefit further therapeutic approaches. The T2DiACoD is available at www.http://t2diacod.igib.res.in/.

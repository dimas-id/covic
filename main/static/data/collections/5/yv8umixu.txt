Infection, in particular by respiratory viruses, plays an important role in triggering exacerbations and has also been implicated in the etiology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This chapter reviews the epidemiological evidence that implicates infectious pathogens as triggers. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of interaction between the host-pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology resulting in an exacerbation. Much of the treatment of infective exacerbations for both asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of bronchodilators or supportive in the form of oxygen, and in severe cases it includes noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures. The current therapy for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD relies on increased treatment of preexisting disease. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections. The effective use of antiviral agents, particularly for influenza viruses, requires viral diagnosis, commencement of treatment early in the course of an exacerbation, or the targeting of high-risk groups for prophylaxis. Alternative strategies for drug development involve the identification of key factors common to exacerbations induced by a range of different viruses. Increased knowledge of the hostâ€“virus interaction can help in designing treatments that can increase virus clearance and minimize immunopathology.

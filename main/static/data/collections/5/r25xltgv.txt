As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic posed a huge challenge to global public health, emphasis on personal hygiene caused extraordinary daily use of detergents and household cleaning products. Since antibacterial cleaning products have the capacity to change the environmental microbiome, increased exposure to household disinfectants could be associated with alterations in human microbiota composition and function. Moreover, the emerging links between household cleaning products and occurrence of non-communicable diseases and antibiotic resistance may involve the gut microbiome. The mediating effects of disturbed gut microbiota on associations between home use of cleaning products and life-long health consequences have been documented in some observational studies. Regarding the evidence associated reduction in exposure to non-pathogenic commensal bacteria and gut dysbiosis, further study is required to assess the effect of massive use of cleaning products during COVID-19 pandemic on long-term host health mediated by the altered microbiota. In this context, recommendations to consume probiotics and fermented foods might reverse the consequences by alleviating dysbiosis.

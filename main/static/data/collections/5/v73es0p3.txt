OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Their clinical baseline data were collected. The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients. RESULTS: Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3.206, 95%CI: 1.073-9.583, P<0.05) and depression (OR=9.111, 95%CI: 2.143-38.729, P<0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3.267, 95%CI: 1.082-9.597, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary.

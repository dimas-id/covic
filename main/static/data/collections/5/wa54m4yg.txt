This first-attempted study demonstrated endogenous redox-mediators harvest/application from waste activated sludge (WAS) through freezing/thawing (F/T) pretreatment-enhanced anaerobic acidogenesis coupled with microbial fuel cells (MFCs). A total of 2.57 kWh electricity was produced from per kg soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) via MFCs just in 2 d with about 90% organics removal, which contained 1.152 kWh/kg COD from F/T liquid together with 1.418 kWh/kg COD from fermentation liquid. The fermentation liquor-MFCs fostered higher anodic biodiversity and more power output as compared with the F/T liquid-MFCs. Essentially, the completely endogenous redox mediators-like substances with relatively high redox activities could be retained after MFC electrogenesis from F/T liquid and played electron shuttle-roles sufficiently in enlarging bio-energy production of MFCs, which seemed to be an effective option for harvesting endogenous redox mediators from sludge. This study might inspire progressive thinking toward aims of high-efficiency of resource recycle/bioenergy production from WAS.

BACKGROUND Since first being described in 2009, single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy has been described in a limited number of case reports and small case series. No studies have evaluated single-incision splenectomy in unselected patients, and outcomes of the procedure have not previously been compared to standard laparoscopy. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted to evaluate all single-incision splenectomies performed by a single surgeon between June 2010 and June 2011. Additionally, patients who underwent standard laparoscopic splenectomy by surgeons in the same tertiary referral surgical oncology group were evaluated to serve as a control group. Demographic data, operative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Eight patients underwent successful single-incision splenectomy during the study period without conversion to an open procedure or requiring additional ports. The median operative time was 92.5 min. There was 25 % morbidity and no mortality in the study group. Median length of stay was 4 days. Additionally, 18 patients who underwent standard laparoscopic splenectomy were evaluated for comparison. No significant differences were identified in the preoperative patient characteristics between the two groups. Single-incision splenectomy was associated with a shorter operative time (92.5 vs. 172 min, p = 0.003), lower conversion rate, equivalent length of stay, reduced mortality, similar morbidity, and comparable postoperative narcotic requirements. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision splenectomy is feasible, safe, and efficient in an unselected patient population in the hands of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The single-incision technique is comparable to standard laparoscopic splenectomy in terms of operative time and perioperative outcomes.

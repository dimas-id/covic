Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent demyelinating disease of young adults, affecting an estimated 300,000 individuals in the United States alone. The majority of affected individuals have a relapsing–remitting course while a smaller subset has a more chronic–progressive presentation. Women are affected more often than men, a phenomenon associated with a number of auto-immune diseases. Although the etiology of MS is unknown, it is generally believed that genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors are involved. This chapter discusses these issues as they suggest that exogenous factors are associated with the pathogenesis of this disorder. Recently, the human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) has received considerable attention as an infectious agent candidate that might be associated with the pathogenesis of MS. The chapter focuses on this agent and the data that support the role of this virus in MS disease pathogenesis. A model is proposed, whereby in genetically susceptible individuals, multiple viruses may trigger either a virus-specific or a cross-reactive auto-immune response that results in clinical MS. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that it is a multifactorial disease that develops as a result of host genetics, immune response, and environment.

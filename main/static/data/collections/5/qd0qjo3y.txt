In the absence of therapeutic interventions, and a possible vaccine candidate, the spread of COVID-19 disease and associated fatalities are on the rise The high mutation frequency in the genomic material of these viruses supports their ability to adapt to new environments, resulting in an efficient alteration in tissue tropism and host range Therefore, the coronavirus' health threats could be relevant for the long-term The epidemiological data indicate that age, sex, and cardio-metabolic disease have a significant impact on the spread and severity of COVID-19 In this review, we highlight recent updates on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 among men and women, including children We also discuss the role of the cellular receptors and coreceptors used by the virus to enter host cells on differential infection among men, women, and cardio-metabolic patients

Background and Objective The number of laparoscopic procedures increases annually with an estimated 3% of complications, one third of them linked to Verres' needle or trocar insertion. The safety and efficacy of ports insertion during laparoscopic surgery may be related the technique but also to trocar design. This study aims to compare physical parameters of abdominal wall penetration for 5 different trocars. Methods Eleven pigs were studied. Five different commercially available trocars were randomically inserted at the midline. Real-time video recording of the insertions was achieved to measure the excursion of the abdominal wall and the time and distance the cutting surface of the bladed trocars was exposed inside the abdominal cavity. An especially designed hand sensor was developed and placed between the trocar and the hand of the surgeon to record force required for abdominal wall perforation. Results Greater deformations and forces occurred in nonbladed as compared to bladed trocars, and in conical trocars as compared to pyramidal pointed ones, except for peritoneum perforation. Greater distance and time of blade exposure occurred in pyramidal laminae as compared to conical. Conclusion The bladed trocars have lower forces and deformations in their introduction, and should be those that cause less injury and are more suitable for first entry. Conical and pyramidal trocars with the same blade size showed similar force, deformation, time, and distance of exposed blade.

It has been shown that a single parenteral administration of vaccine containing bacterial ligands for TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9 in mice induced rapid (24 h after administration) and effective (100%), but short-term (96 h) protection against lethal challenge with Salmonella typhimurium. Repeated mucosal applications of this vaccine stimulated long-term (up to 9 months) protection against acute respiratory infections in children of preschool age.

This paper shows the preliminary results of an initial effort to analyse whether explanations associated with a semantic parser help users to generalise the system’s mechanisms regardless of their technical background. With the support of a user-centred experiment with 66 participants, we evaluated the user’s mental model by associating the linguistic features from a set of explanations to the system’s behaviour.

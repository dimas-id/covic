This contribution records the reproductive periods of ten dominant freshwater fish species from the Patos Lagoon and Guaíba Lake (Astyanax fasciatus, Cyphocharax voga, Hoplias malabaricus, Oligosarcus jenynsii, Oligosarcus robustus, Hoplosternum littorale, Loricariichthys anus, Parapimelodus nigribarbis, Trachelyopterus lucenai, Pachyurus bonariensis). Data were derived from monthly samples in Casamento Lake (northern Patos Lagoon; Nov. 2002 to Apr. 2004) and Guaíba Lake (Jun. 2005 to May 2006). The reproductive period was determined according to the monthly variation of the gonadosomatic index (GSI). Fish reproduction was identified during all months of the year. Oligosarcus jenynsii started reproduction in winter, but extended spawning to spring (early warming-water reproduction). Three species also presented reproduction during warming water months, but beginning in spring and finishing in summer (late warm-water reproduction): P. nigribarbis, T. lucenai and P. bonariensis. Three species presented relatively short reproduction periods on summer (spotted warm-water reproduction): H. malabaricus, H. littorale and L. anus, and only one species reproduces almost continuously during warmer waters (long-season warm-water reproduction): A. fasciatus. Finally, two other species presented a very distinct reproductive pattern, starting reproduction on late summer but increasing GSI values along autumn and winter (long-season cooling-water reproducers): C. voga and O. robustus.(AU)

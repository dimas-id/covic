From August 2010 to June 2011, 10 consecutive patients underwent transvaginal NOTES of the adnexa, including tubal sterilization in 3, salpingectomy because of ectopic pregnancy in 3, and ovarian tumor enucleation in 4. The mean (SD; 95% CI) age of the patients was 34.8 (9.7; 27.9-41.8) years, and their body mass index was 21.6 (2.8; 19.4-23.8). In 9 of the 10 patients, the procedure was completed. The 3 tubal sterilization procedures were completed in 18 to 30 minutes, with negligible blood loss. Operative time for the 3 salpingectomies because of ectopic pregnancy was 62 to 116 minutes. One of these procedures included management of 2000 mL hemoperitoneum. Three of the 4 attempts at ovarian enucleation were successfully completed within 64 to 162 minutes, with estimated blood loss â‰¤ 50 mL. One NOTES procedure failed because of a misdiagnosed peritoneal mucinous tumor located anterior to the uterus and inaccessible, leading to subsequent conversion to transabdominal laparoscopy. Our preliminary results show that purely transvaginal NOTES is feasible and safe for use in performing uterine adnexal procedures in selected patients. However, the procedure cannot be used in patients with cul-de-sac disease, and could have limited use in treating lesions located anterior to the uterus.

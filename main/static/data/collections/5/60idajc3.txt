Small bowel capsule endoscopy can detect subtle mucosal lesions in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, and our aim was to evaluate its application in established ileocolonic Crohn's disease. Colonic inflammation was evaluated with the colonic Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) (excluding the score of the terminal ileum). Small bowel inflammation was evaluated with the Lewis score and/or Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CECDAI). A Lewis score <135 was defined as small bowel inactive. A colonic SES-CD of 0 (colonic inactive group) was observed in 22/42 procedures (52.4%), and active small bowel lesions were observed in 11/22 procedures (50.0%). The Lewis score was lower in the colonic inactive group compared to the colonic active group. Correlations between the colonic SES-CD, the Lewis score and CECDAI were weak. The Lewis score and CECDAI in the colonic inactive group had significant correlation with fecal calprotectin levels. We suggest that Crohn's disease patients without both colonic active lesions and elevation of fecal calprotectin levels may not need to receive small bowel capsule endoscopy due to low incidence of lesions in small bowel.

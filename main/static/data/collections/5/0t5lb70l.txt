Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the critical subjects of research in health and human machine interaction fields in recent years. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Decision Tree (DT) and many other algorithms were previously implemented to serve this common goal but most of the traditional Machine learning proposed solutions were not satisfying in term of accuracy and real time testing process. For that, a human activities analysis and recognition system with an embedded trained ANN model on Raspberry PI for an online testing process is proposed in this work. This paper includes a comparative study between the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), using signals produced by the accelerometer and gyroscope, embedded within the BlueNRG-Tile sensor. After evaluate algorithms performance in terms of accuracy and precision which reached an accuracy of 82% for ANN and 99% for RNN, obtained ANN model was implemented in a Raspberry PI for real-time predictions. Results show that the system provides a real-time human activity recognition with an accuracy of 86%.

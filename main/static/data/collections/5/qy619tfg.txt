In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause led to the identification of a new strain of pandemic coronavirus called Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first SARS-CoV outbreak, human coronaviruses are known for their neurological tropism. If respiratory complications are at the forefront of clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2, neurological involvement remains poorly described and understood. We report here two patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who presented with neurological symptoms and signs.

Lobectomy for lung carcinoma is usually associated with complete node dissection, but it is often difficult to perform using video thoracoscopy, especially on the left side. In this case, our team uses an anterior technique for subcarinal lymphadenectomy. After left lobectomy, we lift the bronchial stump by its anterior face to open and dissect the subcarinal space. Exposure is difficult using the more usual technique of posterior subcarinal lymphadenectomy, and the different techniques (often requiring retractors) remain complex because some vessels might be injured. We recommend using anterior lymphadenectomy, which should facilitate video thoracoscopy for lymphadenectomy on the left side.

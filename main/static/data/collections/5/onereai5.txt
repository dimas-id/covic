The computational strategies like molecular docking, simulation, in silico ADMET and drug-likeness prediction were adopted to search potential compounds that can inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the published literatures on medicinal importance, total 154 phytochemicals with analogous structure from limonoids and triterpenoids were selected to search potential inhibitors for the five protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain like protease), SGp-RBD (spike glycoprotein-receptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). Analyses of the in silico computational results and reported medicinal uses, the phytochemicals such as 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, epoxyazadiradione, limonin, maslinic acid, glycyrrhizic acid and ursolic acid were found to be effective against the target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that these phytochemicals bind at the main active site of the target proteins. Therefore, the core structure of these potential hits can be used for further lead optimization to design drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Also, the plants extracts like neem, tulsi, citrus and olives containing these phytochemicals can be used to formulate suitable therapeutics approaches in traditional medicines.

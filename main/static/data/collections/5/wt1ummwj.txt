This paper describes a prospective, observational, single-centre study of 20 consecutive patients with clinical stage I lung carcinoma undergoing anatomical sublobar resections using complete video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (cVATS). Thirteen male and seven female patients with a median age of 68 (range 57-84) years and a median of four (range 0-9) relevant comorbid conditions presented with five right-sided and 15 left-sided tumours, with a median diameter of 2.3 (range 1.0-5.2) cm. Thirteen segmentectomies, three bisegmentectomies and four trisegmentectomies with lymphadenectomy of the N1 stations and the mediastinum were performed, with a median duration of 212 (range 91-397) min, a conversion rate to open surgery of 20% and conversion to lobectomy of 10%. In five patients, we noted 10 postoperative adverse events but no transfusions, no readmissions and zero mortality. Median drainage time was six days, with a median hospital stay of 8.5 days. According to the pTNM classification, 10, three, one, and six patients were staged as Ia, Ib, IIb and IIIa, respectively. The distance between the tumour and the parenchymal stapling line exceeded the tumour diameter in 56%, 0% and 0% of T1a, T1b and T2 tumours, respectively. To conclude, cVATS anatomical sublobar resections are technically feasible. We observed a favourable postoperative course in 20 multimorbid or aged patients. In patients fit for lobectomy, the tumour diameter should not exceed 2 cm.

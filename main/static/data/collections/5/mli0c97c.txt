INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality all around the world. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, mortality and association with clinical entities of influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, and adenoviruses in patients with ARI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During September 2014 till May 2015, 143 respiratory inpatients samples for viral testing collected from central Hospital in Northwest of Iran. A real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay was done to allow in one test the detection of influenza A and B viruses. Also, RSV and adenovirus were identified by Immunochromatography test. RESULTS: Twenty-four (46%) cases were positive for influenza A, which 11 (46%) of them were subtype H1N1 and 13 (54%) cases were subtype H3N2. Also, 21 (40%) cases were positive for influenza B, 5 (10%) cases were positive for RSV, and 2 (4%) cases were positive for adenovirus. One of the patients was positive for both influenza A and adenovirus. Two of the patients were positive for both influenza A and RSV. None of the patients were positive for coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the importance of influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, RSV, and adenoviruses associated with ARI in hospitalized patient and the different epidemiological patterns of the viruses in Tabriz, Iran.

BACKGROUND: At the end of 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, called Sars-CoV-2, was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency. In February 2020, WHO designated the disease COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the degree of knowledge of young Italians about COVID-19 and their current attitudes towards the Sars-CoV-2 and to determine if there were prejudices emerging toward Chinese. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on 3rd-4th-5th February 2020 with the collaboration of Italian Website "Skuola.net". Young people had the opportunity to participate by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new Coronavirus, using a link published on the Homepage. RESULTS: 5234 responses were received of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males. Most of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about COVID-19. Male students, middle school students and those who do not attend school, should increase awareness of the disease; less than half of responders say that their attitudes towards the Chinese population has worsened in the last period. CONCLUSIONS: Global awareness of this emerging infection should be increased, due to its virulence, the significant risk of mortality and the ability of the virus to spread very quickly within the community.

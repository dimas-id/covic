BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has an impact also on neurosurgical training and education, especially in most affected countries. We surveyed Italian neurosurgical residents, asking them to provide a brief description and analyze the situation they are experiencing and how the educational system reacted to the pandemic in one of the most affected countries all over the world. METHODS: An 18-question, web-based survey was administered to Italian neurosurgical residents from May 3 to May 11, 2020, by web-link or e-mail invitation. Closed-ended, multiple choice questions were focused on the experience of neurosurgical residents in the last 2 months (from March to May 2020) concerning both clinical and educational aspects. RESULTS: Among 331 Italian neurosurgical residents invited to participate, 192 responded to the survey (58%). According to the participants' responses, in the whole country, only 29.7% of residents were directly involved in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Time spent in the clinic and surgical activity was significantly reduced in most of the cases. Educational activities as well as scientific activity and time spent for studying, on the other hand, were reported to be significantly increased by the majority of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Most Italian neurosurgical residents reported significant changes on both training and education, highlighting a prompt reaction of the educational system in the whole country, regardless the local and regional diffusion of the pandemic.

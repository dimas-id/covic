The surgical techniques and associated devices for meniscus repair have improved over time, spurred in part by the clear recognition of the benefits of meniscal preservation and in part by the introduction of ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene containing sutures. The desires for more minimally invasive techniques that decrease the risks of neurovascular injury and articular cartilage excoriation have seen 1 device generation after another introduced and improved upon. The current generation of meniscal repair all-inside devices are easier to use, limit the presence of material on the meniscal surface, and are self-adjusting and suture based. Although the speed of meniscus fixation device development places increasingly useful devices in surgeons' hands, clinical evidence of their effectiveness lag behind.

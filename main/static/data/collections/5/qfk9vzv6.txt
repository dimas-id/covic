AIMS This study describes a novel nerve block directed at the maxillary (V2) division of the fifth cranial nerve as treatment for medication-refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN). METHODS AND RESULTS The authors present three cases of TN treated with V2 nerve block using commonly available local anesthetics injected through the greater palatine foramen. Patients' medications were noted before and after the procedure. Following the injection, patients were followed over time and outcome was assessed. Patients experienced rapid and long-lasting pain relief allowing for significant reduction in antineuralgia medications. This was done with the objective of breaking the pain cycle with subsequent discontinuation or reduction of analgesic medications. CONCLUSION This technique may be an effective treatment for medication-refractory V2 TN. By interrupting the pain cycle, this renders the condition amenable to long-term control using diminished doses of standard antineuralgia pharmaceuticals. The practical implications of the described procedure are that it is simple, safe, and well-tolerated with few or no adverse effects. This novel technique is a diagnostic feature for the dentist to differentiate between sources of facial pain.

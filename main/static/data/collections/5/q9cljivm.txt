BACKGROUND Wide-band tympanometry (WBT) was introduced as a beneficial diagnostic test for Ménière's disease (MD) almost 15 years ago. However, an acute episode of MD has not been evaluated by using WBT yet. OBJECTIVE To investigate WBT findings in patients with MD during acute attacks. METHOD Thirty definite MD patients with unilateral acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss and aural fullness, and thirty age- and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled prospectively in a tertiary referral center. Ears were divided into three groups as follows: (1) affected ears of MD patients, (2) contralateral ears of MD patients, (3) control ears. Individuals underwent WBT. The resonance frequency (RF), mean absorbance value, mean low- and high-frequency absorbance values (LF-A and HF-A), and double peak width at 2 kHz of conductance tympanometry (2-kHz PW) were assessed. RESULTS Seventy percent in group 1, 66.7% in group 2, and 78.3% in group 3 demonstrated double peaks at 2 kHz. The mean 2-kHz PW values were 157.52 ± 79.19, 177.40 ± 79.14, and 139.64 ± 87.501 daPa for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to 2-kHz PW, RF, absorbance, LF-A, and HF-A. CONCLUSION This was the first study that evaluated the effects of acute Ménière attacks on WBT findings. An acute Ménière attack was found to have no significant effect on the 2-kHz PW and other variables measured using WBT.

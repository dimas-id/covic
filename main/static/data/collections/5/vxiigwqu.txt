Examination of serum specimens from a patient with chronic active hepatitis proved negative to the Australia-SH antigen by immunodiffusion and by complement fixation. Because the sera were anticomplementary they were examined with the electron microscope, and virus-like structures similar to members of the coronavirus group were identified. The possible significance of this finding in human serum and its relation to mouse hepatitis virus are discussed.A sample of the serum pool containing the MS-1 agent was found negative when examined by immunodiffusion, complement fixation, and electron microscopy. The possible lack of immunological identity between infectious and serum hepatitis is discussed.

BACKGROUND Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection in developed countries and is a known cause of intrauterine fetal death. We examined CMV infection in stillbirths and the relationship with histopathological findings at autopsy. METHODS We collected liver, kidney, and placenta specimens from 130 stillbirths. CMV DNA and protein were detected using polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, along with routine autopsy of stillborn infants. RESULTS Overall, CMV DNA was detected in 15% of singleton, >20-week stillborn infants. CMV DNA was detected in kidney (9%), liver (11%), and placenta (5%) specimens, with 75% of infections confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Fetal thrombotic vasculopathy was the only histopathological abnormality associated with CMV infection (in 60% CMV-infected vs 28% uninfected stillbirths P = .010). CONCLUSIONS Stillbirth has multiple etiologies. However, the detection of CMV DNA in 15% of fetal tissues or placentae suggests a strong association between CMV infection in pregnancy and stillbirth. Molecular testing during postmortem investigation has an important role to determine the contribution of CMV infection.

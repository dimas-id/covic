The cytoplasmic replication of positive-sense RNA viruses is associated with a dramatic rearrangement of host cellular membranes. These virus-induced changes result in the induction of vesicular structures that envelop the virus replication complex (RC). In this study, we have extended our previous observations on the intracellular location of West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNV(KUN)) to show that the virus-induced recruitment of host proteins and membrane appears to occur at a pre-Golgi step. To visualize the WNV(KUN) replication complex, we performed three-dimensional (3D) modeling on tomograms from WNV(KUN) replicon-transfected cells. These analyses have provided a 3D representation of the replication complex, revealing the open access of the replication complex with the cytoplasm and the fluidity of the complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, we provide data that indicate that a majority of the viral RNA species housed within the RC is in a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) form.

SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) is highly-contagious. It can lead to respiratory distress—and some cases—death. Recent reports and observations have identified an association between COVID-19 and manifestations in the feet. However, there are very few reports that describe the course of these foot manifestations in any detail. The authors present a case study chronicling the progression of foot issues in a COVID-19 positive patient who also was positive for the Epstein-Barr virus.

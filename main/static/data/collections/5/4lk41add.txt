Diarrhea is the most frequently diagnosed disease in Swiss cow-calf farms. During an longitudinal study conducted in 105 cow-calf farms in Switzerland in 1993-95, blood and fecal samples were collected from diarrheic calves and from calves that died because of diarrhea. Campylobacter spp. were detected in 42%, E. coli (VTEC) in 32%, rotavirus in 33%, coronavirus in 13%, coccidia in 43% and helminths in 8% of the cases. In some samples Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were isolated. The BVD-virus antigen was not detected in any of the calves examined. In most cases concurrent infection with several enteropathogens was diagnosed. Specific causes of diarrhea were therefore difficult to establish. The bacteriological findings of this study have implication for food safety: VTEC, Campylobacter spp. Yersinia spp. and cryptosporidia are considered as potential causes on zoonoses.

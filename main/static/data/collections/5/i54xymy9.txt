Coronaviruses have a marked tropism for epithelial cells. In this paper the interactions of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) with epithelial cells are compared. Porcine (LLC-PK1) and murine (mTAL) epithelial cells were grown on permeable supports. By inoculation from the apical or basolateral side both TGEV and MHV-A59 were found to enter the polarized cells only through the apical membrane. The release of newly synthesized TGEV from LLC-PK1 cells occurred preferentially from the apical plasma membrane domain, as evidenced by the accumulation of viral proteins and infectivity in the apical culture fluid. In contrast, MHV was released preferentially from the basolateral membrane of mTAL cells. The apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV may explain the in vivo establishment of a local and systemic infection, respectively.

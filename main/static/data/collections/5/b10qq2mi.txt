Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a very rare syndrome with a mortality up to 95% of cases if not treated. It is characterised by an excessive activation of the immune system that leads to a disproportionate and destructive inflammatory response. The high mortality rates are in part due to a delay in the diagnosis, and therefore clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion. When the treatment is started early, the survival rate reaches around 55% of cases. HLH usually presents with persistent fever, pancytopenia, and organomegaly and is associated with very high levels of serum ferritin. In this manuscript, we present the case of a patient with primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome who developed HLH after an acute infection by Cytomegalovirus. We will describe and discuss the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and a pragmatic approach to the treatment for this critically important and, when diagnosed early, potentially curable syndrome.

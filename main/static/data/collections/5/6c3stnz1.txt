PURPOSE Idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) is a relatively common complex deformity of the foot that can be successfully managed by the Ponseti method. The purpose of this study was to see if the latter can be effectively administered by non-medical specialists outside a specialist or teaching hospital setting. METHOD Retrospective review of 24 children (39 feet) with idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus managed by a physiotherapist-led service in a district general hospital. RESULTS The median Pirani score at presentation was 4.5 (mean 4.2, range 1.5-6). The median Pirani score for feet requiring tenotomy was 6 (4.5-6), whereas feet not requiring tenotomy had a median Pirani score of 2.5 (1.5-5). A total of 18 feet (46%) underwent an Achilles tenotomy. Foot correction was achieved with an average of 3.4 (2-6) cast changes in the non-tenotomy group, and an average of 7.5 (5-13) in the tenotomy group. Successful initial correction of the deformity was achieved in 37 (95%) of the feet studied. One patient (2 feet, 5%) failed local conservative management, requiring tertiary referral. Two children (2 feet) have relapsed, requiring further serial casting. No children required open surgical release. Follow-up was for a mean of 31 months (17-50). CONCLUSIONS Early results suggest that a combined consultant/physiotherapist-delivered Ponseti service can be effectively and successfully administered in a district general hospital.

In times of economic stringency, the prerequisite for the provision of healthcare services differentiated by complexity is identified in the right patients' allocation. Since access to high-intensity care units is restricted, it is necessary both to promptly diagnose patients who are at risk of rapid clinical deterioration or death and to define criteria to identify the correct allocation of patients based on clinical-care needs. Although the so-called "early warning scores" were used by healthcare professionals to alert medical staff, nowadays, they can also be used as decision rules for managing patient admissions, increasing their effective usefulness. The procedure for assessing the complexity of care profiles needs to be based on a multidisciplinary approach. The primary objective of scientific research was to determine the intensity of care (clinical instability and care dependence) of the patients allocated in different settings of the medical area. To correctly frame the phenomenon, the main methods and strategies developed for different care models were discussed. In the Italian healthcare organization, the indicators, methodologies and tools to evaluate the clinical-care complexity were identified and subsequently applied. In conclusion, the findings and proposals for improvement actions are shown.

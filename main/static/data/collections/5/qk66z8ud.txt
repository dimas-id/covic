BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become an immense public health burden, first in China and subsequently worldwide. Developing effective control measures for COVID-19, especially measures that can halt the worsening of severe cases to a critical status is of urgent importance. CASE SUMMARY A 52-year-old woman presented with a high fever (38.8 °C), chills, dizziness, and weakness. Epidemiologically, she had not been to Wuhan where COVID-19 emerged and did not have a family history of a disease cluster. A blood test yielded a white blood cell count of 4.41 x 109/L (60.6 ± 2.67% neutrophils and 30.4 ± 1.34% lymphocytes). Chest imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass lung changes. Based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Following treatment with early non-invasive ventilation and a bundle pharmacotherapy, she recovered with a good outcome. CONCLUSION Early non-invasive ventilation with a bundle pharmacotherapy may be an effective treatment regimen for the broader population of patients with COVID-19.

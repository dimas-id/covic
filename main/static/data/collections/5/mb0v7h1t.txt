Treatments for diarrhoea in animals include antibiotics, antisecretory drugs, adsorbents and fluid therapy. Of these, antibiotics have a role in bacterial disease, but are probably often used in cases where they contribute little. Other drug approaches (antisecretory, adsorbents, etc.) may in the future be useful, but those so far available do not appear very effective. Fluid therapy, especially by the oral route, is rational, is effective in both bacterial and viral diarrhoea, and should be the treatment of first choice.

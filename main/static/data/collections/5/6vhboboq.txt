The health crisis due to the outbreak of Coronavirus since the beginning of 2020 has strongly exposed the effect of decades of public service cuts in France, especially in the fields of education or health. Although the French President has recently declared that the living conditions of people with disabilities were a “national priority”, this issue has not been addressed by public authorities while managing the current crisis. This article analyses and helps to understand the situation of young people with disabilities living in student residences in lockdown for about two months, an issue that has been overlooked. The case study is based on a series of interviews with Joseph, a blind Master's student, and some of his relatives. It looks back on Joseph's experience and academic career, his living conditions in lockdown, his difficulties in coping with distance learning, as well as the resources and support he gets to be able to live and get through.

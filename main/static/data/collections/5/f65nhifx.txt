To learn the role of Legionella pneumophila, the agent of Legionnaires' disease, in childhood illness, a prospective study was conducted among 52 children younger than four years of age with acute disease of the lower respiratory tract. Viral, mycoplasmal, and bacterial cultures and acute- and convalescent-phase sera were obtained during 64 episodes of acute illness; additional sera were drawn annually for three to five years. On the basis of serologic evidence, none of the acute episodes appeared to be due to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 or 2. However, examination of annual serum specimens showed that 27 (52%) of the children had rises in titer of indirect immunofluorescent antibody (a fourfold or greater rise to a reciprocal titer of â©¾128). Most rises in titer were in response to the serogroup 2 antigen. These results suggest that L. pneumophila is not a common cause of acute respiratory disease in early childhood in the study area but that children are frequently exposed to the organism. Alternatively, the serologic responses might be to unrelated cross-reacting microorganisms.

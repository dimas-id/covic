Thymidine triphosphate bearing benzylidene‐tetrahydroxanthylium near‐IR fluorophore linked to the 5‐methyl group via triazole was synthesized through CuAAC reaction and was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA probes. The fluorophore lights up upon incorporation to DNA (up to 348‐times) presumably due to interactions in major groove and the fluorescence further increases in single‐stranded oligonucleotide. The labelled dsDNA senses binding of small molecules and proteins by strong decrease of fluorescence. The nucleotide was used as a light‐up building block in real‐time PCR for detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus.

Abstract This study aims to analyze the administrative behavior of Japanese travel companies overseas. Through case studies and questionnaire surveys, the characteristics of Japanese travel multinationals are compared to those of manufacturing companies. An “Ethnic Model” is developed which explains the unique behavior of these companies. It concludes that they are ethnically characterized in target markets, management styles in foreign subsidiaries, emphases on service, and competitors. Though this study focuses on the Japanese tourism industry, the result is potentially generalizable and applicable to other countries and other non-manufacturing industries.

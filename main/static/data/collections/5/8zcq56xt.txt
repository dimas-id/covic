Four unique phage single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) to recombinant human interleukin 18 (IL-18) has been selected from a naïve combinatorial library of human scFvs. Binding of unique phage antibodies with IL-18 was tested by ELISA and Western-blotting. No cross reactivity with tumor necrosis factor α, interferons α and γ was shown for the selected antibodies. The gene segments encoding V(D)J regions of selected antibodies exhibited a high degree of homology to germline genes, therefore we suggest that the selected scFv's belong to repertoire of naïve autoantibodies.

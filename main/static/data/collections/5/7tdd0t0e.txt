Coagulopathy and elevated D‐dimer levels were recognized as prognostic factors early in Wuhan, China as accompanying more severe COVID‐19 patient cases. We sought to determine the accuracy of normal vs elevated D‐dimer blood levels at presentation, day 1, and on day 3 for predicting 28‐day survival in a large cohort of consecutive PCR‐proven COVID‐19 patients, to help with patient triage, reassurance, and follow‐up management.

This case report describes the reimplantation of a 15-cm osteoarticular segment of the distal tibia in a 14-year-old girl who was hit by a truck. The bone fragment was debrided and reimplanted on the day of injury. A free flap was performed within 1 week. Bony union was achieved without complication. At 5-year follow-up, the patient is able to ambulate for several hours at a time without an assistive device, although arthritis of the ankle joint is present. She scores 43.8 on the physical component of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and 49.0 on the mental component. The patient states that she is very pleased with her outcome. This seems to be the first description of an osteoarticular segment reimplantation of a long bone in the orthopaedic literature.

BACKGROUND No randomized comparative trials have presented long-term outcomes for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The present study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two procedures. METHODS From January 2007 to July 2008, 64 eligible patients were randomly assigned to LSG or LRYGB. During the 5-year follow-up, we compared morbidity rate, body mass index (BMI), percent of excess weight loss (%EWL), Moorehead-Ardelt (M-A) II quality of life, and resolution or improvement rate of obesity-related comorbidities between the groups. RESULTS Both groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and BMI. Slightly more major complications were observed in patients undergoing LRYGB (P > 0.05). Weight loss was significantly better with LRYGB except during the first postoperative year. At 5 years, %EWL for LSG and LRYGB was 63.2 ± 24.5 % and 76.2 ± 21.7 % (P = 0.02), respectively. No statistical difference was observed in quality of life between the groups at all intervals (P > 0.05). At the last follow-up, most comorbidities in both groups were resolved or improved, with no difference between the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION LRYGB and LSG are equally safe and effective in quality of life and improvement or resolution of comorbidities, and LRYGB possesses the superiority in terms of weight loss. Further studies are needed to evaluate micronutrient deficiencies of these procedures.

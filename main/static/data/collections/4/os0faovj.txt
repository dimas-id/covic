There is increasing recognition of infections caused by respiratory viruses (RVs) as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, especially within the thoracic and pediatric population. In addition to their direct, cytopathic, and tissue-invasive effects, RVs can create an inflammatory environment, autoimmune responses, resulting in acute and chronic rejection, although this relationship remains controversial. A laboratory diagnosis in SOT with respiratory syndrome should be performed with nucleic acid amplification tests on respiratory specimens, mainly nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Treatment options remain limited and consist of supportive care, reduction of immunosuppression, and, if available, antiviral therapy. The use of immunomodulatory agents remains a clinical dilemma. Since treatment options for RVs are limited, maximizing prevention measures against viral infections in SOT is mandatory. The main preventive strategy against influenza remains the administration of yearly inactivated influenza vaccine in all SOT. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence-based recommendations on the diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies to decrease the burden of RV infections in SOT recipients.

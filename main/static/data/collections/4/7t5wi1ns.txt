Introduction The study was implemented to provide guidance to decision makers and clinicians by describing hospital care offered to women who gave birth with confirmed COVID 19 infection. Materials and methods National population based prospective cohort study involving all women with confirmed COVID 19 who gave birth between February 25 and April 22, 2020 in any Italian hospital. Results The incidence rate of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in women who gave birth was 2.1 per 1000 maternities at a national level and 6.9/1000 in the Lombardy Region. Overall one third of the women developed a pneumonia and 49.7% assumed at least one drug. Caesarean section rate was 32.9%, no mothers nor newborns died. Six percent of the infants tested positive for SARS CoV 2 at birth. Conclusions Clinical features and outcomes of COVID 19 in women who gave birth are similar to those described for the general population, most women developing mild to moderate illness.

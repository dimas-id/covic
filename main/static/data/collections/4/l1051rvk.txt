Introduction Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the primary treatment method for benign gallbladder diseases. Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was reported to be superior in terms of work return, cosmetic results, and post-operative pain, but limited maneuver capacity and overlapping of hand tools are technical difficulties associated with SILC that endanger patient safety. Aim To perform SILC using a needle grasper for gallbladder traction, thus simplifying the dissection of Calot's triangle. Material and methods The files of patients who underwent elective LC for gallbladder stone and polyps in general surgery clinics between December 2013 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: needle-grasper-assisted SILC (nSILC) and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). Age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, ASA score, duration of operation, duration of post-operative hospital stay, complications, drain use, conversion to open and conventional technique, and oral feeding beginning time were analyzed. Results There were no per-operative or post-operative complications in either of the groups, and no significant differences were found between the groups in terms of complications. The mean duration of the operation was significantly longer in the nSILC group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of hospital stay. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in conventional nSILC were significantly lower for all hours. The patient satisfaction in terms of cosmetic results was better in the nSILC group. Conclusions Needle-grasper-assisted SILC reduces the number of tools that need to be held by surgeons; it also provides safe dissection, better cosmetic results, and less post-operative pain in elective cases.

Harvesting of autografts results in donor site morbidities and is limited in scenarios such as large total body surface area burns. In these instances, coverage is increased by meshing grafts at the expense of delayed biologic closure. Moreover, graft meshing increases the likelihood of contraction and hypertrophic scarring, limits range of motion, and worsens cosmesis. Many tissue engineering technologies have touted the promise of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) for burn wounds. The primary objective of the current study was to determine feasibility and efficacy of in situ ASC delivery via PEGylated fibrin (FPEG) hydrogels as adjuncts to meshed split thickness skin grafts in a porcine model. Deep partial thickness burns were created on the dorsum of anesthetized Yorkshire pigs, and subsequently debrided on post-burn day 4. After debridement, wounds were treated with: split thickness skin grafts (STSG); meshed STSG (mSTSG); and mSTSG + FPEG with increasing doses of ASCs. We show that FPEG hydrogels can be delivered in situ to prevent the contraction seen after meshing of STSG. Moreover, ASCs delivered in FPEG dose-dependently increase blood vessel size which significantly correlates with CD31 protein levels. The current study reports a dual-action adjunct therapy to autografting administered in situ, wherein FPEG acts as both scaffolding to prevent contraction, and as a delivery vehicle for ASCs to accelerate angiogenesis. This strategy may be used to incorporate other biologics for generating tissue engineered products aimed at improving wound healing and minimizing donor sites or scarring.

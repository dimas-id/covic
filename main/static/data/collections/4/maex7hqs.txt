5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) are modified cytosines found in mammals that are involved in the regulation of gene expression. The aim of this study was to characterize the global patterns of 5-mC and 5-hmC of the fetal placenta of Nellore cattle as well as blood and sperm as controls. 5-mC and 5-hmC levels were determined using MethylFlash Methylated/Hydroxymethylated DNA Quantification Kit, respectively. Placenta tissues showed lower levels of 5-mC and 5-hmC compared to sperm. The male cotyledon showed higher levels of 5-hmC than the female. For the first time, the levels of 5-mC and 5-hmC in Bos taurus indicus were characterized, which may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in the placenta. The presence of 5-hmC in somatic tissues suggest that 5-hmC has its own biological function and it is not only a byproduct from the oxidation of 5-mC. These results may be of interest in ARTs, especially in cloning in the diagnosis/prognosis of aberrant placentation and the viability of pregnancies.(AU)

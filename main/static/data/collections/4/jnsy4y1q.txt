The relationships of genome organization among elongated (rod-shaped and filamentous) plant viruses have been analyzed. Sequences in coding and noncoding regions of barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) RNAs 1, 2, and 3 were compared with those of the monopartite RNA genomes of potato virus X (PVX), white clover mosaic virus (WClMV), and tobacco mosaic virus, the bipartite genome of tobacco rattle virus (TRV), the quadripartite genome of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), and icosahedral tricornaviruses. These plant viruses belong to a supergroup having 5â€²-capped genomic RNAs. The results suggest that the genomic elements in each BSMV RNA are phylogenetically related to those of different plant RNA viruses. RNA 1 resembles the corresponding RNA 1 of tricornaviruses. The putative proteins encoded in BSMV RNA 2 are related to the products of BNYVV RNA 2, PVX RNA, and WClMV RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that BSMV RNA 3 resembles TRV RNA 1. Also, it can be proposed that in the case of monopartite genomes, as a rule, every gene or block of genes retains phylogenetic relationships that are independent of adjacent genomic elements of the same RNA. Such differential evolution of individual elements of one and the same viral genome implies a prominent role for gene reassortment in the formation of viral genetic systems.

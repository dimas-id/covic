A multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (multiplex RT-PCR) assay was developed and subsequently evaluated for its efficacy in the detection of multiple viral infections simultaneously, in swine. Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10(âˆ’5) ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation. The relative efficiency (compared to the efficiency of separate assays for each virus) and apparent sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR method show that this method has potential for application in routine molecular diagnostic procedures.

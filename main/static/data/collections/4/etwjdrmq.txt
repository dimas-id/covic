OBJECTIVES Complete haemostasis of the dorsal venous complex (DVC) is of great importance in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of blunt-tip needles in the surgery. METHODS Cases of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were reviewed. If a blunt-tip needle had been used to suture the DVC, the patient was recruited to the blunt-tip group. If a regular needle was used, the patient was recruited to the control group. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS One hundred and nine cases were reviewed. A blunt-tip needle was used to suture the DVC in 67 cases, and a regular needle in 42 cases. All characteristics of the two groups are comparable (p > 0.05). In 66 cases in the blunt-tip group, no sutures or coagulations were needed when suturing the DVC, Five cases of DVC-related bleeding were observed in the control group, which is higher than in the blunt-tip group (p = 0.031). At the same time, no catheter was sutured in the blunt-tip group. All patients were followed for at least six months. The continence rate in the blunt-tip group is 89.6%, significantly higher than in the control group (73.8%, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS Using a blunt-tip needle to suture the DVC may reduce DVC-related bleeding and provide a better surgical field. It may be helpful in improving postoperative continence. However, its effect on positive margin at the apex still needs further investigation.

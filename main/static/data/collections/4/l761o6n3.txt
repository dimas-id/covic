Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the 3′-end of the Japanese F4 strain of feline calicivirus (FCV) RNA was determined from a cloned cDNA of 3.5 kbp. We found three open reading frames (ORFs). The largest ORF encoded a 668-amino acid protein of 73,588 Da, which was presumably the capsid precursor protein of FCV and had significant amino acid sequence homology with the VP3 of picornaviruses. A small ORF at the extreme 3′-end was compared with that of the F9 strain of FCV, a vaccine strain originally from the U.S. Highly conserved amino acid sequences were shown, suggesting that this ORF might be functional and encode a putative 106-amino acid protein of 12,153 Da. The other ORF in the 5′-flanking region of the cDNA had consensus amino acid sequences conserved among the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.

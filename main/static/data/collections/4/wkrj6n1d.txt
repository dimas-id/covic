Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family. Similar to other coronaviruses, PEDV encodes two papain-like proteases. Papain-like protease (PLP)2 has been proposed to play a key role in antagonizing host innate immunity. However, the function of PLP1 remains unclear. In this study, we found that overexpression of PLP1 significantly promoted PEDV replication and inhibited production of interferon-Î². Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify cellular interaction partners of PLP1. Host cell poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) was determined to bind and interact with PLP1. Both endogenous and overexpressed PCBP2 co-localized with PLP1 in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PLP1 upregulated expression of PCBP2. Furthermore, overexpression of PCBP2 promoted PEDV replication. Silencing of endogenous PCBP2 using small interfering RNAs attenuated PEDV replication. Taken together, these data demonstrated that PLP1 negatively regulated the production of type 1 interferon by interacting with PCBP2 and promoted PEDV replication.

INTRODUCTION The technology near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been utilized extensively in several clinical settings and one of which is in cerebral oximetry. This review will provide information on the technology, clinical applications and algorithm to follow when desaturation occurs. AREAS COVERED The review will cover the technology of near infrared spectroscopy, cerebral oximetry and the utilization of cerebral oximetry in each clinical setting. Expert commentary: Cerebral oximetry provides a noninvasive measure of cerebral oxygenation, which when persistently declining, can serve as a warning sign of hemodynamic or metabolic compromise intraoperatively or a predictor of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Although useful, the cerebral oximetry readings must be interpreted in the context of other clinical information. When cerebral desaturation is confirmed, an algorithm should be followed in an attempt to increase oxygen delivery to the brain and/or decrease cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen.

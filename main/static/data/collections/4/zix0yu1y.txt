Liver transplantation (LT) is performed to improve life expectancy and quality of life in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD), and to save life in the context of acute liver failure (ALF). These two groups of patients differ significantly in terms of mean age, prior comorbidity, and degree of extra-hepatic organ dysfunction, requiring substantially different approaches to supportive care. Common aspects of care are those directed at the transplanted organ itself, with regard to monitoring and recognition of early dysfunction, initiation of immunosuppression, and management of surgical complications. Close liaison with the multidisciplinary team, which will include the intensivist, transplant surgeon, transplant hepatologist, anesthesiologist, and radiologist, is required.

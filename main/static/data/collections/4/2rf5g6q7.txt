Abstract The emergency department (ED) is a “unique operation, optimized to exist at the edge of chaos”. It is the responsibility of the leaders and managers of the ED to ensure that their teams work in an environment where they can deliver the best care to their patients. This environment is defined by people, system and place. People are the most important asset of the ED. One of the most important responsibilities of the ED leaders and managers (senior management) is to foster teamwork. They will also have to ensure that communication between team members is optimal and that there is a structure in place for conflict resolution. ED senior management should be aware of their team dynamics and know the “movers and shakers” in their organization. ED systems should be kept simple. One of the core businesses of an ED is contingency planning. ED senior management must plan, prepare, practice, review, analyze, assess and strategize for unexpected events. The ED physical environment has an impact on the flow of care being delivered to her patients. ED senior management must manage change. Change works only if it takes root in the hearts and minds of the organization's people. The quality of the leaders and managers of the ED will determine whether or not, their teams work in an environment where they can deliver the best care to their patients.

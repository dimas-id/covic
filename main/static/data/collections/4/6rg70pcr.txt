The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is essential for infection by a variety of viruses. The p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) are direct substrates of ERK and functional mediators of ERK MAPK signaling, but their roles in viral infection have never been examined. We demonstrate that ORF45 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) interacts with RSK1 and RSK2 and strongly stimulates their kinase activities. The activation of RSK by ORF45 is correlated with ERK activation but does not require MEK. We further demonstrate that RSK1/RSK2 is activated during KSHV primary infection and reactivation from latency; a subset of RSK1/RSK2 is present in the viral replication compartment in the nucleus. Depletion of RSK1/RSK2 by small interfering RNA or the specific inhibitor BI-D1870 suppresses KSHV lytic gene expression and progeny virion production, suggesting an essential role of RSK1/RSK2 in KSHV lytic replication.

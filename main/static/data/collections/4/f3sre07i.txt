BACKGROUND COVID-19, a novel coronavirus originating in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly throughout the globe over 3 months. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to both the public health and the durability of our healthcare systems and will profoundly affect the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The objective of this paper is to provide a natural history of COVID-19 - including virology, epidemiology and transmission patterns - and a guide for plastic surgeons regarding patient and resource management. METHODS The authors reviewed existing literature regarding COVID-19, both primary research and secondary reviews, via PubMed queries, and recommendations from relevant professional organizations (e.g., American College of Surgeons and American Society of Plastic Surgeons). The literature and recommendations were summarized to provide a specific guide for plastic surgeons. RESULTS Internationally, over 5.7 million cases and 357,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported at time of writing. No pharmacological treatments have been identified, but epidemiological strategies were identified to prevent viral spread, preserve healthcare resources, and protect patients and surgeons globally. Specific recommendations for plastic and reconstructive surgeons include postponing elective cases and transitioning to telecommunication platforms for patient consultations and education. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to the public health and the durability of healthcare systems in the contemporary era. While plastic and reconstructive surgery may seem relatively remote from the pandemic in direct patient care and exposure, our field can significantly enhance healthcare resource management.

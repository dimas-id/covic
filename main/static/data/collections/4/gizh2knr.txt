We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate use of PCR assays for diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.92) and 0.91 (CI, 0.81 to 0.96), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that use of tissue samples may improve sensitivity, and quantitative PCR and sonication of prostheses fluid may improve specificity. The results showed that PCR is reliable and accurate for detection of PJI.

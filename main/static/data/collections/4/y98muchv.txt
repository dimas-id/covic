BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the utility of a preoperative model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score in predicting the prognosis after othotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for chronic severe hepatitis B (CSHB) and explore the prognostic factors. METHODS: The outcome of 137 patients who underwent OLT using donors after cardiac death (DCDs) for CSHB in our center was reviewed retrospectively. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method; the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis; and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for prognostic factors screening. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 33.6% (46/137); and 1-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year patient survival rates were 75.8, 72.0, 71.0, and 60.1%, respectively. Most patients (33/46) died during the first month after OLT. The area under the curve values generated by the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.92] and 0.68 (95% CI 0.58–0.79), respectively (P < 0.01), for the MELD and CTP models in predicting 1-month mortality after OLT. Patients with a preoperative MELD score <33.8 or a CTP score <12.5 had significantly better prognosis than those with higher scores (P < 0.05). Other mortality predictors include hepatic encephalopathy, preoperative infection, serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: The MELD score was more efficient than the CTP score for evaluating the short-term prognosis in patients with CSHB undergoing OLT using DCDs, which should be taken into consideration during graft allocation.

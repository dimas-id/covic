Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), the illness caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Hospitals and healthcare providers are preparing for the anticipated surge in critically ill patients but few are wholly equipped to manage this new disease. We all must do our part to prepare our patients, clinics, and hospitals for the drastic changes necessary to mitigate the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 or we risk overwhelming the capacity of our healthcare system. The goals of this document are to provide data on what is currently known about COVID‐19, and how it may impact hepatologists and liver transplant providers and their patients. Our aim is to provide a template for the development of clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on liver patients and healthcare providers.

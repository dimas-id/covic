OBJECTIVES Limited involvement of the major peripancreatic vessels is no longer considered a contraindication for resection in cases of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Extended open pancreatectomies associated with vascular resection are performed in experienced centers with mortality and morbidity rates comparable to standard pancreatic resection. We evaluate the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of robotic extended pancreatectomy with vascular resection. METHODS We reviewed data of 5 patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 52-74 years) who underwent robotic surgery for pancreatic tumors with vascular involvement between May 2007 and March 2010 at our institution. The types of resection included 2 left-sided splenopancreatectomy with celiac axis resection, 1 left-sided splenopancreatectomy with portal vein resection, and 2 pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection. RESULTS No conversions occurred. The overall mean operating time was 392 ± 66 minutes (range, 310-460 min). The overall mean blood loss was 200 ± 61 mL (range, 150-300 mL) with no transfusions. No mortalities occurred. At a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-20 months), 4 patients were alive and disease free. CONCLUSIONS This early series by a single surgeon supports the feasibility and safety of robotic pancreatectomy with vascular resection for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic tumor.

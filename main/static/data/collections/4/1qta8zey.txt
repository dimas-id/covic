Background: COVID-19 poses a potentially significant infectious risk during procedures of the head and neck due to high viral loads in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. Facial plastic surgery has significant exposure to these areas during craniomaxillofacial trauma procedures and rhinoplasty. Methods: Airborne particulate generation in the 1-10 Î¼m range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real time during cadaveric-simulated rhinoplasty and facial trauma conditions. Procedures tested included mandibular plate screw drilling, calvarial drilling, nasal bone osteotomy, nasal dorsal rasping, and piezoelectric saw use. Particulate generation was measured both adjacent to the surgical site and at surgeon mouth level (SML). Results: Mandibular plate screw drilling without irrigation generated significant particulate both adjacent to the surgical site and at SML (p < 0.01). Irrigation mitigated particulate generation at SML to nonsignificant levels. Calvarial drilling additionally produced substantial particulate above baseline adjacent to the surgical site (p < 0.01). Standard nasal osteotomies and dorsal rasping did not generate detectable airborne particulate, whereas piezoelectric saw use was associated with significant particulate generation both adjacent to the surgical site (p < 0.001) and at SML (p < 0.01). At SML, smaller particulate represented a significantly higher proportion of total particulate detected. Conclusions: The majority of craniomaxillofacial trauma procedures involve particle generation that may be limited in spread by the use of local irrigation. Most bony work involved in rhinoplasty can be safely performed without a high degree of particle formation. The use of piezoelectric instruments in rhinoplasty should be avoided when concerned for particulate generation.

Nursing homes have become “ground zero” for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) epidemic in North America, with homes experiencing widespread outbreaks resulting in severe morbidity and mortality among its residents. This manuscript describes a 371‐bed acute care hospital's emergency response to a 126‐bed nursing home experiencing a COVID‐19 outbreak in Toronto, Canada. Like other health care system responses to COVID‐19 outbreaks in nursing homes, this hospital‐nursing home partnership can be characterized in several phases: 1) engagement, relationship and trust‐building; 2) environmental scan, team‐building and immediate response; 3) early phase response; and 4) stabilization and transition period.

PURPOSE To describe our experience with the chimney technique in endovascular aneurysm repair (ch-EVAR) using long parallel grafts (PGs) of 100 mm or more for the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2009 to 2016, data were prospectively collected for patients who underwent ch-EVAR using long PGs. Data included patient demographics and aortic anatomy, technical success, patency and reintervention rate. RESULTS A total of 29 long PGs were placed in 18 patients (males 16, average age 71 years). Nine (50%) suffered from thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 4 (22%) from juxtarenal aortic aneurysms and 3 (17%) from suprarenal aortic aneurysms and 2 (11%) were treated for abdominal aortic aneurysms that required revascularization of a pelvic kidney. Twenty (70%) of the PGs were 100 mm in length, and 9 (30%) were 150 mm. Long PGs were successfully placed in 16 (89%) patients. Two patients (11%) expired in the perioperative period. Mean period of follow-up was 12 months (range 1-43 months). Sac size decreased in size or remained unchanged in 13 patients (72%). Three patients with sac enlargement underwent successful endovascular treatment the type 1A gutter endoleaks. None required reintervention of the PGs. Three patients expired, none from aneurysm-related deaths. CONCLUSION The use of long PGs is a feasible technique and provides a durable repair of complex aortic aneurysms in midterm follow-up. Despite the length of the PGs, gutter endoleaks are encountered only in a minority of the cases and can be treated minimally invasive techniques.

The ideal treatment for pentalogy of Cantrell is neo-sternum reconstruction by using autologous tissues. Although treatment timing varies depending on the degree of deformity and patient's condition, the principle is performing the procedure at the earliest, to prevent blunt or piercing trauma to the heart. However, the challenge is performing the procedure on a neonate, because feasibility of the procedure is affected by the size of the defect, and limitations in utilizable autologous tissues. We used a small biocompatible patch (Permacol) and lower costal cartilage to perform curative neo-sternum reconstruction, which is a simple and safe treatment method.

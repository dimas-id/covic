OBJECTIVE To report our complete experience with laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) to understand what role it may play in the broader context of liver surgery. BACKGROUND The goal of LLR is to extend the benefits of the laparoscopic approach without compromising the fundamental principles of open liver surgery. LLR, however, presents unique technical challenges and its evaluation is made difficult by the restricted indications for this approach, the few centers world-wide experienced in the technique, and the heterogeneity of procedures and pathologies involved. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of liver resections from a unit with a comprehensive liver program, including resection and transplantation. RESULTS There were 166 laparoscopic liver resections between May 23, 1996 and December 31, 2007, including 100 (60%) for malignant pathology (64 HCC, 3 cholangiocarcinoma, 33 hepatic metastases) and 66 for benign pathology (adenoma, 23; FNH, 19; cystic, 17; other, 7). Numbers of resections for benign indications remained stable over time whereas those for malignant indications increased. There were 31 major resections, 56 left lateral sectionectomies, 28 segmentectomies, and 51 tumorectomies. There was 0% mortality and 15.1% morbidity. Median blood loss was 200 mL, 9 patients (5.4%) required transfusion, and median operating time was 180 minutes. Left lateral sectionectomies demonstrated reduced bleeding (median, 175 vs. 300 mL, P = 0.0015) and faster operating time (median, 170 vs. 180 minutes, P = 0.0265). In the second half of the experience, there was reduced bleeding (median, 200 vs. 300 mL, P = 0.0022) and a lower conversion rate (2.4% vs. 16.9%, P = 0.0015). CONCLUSIONS Good patient selection and refined surgical technique are the keys to successful LLR. The indications for resection of asymptomatic benign lesions should not be increased because the laparoscopic approach is available. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are more likely to be suitable to a laparoscopic approach than colorectal liver metastases. Left lateral sectionectomy and limited resection of solitary peripheral lesions are particularly suitable while hemihepatectomies remain challenging procedures. LLR requires an ongoing robust audit to identify any emerging problems.

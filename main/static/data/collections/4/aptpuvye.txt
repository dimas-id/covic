News discourse provides inferential information as well as factual information. Inference is a process of making an epistemic judgement, an act of passing from known facts or evidence to a conclusion with varying degrees of certainty. Intersubjective representations of inferential information in news discourse refer to the ways in which inferences are represented as carrying a higher degree of intersubjectivity.

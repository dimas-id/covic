During the current COVID-19 pandemic, anecdotal reports suggest that BAME background patients may be disproportionately affected compared to White but few objective data are available. We took advantage of near real-time hospital data access and analysis pipelines to look at the impact of ethnicity in 437 consecutive patients admitted during March to Kings College Hospital NHS Trust in London. Our key findings are firstly that BAME patients are significantly younger and have different co-morbidity profiles than White individuals. Secondly, there is no significant effect of ethnicity itself on severe outcomes (death or ITU admission) within 14-days of symptom onset, with adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities.

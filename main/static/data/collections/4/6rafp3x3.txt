As in other coronaviruses, the nucleocapsid protein is one of the core components of the SARS coronavirus (CoV). It oligomerizes to form a closed capsule, inside which the genomic RNA is securely stored thus providing the SARS-CoV genome with its first line of defense from the harsh conditions of the host environment and aiding in replication and propagation of the virus. In addition to this function, several reports have suggested that the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein modulates various host cellular processes, so as to make the internal milieu of the host more conducive for survival of the virus. This article will analyze and discuss the available literature regarding these different properties of the nucleocapsid protein. Towards the end of the article, we will also discuss some recent reports regarding the possible clinically relevant use of the nucleocapsid protein, as a candidate diagnostic tool and vaccine against SARS-CoV infection.

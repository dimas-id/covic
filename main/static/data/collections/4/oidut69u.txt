Viruses have been known to subvert the anti-apoptotic pathways of the host cell in order to delay apoptosis. However, the mechanisms utilized by enterovirus 71 (EV71) to mediate anti-apoptotic activity remained undetermined. We observed that EV71 infection induced an early activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. The activity of GSK3β, a downstream target of these pathways, was negatively regulated by the activation of both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. The phosphorylation of GSK3 could be inhibited by treatment with the specific inhibitors of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. Other Akt downstream targets, BAD, caspase-9 and the Forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), were not phosphorylated during the course of infection by EV71. We further demonstrated that infection by UV-irradiated, inactivated virus triggered early Akt activation but was insufficient to trigger late Akt activation. These data suggest that with the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt the subsequent inactivation of GSK3β is utilized by EV71 as a potential mechanism to delay host cell apoptosis.

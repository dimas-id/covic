OBJECTIVES This study sought to use a new catheter technique to split the anterior mitral valve leaflet (AML) and prevent iatrogenic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction immediately before transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). BACKGROUND LVOT obstruction is a life-threatening complication of TMVR, caused by septal displacement of the AML. METHODS The procedure was used in patients with severe mitral valve disease and prohibitive surgical risk. Patients either had prior surgical mitral valve ring (n = 3) or band annuloplasty (n = 1) or mitral annular calcification with stenosis (n = 1). Iatrogenic LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction was predicted in all based on echocardiography and computed tomography. Transfemoral coronary guiding catheters directed an electrified guidewire across the center and base of the AML toward a snare in the left atrium. The externalized guidewire loop was then electrified to lacerate the AML along the centerline from base to tip, sparing chordae, immediately before transseptal TMVR. RESULTS Five patients with prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction from TMVR successfully underwent LAMPOON, with longitudinal splitting of the A2 scallop of the AML, before valve implantation. Multiplane computed tomography modeling predicted hemodynamic collapse from TMVR assuming an intact AML. However, critical LVOT gradients were not seen following LAMPOON and TMVR. Doppler blood flow was seen across transcatheter heart valve struts that encroached the LVOT, because the AML was split. Transcatheter heart valve function was unimpeded. CONCLUSIONS This novel catheter technique, which resembles surgical chord-sparing AML resection, may enable TMVR in patients with prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction.

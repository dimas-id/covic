Sulfur mustard (SM) is a mutagenic compound that targets various organs. Although it causes a wide range of abnormalities, cellular and molecular mechanisms of its action are not-well-understood. Oxidation of DNA, proteins, lipids, as well as depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), antioxidants and increase of intracellular calcium are the hypothesized mechanisms of its action at the acute phase of injury. In this review, the proteome analysis of SM toxicity has been considered. We selected articles that considered proteomics analysis of SM toxicity with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) followed by mass spectrometry. Our search yielded nine related articles, four original in vitro and five human studies. The results of these studies have revealed a change in expression pattern of various proteins such as haptoglobin, amyloid A1, surfactant proteins, S100 proteins, apolipoprotein, Vit D binding protein, transferrin, alpha 1 antitrypsin, protein disulfide isomerase and antioxidant enzymes in patients who were exposed to SM about 30 years ago. Most of these proteins are up- or down-regulated in response to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS). There is a tight link between the expression pattern of these proteins with accumulation of leukocytes, inflammatory conditions, antioxidant depletion, mitochondrial deficiency, as well as increased expression or activity of several proteases such as caspases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Therefore, excessive production of ROS and OS along with chronic inflammatory may be the long-term toxic effects of SM following acute exposure.

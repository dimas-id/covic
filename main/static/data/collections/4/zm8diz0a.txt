A 39-year-old man with previously undiagnosed scleroderma was admitted to the UCSD Medical Center with bilateral, limb-threatening necrotic lower extremity ulcers extending to underlying fascia and muscle. Rather than amputate the extremities, the patient requested alternative treatment and underwent extensive tissue debridement followed by placement of an equine pericardium xenograft. Subsequent to treatment, the patient underwent weekly examinations and dressing changes without additional treatment. The patient was ambulating without assistance and with complete closure of all wounds in 10 weeks. The patient remained without wound recurrence at a recent 6-month follow-up visit ﻿﻿﻿.

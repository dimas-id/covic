Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space, and $A$ be a positive bounded linear operator on $\mathcal{H}.$ Let $\mathcal{B}_A\mathcal{(H)}$ denotes the set of all bounded linear operators on $\mathcal{H}$ whose $A$-adjoint exists. Let $\mathbb{A}$ denotes a diagonal operator matrix with diagonal entries are $A.$ In this paper, we prove a few new $\mathbb{A}$-numerical radius inequalities for $2\times 2$ and $n\times n$ operator matrices. We also provide some new proofs of the existing results by relaxing different sufficient conditions like"$A$ is strictly positive"and"$\mathcal{N}(A)^\perp$ is invariant subspace for different operators". Our proofs show the importance of the theory of the Moore-Penrose inverse of bounded operators in this field of study.

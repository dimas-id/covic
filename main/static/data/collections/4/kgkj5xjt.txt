PURPOSE To evaluate the usefulness of preoperative computed tomography (CT)-guided coil localization in patients with lung nodules who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lung resection. MATERIAL AND METHODS From October 2015 to January 2018, 76 patients with lung nodules underwent CT-guided coil localization and subsequent VATS in our center. The tail of the coil remained above the visceral pleura. Data regarding the technical success of coil localization and wedge resection were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 96 lung nodules in 76 patients were localized. The technical success rate of CT-guided coil localization was 97.9% (94/96). Among the 94 localized nodules, 88 coils were visible and six coils were palpated during VATS. Nine patients experienced pneumothorax and two patients experienced hemoptysis after coil localization. Two patients underwent VATS beyond 24 h after coil localization. The technical success rate of wedge resection of lung nodules was 97.9%. Seventeen patients with multiple target lung nodules underwent one-stage video-assisted resection of all target nodules after coil localization. CONCLUSION Preoperative CT-guided coil localization is a safe and convenient method to facilitate a high success rate of diagnostic VATS wedge-resection of lung nodules. Coil localization can also facilitate one-stage VATS wedge-resection of multiple nodules.

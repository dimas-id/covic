Caliciviruses were isolated from 7 dogs and 1 captured coyote with enteritis. There was a high fatality rate in dogs 4 to 16 weeks of age. The occurrence in these dogs of concurrent infection with known enteric pathogens such as Salmonella sp, canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and canine rotavirus did not allow making any conclusions regarding the pathogenicity of this newly recognized calicivirus. The caliciviruses were characterized by electron microscopy and were further identified as being closely related to feline calicivirus by immunoelectron microscopy with specific antibody.

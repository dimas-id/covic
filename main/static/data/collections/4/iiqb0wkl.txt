BACKGROUND Previous studies have shown accelerated gastric emptying after sleeve gastrectomy. This study aimed to determine whether a correlation exists between immediate postoperative gastroduodenal transit time and weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Specifically, correlation tests were conducted to determine whether more rapid transit after LSG correlated with increased weight loss. METHODS Data were collected from an institutional review board-approved electronic registry. All LSGs were performed over a 40-Fr bougie, starting 5 to 7 cm proximal to the pylorus. Gastroduodenal transit time (antrum to duodenum) was calculated from a postoperative day 1 esophagram. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The analysis included 62 consecutive LSG patients. The mean gastroduodenal transit time was 12.3 ± 19.8 s. Almost all the patients (99%) had a transit time less than 60 s. The mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 23.8 ± 9.8% at 3 months, 37.9 ± 11.8% at 6 months, and 52.2 ± 10.8% at 12 months. No correlation was found between gastroduodenal transit time and %EWL at 3, 6, or 12 months. CONCLUSION No correlation was found between gastroduodenal transit time and weight loss after LSG.

This paper discusses the possible effects of comedication on COVID-19 and the current treatment options for this infection. It is very doubtful that comedication has a disadvantageous effect on the course of the disease. NSAIDs should be avoided in any patient with a possible severe disease, because of potential side effects. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system should be continued when there is a solid indication, and stopped in case of hemodynamic problems. There is no preference for either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor inhibitors. Currently, chloroquine and remdesivir are possible treatment options. There is no sound evidence for either treatment. Chloroquine has side effects (nausea, QT prolongation) and there are several drug interactions. The treatment should be reconsidered in the event of side effects and when inferior medication for comorbidity must be prescribed because of possible interactions. Lopinavir/ritonavir is not effective. Supportive care is at present the mainstay of the treatment.

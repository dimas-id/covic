The ultrastructure of coronaviruses from 46 out of 111 monkeys examined (baboons, macaques, green monkeys, langurs) was studied by negative staining in homogenates of different parts of the intestinal tract, pancreatic gland, liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, and brain. Because of marked pleomorphism of coronaviruses it is suggested that morphological variants of the viruses may be distinguished. No relationship between pleomorphism of virus particles and species differences of monkeys and their organ pathology was established. Morphological signs distinguishing simian coronaviruses from those of man were noted.

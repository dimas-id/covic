OBJECTIVES To describe the safety and efficacy of single-port access for laparoscopic surgery in gynecology with conventional laparoscopic instruments. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this prospective study, we report our experience with 90 patients who underwent Single Port Access (SPA) laparoscopic surgery for gynecologic pathology with the use of the SILS(®) Port Multiple Instrument Access Port (Covidien(®), Mansfield, MA). RESULTS We realised 15 ovarian cystectomies, 30 salpingo-oophrectomies with 14 one side, 9 lysis of adhesions, 7 distal tubal repairs, 6 salpingectomy, 8 other procedures. The mean surgical time is 47 min (25-120). One conversion to conventional laparoscopy and one in laparotomy were performed. The mean duration stay is 2 days [1-3]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION SPA in gynecology is feasible with conventional laparoscopic instruments. SPA surgery represents the newest frontier in minimally invasive surgery.

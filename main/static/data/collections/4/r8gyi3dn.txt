Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection in Nanyang City, so as to provide evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, atory and radiologic data of 150 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to the designated hospitals in Nanyang City from January 24,2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The 150 patients with 2019 nCov infection consisted of 67 men and 83 women, and the median age was (45±16) years; 69 of them were the first generation case,60 of them were the second generation case, 6 of them were the third generation case,the median incubation period of the first generation case was (5.4±2.2) days, and the second generation case was (6.7±3.1) days, and the first-generation cases are the majority in severe patients (69%) . The most common basic disease was hypertension (13 cases, 9%), diabetes (9 cases, 6%), and the most common symptom is fever(142 cases, 95%, 63% showed moderate fever) , cough and sputum(108 cases,72%), fatigue(23 cases,15%), anorexia(20 cases, 13%), headache, diarrhea, muscle soreness, sore throat as the first symptoms. The average time from onset of symptoms to consultation was (4.2±2.2) days for all patients. The changes in peripheral blood cells were mainly lymphonpenia (83 cases, 55%) and eosinophilia (95 cases, 63%), The lymphocyte count of the severe and critically ill patients was more significantly reduced, and some patients had increased myocardial enzymes, mainly LDH (47 cases, 31%), and a few patients had liver function damage, mainly manifested in ALT and AST. High, very few patients have renal impairment. Among the inflammation-related indicators, the main manifestations are increased CRP (66 cases, 43%) and ESR (86 cases, 57%), elevated D-Dimer in 29% of patients. 144 cases have different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT examination, with 30 cases (21%) on one side and 144 cases (79%) on both sides. Morphologically, most of the lesions were patchy ground glass lesions, which could be accompanied by air bronchus signs and some consolidation and paving stone signs. Of the cases showing "white lung", 87% were sever ill or critically ill. After active treatment, 45% of patients were discharged according to discharge standards. 33% of sever and critically ill patients were discharged, 49% of them were degraded hospitalization.The average length of hospitalization was (12±4) days. Conclusion: A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases. The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease.

BACKGROUND Patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are likely to develop respiratory failure which requires noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Ventilation via a mouthpiece (MPV) is an option to offer daytime NIV. OBJECTIVES To determine the preferred equipment for MPV by patients with NMDs. METHODS Two MPV equipment sets were compared in 20 patients with NMDs. Set 1, consisted of a non-dedicated ventilator for MPV (PB560, Covidien) with a plastic angled mouthpiece. Set 2, consisted of a dedicated MPV ventilator (Trilogy 100, Philips Respironics) without back-up rate and kiss trigger combined with a silicone straw mouthpiece. The Borg dyspnea score, ventilator free time, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) and carbon dioxide tension (TcCO2 ) were recorded with and without MPV. Patient perception was assessed by a 17-items list. RESULTS TcCO2 measurements and total perception score were not different between the two MPV sets. Dyspnea score was lower with the non-dedicated versus dedicated equipment, 1 (0.5) vs 3 (1-6), p<0.01. All patients with a ventilator free time lower than 6 hours preferred a set backup rate rather than a kiss trigger. Sixty five percent of patients preferred the commercial arm support and 55% preferred the plastic angled mouthpiece. CONCLUSIONS Dedicated and non-dedicated MPV equipment are deemed effective and comfortable. Individualization of arm support and mouthpiece is advised to ensure success of MPV. A ventilator free time lower than 6 hours seems to be a useful indicator to a priori set a back-up rate rather than a rate at zero associated to the kiss trigger.

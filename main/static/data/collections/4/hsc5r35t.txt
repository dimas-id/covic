A survey was carried out during March-May 2017 to analyze the beliefs and attitudes of health workers and nursing students in the face of an influenza pandemic in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. A high percentage doubted that there is a vaccine to protect them against an influenza pandemic, although workers showed greater certainty than students concerning access to a vaccine. Health workers showed themselves as more responsible for their work than students; i.e., 46.7% would be in favor of penalizing anyone who refused to go to work because there is a high percentage that put work before their responsibility toward themselves and their families. In conclusion, this study suggests promoting initiatives for reducing absenteeism, identifying those factors that would facilitate it, and having a contingency plan prepared in the event of an influenza pandemic.

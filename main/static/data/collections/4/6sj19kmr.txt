Events of public health concern continue to present a challenge for the general population. A key element to address appropriate health responses is the establishment of modern public health surveillance mechanisms. In this chapter we explore possible scenarios/use cases where dentists can use electronic dental record technology to increase the accuracy, coverage, and timeliness of existing public health surveillance efforts. We identify organizational, technical, and regulatory elements that influence the adoption of such approaches and possible benefits when integrated to the public health system at large.

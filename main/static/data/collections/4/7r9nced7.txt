Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) is an important pathogen causing hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a rapid real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for detection of CV-A6. The sensitivity of this assay was 202 copies/reaction, with 100 % specificity. Furthermore, this assay yielded consistent results comparable with a commercial qRT-PCR diagnostic kit. This assay is therefore potentially useful for surveillance of CV-A6 infections and outbreak control.

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Severe complications are observed only in a small proportion of infected patients but the cellular mechanisms underlying this progression are still unknown. Comprehensive flow cytometry of whole blood samples from 54 COVID-19 patients revealed a dramatic increase in the number of immature neutrophils. This increase strongly correlated with disease severity and was associated with elevated IL-6 and IP-10 levels, two key players in the cytokine storm. The most pronounced decrease in cell counts was observed for CD8 T-cells and VD2 γδ T-cells, which both exhibited increased differentiation and activation. ROC analysis revealed that the count ratio of immature neutrophils to CD8 or VD2 T-cells predicts pneumonia onset (0.9071) as well as hypoxia onset (0.8908) with high sensitivity and specificity. It would thus be a useful prognostic marker for preventive patient management and improved healthcare resource management.

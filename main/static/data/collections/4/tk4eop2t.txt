BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to investigate whether early postoperative weight loss predicts weight loss 1 and 2 years after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and to determine its effect on the resolution of comorbidities. METHODS This was a prospective study of patients who underwent LSG at Jordan University Hospital from February 2009 to January 2014. RESULTS One hundred ninety patients (mean age 34.0 ± 10.8 years; mean preoperative body mass index 46.2 ± 7.7 kg/m(2)) were included in the study. Of these, 146 were followed for 1 year and 73 were followed for 2 years. Thirty patients (20.5 %) had hypertension, 23 (15.8 %) had diabetes, 78 (53.4 %) had hyperlipidemia, 30 (20.5 %) had obstructive sleep apnea, and 50 (34.2 %) had more than one comorbidity. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 22.7 ± 8.1, 75.1 ± 22.8, and 72.6 ± 17.5 at 1, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Fifty-five patients (37.7 %) had a 1-year %EWL of ≥80 %, and 29 (39.7 %) had a 2-year %EWL of ≥80 %. Linear regression analysis showed a strong correlation between 1-month %EWL and %EWL at 1 year (r (2) = 0.23, p < 0.001) and 2 years (r (2) = 0.28, p < 0.001). Resolution of comorbidities was associated with higher %EWL achieved at 1 year, but early postoperative weight loss did not have a significant effect on comorbidity resolution. CONCLUSIONS Early postoperative weight loss can be used to identify and target poor responders.

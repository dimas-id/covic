Radiotherapy (RT) plays a diverse and essential role in the contemporary management of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and remains the single most powerful monotherapeutic intervention for both aggressive and indolent subtypes. Over the past decade, there have been significant advancements in radiation oncology practice, which have made modern treatments safer and more conformal. Despite this sophistication and evidence supporting a continued role for RT, numerous data suggest that utilization is on the decline. In this review, we discuss the rationale for RT in 4 commonly encountered scenarios: combined modality therapy for limited-stage aggressive NHL, consolidation therapy for advanced-stage aggressive NHL, and the changing roles of salvage RT for relapsed/refractory NHL in an era of new frontiers such as cellular therapies. We also evaluate current strategies to treat indolent histologies. We conclude with perspectives on how RT for the hematological malignancies may continue to evolve.

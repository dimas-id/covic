OBJECTIVE: Assess practices supporting care transitions for infants and families in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using a model of four key drivers: communication, teamwork, family integration, and standardization. STUDY DESIGN: Single-day audit among NICUs in the Vermont Oxford Network Critical Transitions collaborative addressing policies and practices supporting the four key drivers during admission, discharge, shift-to-shift handoffs, within hospital transfers, and select changes in clinical status. RESULTS: Among 95 NICUs, the median hospital rate of audited policies in place addressing the four key drivers were 47% (inter-quartile range (IQR) 35–65%) for communication, 67% (IQR 33–83%) for teamwork, 50% (IQR 33–61%) for family integration, and 70% (IQR 56–85%) for standardization. Of the 2462 infants included, 1066 (43%) experienced ≥1 specified transition during the week prior to the audit. CONCLUSIONS: We identified opportunities for improving NICU transitions in areas of communication, teamwork, family integration, and standardization.

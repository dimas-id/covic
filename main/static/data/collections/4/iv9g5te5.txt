Dentists are among the medical professionals, who are particularly exposed to Covid-19 (Meng et al. 2020, Yu et al. 2020). Indeed, in additional to the nasal passages the mouth is a privileged place of contamination; urgent or emergent dental care is often invasive and requires aerosolization (Ather et al 2020). Dental practitioners are then exposed to saliva which plays a role in the human-to-human transmission of diseases, in particular respiratory coronaviruses (Sabino-Silva et al. 2020, Lu et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2011). We believe that dental surgeons are at the forefront of practitioner-patient cross-transmission. It is imperative that dental surgeons stay abreast of this outbreak and appreciate essential precautionary practices that are potentially crucial to protect themselves, their relatives and their patients during this outbreak.

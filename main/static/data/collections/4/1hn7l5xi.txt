Abstract Contacts with public devices such as elevator buttons, beepers, telephones, computer mice and keyboards can contribute to spread viral diseases. Here we report our experience in designing, producing and dispatching three 3D-printed objected intending to lower the risks of COVID19 contamination by limiting direct contacts: (1) fixed hand-free door openers, (2) door hooks and (3) button pushers. These devices were produced in industrial quantities and made available for free for Greater Paris University Hospitals and various state institutions as part of the 3D COVID project. In this short technical note, we describe the sequential organisation of the design and production and highlight the advantages of additive manufacturing in dealing with specific aspects of sanitary crises.

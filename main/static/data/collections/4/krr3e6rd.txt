Gastric endoscopy has not yet been recommended for organized or population-based cancer screening because at the moment, the sole criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of cancer screening is the reduction in the death rate, and not the mere detection of cancer. Nevertheless, compared with X-ray screening, which has normally been recommended, endoscopic screening is better at finding small lesions, at finding cancer at its earlier stages, making it more easily and economically treatable, and allows on-the-spot biopsies. Opportunistic, individually initiated screening by endoscopy is more and more in demand. Therefore, its excellent efficacy needs to be matched by improved toleration, improved safety, and improved manpower efficiency so that it can be standardized and utilized to its full diagnostic, therapeutic, and quality-of-life potential.

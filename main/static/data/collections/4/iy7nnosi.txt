Cell-to-cell and long-distance transport of some plant viruses requires coordinated action of three movement proteins encoded by triple gene block (TGB). The largest of TGB proteins, TGBp1, is a member of the superfamily I of DNA/RNA helicases and possesses a set of conserved helicase sequence motifs necessary for virus movement. A recombinant His-tagged form of TGBp1 of two hordeiviruses and potato virus X, a potexvirus, produced in Escherichia coli had unwinding activity on a partially duplexed RNA, but not DNA substrate. The helicase activity of these proteins was dependent on Mg2+ and ATP. The isolated C-terminal half of the PSLV TGBp1 retaining all helicase motifs was also able to unwind RNA duplex.

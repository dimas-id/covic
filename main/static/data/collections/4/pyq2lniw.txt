One month ago, few people could have foreseen the scope and impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic. At the time of this writing for the current issue of Management Report, the United States has the most confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in the world, the death toll is climbing, and experts say the situation will get worse before it gets better. Commerce in large areas of the country, including California and the Northeast, has largely shut down. The U.S. secretary of the treasury recently suggested that the U.S. unemployment rate could reach as high as 20 percent. Some economists have said it could go as high as during the economic devastation of the Great Depression, when the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 25 percent in 1933. Other economists have said it may reach 30 percent. It has been predicted that 37 million jobs may be the subject of temporary layoffs during this crisis, and 10 million may be lost permanently.

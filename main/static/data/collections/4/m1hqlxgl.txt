This preliminary study describes the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on people’s interests, opinions, and behaviour towards food. Here, the evolution of people’s internet searches, the characteristics of the most watched YouTube videos, and Tweeted messages in relation to COVID-19 and food was studied. Additionally, an online questionnaire (Spanish population, n = 362) studied changes in food shopping habits during the lockdown, motivations behind the changes, and perceived reliability of the information received from media. Results showed initial trending searches and most watched YouTube videos were about understanding what COVID-19 is and how the illness can progress and spread. When the official statement of a pandemic was released, trending searches in relation to food and shopping increased. Data retrieved from Twitter also showed an evolution from shopping concerns to the feeling of uncertainty for the oncoming crisis. The answers to the online questionnaire showed reduction of shopping frequency but no changes in shopping location. Products purchased with higher frequency were pasta and vegetables (health motivations), others were purchased to improve their mood (nuts, cheese, and chocolates). Reduced purchasing was attributed to products with a short shelf-life (fish, seafood) or because they were unhealthy and contributed to gained body weight (sugary bakery goods) or mood (desserts). Statements made by experts or scientists were considered by consumers to be the most reliable.

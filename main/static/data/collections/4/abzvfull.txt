The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a worldwide sanitary emergency. The viral biology is only partially known, with some aspects in common with other coronaviruses, and the damage observed in the most severe cases is due to intense inflammation. Immunotherapy restores immunological activity against cancer cells and it has become a standard treatment for several cancers. We carried out an examination of available data on the effects exerted by both SARS-CoV-2 and the most widespread immunotherapy treatments on the immune system in order to hypothesize mechanisms underlying potential and mutual interaction. We provided an analysis of laboratory, clinical and therapeutic data related with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We finally focused on implications of immunotherapy treatments in clinical practice.

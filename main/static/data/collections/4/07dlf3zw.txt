Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is subject to stringent quality control. When protein secretion demand exceeds the protein folding capacity of the ER, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered as a consequence of ER stress. Due to the secretory function of epithelial cells, UPR plays an important role in maintaining epithelial barrier function at mucosal sites. ER stress and activation of the UPR are natural mechanisms by which mucosal epithelial cells combat viral infections. In this review, we discuss the important role of UPR in regulating mucosal epithelium homeostasis. In addition, we review current insights into how the UPR is involved in viral infection at mucosal barriers and potential therapeutic strategies that restore epithelial cell integrity following acute viral infections via cytokine and cellular stress manipulation.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic having caused a major health care crises across the globe.Pharmacy professionals are considered vital in preparation for optimal response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, in response to the estimated potential impact of COVID-19 on Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Johns Hopkins Medicine International), several initiatives were taken by the hospital's inpatient pharmacy department with focus on infection control, staffing, meeting clinical operational challenges, ethics, increased utilization of automation, and maintenance of employee wellness to prepare for this challenge. The plan implemented by the inpatient pharmacy department was prepared while incorporating information and recommendations from leading pharmacy organizations, ministry of health, institute's experience in battling another similar coronavirus (the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) previously, and updated scientific research. The key focus areas include development of an institutionalized COVID-19 protocol, measures to improve infection control when handling and dispensing medications, modified staffing plan, system changes in peri-operative areas, keeping pharmacy professionals updated about new and scientific researches, increased utilization of automation, clinical interventions by pharmacist ensuring appropriate utilization of medications while monitoring for drug-drug interactions, adverse drug event prevention, and preparing for handling drug shortages. By implementing a robust plan, pharmacy professionals continue to show that they are an integral member of inter-professional health care teams.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA-PRKCG, formerly SCA14) is a rare, slowly progressive disorder caused by conventional mutations in protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ). The disease usually manifests with ataxia, but previous reports suggested PRKCG variants in retinal pathology. To systematically investigate for the first time visual function and retinal morphology in patients with SCA-PRKCG. Seventeen patients with PRKCG variants and 17 healthy controls were prospectively recruited, of which 12 genetically confirmed SCA-PRKCG patients and 14 matched controls were analyzed. We enquired a structured history for visual symptoms. Vision-related quality of life was obtained with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) including the Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement (NOS). Participants underwent testing of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, and retinal morphology with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Measurements of the SCA-PRKCG group were analyzed for their association with clinical parameters (ataxia rating and disease duration). SCA-PRKCG patients rate their vision-related quality of life in NEI-VFQ significantly worse than controls. Furthermore, binocular visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were worse in SCA-PRKCG patients compared with controls. Despite this, none of the OCT measurements differed between groups. NEI-VFQ and NOS composite scores were related to ataxia severity. Additionally, we describe one patient with a genetic variant of uncertain significance in the catalytic domain of PKCγ who, unlike all confirmed SCA-PRKCG, presented with a clinically silent epitheliopathy. SCA-PRKCG patients had reduced binocular vision and vision-related quality of life. Since no structural retinal damage was found, the pathomechanism of these findings remains unclear.

The inflammatory response - induced and regulated by a variety of mediators such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) - is the localized hostâ€™s response of the tissue to injury, irritation, or infection. In a very similar and stereotyped sequence, the mediators are thought to induce an acute phase response orchestrated by an array of substances produced locally or near the source or origin of the inflammatory response. Despite its basically protective function, the response can become inappropriate in intensity or duration damaging host tissues or interfering with normal metabolism. Thus, inflammation is the cause and/or consequence of a diversity of diseases and plays a major role in the development of remote organ failure. Better knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of these processes is, therefore, a fundamental pre-requisite fostering the molecular understanding of novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic variables.

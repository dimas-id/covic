For the pandemic of COVID-19, the initial number of infections in Wuhan China has never been known or estimated properly. This data is critical to understand the current pandemic across the world, as well as to eliminate panic from overestimated fatality rate that has biased the public health policies of many countries. By our unique estimation with the data of a number of foreign government evacuations with thorough follow-up and etiological tests, it is safe to say that a large number of infections in Wuhan, China have not been diagnosed (the number of undiagnosed is much more than the final diagnosed number 50,333 to date).

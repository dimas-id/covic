INTRODUCTION: Contradictory data have been reported on the incidence of stroke in patients with COVID-19 and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with history of stroke. METHODS: This study systematically reviews case series reporting stroke as a complication of COVID-19, and analyses the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and history of stroke. The pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in patients with COVID-19 are also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: History of stroke increases the risk of death due to COVID-19 by 3 times. Stroke currently seems not to be one of the main complications of COVID-19.

Infrabony periodontal defects are common findings encountered during complete oral examinations. Treatment options for infrabony lesions are aimed at meeting client demands as well as patient needs. Deciding on how to treat these lesions depends on the nature and degree of disease present as well as having the materials available to improve the chances of achieving the greatest clinical success. Bone grafting of an infrabony defect of the left mandibular first molar tooth of a dog using an autogenous cortical graft harvested with a reusable bone grafter in combination with guided tissue regeneration is described.

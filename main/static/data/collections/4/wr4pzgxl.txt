Rectal lumen obliteration (RLO) is a rarely described, but fearful and potentially life-threating complication following stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Its management is not standardized and should take into account the time of recognition of the complication, the completeness of obliteration, and the integrity of the rectal wall. Here, we describe a case of complete RLO after stapled hemorrhoidopexy (the first case published to the best of our knowledge), successfully treated via an intra-abdominal approach with full rectal mobilization and recanalization of the rectum using a 31 mm EEA(Â®) stapler.

The present study determined the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of ferret (Mustela putorius furo) inflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The homologies of the nucleotide sequences of IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha of the ferret to those from other mammalian species ranged from 64.3-92.9%, 73.0-83.9, 58.1-84.8%, 58.1-89.7% and 79.0-95.0%, respectively. As distinctive amino acid residues constituting various motifs and ligand-binding sites and cysteine residues were highly conserved in ferret inflammatory cytokine proteins, ferret cytokines may have fundamentally similar functions to those of other mammals. Phylogenetic analyses based on the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that all ferret inflammatory cytokines were more closely related to those of the Carnivora order, specifically dog and cat, than to other species.

Understanding the orchestrated genome-wide cellular responses is critical for comprehending the early events of coronavirus infection. Microarray analysis was applied to assess changes in cellular expression profiles during different stages of two independent, highly controlled murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infections in vitro. Fibroblast-like L cells were infected at high multiplicity in order to study the direct effects of a synchronized lytic coronavirus infection. Total RNA was harvested from MHV- or mock-infected L cells at 3, 5 and 6 h post-infection and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays representing approximately 12,500 murine genes and expressed sequences. The expression data were compared to their respective mock-infected controls. Quantitative RT-PCR of selected transcripts was used to validate the differential expression of transcripts and inter-experiment reproducibility of microarray analysis. It was concluded that MHV-A59 infection in fibroblast-like cells triggers very few transcriptional cellular responses in the first 3 h of infection. Later, after having established a productive infection, a chemokine response is induced together with other cellular changes associated with RNA and protein metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis. Interferon responses are not triggered during infection, although the L cells can be readily stimulated to produce interferon by dsRNA, a known potent inducer of interferon. Possibly, the interferon response is actively counteracted by a virus-encoded antagonist as has been described previously for other RNA viruses.

Health care-associated viral respiratory infections, common among hospitalized children, also occur among adults and institutionalized persons and result in increased patient morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Approximately 20% of patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia have viral respiratory infections, with 70% of these infections caused by adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These infections typically reflect the level of viral activity within the community. This article focuses on the epidemiology, transmission, and control of health care-associated RSV and influenza virus.

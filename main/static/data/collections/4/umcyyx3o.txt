BACKGROUND The Middle East is one of the most rapidly growing destination for travelers. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the medical conditions affecting travelers needing medical assistance in Bahrain International Airport (BIA). METHOD Logbook documenting medical conditions of travelers presenting to the BIA clinic from January 1 till the end of December 2004 was reviewed. RESULTS A total of 3,350 travelers attended the clinic, constituting 0.12% of the disembarking and transit travelers. Most common conditions faced were respiratory problems (24.4%), followed by headaches (19.2%), trauma, musculoskeletal pains (12.9%), and gastrointestinal problems (11.0%). Only 2.1% of all complaints were referred to secondary care. The majority of cases were handled by the nurse. CONCLUSIONS Majority of the patients examined had acute minor medical problems. Ninety-eight percent of conditions affecting travelers were handled in the airport clinic by the nurse and the family physician. Airport clinic could serve as an efficient emergency triage system for filtering serious illnesses needing urgent management.

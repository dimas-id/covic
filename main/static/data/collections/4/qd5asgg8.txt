Aims: We aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks associated with air travel from a country with a very low prevalence of COVID-19 infection (Australia) to a COVID-19-free country (New Zealand; [NZ]), along with the likely impact of various control measures for passengers and cabin crew. Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilized. It was populated with data for both countries and parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control measures. We assumed one Australia to NZ flight per day. Results: When no interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in NZ was estimated to occur after an average time of 1.7 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 0.04-6.09). However, the combined use of exit and entry screening (symptom questionnaire and thermal camera), masks on aircraft and two PCR tests (on days 3 and 12 in NZ), combined with self-reporting of symptoms and contact tracing and mask use until the second PCR test, reduced this risk to one outbreak every 29.8 years (0.8 to 110). If no PCR testing was performed, but mask use was used by passengers up to day 15 in NZ, the risk was one outbreak every 14.1 years. However, 14 days quarantine (NZ practice in May 2020), was the most effective strategy at one outbreak every 34.1 years (0.06 to 125); albeit combined with exit screening and mask use on flights. Conclusions: Policy-makers can require multi-layered interventions to markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus into a COVID-19-free nation via air travel. There is potential to replace 14-day quarantine with PCR testing or interventions involving mask use by passengers in NZ. However, all approaches require continuous careful management and evaluation.

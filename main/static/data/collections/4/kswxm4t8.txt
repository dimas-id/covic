Public health disasters reflect a class of global problems that generate moral quandaries and challenges. As such, they demand a global bioethical response involving an approach that is sufficiently nuanced at the local, trans-national, and global domains. Using the overlapping ethical issues engendered by Ebola and pandemic influenza outbreaks, atypical drug-resistant tuberculosis, and earthquakes, this chapter develops a global ethical framework for engaging PHDs. This framework exhibits sufficient responsiveness to local, global, microbial, and metaphysical realities as well as scientific concerns.

Acute bronchitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the large airways within the lung accompanied by a cough lasting from 1 to 3 weeks. The inflammation occurs as a result of an airway infection or environmental trigger, with viral infections accounting for an estimated 89% to 95% of cases. Symptomatic treatment of cough is primarily required for patients, though in most cases the condition is self-limiting. Therapy consists of both nonpharmacological and pharmacological options to include antibiotics and antivirals, antitussive agents, protussive agents, and beta-2-agonists. This article reviews the treatment options for acute bronchitis and recommends criteria for use.

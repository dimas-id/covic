BACKGROUND Ehrlichia canis infection in dogs can cause thrombocytopenia and clinical evidence of bleeding. It is unknown why some dogs show signs of bleeding whereas others do not despite clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES Activated platelets, decreased fibrinolysis or both mitigate bleeding tendency. Assess standard hemostatic variables, platelet dynamics, and specialized coagulation testing in dogs experimentally infected with E. canis to evaluate this clinical discrepancy. ANIMALS Four healthy laboratory beagles. METHODS Dogs were given blood infected with E. canis IV. Platelet indices of activation, platelet aggregometry, antiplatelet antibodies (percent IgG), complete coagulation panel, and thromboelastography (TEG) were measured before inoculation and on weeks 1-8. Dogs were treated with doxycycline at approximately 5 mg/kg PO q12h between weeks 3 and 4 (day 24). For each variable, 1-way repeated measures analysis (1-way ANOVA) with post-hoc analysis was performed with statistical significance set at P < .05. RESULTS Dogs had significantly lower platelet counts, evidence of activated platelets, and antiplatelet antibodies during E. canis infection. Dogs also appeared hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic using TEG as compared with baseline, changes that persisted for variable amounts of time after doxycycline administration. No overt signs of bleeding were noted during the study. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Activated platelets and a hypercoagulable, hypofibrinolytic state could explain the lack of a bleeding phenotype in some dogs despite clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. Findings from our pilot study indicate that additional studies are warranted.

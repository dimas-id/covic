To reduce morbidity and mortality through integrated case management, a pilot study to detect respiratory viruses in patients with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) was designed as part of a nationwide surveillance for this disease in Korea. The study population consisted of hospitalized patients under the age of 5 years with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. A prospective 6-month study was performed. Two hundred and ninety-seven nasopharyngeal secretions were collected and multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR)/polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed to detect respiratory viruses. If there were any positive RT-PCR/PCR results, viral cultures were proceeded for confirmation. Respiratory viruses were identified in 49.6% of 296 patients. The detection rates were as follows: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected in 52.7% (87/165), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 15.8%, human corona virus (hCoV) in 5.5%, adenovirus in 9.7%, human bocavirus (hBoV) in 5.5%, parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 3.6%, rhinovirus (RV) in 4.2%, and the influenza virus in 3% of the patients with ALRIs. The consistent rate of positive results between RT-PCR and viral culture was 92% (105/114). Using our methods to detect viral causes seemed to be acceptable for the national surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections in infants and children.

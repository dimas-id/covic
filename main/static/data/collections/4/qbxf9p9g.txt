As burnouts grow increasingly common, the necessity for a model describing burnout dynamics becomes increasingly apparent. The model discussed in this paper builds on previous research by adding dreams, a component that has been shown to have an adaptive regulating effect on emotions. The proposed model is a first-order adaptive temporal-causal network model, incorporating emotions, exercise, sleep, and dreams. The model was validated against given patterns found in empirical literature and it may be used to gain a better understanding of burnout dynamics.

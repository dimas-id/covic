There has been a global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019. Here, we describe the case of a 49-year-old male undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) who got infected with COVID-19 and our experience in performing HD for him. The patientâ€™s symptoms and lung imaging changes were atypical. However, his lymphocyte range decreased upon admission and the polymerase chain reaction of the pharyngeal swab for the Â­COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive. The patient developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation 8Â days after admission. In the end, he died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The difficulties in diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of COVID-19 in maintenance HD patients are discussed in this report.

Mass gatherings, such as World Youth Day (WYD) 2008 in Sydney, provide an opportunity for public health workers to gain emergency management experience. Communicable disease (mainly influenza) among pilgrims was the major public health issue during WYD. Public health workers also identified environmental health issues, resulting in hazard reduction measures being made to reduce falls. Other public health issues highlighted include training, communication, surge capacity, and health education. Lessons learned from planning WYD mass accommodation could be applied to emergency accommodation in the case of evacuation.

This is a report of a case with mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) with severe eye involvement and concurrent COVID-19 treated successfully using simultaneous high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and anti-viral treatment as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin. He had finished a 2-g cycle of rituximab (RTX) in late January. He was receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for one month and 30 mg prednisolone for three months until his hospitalization. Prednisolone was tapered to 15 mg when current COVID-19 was suspected, considering his recent cough, dyspnea, and fever.

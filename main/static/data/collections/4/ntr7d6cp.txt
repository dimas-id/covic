The purpose of this review was to analyze the literature concerning community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) published in the last five years. CAP and AECOPD are frequent diseases that are to this day still associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Patient management, especially the choice of the management environment, outpatient or intensive care, depends on the knowledge and recognition of predictors of complications, mortality risk factors, and severity signs to the extent that predictive algorithms have been established. However, research and publications concerning discharge criteria and follow-up of CAP and AECOPD patients is more sparse.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis and liver disease worldwide. Its tissue and species tropism are largely defined by the viral entry process that is required for subsequent productive viral infection and establishment of chronic infection. This review provides an overview of the viral and host factors involved in HCV entry into hepatocytes, summarizes our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing this process and highlights the therapeutic potential of host-targeting entry inhibitors.

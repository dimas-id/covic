Quantum Computing leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to build computers endowed with tremendous computing power. The field is attracting ever-increasing attention from both academic and private sectors, as testified by the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy in practice. However, the intrinsic restriction to linear operations significantly limits the range of relevant use cases for the application of Quantum Computing. In this work, we introduce a novel variational algorithm for quantum Single Layer Perceptron. Thanks to the universal approximation theorem, and given that the number of hidden neurons scales exponentially with the number of qubits, our framework opens to the possibility of approximating any function on quantum computers. Thus, the proposed approach produces a model with substantial descriptive power, and widens the horizon of potential applications already in the NISQ era, especially the ones related to Quantum Artificial Intelligence. In particular, we design a quantum circuit to perform linear combinations in superposition and discuss adaptations to classification and regression tasks. After this theoretical investigation, we also provide practical implementations using various simulation environments. Finally, we test the proposed algorithm on synthetic data exploiting both simulators and real quantum devices.

Damage of mitochondria in the initial period of tissue injury aggravates the severity of injury. Restoration of mitochondria dysfunction and mitochondrial-based therapeutics represent a potentially effective therapeutic strategy. Recently, mitochondrial transfer from stem cells has been demonstrated to play a significant role in rescuing injured tissues. The possible mechanisms of mitochondria released from stem cells, the pathways of mitochondria transfer between the donor stem cells and recipient cells, and the internalization of mitochondria into recipient cells are discussed. Moreover, a novel strategy for tissue injury based on the concept of stem cell-derived mitochondrial transplantation is pointed out, and the advantages and challenges are summarized.

BACKGROUND single-port laparoscopic surgery has gained popularity over the last decade. This technique is used for several surgical procedures. This paper documents a new and cheaper access method known as "surgical glove port" or "homemade single-port", and describes our initial experience with 25 cases. METHOD Eleven cholecystectomies, eight totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repairs, three splenectomies, two gastric wedge resections, and one anti-reflux procedure were performed. RESULTS Twenty-four procedures out of twenty-five were completed without conversion to open or multiple port techniques. An individual patient who had both cholelithiasis and gastrointestinal stromal tumor underwent both cholecystectomy and gastric wedge resection in the same session with surgical glove port technique. In another case two additional 5-mm incisions were made for hemostasis. The additional operation was required and performed by using surgical glove port for a hiatal hernia repair case, because of postoperative hemorrhage. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery is an applicable technique for plenty of surgical procedures. Also, surgical glove port is a newer technique and some initial experience shave already published all over the world. Surgical glove port has advantages such as cost-effectiveness, easy and safe port implantation and specimen extraction. SGP can also be used for treating post-operative complications.

The current pandemic of Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continued to spread globally and no potential drug or vaccine against it is available. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 located on the envelope surface, involve in interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cell surface receptor, followed by entry into the host cell. Thereby, blocking the S glycoprotein through potential inhibitor may interfere its interaction with ACE2 and impede its entry into the host cell. Here, we present a truncated version of human ACE2 (tACE2), comprising the N terminus region of the intact ACE2 from amino acid position 21-119, involved in binding with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed the in-silico potential of tACE2 to compete with intact ACE2 for binding with RBD. The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2. Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics. This is the first MD simulation based findings to provide a high affinity protein inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, an important target for drug designing against this unprecedented challenge.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

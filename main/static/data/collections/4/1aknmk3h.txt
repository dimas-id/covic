In late December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has been identified as a novel pathogen causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in Wuhan, China, subsequently spread to the rest of China and has been demonstrating a rapid global spread. Nucleic acid testing (NAT, tested by real‐time polymerase chain reaction) of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus in oropharyngeal/nasal swab samples has been described to be extremely sensitive for the diagnose of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, but false‐negative results have been reported. Recent months, researches demonstrated the importance of IgM/IgG antibody detecting due to the unsatisfied positive rate of NAT, and the increasement IgM/IgG antibody was considered as a confirmed criteria of diagnosis in the official guides of the diagnosis and treatment of COVID‐19 in China (7(th) Edition) .

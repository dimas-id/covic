BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As a result of the pandemic, family physicians face the additional challenge of navigating COVID-19. The aim of this study was to provide simulated training for best-practice management of COVID-19 presentations for residency program trainees in Shanghai, China. METHOD: A simulated suspected COVID-19 case was designed on the basis of a real patient. The simulation included: preÂ­ and post-simulation surveys, a PowerPoint presentation, simulation practice, debriefing and reflection. Improvement in survey outcomes was assessed using a paired t-test. RESULTS: A total of 25 trainees participated in the simulation, consisting of first-, second- and third-year family medicine residents. Significant improvement was observed in their knowledge of COVID-19, and sub-analysis showed that all three grades of residents improved their knowledge significantly. Ninety-six per cent of participants believed the simulation was very helpful. DISCUSSION: The simulation scenario improves crisis management skills for family physicians managing the high risk of transmission of respiratory infectious diseases. Higher-order learning outcomes will be explored in future training programs.

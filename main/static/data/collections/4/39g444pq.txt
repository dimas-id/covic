Chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection not only causes a gradual loss of CD4(+) T cells but also leads to a disturbance of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. In people living with HIV (PLWH), monitoring TCR repertoire is challenged by the inconsistency of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) and limited cell numbers in clinical samples. Thus, a quantitative method is necessary for monitoring the TCR repertoire in PLWH. We characterized the TCR V-J pairing profile of naïve and memory CD4(+) T cells in healthy donors, HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve patients and long-term (over 5 years) ART-experienced patients by performing TCR sequencing. We developed a V-J index with 18 parameters which were subdivided into five categories (expression coverage, cumulative percentage of the top tenth percentile, diversity, intra-individual similarity and inter-individual similarity). In ART-naïve patients, 14 of the 18 parameters were significantly altered. Long-term ART recovered ten parameters. The four unrecovered parameters were related to inter-individual similarity. Therefore, these findings indicate that long-term ART could only partially recover TCR V-J pairs and introduce newly impacted V-J pairs. Moreover, these results provide new insights into the V-J pairing of the TCR and into the disturbance of TCR repertoire in HIV infection.

The year 2020 will infamously be known for the COVID-19 pandemic. It certainly caught most of the population completely off-guard and forever changed their lives. Unfortunately, this pandemic is expected to make a resurgence in the fall, but hopefully more will be known about SARS-CoV-2, better treatment protocols will be established, and, possibly, a safe and effective vaccine will be developed and available soon. There are numerous drug shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some products are not commercially available in certain dosage forms needed by patients. Pharmacies (retail, independents, health systems) all over the U.S. are being asked to compound items such as hand sanitizers, saccharin solutions for FIT testing of N95 masks, and hydroxychloroquine suspension. The commercial lopinavir/ritonavir oral liquid is in short supply and may need to be compounded soon. We are all in this one together, from the essential workers to the children, and pharmacists are emerging as one of the first-line responders.

The immune system of older individuals declines with advancing age (“immunosenescence”) increasing susceptibility to infection, as well as to an increased risk of a worse outcome. Severe community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are causes of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in elderly patients. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is effective in the treatment of patients with ARF, above all in case of AECOPD.

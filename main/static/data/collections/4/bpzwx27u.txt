It is clear that existing cardiovascular disease is a major risk factor for COVID-19 and related adverse outcomes. In addition to acute respiratory syndrome, a large cohort also develop myocardial and/or vascular dysfunction, in part from inflammation and renin angiotensin system activation with increased sympathetic outflow, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemia, heart failure, and thromboembolic complications that portend poor COVID-19 outcomes. We summarize here recent information for hospitalists/internists on the front-line of this pandemic regarding its cardiovascular impacts and management and need for cardiovascular consultation.

Sinusitis is characterized by mucosal inflammation of the sinuses which is almost always accompanied by inflammation of the nasal passages. Since nasal mucosa is contiguous with paranasal sinus mucosa, the term sinusitis is often used interchangeably with [1]; the latter term will be used in this chapter. Rhinosinusitis can be acute (less than 4 weeks’ duration), subacute (4–12 weeks), or chronic (greater than 12 weeks) [2].

The efficiency of a double-lumen tube depends on its position in the airways, which can be verified by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. The VivaSight DL is a single-use double-lumen tube with a camera embedded in the tube's right side. The view from the camera appears continuously on a monitor. In this prospective study of 71 adult patients, we compared intubation times using either the VivaSight DL or a conventional double-lumen tube. Median (IQR [range]) duration of intubation with visual confirmation of tube position was significantly reduced using the VivaSight DL compared with the conventional double-lumen tube (51 (42-60 [35-118]) s vs 264 (233-325 [160-490]) s, respectively, p < 0.0001). None of the patients allocated to the VivaSight DL required fibreoptic bronchoscopy during intubation or surgery. The VivaSight DL enables significantly more rapid intubation compared with the conventional double-lumen tube.

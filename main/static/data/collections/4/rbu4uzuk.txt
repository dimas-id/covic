Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an enveloped virus that enters host cells and transits within the endosomes before starting its replication cycle, the precise mechanism of which is yet to be elucidated. Endocytosis and endosome acidification inhibitors inhibit infection by CHIKV, murine leukemia virus (MLV), or SARS-coronavirus, indicating that these viral entries into host cells occur through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Although endosomal cathepsin B protease is necessary for MLV, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV infections, its role in CHIKV infection is unknown. Our results revealed that endocytosis inhibitors attenuated CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection in 293T cells but not in TE671 cells. In contrast, macropinocytosis inhibitors attenuated CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection in TE671 cells but not in 293T cells, suggesting that CHIKV host cell entry occurs via endocytosis or macropinocytosis, depending on the cell lines used. Cathepsin B inhibitor and knockdown by an shRNA suppressed CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection both in 293T and TE671 cells. These results show that cathepsin B facilitates CHIKV infection regardless of the entry pathway.

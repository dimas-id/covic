PURPOSE To analyze our preliminary outcomes on the use of 3 mm instruments for laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy (LLDN). METHODS Our series includes thirteen patients, who underwent LLDN using 3-mm instruments and laparoscope and 5-mm transumbilical trocar. The patients were followed at 7 and 14 days from discharge and were specifically asked about their cosmetic satisfaction. At follow-up, the recipient graft function was controlled, as well as the donor's cosmetic results. Eight months after surgery, all thirteen patients were asked to fill out the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire and Scoring System (PSAQ). RESULTS All patients presented good recovery after surgery. Regarding cosmetic outcomes, the donors expressed their satisfaction toward the minimal incision size and optimal esthetic results at 7 and 14 days from discharge home. The low scores on each section of the PSAQ confirmed the favorable outcomes. Early graft function was satisfactory at 1 and 3 months after the kidney transplantation. Furthermore, there were no major complications in the recipients. CONCLUSIONS Our persistent positive results with the use of 3-mm instruments during LLDN support this technique as a good alternative to the standard laparoscopic approach for minimizing the incision site, while maintaining safety and excellent clinical outcomes. The fact that the general laparoscopic standards are maintained could make this approach a very attractive alternative to the other minimally invasive approaches for live donor nephrectomy. The hope is in that the higher degree of satisfaction in the donor population demonstrated in this study may likely enhance living kidney donation.

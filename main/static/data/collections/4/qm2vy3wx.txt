Analysis of COVID-19 cases and prediction of quantity of associated ventilator requirement is very relevant during this pandemic. This paper presents a method for predictive estimation of ventilator requirement for COVID-19 patients in Indian states. It uses ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model for predicting the future cumulative cases and daily fatality. Taking cue from this, ventilator requirement is estimated for each state. State wise estimation of ventilator is important because public healthcare system in India is managed at state level. Dataset on Novel Corona Disease 2019 in India from Kaggle website is used in this work.

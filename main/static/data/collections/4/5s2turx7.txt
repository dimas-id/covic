BACKGROUND To date, there has been no consensus concerning the vascular approach during sigmoid colectomy for diverticular disease. The aim of this study was to determine the functional impact of elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy performed with high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery for diverticulitis in consecutive male patients. METHODS Twenty-five consecutive patients of median age 53 years were enrolled in a prospective single-centre pilot study at a tertiary teaching hospital. Main outcome measures were functional results. Patients were asked to complete standardized, validated questionnaires to evaluate preoperative and 6 months postoperative bowel symptomatology (Jorge-Wexner Incontinence Score and KESS score), urinary function (IPSS), and sexual function (IIEF). Secondary outcomes were surgical data, morbidity, and quality of life (SF-36). RESULTS There were no significant differences between preoperative and 6 months postoperative total scores for bowel symptomatology, urinary function, and sexual function. There were no perioperative deaths. The morbidity rate was 12% including three minor and no major events. Quality of life demonstrated statistically better general health (p < 0.01) and better medical status over the prior 4 weeks at 6 months after surgery, compared to baseline. This single-centre prospective study has a limited number of patients, relatively short follow-up time, and includes only male patients. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with high tie of the inferior mesenteric artery for diverticular disease does not induce functional disorders at 6 months after surgery. The benefit of the operation for quality of life is even greater for general health and medical status.

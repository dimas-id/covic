Traumatic pseudoaneurysm is a rare lesion with a high risk of rupture, and represents one of the most difficult lesions to treat, either surgically or endovascularly. Herein, we describe the case of a 32-year-old man with a traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery, which was treated by overlapped flow diverters (Tubridge). The patient recovered well, and the follow-up angiography at four months showed complete occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm and patency of the internal carotid artery and the ophthalmic artery.

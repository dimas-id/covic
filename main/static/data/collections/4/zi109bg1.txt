Based on bi-capacities and related Choquet integral introduced by Grabisch and Labreuche, a new generalization of OWA operators, namely BIOWA operators are introduced. Our approach is exemplified by several examples. Bi-capacities leading to the standard Yagerâ€™s OWA operators on real line are completely characterized.

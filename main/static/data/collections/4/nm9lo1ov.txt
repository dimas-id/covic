This study was conducted to measure the inactivation characteristics of UVs and TiO(2) against Salmonella. Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 on black pepper powder. The sample was irradiated by UV-A and UV-C combined with TiO(2) coating. After treatment, microbial and physicochemical analysis was carried out. Among various sterilization conditions, the largest number of pathogen in black pepper powder was inactivated by UV-A and UV-C combined with TiO(2) coating. The microbial count of black pepper powder treated simultaneously with UV-A and UV-C was less than that of black pepper powder treated with alone. The inactivation effect of UV-A and UV-C was increased when TiO(2) coating was combined. Moisture content was decreased with increasing treatment time, but color did not change. In this study, it was indicated that the combined treatment of UV-C, UV-A and TiO(2) coating was effective for reducing S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 on black pepper powder.

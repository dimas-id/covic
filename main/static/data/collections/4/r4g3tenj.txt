BACKGROUND/AIMS Recently, partial splenic arterial embolization (PSE) has become a supportive intervention for cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism in the administration of interferon therapy. However, relapsed thrombocytopenia is often observed in patients following PSE. This study aimed to report the clinical efficiency of laparoscopic splenectomy as a salvage treatment for relapsed thrombocytopenia following PSE. METHODS From 2005 to 2009, 6 patients with prior PSE treatment underwent laparoscopic splenectomy. We reviewed the surgical method of laparoscopic splenectomy and the peri- and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Laparoscopic splenectomy effectively provided sufficient increases in patient platelet counts. In all patients, laparoscopic splenectomy was performed safely with no significant complications despite PSE-associated dense adhesion to the diaphragm and/or retroperitoneal attachments. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic splenectomy provides a sufficient increase in patient platelet counts in relapsed thrombocytopenia following PSE. Therefore, laparoscopic splenectomy appears to be a superior supportive therapy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients.

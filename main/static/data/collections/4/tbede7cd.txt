BACKGROUND A highly reliable and safe means of gastric closure for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has yet to be developed. The authors have previously described the self-approximating transluminal access technique (STAT) as a means for gastrotomy closure in transgastric surgery. It has yet to be determined whether biologic mesh can be utilized in facilitating gastrotomy closure via STAT. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of implanting an acellular porcine dermal matrix (LifeCell) into the STAT tunnel and investigate whether it will become incorporated into the submucosal plane of the STAT tunnel. METHODS Five pigs underwent transgastric left uterine horn resection utilizing STAT. For closure, the acellular porcine dermal matrix was implanted within the submucosal plane, occluding the seromuscular incision. The mucosal incision was then closed over the matrix with endoscopically placed clips. Necropsy was performed after a 3 week survival period. Histopathological evaluation of the tunnel and matrix was performed. RESULTS The matrix was successfully implanted in all five animals. Average OR time was 151 ± 68 min. Average time to anchor and embed the matrix within the tunnel was 4 ± 1 and 9 ± 12 min, respectively. There was one duodenal perforation related to a balloon occlusion device. Postoperative course was unremarkable; the average weight gain at 3 weeks was 22 ± 5 lbs. On necropsy, one animal had some protrusion of the matrix at the serotomy, with adhesions to small bowel and liver. Histopathology revealed one clinically insignificant microabscess but otherwise demonstrated local inflammation and fibrovascular ingrowth into the matrix. CONCLUSIONS The porcine dermal matrix can be successfully implanted within the gastric submucosal plane and evidence of incorporation into the gastric wall by 3 weeks was demonstrated.

During the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurred in Vietnam in March 2003, the French Ministries of Health and Foreign Affairs dispatched a mission composed of personnel from the emergency medical assistance department (French acronym, SAMU) and one virologist from the Pasteur Institute to the French hospital in Hanoi. The purpose of this mission was to reinforce the local medical staff, to bring medical equipment, and to assist in identifying the cause of the SARS epidemic. Most of the 39 cases observed involved health care personnel working at the hospital. Six including 5 who died presented severe manifestations. Application of strict empirical measures of isolation, hygiene, and personal protection allowed containment of the SARS outbreak in Hanoi.

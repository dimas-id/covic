We report two cases of successful use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to control of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)-related mediastinitis. It is difficult to treat mediastinitis in patients who have undergone LVAD implantation, because it is impossible to remove the infected artificial materials from the mediastinal space. This report indicates that NPWT might become the preferred therapeutic option for control of mediastinitis in patients who have undergone LVAD implantation.

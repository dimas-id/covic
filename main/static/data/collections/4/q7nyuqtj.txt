It is critical to discover biomarkers for non-invasive evaluation of inflammation and oxidative stress in human body - two key common pathological factors in numerous diseases. Our study has indicated keratin 1 (K1)-based epidermal autofluorescence (AF) as a novel biomarker of this type: Epidermal green AF intensity was significantly associated with both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dosages and the serum levels of multiple cytokines in LPS-administered mice; and the green AF intensity of mouse’s skin or skin cell cultures was highly associated with the dosages of oxidative stress inducers. The epidermal AF had the characteristic polyhydral structure of the stratum spinosum. The polyhydral structure with highly increased green AF was also found in the Dorsal Index Finger’s skin of 45.59% of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, which was profoundly decreased in the stroke patients’ skin during recovery phase. Our study has further obtained multiple lines of evidence indicating K1 as an origin of the pathological insult-induced AF, including the finding showing that K1 siRNA administration significantly attenuated the increase in the mice’ epidermal AF. Collectively, our study has indicated that K1-based epidermal AF is the first biomarker for non-invasive evaluation of inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. This finding forms a basis for novel keratin’s AF-based biomedical imaging technology for not only screening and diagnosis of inflammation- and oxidative stress-associated diseases including AIS and COVID-19, but also evaluations of the inflammation and oxidative stress in the body of natural populations.

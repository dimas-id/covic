Abstract Two areas of research that have greatly increased in attention are: dipterans as vectors and the microbes they are capable of vectoring. Because it is the front-end of the fly that first encounters these microbes, this review focuses on the legs, mouthparts, and foregut, which includes the crop as major structures involved in dipteran vectoring ability. The legs and mouthparts are generally involved in mechanical transmission of microbes. However, the crop is involved in more than just mechanical transmission, for it is within the lumen of the crop that microbes are taken up with the meal of the fly, stored, and it is within the lumen that horizontal transmission of bacterial resistance has been demonstrated. In addition to storage of microbes, the crop is also involved in depositing the microbes via a process known as regurgitation. Various aspects of crop regulation are discussed and specific examples of crop involvement with microorganisms are discussed. The importance of biofilm and biofilm formation are presented, as well as, some physical parameters of the crop that might either facilitate or inhibit biofilm formation. Finally, there is a brief discussion of dipteran model systems for studying crop microbe interactions.

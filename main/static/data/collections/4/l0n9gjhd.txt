Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic presented numerous, significant challenges for medical schools, including how to select the best candidates from a pool of applicants when social distancing and other measures prevented "business as usual" admissions processes. However, selection into medical school is the gateway to medicine in many countries, and it is critical to use processes which are evidence-based, valid and reliable even under challenging circumstances. Our challenge was to plan and conduct a multiple-mini interview (MMI) in a dynamic and stringent safe distancing context.Methods: This paper reports a case study of how to plan, re-plan and conduct MMIs in an environment where substantially tighter safe distancing measures were introduced just before the MMI was due to be delivered.Results: We report on how to design and implement a fully remote, online MMI which ensured the safety of candidates and assessors.Discussion: We discuss the challenges of this approach and also reflect on broader issues associated with selection into medical school during a pandemic. The aim of the paper is to provide broadly generalizable guidance to other medical schools faced with the challenge of selecting future students under difficult conditions.

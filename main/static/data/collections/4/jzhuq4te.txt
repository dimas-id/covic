Respiratory failure is a major complication of viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1], avian influenza H5N1 infection [2], and the 2009 pandemic influenza (H1N1) infection [3]. The course may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure, requiring intensive care. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may play a supportive role in patients with severe viral pneumonia and early ARDS/acute lung injury. It can act as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation, although it is contraindicated in critically ill patients with hemodynamic instability and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome [4]. Transmission of some of these viral infections can convert from droplets to airborne during respiratory therapy.

Introduction: Little is known about the relation of cognitive impairment (CI) to COVID-19 mortality. Here, we analyse the frequency of CI in deceased COVID-19 patients. Methods: We included 477 adult cases that died after admission from March 1 to March 31, 2020: 281 with confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 who died of other causes. Results: The number of comorbidities was high in the confirmed COVID-19, and CI was common (30%: 21.1% dementia; 8.9% mild cognitive impairment). Subjects with CI were older, more lived in nursing homes and had shorter times from symptom onset to death than those without CI. COVID-19 patients with CI were rarely admitted to the ICU and fewer received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, but palliative care was provided more often. Conclusions: Dementia is a frequent comorbidity in COVID-19 deceased patients. The burden of COVID-19 in the dementia community will be high.

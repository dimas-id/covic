We have previously shown that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In this study, we identified another viral protein, the spike of SARS-CoV, which played an important role in virus-stimulated COX-2 expression after screening all genes from the SARS-CoV genome. We found that an upstream calcium-dependent PKC isozyme PKC alpha that modulates the downstream ERK/NF-kappaB pathway through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ is induced by the spike protein of SARS-CoV. The ERK/NF-kappaB was identified to be involved in the activation of COX-2 promoter and production of COX-2 protein in HEK293T cells. We also demonstrated that another unusual pathway, the calcium-independent PI3K/PKC epsilon/JNK/CREB pathway, functioned in cooperation with the calcium-dependent pathway to induce COX-2 expression upon stimulation by spike protein. This pathway can be blocked by PKC epsilon-specific, small interfering RNA, PI3K/JNK kinase-specific inhibitors as well as dominant negative JNK. PKC epsilon-specific siRNA also attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK. Our results provide evidence that helps us understand the function of SRAS-CoV spike protein in SARS pathogenesis.

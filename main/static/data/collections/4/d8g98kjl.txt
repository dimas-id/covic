Skin manifestations have been increasingly reported in the setting of COVID-19. However, their incidence and presentation are debated, and the role, direct or undirect, of SARS-CoV-2 in their pathogenesis has yet to be determined. In this work, we aimed to analyze our experience in a French referral center and to perform a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of cutaneous lesions observed in COVID-19 patients. Cutaneous manifestations were assessed in COVID-19 patients admitted to Cochin Hospital (Paris, France) between March 16th and April 27th 2020. 759 confirmed moderate-to-severe COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in our institution. Eight patients (1%, 6 males, 2 females, mean age 55.6) presented with skin lesions, mainly disseminated maculo-papular exanthema, but also digitate papulo-squamous rash (reported in1 ), herpes recurrence, papulo-vesicular rash and Grover's disease. The mean delay between respiratory/systemic and dermatological signs was 13 days.

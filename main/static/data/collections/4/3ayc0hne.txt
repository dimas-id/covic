The excitement of molecular biology and of genetic knowledge and their possibilities must be balanced against our limitations in using this information for the care of our patients. There is a great discrepancy between what we know and what we can do. There are many reasons for this. A major one is that science must simplify/reduce the variables in experimentation and then generalize in terms of a specific factor or effect, whereas patients are complex with variables that we do not yet understand completely. This powerful science is now teaching us about the genetic diversity in both susceptibility and outcome of disease, and the diversity in life experiences and antigen exposures. Clinicians have tried to lump together and treat in a similar way many diverse human diseases. This has not worked well. Pancreatitis and perforated diverticulitis both produce inflammation and sepsis, but they are different processes and may both lead to multiple organ failure. This lumping together has contributed to the failure of so-called magic bullets. There are new contributors to organ damage. Gender, lifestyle and prior disease differences also complicate the care of patients. Despite this, we are slowly and gradually improving the care of our surgical patients by careful pre-, intra- and postoperative support and better, simpler and safer operations.

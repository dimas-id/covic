Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) is a new emerging virus responsible for pandemic and death. High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity have been described as poor prognosis factors. Few data have been reported in patient with immunocompromised status (solid tumor, hematological malignancy, rheumatoid conditions or organ transplant). We evaluated the characteristics of patients, including the outcome, with immunodepression hospitalized in Besancon University hospital (East of France). We wanted to identify if a type of immunosupression influences the course of Covid-19. In a cohort of 80 patients with immunosupression (42 solid tumors, 20 hematological malignancy and 18 non neoplastic immunosupression), poor outcomes (Intensive care unit hospitalization and or deaths) was frequent (38%) and tended to be more frequent in patients with hematological malignancy.

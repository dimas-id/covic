Respiratory viruses have starred in the history of humanity's pandemics. At the end of the year 2019 the appearance of a new respiratory disease COVID-19 begins, the novel coronavirus is designated SARSCoV-2. The clinical manifestations are mild in approximately 80% of cases, fever and dry cough are its predominant signs, in severe cases it is difficult to breathe, more severely in elderly patients, hypertension and diabetes. Emerging viruses represent a challenge for effective clinical treatment, rendesivir, lopinavir, chloroquine, and nitasoxanide, among others, are being tested. Clinical trials with drugs that are known and approved for use in humans are suggested. It would be interesting to test the use of tetracyclines or their semi-synthetic derivatives. Venezuela is among the least prepared countries to react to major infectious disease outbreaks, managing this new epidemic represents a significant challenge, especially considering that health centers and research institutes are greatly affected by the abandonment and the diaspora.

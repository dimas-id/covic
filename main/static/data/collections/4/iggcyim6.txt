Objectives: Clinical laboratory analyses are essential part of critical care Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-confirmed cases were doubling in Germany every 3 days during March 2020 Health care systems are preparing for an epidemic crisis Methods: We outline a cohort-based emergency planning The plan is based on three independent self-sufficient cohorts that maintain duty for 7 days, followed by quarantine-like rest for 14 days COVID-19-infected and otherwise ill personnel will be replaced by a tactical reserve, which is again replaced by recovered staff Results: We switched to the outlined system when incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed 50/100,000 residents Our parameter spectrum was reduced to the essential analyses in agreement with our clinical colleagues So far the system works well In model calculations, the system is robust to maintain essential laboratory functionality even when incidence of COVID-19 is higher than that currently observed in the most severely hit countries Conclusions: We outline a cohort-based emergency planning to maintain essential functionality of a clinical laboratory while minimizing the risk of spreading infection with COVID-19 among our workforce during the COVID-19 epidemic faced in 2020

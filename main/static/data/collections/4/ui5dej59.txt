With no drugs currently approved for treatment and cure of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), hydroxychloroquine is one of the many first-line drugs used in the management. However, given the life-threatening adverse effects of HCQ that have been reported, its use as a prophylactic treatment remains debated. HCQ has long been used in India for the treatment of malaria, auto-immune and inflammatory diseases, and even type 2 diabetes mellitus recently. We aimed to review existing literature and relevant Web sites regarding the safety profile of HCQ in the Indian subcontinent. A non-systematic critical analysis of all published literature/studies focused on the Indian population, recording on the use of HCQ for various indications up till April 2020 was done and frequency of occurrence of HCQ related life-threatening and cardiac side effects were noted. Results from PubMed database showed an incidence of 0.6% of cardiac-related side effects and 7.42% of other self-limiting and minor side effects among the Indian population on HCQ. Considering its minimal risk and favorable safety profile, cost-effectiveness, availability, and affordability in India, the use of hydroxychloroquine in the fight against COVID-19 appears rationale. Following the results of our study, we hypothesize that Indians might be less likely to suffer from cardiac-related side effects given their genetic make-up. However, this would need further studies, clinical trials, and a pharmacogenomic understanding of the subject.

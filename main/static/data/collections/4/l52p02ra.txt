COVID-19 presents an unprecedented challenge to hospitals and the systems in which they operate. The primary exponential surge of COVID-19 cases is arguably the most devastating event a hospital will face. In some countries, these surges during the initial outbreak of the disease have resulted in hospitals suffering from significant resource strain, leading to excess patient mortality and negatively impacting staff wellbeing. As experience builds in managing these surges, it has become evident that agile, tailored planning tools are required. The comprehensive hospital agile preparedness (CHAPs) tool provides clinical planners with six key domains to consider that frequently create resource strain during COVID-19; it also allows local planners to identify issues unique to their hospital, system or region. Although this tool has been developed from COVID-19 experiences, it has potential to be modified for a variety of pandemic scenarios according to transmission modes, rates and critical care resource requirements.

The aim of our observation was to establish whether or not renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) may help control blood pressure (BP) levels in patients with severe hypertension refractory to pharmacological therapy. Out of a group of 12 patients, candidates for RSD, with uncontrolled hypertension and a systolic BP over 190 mm Hg on repeated measurements despite optimal medication, four patients were excluded for multiple renal arteries and one for hyperaldosteronism. Seven patients had RSD using a Symplicity device (5M, 2 F) with a mean age of 64.9 years. While all were followed up for a minimum of 6 months, follow-up duration in the majority of them was substantially longer (12-20 months). At six months post-RSD, six of the seven patients showed a decrease in systolic BP by at least 15 mm Hg while receiving the same or fewer doses of antihypertensive agents. A similar response was seen in diastolic BP. The BP decrease was maintained throughout whole follow-up. In a small group of patients with severe hypertension, we demonstrated that renal sympathetic denervation is capable of reducing blood pressure even in patients with severe hypertension.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is often attributed to complex interactions between the host, pathogen, and the environment. Likewise, many BRD treatment failures result from interactions between the host, pathogen, environment, drug, and drug administrator. Investigating and addressing the underlying causes of BRD treatment failures can improve clinical outcomes and animal welfare of future cases, improve morale of employees, reduce direct costs of dealing with BRD treatment failures, refine antimicrobial prescribing practices, and advance antimicrobial stewardship. This article discusses these interactions and provides guidance to veterinary practitioners on evaluating the success of treatment protocols.

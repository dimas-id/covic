The intraoperative vs postoperative initiation of haemofiltration procedures in patients submitted for major vascular surgery is a controversial issue and a subject of debate in recent literature. We report the case of a 50 yr old patient scheduled for aorto-bifemoral bypass with mesenteric revascularization in whom the haemofiltration procedure (Prismaflex with Onix filter) was installed intraoperatively. Known to have non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, the patient was admitted for Leriche syndrome, abdominal aorta thrombosis, superior and inferior mesenteric artery occlusion, celiac trunk occlusion, bilateral critical limb ischemia and mild renal impairment. The filtration rate was 25 ml/kg/h, ultrafiltration rate of 50 ml/h and 2 h clampation time. Haemofiltration was continued postoperatively in the ICU for another 48 h. The patient had a favorable evolution with restoration of renal function and a significant improvement of the biochemical parameters. In conclusion the early haemofiltration applied in this case provided clear beneficial effects, probably preventing the evolution towards multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

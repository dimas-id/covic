This study aimed to compare the treatment pathway and 30-day outcomes of hip fracture patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic with the pre-pandemic period. Three periods were retrospectively analysed: period C = 23/03/2020–11/05/2020, period A = 23/03/2018–11/05/2018, period B = 23/03/2019–11/05/2019. No statistically significant differences in time to surgery, type of treatment, complications, and mortality rates were noted. A significant reduction (p = 0.021) in the time to orthogeriatric assessment and length of inpatient stay (p < 0.001) was found in period C. Institutional adaptions to facilitate prompt treatment in hip fractures during the pandemic resulted in favourable outcomes.

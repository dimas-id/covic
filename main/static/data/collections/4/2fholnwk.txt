Payment of fruits or vegetables in retail stores normally require them to be manually identified. This paper presents an image classification method, based on lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with the goal of speeding up the checkout process in stores. A new dataset of images is introduced that considers three classes of fruits, inside or without plastic bags. In order to increase the classification accuracy, different input features are added into the CNN architecture. Such inputs are, a single RGB color, the RGB histogram, and the RGB centroid obtained from K-means clustering. The results show an overall 95% classification accuracy for fruits with no plastic bag, and 93% for fruits in a plastic bag .

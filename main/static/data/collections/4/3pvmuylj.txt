This paper introduces a novel method of spectrum sensing in communication systems that utilizes nonuniform sampling in conjunction with a suitable spectral analysis tool. It is referred to here as spectral analysis for randomized sampling (SARS). Owing to the deployment of nonuniform sampling, the proposed technique can accomplish the sensing task by using sampling rates well below the ones demanded by uniform-sampling-based digital signal processing (DSP). The effect of the cyclostationary nature of the incoming digital communication signal on the adequacy of the adopted periodogram-type estimator for the spectrum sensing operation is addressed. The statistical characteristics of the estimator are presented. General reliability conditions on the length of the required signal observation window, i.e., sensing time, for a chosen sampling rate or vice versa are provided amid a sought system performance. The impact of the presence of noise and processing transmissions with various power levels on the derived dependability recommendations is given. The analytical results are illustrated by numerical examples. This paper establishes a new framework for efficient spectrum sensing where considerable savings on the sampling rate and number of processed samples can be attained.

World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 23, 2020, according to WHO, there are 213 countries, areas or territories with COVID-19 positive cases. To effectively address this situation, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics and to concoct efficient control measures to mitigate/contain the spread. In this work, the COVID-19 dynamics is modelled using susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed model with a nonlinear incidence rate. In order to control the transmission, the coefficient of nonlinear incidence function is adopted as the Governmental control input. To adequately understand the COVID-19 dynamics, bifurcation analysis is performed and the effect of varying reproduction number on the COVID-19 transmission is studied. The inadequacy of an open-loop approach in controlling the disease spread is validated via numerical simulations and a robust closed-loop control methodology using sliding mode control is also presented. The proposed SMC strategy could bring the basic reproduction number closer to 1 from an initial value of 2.5, thus limiting the exposed and infected individuals to a controllable threshold value. The model and the proposed control strategy are then compared with real-time data in order to verify its efficacy.

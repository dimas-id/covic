BACKGROUND: Neonatal gastro-intestinal perforation [NGIP] is one of the major problems in pediatric surgical practice. Although the outcomes of neonatal surgery have improved markedly over the past decade the mortality rates of neonates with NGIP are still high. The aim of this study was to present the possible etiological factors, clinical findings, and operative procedures of NIP in our locality. RESULTS: A total of 34 neonates with NGIP were included in this study. The median age at presentation was (15.8 ± 7.0 SD) days. The median interval between presentation and surgical interference was (2.0 ± 1.1 SD).Necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC] was the commonest cause of neonatal gastro-intestinal perforation. The commonest site of perforation was the colon [11cases]. The overall mortality rate was 11 cases [32.4%]. The main cause of mortality was neonatal NEC [6 cases]. Eight cases [40 %] died out of 20 cases which the interval between the presentation and interference were more than one day. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal gastro-intestinal perforations are still associated with high mortality rate in our institutions, and delayed diagnosis with increased interval between the presentation and surgical intervention are associated with increased mortality. In our locality, although NEC is the commonest cause of NGIP, the iatrogenic cause is relatively higher than reported.

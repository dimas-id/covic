OBJECTIVE Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (aSICH) is a common phenomenon after endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke, but its prognostic impacts remain unclear. This study evaluated functional outcomes of thrombectomy in patients with and without aSICH. METHODS Patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation who were treated with thrombectomy were enrolled in 21 centers. According to CT scans performed within 72 hours of endovascular procedures, patients with aSICH or without intracranial hemorrhage were included while patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) were excluded. Baseline data and functional outcomes were compared between patients with aSICH and those without intracranial hemorrhage. Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the impacts of aSICH on functional outcomes. RESULTS Of the 632 patients with endovascular treatment, 101 (16.0%) were classified as having SICH, 212 (33.5%) as having aSICH, and 319 (50.5%) as being without intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with aSICH after endovascular treatment had a lower ratio of excellent outcome (mRS 0-1, OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84, P=0.007) than those without intracranial hemorrhage. There were no significant differences concerning favorable outcome (mRS 0-2, OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14, P=0.185) or mortality (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.09, P=0.101) between patients with aSICH and those without intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS In an Asian population, aSICH after thrombectomy may decrease the likelihood of an excellent functional outcome but does not influence a favorable outcome and mortality in patients with ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation.

The lungs provide a large inner surface to guarantee respiration. In lung alveoli, a delicate membrane formed by endo- and epithelial cells with their fused basal lamina ensures rapid and effective gas exchange between alveolar and vascular compartments while concurrently forming a robust barrier against inhaled particles and microbes. However, upon infectious or sterile inflammatory stimulation, tightly regulated endothelial barrier leakiness is required for leukocyte transmigration. Further, endothelial barrier disruption may result in uncontrolled extravasation of protein-rich fluids. This brief review summarizes some important mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial barrier regulation and disruption, focusing on the role of specific cell populations, coagulation and complement cascades and mediators including angiopoietins, specific sphingolipids, adrenomedullin and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species for the regulation of pulmonary endothelial barrier function. Further, current therapeutic perspectives against development of lung injury are discussed.

Some limitations of conventional laparoscopy have been overcome by the enhanced dexterity of the robotic da Vinci system, and its use in gastrointestinal procedures is evolving. However, difficulties accessing multiple quadrants of the abdomen with the first robotic system led to a rather slow introduction of the da Vinci into the field of abdominal surgery compared with its success with urologic and cardiac procedures. The new da Vinci S HD system offers improved range of motion that allows for easier access to a wider surgical field. The authors developed a new "one-step" setup to perform a low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision and splenic flexure mobilization for rectal cancer using a completely robotic approach. This technical report describes all the major aspects for successful performance of this complex minimally invasive procedure.

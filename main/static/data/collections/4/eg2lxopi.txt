Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has spread quickly across the world and has been declared a pandemic. Indonesia has many COVID-19 cases, with a high mortality rate. This study aimed to describe the distribution of COVID-19 in Indonesia and constructed the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree from Indonesian isolates and those from other countries, including other CoVs to determine their relationship. The distribution data of COVID-19 in Indonesia were obtained from the COVID-19 Management Handling Unit and descriptively analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 isolates were retrieved from the GenBank® (National Center of Biotechnology Information, USA) and GISAID EpiCoV™ databases and were used to construct phylogenetic trees using MEGA X software. Of the 37 provinces in Indonesia, five provinces with the highest case fatality rates were DKI Jakarta, Jawa Barat, Jawa Timur, and Banten, and the five provinces with the highest cure rate were Kepulauan Riau, Bali, Aceh, Gorontalo, and DI Yogyakarta. SARS-CoV-2 Indonesian isolates were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 isolates from other countries. The rapid and widespread distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia was caused by the lack of compliance with territorial restrictions and dishonesty with medical personnel. These data revealed that mutations can occur during the transmission process, which can be caused by a history of travel and increased patient immunity.

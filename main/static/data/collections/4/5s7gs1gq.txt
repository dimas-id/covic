The paper is devoted to new aspects of ontology-based approach to control the behavior of Edge Computing devices. Despite the ontology-driven solutions are widely used to develop adaptive mechanisms to the specifics of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous computing ecosystems, the problem of creating withal full-fledged, easy to handle and efficient ontology-driven Edge Computing still remains unsolved. We propose the new approach to utilize ontology reasoning mechanism right on the extreme resource-constrained Edge devices, not in the Fog or Cloud. Thanks to this, on-the-fly modifying of device functions, as well as ad-hoc monitoring of intermediate data processed by the device and interoperability within the IoT are enabled and become more intelligent. Moreover, the smart leverage of on-demand automated transformation of Machine-to-Machine to Human-Centric IoT becomes possible. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our solution by the implementation of ontology-driven Smart Home edge device that helps locating the lost things.

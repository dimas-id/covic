OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of an in vivo small bowel bioengineering model using allogeneic aortic grafts in pigs. BACKGROUND The best treatment for short bowel syndrome is still unclear. Intestinal transplantation, as well as lifelong parenteral nutrition is associated with a 5-year survival rate of less than 50 %. We have already used allogeneic arterial segments to replace the upper airway in sheep. The results were encouraging with an induced transformation of the aortic wall into tracheo-bronchial bronchial-type tissue. METHODS Seven young mini-pigs were used. A 10-cm-diameter, allogeneic, aortic graft was interposed in an excluded small bowel segment and wrapped by the neighboring omentum. Animals were autopsied at 1 (n = 2), 3 (n = 3), and 6 months (n = 2), respectively. Specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS The overall survival rate of the animals was 71.4 %. No anastomotic leak occurred. Histologic analysis revealed intestinal-like wall transformation of the aortic graft in the surviving animals. CONCLUSION Aortic-enteric anastomosis is feasible in a porcine model. Moreover, in vivo, bioengineered, intestinal-like transformation of the vascular wall was identified.

A simple heuristic model for spread of COVID-19 infections in India is presented and compared with reported data up to April 10, 2020. Spread of infection is considered to be initiating from infected individuals and spread is assumed to take place in a compounding manner. Some of the data needed are taken from readily available sources in the web. The possible progress is then estimated based on model presented and possible scenarios are highlighted.

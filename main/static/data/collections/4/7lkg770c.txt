Effects of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) on cellular protein expression are essential for viral pathogenesis. To characterize the cellular response to EBV infection, differential proteomes of gastric epithelial AGS cells were analyzed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and liquid chromatography electrospray/ionization ion trap (LC-ESI-IT) mass spectrometry identification. Mass spectrometry identified 9 altered cellular proteins, including 5 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated proteins after EBV infection. Notably 2-DE analysis revealed that EBV infection induced increased expression of heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, actin cytoplasmic 1, pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase, caspase 9, and t-complex protein 1 subunit alpha. In addition, EBV infection considerably suppressed those cellular proteins of zinc finger protein 2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, macrophage-capping protein, and growth/ differentiation factor 11. Furthermore, the differential expressional levels of partial proteins (cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and caspase 9) were confirmed by Western blot analysis.Thus, this work effectively provided useful protein-related information to facilitate further investigation of the mechanisms underlying EBV infection and pathogenesis.

Human bocavirus (HBoV) has been identified worldwide in children with lower respiratory tract infections with an incidence of approximately 2% âˆ’11%. The role of HBoV in pathogenesis, however, is largely unknown, and little is known about the epidemiology of the virus. To study the seroepidemiology of HBoV infection, the capsid protein was expressed in insect cells. Expression of the putative major capsid protein VP2 in insect cells led to the formation of virus-like particles exhibiting the typical icosahedral appearance of parvoviruses with a diameter of approximately 20 nm. The expressed particles were used to establish an ELISA method, and serum samples from groups of children of various ages in China were tested for IgG antibodies against HBoV. HBoV antibodies were detected in as high as 36% of healthy children under 9 years. Of children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections, 31% were seropositive, and all age groups of these children showed a significantly higher level of HBoV IgG antibody than their healthy counterparts. When divided into age cohorts, results showed that more than 48% of healthy children had seroconverted by age of 4. Thus, HBoV appears to be a common infection in children. The potential pathogenesis of this virus, especially its role in lower respiratory tract infections in children warrants further investigation.

On 20 November 2019, Lassa fever was diagnosed in a physician repatriated from Sierra Leone to the Netherlands. A second physician with suspected Lassa fever, repatriated a few days later from the same healthcare facility, was confirmed infected with Lassa virus on 21 November. Comprehensive contact monitoring involving high- and low-risk contacts proved to be feasible and follow-up of the contacts did not reveal any case of secondary transmission in the Netherlands.

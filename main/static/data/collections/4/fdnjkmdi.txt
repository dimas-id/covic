BACKGROUND/AIMS The clinical course and exacerbation of portal hypertensive enteropathy (PHE) are yet to be fully clarified. This study aimed to identify factors related to PHE exacerbation in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). METHODS Fifty patients with LC (33 male; mean age, 67 years), who underwent capsule endoscopy (CE) at the Hiroshima University Hospital between February 2009 and September 2015, were followed up for >6 months. Exacerbation is defined as the appearance of new lesions or worsening of existing lesions. The association between PHE exacerbation and the clinical factors was evaluated. RESULTS PHE exacerbation was identified in 24 out of 50 (48%) of cases: erythema (14 cases); angioectasia (11 cases); erosions (9 cases); villous edema (8 cases); and esophageal varices (EVs; 6 cases). The following factors were significantly associated with PHE exacerbation: portosystemic shunts, EVs and portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) exacerbation. After therapy, CE findings among the 24 cases were as follows: villous edema (19 cases); erythema (17 cases); angioectasia (16 cases); erosions (12 cases); and EVs (9 cases), and no observable abnormalities in 2 cases. On multivariate analysis, exacerbation of EVs and PHG were independent predictors of PHE exacerbation. CONCLUSION EVs and PHG exacerbation may predict PHE exacerbation in patients with LC.

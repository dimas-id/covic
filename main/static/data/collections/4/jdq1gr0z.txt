Policies determining the duration of quarantine and return to work for confirmed COVID-19 patients still lack evidence. We report our findings regarding viral RNA positivity duration among a cohort of young patients with mild disease. Between March 20th, 2020, and May 10th, 2020, 219 soldiers were admitted to the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps (IDF-MC) COVID-19 rehabilitation center following a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. 119 of these patients, 84 (70.6%) males, 35 (29.4%) females with a median age of 21 (IQR 19-25) were classified as having mild disease and had two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests by May 10th, 2020. The median time for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in the study population was 21 days (IQR 15-27) from symptom onset, with a range of 4 to 45 days. The results of this study suggest that in young and healthy adult patients with COVID-19, the median duration of viral positivity is around three weeks. This duration is higher than previously reported in other populations. Young and healthy adults comprise much of the population workforce, and the results of this study may assist in determining the isolation period for symptomatic adults and confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Further studies on this topic should look to expand and determine the intervals of serial testing for confirmed patients and determine the duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in other populations.

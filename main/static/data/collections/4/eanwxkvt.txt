BACKGROUND The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable virus associated with a significantly increased risk of complications among the infected population. Few data are available for the outcome of pregnancy complicated by serious respiratory disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIM We herein report a series of four neonates whose mothers had recovered from new coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy. METHODS pregnant women with documented COVID-19 infection during their pregnancy, who gave birth in Parma Hospital, University of Parma, Italy, in March and April 2020, during the peak of incidence of COVID-19 in Italy. Clinical records and laboratory tests were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS All neonates were delivered at term in good conditions without congenital COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS Findings from our series of cases indicated that adverse effects on foetuses from pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 infection in late pregnancy are unlikely.

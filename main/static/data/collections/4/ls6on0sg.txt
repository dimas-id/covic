In this article, we provide a chronological description of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in Mexico from the detection of severe respiratory disease among young adults in central Mexico and the identification of the novel swine-origin influenza virus to the response of Mexican public health authorities with the swift implementation of the National Preparedness and Response Plan for Pandemic Influenza. Furthermore, we review some features of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in Mexico in relation to the devastating 1918-1920 influenza pandemic and discuss opportunities for the application of mathematical modeling in the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza. The value of historical data in increasing our understanding of past pandemic events is highlighted.

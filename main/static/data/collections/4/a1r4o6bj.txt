Abstract In the last few years, the development of a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for mammalian reovirus has allowed the production and characterization of mutant viruses. This could be especially significant in the optimization of reovirus strains for virotherapeutic applications, either as gene vectors or oncolytic viruses. The genome of a mutant virus exhibiting increased sensitivity to interferon was completely sequenced and compared with its parental virus. Viruses corresponding to either the parental or mutant viruses were then rescued by reverse genetics and shown to exhibit the expected phenotypes. Systematic rescue of different viruses harboring either of the four parental genes in a mutant virus backbone, or reciprocally, indicated that a single amino acid substitution in one of Î»2 methyltransferase domains is the major determinant of the difference in interferon sensitivity between these two viruses.

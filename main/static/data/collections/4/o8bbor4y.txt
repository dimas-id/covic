UNLABELLED One of the pathways leading to androgen independence in prostate cancer involves upregulation of insulinlike growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Radionuclide imaging of IGF-1R in tumors might be used for selection of patients who would most likely benefit from IGF-1R-targeted therapy. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo radionuclide imaging of IGF-1R expression in prostate cancer xenografts using a small nonimmunoglobulin-derived binding protein called an Affibody molecule. METHODS The IGF-1R-binding Z(IGF1R:4551) Affibody molecule was site-specifically conjugated with a maleimido derivative of DOTA and labeled with (111)In. The binding of radiolabeled Z(IGF1R:4551) to IGF-1R-expressing cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS DOTA-Z(IGF1R:4551) can be stably labeled with (111)In with preserved specific binding to IGF-1R-expressing cells in vitro. In mice, (111)In-DOTA-Z(IGF1R:4551) accumulated in IGF-1R-expressing organs (pancreas, stomach, lung, and salivary gland). Receptor saturation experiments demonstrated that targeting of DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts in NMRI nu/nu mice was IGF-1R-specific. The tumor uptake was 1.1 ± 0.3 percentage injected dose per gram, and the tumor-to-blood ratio was 3.2 ± 0.2 at 8 h after injection. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the feasibility of in vivo targeting of IGF-1R-expressing prostate cancer xenografts using an Affibody molecule. Further development of radiolabeled Affibody molecules might provide a useful clinical tool for stratification of patients with prostate cancer for IGF-1R-targeting therapy.

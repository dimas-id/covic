The use of reduced port laparoscopic surgery (RPS) has become increasingly popular. The concept of RPS includes all procedures derived from various efforts minimizing the invasiveness of surgery, with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) being the ultimate reduced port technique. Reduced-port laparoscopic gastrectomy (RPLG) for gastric cancer has not yet been fully established and still has issues such as feasibility, oncological validity, training, and education. The short-term results of reported studies are acceptable. However, long-term results that verify positive results or radical cure even in cases of cancer have not yet been published. Patients for whom RPLG is indicated should be selected carefully. Prospective multicenter studies should be conducted to establish RPS as a truly evidence-based practice that addresses not only cosmesis but also the appropriate balance between minimal invasiveness and radical cure.

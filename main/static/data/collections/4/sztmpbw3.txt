BACKGROUND Although the duodenal switch (DS) has been the most effective weight loss surgical procedure, it is a small minority of the total bariatric surgical cases performed. Modifications that can make the operation technically simpler and reduce a long-term risk of short bowel syndrome would be of benefit. The aim of this study was to detail our initial experience with a modified DS called stomach intestinal pylorus sparing (SIPS) procedure. METHODS Data from patients who underwent a primary SIPS procedure performed by two surgeons at two centers from January 2013 to August 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. All revisions of prior bariatric procedures were excluded. Regression analyses were performed for all follow-up weight loss data. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients were available. One hundred two patients were beyond 1 year postoperative, with data available for 64 (62 % followed up). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 49.4 kg/m(2). Two patients had diarrhea (1.6 %), four had abdominal hematoma (3.2 %), and one had a stricture (0.8 %) in the gastric sleeve. Two patients (1.6 %) were readmitted within 30 days. One patient (0.8 %) was reoperated due to an early postoperative ulcer. At 1 year, patients had an average change in BMI of 19 units (kg/m(2)), which was compared to an average of 38 % of total weight loss or 72 % of excess weight loss. CONCLUSIONS Modification of the classic DS to one with a single anastomosis and a longer common channel had effective weight loss results. Morbidity seems comparable to other stapling reconstructive procedures. Future analyses are needed to determine whether a SIPS procedure reduces the risk of future small bowel obstructions and micronutrient deficiencies.

PURPOSE In laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, parietal ingrowth of the mesh is of crucial importance. Until significant ingrowth occurs integrity of the repair depends solely on mesh overlap and anchoring device. Relatively few studies have addressed the effect of mesh properties and anchoring device on long-term parietal ingrowth. METHODS In 20 sheep, using laparoscopy, we inserted two different polypropylene-based meshes, Physiomesh™ and Ventralight™ ST, anchored with Protack™, SecureStrap™, or Glubran™. After 6 and 12 months, 10 sheep at each time point were euthanized, and we harvested the meshes with corresponding fascia. Mesh with fascia was attached on an Alwetron™ materials testing machine and pulled apart obtaining the peel-off energy (kilojoule (kJ)). RESULTS The strength of parietal ingrowth at 6 months was 5.99 ± 0.54 kJ (mean ± SEM), 4.94 ± 0.54 kJ and 7.35 ± 0.55 kJ when anchored with Protack™, Glubran™, or SecureStrap™, respectively. At 6 months, the strength of parietal ingrowth of SecureStrap™ was significantly higher than Glubran™ (p = 0.04). No significant difference was seen between any other combinations. Parietal ingrowth at 12 months was 7.05 ± 0.56 kJ, 7.55 ± 0.54 kJ, and 5.73 ± 0.54 kJ when anchored with Protack™, Glubran™, and SecureStrap™, respectively. No significant difference in strength of parietal ingrowth was seen between the three types of anchoring, (p = 1.00, p = 1.00, and p = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS At 12 months, the strength of parietal ingrowth was the same for all comparisons. The two polypropylene meshes showed equal strength of parietal ingrowth independent of mesh properties and anchoring devices used.

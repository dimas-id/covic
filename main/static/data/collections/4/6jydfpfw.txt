We investigated age related synaptic plasticity in thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) as a part of visual information processing system in the brain. Simulation experiments were performed using a hierarchical spike timing neural network model in NEST simulator. The model consists of multiple layers starting with retinal photoreceptors through thalamic relay, primary visual cortex layers up to the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) responsible for decision making and preparation of motor response. All synaptic inter- and intra-layer connections of our model are structured according to the literature information. The present work extends the model with spike timing dependent plastic (STDP) synapses within TRN as well as from visual cortex to LIP area. Synaptic strength changes were forced by teaching signal typical for three different age groups (young, middle and elderly) determined experimentally from eye movement data collected by eye tracking device from human subjects preforming a simplified simulated visual navigation task.

Griffithsin (GRFT) is an antiviral lectin, originally derived from a red alga, which is currently being investigated as a topical microbicide to prevent transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Targeting GRFT to the apoplast for production in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in necrotic symptoms associated with a hypersensitive response (HR)‐like cell death, accompanied by H(2)O(2) generation and increased PR1 expression. Mannose‐binding lectins surfactant protein D (SP‐D), cyanovirin‐N (CV‐N) and human mannose‐binding lectin (hMBL) also induce salicylic acid (SA)‐dependent HR‐like cell death in N. benthamiana, and this effect is mediated by the lectin's glycan binding activity. We found that secreted GRFT interacts with an endogenous glycoprotein, α‐xylosidase (XYL1), which is involved in cell wall organization. The necrotic effect could be mitigated by overexpression of Arabidopsis XYL1, and by co‐expression of SA‐degrading enzyme NahG, providing strategies for enhancing expression of oligomannose‐binding lectins in plants.

INTRODUCTION The standard technique for Ivor Lewis minimally invasive esophagectomy involves a two-stage approach necessitating repositioning mid-procedure. TECHNIQUE We describe our technique for a one-stage hand-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy that allows sequential access to the chest and abdomen within the same surgical field, eliminating the need for repositioning. The patient is positioned in a "corkscrew" configuration with the abdomen supine and the chest rotated to the left to allow access to the right chest. The abdomen and chest are prepped into a single operative field. This technique allows sequential access to the abdomen for gastric mobilization, chest for division of the esophagus, abdomen for construction of the gastric conduit, and chest for intrathoracic anastomosis. CONCLUSION This approach enables extracorporeal construction of the conduit, which helps ensure a clear distal margin on the specimen and facilitates conduit length by placing the stomach on stretch during stapling.

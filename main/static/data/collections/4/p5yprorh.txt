New pathogens have emerged that now complicate the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as a potential cause of CAP, particularly complicated CAP. In this literature review, the incidence, invasiveness, and antimicrobial management of CA-MRSA is discussed. Based on existing data and the rising incidence of CA-MRSA, we recommend a change in antibiotic selection for complicated CAP.

Five of thirteen Dengue antibody- positive serum samples, dated 2017 (pre-dating the COVID-19 outbreak) produced false-positive results in SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid strip tests. Our results emphasize the importance of NAT and/or virus antigen tests to complement sero-surveillance for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19/Dengue in regions where both viruses are co-endemic.

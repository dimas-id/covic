BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound is a bedside non-irradiating tool for assessment and monitoring of lung diseases. A lung ultrasound score based on visualized artefacts allows reliable quantification of lung aeration, and is useful to monitor mechanical ventilation setting, fluid resuscitation and antibiotic response in critical care. In the context of interstitial lung diseases associated to connective tissue disorders, lung ultrasound has been integrated to computed tomography for diagnosis and follow-up monitoring of chronic lung disease progression. CASE PRESENTATION: This case describes a severe acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease associated to dermatomyositisâ€“polymyositis requiring prolonged extra-corporeal life support. Lung ultrasound score was performed daily and allowed monitoring and guiding both the need of advanced imaging as computed tomography and immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests lung ultrasound may be a useful monitoring tool for the response to immunosuppressive therapy in acute severe rheumatic interstitial lung disease, where chest X-ray is poorly informative, and transportation is at high risk.

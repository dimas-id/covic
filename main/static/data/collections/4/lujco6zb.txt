OBJECTIVES We present our single center results of two commonly used surgical techniques, the modified single-patch and double-patch technique for the repair of the complete atrioventricular septal defect. METHODS We enrolled 49 patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect who were operated by a single surgeon between 2004 and 2014. The modified single-patch technique was performed in 32 cases (group S), whereas the defect was repaired with the double-patch technique in 17 patients (group D). RESULTS The mean age at the time of operation was 7.7 ± 8.6 (range 1-48) months and 9.9 ± 12.5 (range 1.5-48) months, in groups S and D, respectively. Mean body weight was 6.7 ± 3 (range 3.5-15.5) kilograms and 7.2 ± 3.8 (range 4.3-14.5) kilograms in groups S and D, respectively. Cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were shorter in the modified single-patch group (65.6 ± 16.3 vs. 98.7 ± 19.8 minutes, p = 0.0001; 88.9 ± 23.3 vs. 128.9 ± 28.0 minutes, p = 0.0001). Postoperative atrioventricular valve function was improved in both groups. Mean follow-up period was 4.4 ± 3.2 (range 1.2-9.9) years. One patient in each group underwent reoperation for left atrioventricular valve insufficiency. We encountered two early and one late mortalities in modified single-patch group. One early mortality was experienced in the unmodified group. CONCLUSIONS The modified single-patch and two-patch techniques have comparable results; however, the modified single-patch technique is performed with significantly shorter cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times, therefore we have adopted this technique on a routine basis for the treatment of the complete atrioventricular septal defect in our institute.

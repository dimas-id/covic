BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people throughout the world since December 2019. However, there is a limited amount of data about pediatric patients infected with the disease agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: The epidemiological, laboratory, radiological, and treatment features of the pediatric patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age of 81 children included in the study was 9.50 years (0–17.75 years). The most frequent symptoms at the time of admission were fever (58%), cough (52%), and fatigue or myalgia (19%). The abnormal laboratory findings in these cases were decreased lymphocytes (2.5%, n = 2), leucopenia (5%, n = 4), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (17.2%, n = 14), C-reactive protein (16%, n = 13), procalcitonin (3.7%, n = 3), and D-dimer (12.3%, n = 10). Three (4%) patients had consolidation in chest computed tomography, and three (4%) had ground-glass opacities. None of the patients needed intensive care except for the newborns. The median time to turn SARS-CoV-2 negative in the RT-PCR test was 5 (3–10) days. The median length of hospital stay was 5 (4–10) days. The time to turn SARS-CoV-2 negative in the RT-PCR test and the length of hospital stay were significantly longer for those aged five years or younger than others (P = 0.037, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared to adults, COVID-19 is milder and more distinctive in children. As a result, more conservative approaches might be preferred in children for the diagnostic, clinical, and even therapeutic applications.

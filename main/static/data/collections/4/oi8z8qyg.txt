PURPOSE To examine the short-term outcomes of intracorporeal anastomosis during totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy retrospectively at multiple institutions. PATIENTS AND METHODS We collected data of the patients who had undergone totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy at 4 institutions. All patients received an intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy. RESULTS Of the 215 patients evaluated, 147 underwent functional end-to-end anastomosis (FEEA) as the intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (FEEA group), and 68 patients received a circular stapler anastomosis (Circular group). The rate of tumor invasion to the esophagus was significantly higher in the Circular group than in the FEEA group (33% vs. 6%, respectively; P<0.0001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the circular stapler anastomosis and high preoperative BMI were statistically significant risk factors for postoperative leakage. However, the rates of complications and mortality were not significantly different between groups. CONSIDERATION Our results showed that each type of esophagojejunostomy is safe and feasible for patients with gastric cancer with acceptable morbidity and mortality.

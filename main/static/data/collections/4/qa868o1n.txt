In this commentary on “A gammaherpesvirus licenses CD8 T cells to protect the host from pneumovirus-induced immunopathologies”, the authors highlight the growing literature suggesting that herpesvirus infections shape subsequent immune responses to other pathogens, especially by broadening CD8+T-cell responses. These observations have implications for vaccine development against other important pathogens, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus.

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), once considered to be very rare, are now increasingly recognized because of growing knowledge in the immunological field and the availability of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques and therapeutic modalities [161]. However in a database of >120,000 inpatients of a general hospital for conditions suggestive of ID 59 patients were tested, and an undiagnosed PID was found in 17 (29%) of the subjects tested [107]. The publication of the first case of agammaglobulinemia by Bruton in 1952 [60] demonstrated that the PID diagnosis is first done in the laboratory. However, PIDs require specialized immunological centers for diagnosis and management [33]. A large body of epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis of the existence of a close etiopathogenetic relation between PID and atopy [73]. In particular, an elevated frequency of asthma, food allergy (FA), atopic dermatitis and enteric pathologies can be found in various PIDs. In addition we will discuss another subject that is certainly of interest: the pseudo-immunodepressed child with recurrent respiratory infections (RRIs), an event that often requires medical intervention and that very often leads to the suspicion that it involves antibody deficiencies [149].

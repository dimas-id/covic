Thailand has been struggling to control and prevent H5N1 avian influenza on both the animal health and public health fronts. Prevention and control programs for animals and humans are improving, with infections in poultry currently under control and no human cases seen in 2007. In awareness of the risk of an influenza pandemic, Thailand is joining global efforts in pandemic influenza preparedness. The national preparedness plan highlights building of national capacity for self-reliance and regional/international cooperation. Public health response to avian influenza and pandemic preparedness benefit significantly from the experience of responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome. This underlines the need to strengthen infrastructure and manpower, ensure public confidence and cooperation, secure maximum government advocacy and support, and forge multi-sector and international cooperation.

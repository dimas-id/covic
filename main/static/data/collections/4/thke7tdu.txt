INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic surgery for totally extraperitoneal repair (SILS-TEP) of irreducible inguinal hernias and incarcerated inguinal hernias. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 194 patients, including 16 with irreducible or incarcerated hernia, who had undergone SILS-TEP from May 2016 to December 2017 at Kinki Central Hospital. The outcomes of patients with irreducible or incarcerated hernia and those with reducible hernia were compared. For irreducible or incarcerated hernia, laparoscopic exploration with hernia reduction through an intraumbilical incision was performed. If no bowel resection was needed, one-stage SILS-TEP was performed. If bowel resection was required, two-stage SILS-TEP was performed 2-3 months after the bowel resection. RESULTS Of the 16 patients, 8 had an irreducible hernia, and 8 had an incarcerated hernia. The eight patients with an incarcerated hernia underwent emergency surgery, and among these patients, two needed single-incision laparoscopic partial resection of the ileum followed by two-stage SILS-TEP. Fourteen patients, excluding the two patients who required single-incision laparoscopic partial resection of the ileum, underwent laparoscopic exploration with hernia reduction followed by one-stage SILS-TEP. Among these 14 patients, one with an irreducible hernia required conversion to Kugel patch repair. The operative outcomes were generally comparable between the two groups. However, the operative time was longer for unilateral hernia, and more seromas were seen in the irreducible or incarcerated group. No other major complications or cases of hernia recurrence were noted in this study. CONCLUSIONS SILS-TEP, which offers good cosmetic results, can be safely performed for irreducible or incarcerated inguinal hernia.

PURPOSES The aim of this study was to explore predictive factors for portal or splenic vein thrombosis (VT) that might cause serious problems after distal pancreatectomy (DP). METHODS A total of 230 patients who underwent DP between 2008 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed to identify predictive factors for portal or splenic VT. RESULTS Ultimately, 164 patients were analyzed. Portal or splenic VT was significantly correlated with age < 65 years old, benign tumor, laparoscopic surgery, preservation of the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and left gastric vein (LGV), preservation of the IMV only, no drainage vein, length of the residual splenic vein (RSV) â‰¥ 26 mm, vessel dissection with a linear stapler, and intra-abdominal abscess (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis indicated that the length of the RSV (odds ratio [OR]: 9.15, P = 0.03) was an independent predictive factor for portal VT and that the length of the RSV (OR: 37.9, P < 0.01), vessel dissection with a linear stapler (OR: 6.49, P = 0.03), and intra-abdominal abscess (OR: 23.0, P = 0.02) were independent predictive factors for splenic VT. CONCLUSION As the length of the RSV was significantly associated with portal or splenic VT, a follow-up imaging diagnosis might be recommended for such cases.

Conti and Younes have pointed to a connection between lower TLR7 expression in men and their increased vulnerability towards a severe form of COVID-19 infection (1). I had started to investigate the same idea and think that I have discovered a wealth of additional supporting information that renders the hypothesis plausible and, if correct, could establish lower TLR7 activity/sensitivity as a common molecular characteristic of several high-risk patient groups.

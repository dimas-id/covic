Abstract Investigation of the secondary metabolites of the ascidian Herdmania momus led to the isolation and characterization of four new nucleoside derivatives (1â€“4). Structural studies showed that these derivatives represent a series of rare methylsulfinyladenosine derivatives of interconvertible transesterification isomers and/or sulfinyl epimers. The antiviral activities of these rare nucleosides were evaluated against a series of human pathogenic viruses.

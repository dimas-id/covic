ABSTRACT Objective To describe the modified operational plan we implemented for residents and faculty in our orthopaedic surgery department to allow continuation of resident education and other core activities during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Design Description of educational augmentation and programming modifications Setting The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Baltimore, MD Participants Residents and faculty, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery Methods In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented a modified operational schedule and remote curriculum in the orthopaedic surgery department of our health system. Our plan was guided by the following principles: protecting the workforce while providing essential clinical care; maintaining continuity of education and research; and promoting social distancing while minimizing the impact on team psychosocial well-being. Results The operational schedule and remote curriculum have been implemented successfully and allow resident education and other core departmental functions to continue as our health care system responds to the pandemic. Conclusions We have been proactive and deliberate in implementing these operational changes, without compromise of our workforce. This experience provides residents exposure to real-life systems-based practice. We hope that our early experience will provide a framework for other surgical residency programs facing this crisis.

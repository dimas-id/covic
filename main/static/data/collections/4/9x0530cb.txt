Abstract Juxta-articular myxomata are benign tumors which are mostly encountered in the vicinity of larger joints. Few cases in the hand have been reported. We present a case of a juxta-articular myxoma at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb in a 40 year-old man. The preoperative diagnostic work-up included 4D MR-Angiography and ultrasound. The histochemical examination of the resected tumor established the diagnosis definitively. A follow-up MRI, scheduled without any clinical suspicion of tumor-recurrence, 9 months postoperatively, did not reveal any obvious recurrence. At 14 months, the patient has full motion without pain and declined any further imaging.

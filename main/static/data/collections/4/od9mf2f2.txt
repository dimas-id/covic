More stringent constraints placed nowadays on water companies to provide high quality drinking water, increasing water resources scarcity in many areas of the planet, forcing water companies to work on marginal water bodies for supply, and the threat of hostile actions by political extremists and terrorist groups, that may willingly and deliberately cause contamination of an otherwise safe supply, are recent issues that have spurred demand for more efficient and comprehensive online water monitoring technologies. Traditionally, quality parameters associated with drinking water provision were monitored using routine grab samples followed by laboratory analysis. This approach only allowed to capture small data sets, mostly unrepresentative of the true variance at the source, and allowed potentially important events to occur undetected. This paper examines state-of-the-art technologies for online monitoring of water quality in supply water systems, and reports some recent application examples.

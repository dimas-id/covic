Atrial fibrillation is a common clinical manifestation in hospitalized coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Medications used to treat atrial fibrillation such as antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants may have significant drug interactions with emerging COVID-19 treatments. Common unintended non-therapeutic target effects of COVID-19 treatment include IKr blockade, CYP450 isoenzyme inhibition or activation, and P-glycoprotein inhibition. Drug-drug interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants in these patients may lead to significant bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, or severe bleeding. It is important for clinicians to be aware of these interactions, drug metabolism changes, and clinical consequences when choosing antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants for COVID-19 patients with atrial fibrillation. The objective of this review is to provide a practical guide for clinicians who are managing COVID-19 patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation.

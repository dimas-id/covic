Abstract NICEATM and ICCVAM convened an international workshop to review the state of the science of human and veterinary vaccine potency and safety testing methods, and to identify opportunities to advance new and improved methods that can further reduce, refine, and replace animal use. This report addresses methods and strategies identified by workshop participants for replacement of animals used for potency testing of human vaccines. Vaccines considered to have the highest priority for future efforts were (1) vaccines for which antigen quantification methods are already developed but not validated, (2) vaccines/components that require the largest number of animals, (3) vaccines that require an in vivo challenge test, and (4) vaccines with in vivo tests that are highly variable and cause a significant number of invalid tests. Vaccine potency tests identified as the highest priorities for replacement were those for diphtheria and tetanus, pertussis (whole cell and acellular), rabies, anthrax, polio vaccine (inactivated) and complex combination vaccines based on DT or DTwP/aP. Research into understanding the precise mechanism of protection afforded by vaccines and the identification of clinically relevant immunological markers are needed to facilitate the successful implementation of in vitro testing alternatives. This report also identifies several priority human vaccines and associated research objectives that are necessary to successfully implement in vitro vaccine potency testing alternatives.

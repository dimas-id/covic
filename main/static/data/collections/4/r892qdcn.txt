Abstract Clinical samples were evaluated with the Mobile Analysis Platform (MAP) to determine platform performance for detecting respiratory viruses in samples previously characterized using clinical reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. The percent agreement between MAP and clinical results was 97% for influenza A (73/75), 100% (21/21) for influenza B, 100% (6/6) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 80% (4/5) for negative specimens. The approximate limit of detection of the MAP was 30 copies/assay for RSV and 1500 copies/assay for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

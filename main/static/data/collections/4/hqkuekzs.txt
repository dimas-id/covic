A recombinant vaccinia virus (rWR-SARS-S)expressing spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was constructed. The expression of full length recombinant SARS spike protein (rSS) in HeLa cells possessing specific reaction ability to chicken anti-sera was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot (190 kD). HeLa cells infected with rWR-SARS-S also showed high sensitivity in detecting specific serum antibody by indirect immunofluoresence assay (IFA). The results above indicated that the availability of such a faithful model system offers particular advantages for the study of SARS in that it reduces the need for direct manipulation of an exotic pathogen. In the absence of infectious SARS, we may safely carry out detailed biochemical and genetic manipulations to investigate features of viral replication and gene function, as well as explore new avenue for vaccine development.

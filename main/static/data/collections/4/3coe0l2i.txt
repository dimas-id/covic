INTRODUCTION: Catatonia has been associated with many medical conditions, including systemic infections. Several neuropsychiatric sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been identified to date. CASE: We describe a case of catatonia in a patient with COVID-19. He had no prior medical, substance use, or psychiatric history. His condition improved with administration of lorazepam. DISCUSSION: Potential etiologies of this patientâ€™s catatonia are explored, including COVID-19 itself, medications, and an acute presentation of a psychiatric disorder. The limitations posed by infection risk on psychiatric evaluations are discussed. CONCLUSION: We highlight the importance of considering catatonia in the diagnosis of altered mental status. We also identify catatonia as a potential neuropsychiatric consequence of COVID-19

Osteoid osteoma, a benign bone tumor, is characterized by a generally less than 1 cm nidus surrounded by a zone of reactive sclerosis. It is frequently located in the femur and tibia; on the other hand in up to 5% of cases it may be presented in upper extremities. In previous years, its treatment was usually open surgery with en-bloc resection or curettage of the tumor. Various minimal invasive percutaneous treatments including radiofrequency ablation became popular in last years. In this report, the difficulties encountered during radiofrequency ablation treatment in small bones is described in a 19-year-old female case of osteoid osteoma.

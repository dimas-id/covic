Publisher Summary This chapter deals with the digestive system. The major and minor salivary glands and their secretions also represent and integral part of the protective mechanism of the oral cavity, and derangement of saliva production may lead to loss of integrity of the oral mucosa. Drug-induced abnormalities of taste sensation are also well-described phenomena occurring in man although human studies are necessary for the detection of these effects. Inflammation of the oral cavity may involve the buccal mucosa, the gingiva (gingivitis), the tongue (glossitis), and the peridontal tissues (peridontitis). Therapeutic agents can induce inflammatory lesions in the tongue. Moreover, a protective layer of mucus, a visco-elastic material containing high molecular weight glycoproteins produced by the major and minor salivary glands, covers the stratified squamous mucosa of the oral cavity. Salivary secretions also possess digestive enzyme activity although in herbivores and carnivores, it is usually low in contrast to high digestive enzyme activity in omnivorous species.

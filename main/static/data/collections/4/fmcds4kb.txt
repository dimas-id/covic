Droplet generation and transport during coughing and sneezing has been studied for decades to characterize disease transmission by symptomatic individuals. Nevertheless, many reports document that asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of COVID-19, probably during conversations in social interactions. Researchers have shown that droplet emission occurs during speech, yet there are few quantitative studies of the flows that provide the transport mechanism; the relevant fluid dynamics is largely unstudied. This lack of quantitative characterization means that when virus is present there is little public health guidance for understanding risk and mitigation strategies, e.g. the"six-foot rule". Here we analyze flows during breathing and speaking, including linguistic features, using order-of-magnitudes estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments. We show how plosive sounds like `P' are associated with vortical structures, leading to rapid transport over half a meter in a split second. When produced individually, puffs decay over a meter, with the distance traveled in time $t$ scaling as $L\sim t^{1/4}$, and mix with the slower environmental circulation. In contrast, the transport of exhaled material over time scales longer than a few seconds, characteristic of speech, which is effectively a train of puffs, is a conical turbulent jet with a scaling law $L\sim t^{1/2}$. Typically, the exhaled air in front of a speaker extends 2 m after 30 seconds of normal speech. We believe this work will inform thinking about aerosol transport in disease transmission for humans and other animals, and yield a better understanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e., aerolinguistics.

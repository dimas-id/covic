BACKGROUND This study aimed to evaluate laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) adrenalectomy via the retroperitoneal approach using the Alexis wound retractor with standard laparoscopic instrumentation. METHODS Since October 2009, seven LESS retroperitoneal adrenalectomies have been completed successfully with a homemade single port created using an Alexis wound retractor as an access platform through a 3-cm incision beneath the tip of the 12th rib. RESULTS All the LESS procedures for these seven patients with adrenal tumors (size, 1.3-6.0 cm; 4 right, 1 left) were completed successfully without traditional laparoscopic conversion or complication. The average operative time was 159 min, and the estimated blood loss was 100 ml. The average hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-3 days). CONCLUSIONS The preliminary results show that LESS retroperitoneal adrenalectomy is a safe and feasible procedure for functional adrenal tumors using standard laparoscopic instruments.

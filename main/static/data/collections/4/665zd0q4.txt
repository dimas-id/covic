In the 100 years since their discovery, retroviruses have played a special role in virology and in molecular biology. These agents have been at the center of cancer research and shaped our understanding of cell growth, differentiation and survival in ways that stretch far beyond investigations using these viruses. The discovery of retroviral oncogenes established the central paradigm that altered cellular genes can provide a dominant signal initiating cancer development. Their unique replication mechanism and their integration into cellular DNA allow these viruses to alter the properties of their hosts beyond the life span of the infected individual and contribute to the evolution of species. This same property has made retroviral vectors an important tool for gene therapy. Indeed, the impact of retrovirus research has been far-reaching and despite the amazing progress that has been made, retroviruses continue to reveal new insights into the host â€“ pathogen interaction.

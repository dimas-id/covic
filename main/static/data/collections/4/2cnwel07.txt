The emergence of influenza A H7N9 in infection has posed a great threat to public health globally. Poor immunogenicity of H7N9 haemagglutinin (HA) is a major obstacle to the development of an effective H7N9 vaccine. Here, we found that the vaccine containing the H7HA head conjugated with IgG Fc (Hd-Fc) induced strong neutralizing antibody responses and protection against H7N9 infection, whilst the Fc-conjugated H7HA stalk (St-Fc)-based vaccine could not induce neutralizing antibodies, although the St-Fc-immunized mice were partially protected. The vaccines containing the full-length extracellular domain of HA conjugated with Fc and the mixture of Hd-Fc plus St-Fc induced significantly lower neutralizing antibody and haemagglutination inhibition titres than the Hd-Fc-based vaccine. These results suggest that the St-Fc may have inhibitory effects on the neutralizing immunogenicity of Hd-Fc. Therefore, the neutralizing domain(s), such as the receptor-binding domain, in the HA head should be kept and the non-neutralizing domain(s) in the HA stalk with the ability to potentially suppress the neutralizing immunogenicity of HA head should be removed from Fc-conjugated HA-based influenza vaccines to increase the neutralizing antibody response.

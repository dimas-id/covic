Despite consistent research into the molecular principles of the DNA damage repair pathway for almost two decades, it has only recently been found that RNA metabolism is very tightly related to this pathway, and the two ancient biochemical mechanisms act in alliance to maintain cellular genomic integrity. The close links between these pathways are well exemplified by examining the base excision repair pathway, which is now well known for dual roles of many of its members in DNA repair and RNA surveillance, including APE1, SMUG1, and PARP1. With additional links between these pathways steadily emerging, this review aims to provide a summary of the emerging roles for DNA repair proteins in the post-transcriptional regulation of RNAs.

Increased production of inflammatory cytokines and myeloid-derived suppressor cells occur in COVID-19 patients. These inversely correlated with perforin-expressing NK and CD3+T-cells. We observed a lower perforin+ NK cells number in intensive care unit (ICU) compared to non-ICU patients, suggesting an impairment of the immune cytotoxic arm as a pathogenic mechanism.

We read with great interest the article by Cheng H et al. The authors mentioned that angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is protective against novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We would like to explain how cytosolic pH increases the COVID‐19 infection by affecting the ACE2. In addition, we would like to mention that amiloride, which increases the cytosolic pH, can be used in the COVID‐19 treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

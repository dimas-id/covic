Abstract Purpose To describe the epidemiology and outcome of the first 100 COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. Methods We included the first 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taiwan. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were extracted from outbreak investigation reports and medical records. Results Illness onset of the 100 patients was during January 11 to March 16, 2020. Twenty-nine (29%) had at least one underlying condition and ten (10%) were asymptomatic. Seventy-one were imported, including four clusters. Twenty-nine were locally-acquired, including four clusters. The median days from onset to report was longer in locally-acquired cases (10 vs 3 days). Three patients died (case fatality rate 3%) and all of them had underlying conditions. As of May 13, 2020, 93 had been discharged in stable condition; the median hospital stay was 30 days (range, 10â€’79 days). Conclusion The first 100 cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan showed the persistent threat of imported cases from different countries. Even though sporadic locally-acquired disease has been identified, through contact investigation, isolation, quarantine and implementation of social distancing measures, the epidemic is contained to a manageable level with minimal local transmission.

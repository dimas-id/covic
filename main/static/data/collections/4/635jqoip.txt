The rapid spread of COVID-19 has led to personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage worldwide1,2 . Recently, the adaptation of commercially available modified full-faced snorkel masks (mFFSMs) has been proposed as an alternative of PPE shortage. mFFSMs were adapted and used by health care workers during the COVID-19 crisis3 . An mFFSM is composed of an off-the-shelf snorkel mask, a custom adapter (three-dimensional-printed with a custom print file that sourced attributes from the designs found at Pneumask and OceanReef.), and a filter cartridge (Figure1-a).

Neboviruses and genogroup III noroviruses (NoVsGIII) are causative agents of calf diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of neboviruses and noroviruses in cattle in China. Twenty-eight diarrhea fecal samples collected from 5 different farms were analyzed by RT-PCR. The results showed that 3 nebovirus positive samples were detected on 2 farms, with two strains being related to Bo/DijonA216/06/FR strain and the other one clustering with NB-like strains. Meanwhile, 3 norovirus positive samples were detected on 3 farms, all of which belonged to genotype 1. Our results confirmed the presence of neboviruses and NoVsGIII in China for the first time, and supported the presence of a novel “DijonA216-like” nebovirus genotype.

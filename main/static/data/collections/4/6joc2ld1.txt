Nowadays, COVID-19 has put a significant responsibility on all of us around the world from its detection to its remediation. The globe suffer from lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers are doing their best to discover the nature of this pandemic and try to produce the possible plans to control it. One of the most effective method to understand and control the evolution of this pandemic is to model it via an efficient mathematical model. In this paper, we propose to model the COVID-19 pandemic by fractional order SIDARTHE model which not appear in the literature before. The existence of a stable solution of the fractional order COVID-19 SIDARTHE model is proved and the fractional order necessary conditions of four proposed control strategies are produced. The sensitivity of the fractional order COVID-19 SIDARTHE model to the fractional order and the infection rate parameters are displayed. All studies are numerically simulated using MATLAB software via fractional order differential equation solver.

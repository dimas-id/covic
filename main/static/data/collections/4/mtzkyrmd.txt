In Italy, more infections among healthcare personnel than in China were recorded. As of April 05, 2020 12,252 health workers in Italy have tested positive for COVID-19, making up 10% of Italy's COVID-19 cases; furthermore, 80 medical doctors and 25 nurses have died. Protecting healthcare workers is crucial in order not to amplify the COVID-19 epidemics. Moreover, relocating the public health emergency response from the hospitals to the territory, by integrating the hospital into an overall epidemic response, is a priority for contrasting further COVID-19 waves.

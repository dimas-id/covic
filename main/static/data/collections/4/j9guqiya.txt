BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery has been presented in the past few years as an innovative minimally invasive approach, one which despite its advantages is also challenging and requires specific training. We propose to analyze the performance of attendants in a specific LESS training course. METHODS Following the LESSCAR 2010 guidelines, we focused on level 1 hands-on simulator tasks and level 2 hands-on training on animal model for skills acquisition during a LESS-specific training course. Each attendant completed coordination and cut tasks on simulator, followed by a cholecystectomy on an ex vivo porcine liver. Hands-on animal model each trainee performed 1 cholecystectomy and at least 2 nephrectomies (N1, N2). Performance was analyzed through video recording and reviewed by 3 independent observers. Each result was registered according to a modified objective structured assessment of technical skills. Total task or procedure completion time was also determined. RESULTS Regarding coordination and cut tasks, attendants improved on their performance from first to third attempts with an accompanying decrease in completion time. Surgeons completed the cholecystectomy on animal model significantly faster than on simulator, although with lower performance quality. Regarding N1 and N2, attendants showed improvement both in quality and total completion time. CONCLUSIONS A gradual and positive evolution of attendants was observed throughout the training course. Thus, we believe a structured program for the acquisition of basic skills in new minimally invasive surgical approaches should be recommended. Considering that this is a small study, it would be advisable to increase the number of study subjects on future opportunities.

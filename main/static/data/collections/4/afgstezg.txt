Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a plasma protein implicated in innate immune defence against a broad range of microorganisms, including viruses. It is also thought that MBL plays a role in the recruitment of the specific clonal immune response. This was studied by injecting soluble hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) intravenously into mice deficient in both MBL-A and MBL-C (MBL DKO mice). The MBL DKO animals on mixed genetic background (SV129EvSv x C57BL/6) produced higher antibody titres than the wild-type littermates. After primary challenge with the antigen the immunoglobulin M anti-HBsAg antibody titres were threefold higher in the MBL DKO mice than in the wild-type mice. Following the boost, the immunoglobulin G anti-HBsAg antibody titres were 10-fold higher in the MBL DKO mice, suggesting that MBL plays a role in a negative feedback regulation of adaptive immunity. However, the modulating effect of MBL was dependent on the genetic environment. The MBL DKO mice backcrossed on a C57BL/6 background showed the opposite response with the MBL DKO mice now producing fewer antibodies than the wild-type animals, whereas MBL deficiency in mice with the SV129EvSv background did not show any effect in antibody production. These findings indicate that the modifying effect of MBL on the humoral immune response is influenced by the genetic environment.

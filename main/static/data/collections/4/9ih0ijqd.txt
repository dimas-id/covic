Objective@#To investigate and analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of some cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Beijing.@*Methods@#A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the data of 46 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing from 20th January 2020 to 8th February 2020 at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital. Features of clinical symptoms, laboratory inspections and imaging inspections were analyzed. Statistical analysis used Fisher exact test. If P&lt;0.05, post-hoc test was used for pairwise comparison, and the statistics were corrected by Bonferroni test.@*Results@#Among the 46 patients included in this study, 27 were male and 19 were female. The age range was between 3 - 79 years old, and the mean age was (41.8 ± 16.3) years old. The average incubation period was (4.85 ± 3.00) days. A total of 26 cases (56.5%) were clustered patients, and 12 (26.1%), 23 (50.0%) and 11 patients (23.9%)were assigned to the mild group, common group, and sever group, respectively. Fever (39.8%), cough (27.6%), and fatigue (25.3%) was the main clinical symptom for these patients. The decrease in white blood cell counts occurred in 12 patients, four had the decrease in T lymphocyte counts, 17 had the decrease in CD4 + T lymphocyte counts, seven had the decrease in CD8 + T lymphocyte counts, 21 had the increase level of C-reactive protein (45.7%), and IL-6 level increased in 32 cases (69.6%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased in 20 cases(50.0%), serum ferritin level increased in 26 cases (56.5%), and blood lactate level increased in nine cases. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of cases in which the absolute value of T lymphocytes and of CD8 + T lymphocytes decreased among the mild, common and severe groups (all P&lt;0.05). Comparing the number of cases in the three groups with elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin and blood lactate levels, the differences were statistically significant (all P&lt;0.05). The number of cases with elevated C-reactive protein levels was higher in severe group than that in mild and common group. The number of cases with elevated interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum ferritin levels were higher in severe group than in mild group. The number of cases with elevated blood lactic acid levels was higher in severe group than in mild group. The differences between the above groups were statistically significant (both adjusted P&lt;0.017). Analysis of chest X-rays showed that 34 patients (73.9%) had inflammation in the lungs.@*Conclusions@#The epidemiological characteristics of cases with COVID-19 in Beijing are mainly imported cases and clustered cases. The clinical manifestations are mainly fever , fatigue and cough. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, red blood cell sedimentation rate, serum ferritin and blood lactate levels are higher in severe patients.

With continuous advancements on active prosthetics the detection of the user's intention becomes the new technological bottleneck. While electromyography (EMG) is widely used to detect individual muscular contributions, sweat and relative sensor movements degrade the quality of the signal over time. In this paper, we bypass the problems created with the skin contact analyzing the muscular activation with Archimedean Spiral (AS) electrodes. We compare traditional EMG electrodes with AS electrodes, stacked up in textile embroidered layers to improve their functionality, and eventually adding a layer of cloth/silicon between the electrodes and the human skin to ascertain the feasibility of the method. We use n=9 volunteers to perform a loaded wrist extension and record signals from the extensor digitorum muscle group. We evaluate the amplitude and noise from all results and conclude that the AS electrode is capable of detecting muscular activation without touching the skin. As part of a low-cost prosthetic initiative, this EMG alternative can be potentially embedded to the prosthetic socket to improve usage and reduce adaptation problems.

Abstract Zoonoses are “those diseases and infections which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man.” Relevant lists of zoonotic diseases are presented. Factors, including environmental aspects that may influence the manifestation of zoonoses and their significance for public health, are discussed. Foodborne, nonfoodborne, and vector-borne diseases are presented, followed by an article on preventative actions and control measures. Specific reference is made to the ‘One Health’ concept, since, for zoonoses containment, an integrated approach and cooperation between all responsible health professionals, at all levels, is a sine qua non precondition.

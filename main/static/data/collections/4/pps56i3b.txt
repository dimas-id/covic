Background Intensive screening and testing for COVID-19 could facilitate early detection and isolation of infected persons and thereby control the size of the epidemic. It could also facilitate earlier and more targeted therapy. These factors could plausibly reduce attributable mortality which was the hypothesis tested in this study. Methods Linear regression was used to assess the country-level association between COVID-19 attributable mortality per 100 000 inhabitants (mortality/capita) and COVID-19 tests/capita (number of tests/100 000 inhabitants) controlling for the cumulative number of COVID-19 infections/100 000 inhabitants (cases/capita), the age of the epidemic (number of days between first case reported and 8 April), national health expenditure per capita and WHO world region. Results The COVID-19 mortality rate varied between 0.3 and 3110 deaths/100 000 inhabitants (median 30, IQR 8-105). The intensity of testing per 100 000 also varied considerably (median 21,970, IQR 2,735-89,095) as did the number of COVID-19 cases per 100 000 (median 1,600, IQR 340-4,760 cases/100 000). In the multivariate model, the COVID-19 mortality rate was negatively associated with tests/capita (Coef. -0.036, 95% CI -0.047- -0.025) and positively associated with cases/capita (Coef. 0.093, 95% CI 0.819- 1.034). Conclusions The results are compatible with the hypothesis that intensive testing and isolation could play a role in reducing COVID-10 mortality rates.

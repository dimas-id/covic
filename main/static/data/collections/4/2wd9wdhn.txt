SUMMARY The last major human epidemics of infectious diseases have arisen from animals. Some of them are especially threatening. The authors call attention to the danger of spread of avian influenza, either directly or indirectly through genetic rearrangements. They underline the role of animals in the epidemiology of SARS, West Nile virus, hepatitis E, NIPA and Hendra virus, ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease. The authors recommend health surveillance not only in humans but also in animals ; the teaching of zoonoses, and research on animal diseases transmissible to humans.

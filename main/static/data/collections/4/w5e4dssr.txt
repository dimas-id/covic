The Covid-19 pandemic has touched the lives of nearly every person in the world. No person living today has ever witnessed such a crisis. We strongly request that you follow the guidance in your area and be safe in all your activities. We are so thankful and proud of the medical persons and caregivers for diligently carrying out their duties. We hope and pray that you remain strong for those in need, in particular the elderly, those with medical problems, and those with compromised immune systems.

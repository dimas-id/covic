Projecting the COVID-19 curve parameters such as ending-lifecycle and cumulative cases are helpful in guiding the policy makers to mitigate the outbreak. However, overestimating these parameters may put the public and policymakers in a muddle. In this paper, an optimistic scenario is simulated, wherein the dynamics of the COVID-19 curve is allowed to spread to such an extent that the projections of the COVID-19 parameters do not take excessively high values. Based on this scenario, the ending life-cycle and cumulative cases for India and some of its states, are predicted. Our study, suggests that the fall of the peak amplitude (95%) of the major COVID-19 wave in India may take place by the 8th of September 2020 with a total count of 655000 cases. Simulation results, also indicate that Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan may end up with 263700,29360,50600,21130,24420,44170,27080,28200 cumulative cases respectively.

Good health and wellbeing of animals are essential to dairy cow farms and sustainable production of milk. Unfortunately, day-to-day monitoring of animals condition is difficult, especially in large farms where employees do not have enough time to observe animals and detect first symptoms of diseases. This paper presents an automated, IoT-based monitoring system designed to monitor the health of dairy cows. The system is composed of hardware devices, a cloud system, an end-user application, and innovative techniques of data measurements and analysis algorithms. The system was tested in a real-life scenario and has proved it can effectively monitor animal welfare and the estrus cycle.

Respiratory viruses (RVs) are a known cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this retrospective study, we focused on the first 28 d after transplantation in pediatric HSCT recipients and showed that a multiplex PCR assay significantly increased RV detection compared with a viral culture method. Among 176 pediatric HSCT recipients, 84 with respiratory symptoms within one yr after HSCT were tested by viral culture or multiplex PCR. Within 28 d after HSCT, nine patients were infected with RVs; the incidence of a first episode of RV infection within 28 d after HSCT was 5.1%. Eight patients recovered without complications. However, one patient died of adenovirus (AdV) pneumonia with pulmonary hemorrhage; the mortality rate of RV infection within 28 d after HSCT was 0.57%. In the nine patients with RV infection, five different types of RV were identified, either alone or with another RV. These were corona virus (CoV), rhinovirus (RhV) and respiratory syncytial virus combined with CoV; AdV combined with RhV; and parainfluenza virus. Viral culture detected only one case of RV infection, while multiplex PCR detected eight, suggesting that screening of respiratory infections using multiplex PCR is better than the conventional culture method.

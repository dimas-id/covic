OBJECTIVES To report a combination of standing laparoscopic technique for intra-abdominal dissection of the mesovarial pedicle followed by a limited ventral median celiotomy under general anesthesia for removal of enlarged ovaries in mares. STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Mares (n = 20) aged 3-22 years with unilateral enlarged ovaries. METHODS Enlarged ovaries were confirmed by transrectal palpation and ultrasonography. After sedation, 3 laparoscopic portals were made in the paralumbar fossa. The mesovarium was desensitized and dissected using a vessel sealing device, and the ovary was left free in the abdomen. Then under general anesthesia, the mare was positioned in dorsal recumbency and an 8 cm ventral median celiotomy made for ovary retrieval in a specimen bag. RESULTS This 2-step procedure was successfully used for removal enlarged ovaries (12-50 cm) in 17 mares and for management of behavioral problems in 3 mares. No operative or postoperative complications occurred. Owner satisfaction and cosmesis were considered excellent. CONCLUSIONS Standing laparoscopy combined with a limited median celiotomy is a safe technique for ovariectomy in mares. This technique mitigates most of the disadvantages of standing flank ovariectomy and a conventional open ventral median approach.

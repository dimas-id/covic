Populations are diverse in size, capacity response, and measures to contain a pandemic such covid19. Then, it rises serious and critical questions to whether general measures can be taken worldwide. Also, it is unclear if conventional parametric methods are suitable to study pandemics since their dynamic is modulated by biological, economical, environmental, social, and cultural factors. In this manuscript, we apply a recently developed non-parametric mathematical method that comes from regional economy, to investigate the dynamic of a pandemic. We apply this novel methodology to study the ongoing covid19 pandemic in all USA states and in the country itself. The generality of our methodology makes it suitable to investigate also the worldwide dynamics of diseases such HIV or tuberculosis.

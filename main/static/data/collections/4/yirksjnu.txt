Acute respiratory infections as one of the most common problems of healthcare systems also can be considered as an important reason for worldwide morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Coronaviruses are a group of well-known respiratory viruses that can cause acute respiratory infections. At the current state, the 2019 novel coronavirus is cited as the most worldwide problematic agent for the respiratory system. According to investigations, people with old age and underlying diseases are at higher risk of 2019 novel coronavirus infection. Indeed, they may show a severe form of the disease (with severe acute respiratory infections). Based on the promising role of cell therapy and regenerative medicine approaches in the treatment of several life-threatening diseases, it seems that applying cell-based approaches can also be a hopeful strategy for improving subjects with severe acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. Herein, due to the amazing effects of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of various diseases, this review focuses on the auxiliary role of mesenchymal stem cells to reduce inflammatory processes of acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus.

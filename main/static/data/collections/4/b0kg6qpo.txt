Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in Thailand was first detected in 2015. We performed a retrospective investigation of the presence of PDCoV in intestinal samples collected from piglets with diarrhea in Thailand from 2008 to 2015 using RT-PCR. PDCoV was found to be present as early as February 2013. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all PDCoV variants from Thailand differ from those from other countries and belong to a novel group of PDCoV that is separate from the US and Chinese PDCoV variants. Evolutionary analysis suggested that the Thai PDCoV isolates probably diverged from a different ancestor from that of the Chinese and US PDCoV isolates and that this separation occurred after 1994.

BACKGROUND/AIMS To evaluate the feasibility and safety of single-port access total laparoscopic hysterectomy (SPA-TLH) for large uterus (>500 g). METHODS A prospective data collection was performed in 21 consecutive patients in March 2010 and August 2011. Surgical outcome including operative time (OT) and estimated blood loss (EBL) were analyzed. RESULTS SPA-TLH procedures were successfully performed in 16 cases (76.2%). Of the 5 failed cases, 4 were converted to multiport TLH because of distorted uterine contours and pelvic adhesions and 1 was converted to laparotomy for bleeding control. The median OT, uterine weight, and EBL were 110 (65-165) min, 600 (502-980) g, and 200 (100-800) ml, respectively. Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated that OT and blood loss increased with increasing uterine weight (p = 0.003 and p = 0.033, respectively). No operative complications were observed during the hospital stay and 3-month follow-up following discharge. CONCLUSION SPA-TLH for large uterus is a feasible and safe technique.

Identification of mutations in mutants derived chemically is a difficult and relatively random process. NimbleGen Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) was assessed as an inexpensive, rapid method of identifying mutations in the temperature‐sensitive mutant tsm5 of the K181 (Birmingham) variant of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). This genome resequencing approach requires an established genome sequence as a reference. Comparison of tsm5 and the K181 (Birmingham) variant with the published K181 (Perth) MCMV genomic sequence revealed a total of 10 synonymous and 15 non‐synonymous SNPs in tsm5 and 14 of the latter were confirmed by sequencing. Thus, while CGS cannot be relied upon to identify correctly all mutations it was helpful for identifying a large number of mutations for further investigation that could contribute to the ts phenotype of tsm5.

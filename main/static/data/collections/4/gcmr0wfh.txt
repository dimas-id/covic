Dysphagia is a common symptom in neurodegenerative disorders and is generally associated with increased mortality. In the clinical care setting of ataxia patients, no systematical and standardized assessment of dysphagia is employed. Its impact on patients' health-related quality of life is not well understood. To assess the impact of dysphagia in ataxia patients on diet, body weight, and health-related quality of life. We conducted a large survey using self-reported questionnaires for swallowing-related quality of life (Swal-QOL) and a food frequency list in combination with retrospective clinical data of 119 patients with cerebellar ataxia treated in the neurological outpatient clinic of a large German university hospital. Seventeen percent of ataxia patients suffered from dysphagia based on the Swal-QOL score. Less than 1% of all patients reported dysphagia as one of their most disabling symptoms. Dysphagia was associated with unintentional weight loss (p = 0.02) and reduced health-related quality of life (p = 0.01) but did not affect individual nutritional habits (p > 0.05; Chi-squared test). Dysphagia is a relevant symptom in cerebellar ataxia. A systematic screening for dysphagia in patients with cerebellar ataxia would be desirable to enable early diagnosis and treatment.

Coronaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that typically cause mild respiratory disease in humans. However, over the past 20 years, three novel/variant coronaviruses have spilled over from animals into humans and have been associated with severe respiratory illness. In late 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) emerged in China and, over the following year, went on to cause approximately 8,100 cases and 774 deaths. A decade later, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, marking the beginning of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV outbreak, which has resulted in nearly 2,500 confirmed cases and 850 deaths. Now in 2020, we are in the midst of a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, which, at the time of this writing, has claimed the lives of over 83,500 people and has been confirmed in over 1,500,000 cases. These outbreaks highlight the pathogenic potential of CoVs and the importance of infection prevention and diagnostic testing to reduce the spread of infectious diseases representing a global health threat.

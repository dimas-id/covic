The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, water-salt balance and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the physiologically active mediator and mediates the main pathophysiological actions in RAS. Ang II exerts the effects by activating its receptors, primarily type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R). Most of the known pathophysiological effects of Ang II are mediated by AT1R activation. The precise physiological function of AT2R is still not clear. Generally, AT2R is considered to oppose the effects of AT1R. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein scavenger receptor-1 (LOX-1) is one of the major receptors responsible for binding, internalizing and degrading ox-LDL. The activation of LOX-1 has been known to be related to many pathophysiological events, including endothelial dysfunction and injury, fibroblast growth, and vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Many of these alterations are present in atherosclerosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia and remodeling. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of a cross-talk between LOX-1 and Ang II receptors. Their interplays are embodied in the reciprocal regulation of their expression and activity. Their interplays are involved in a series of signals. Recent studies suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important signals responsible for their cross-talk. This paper reviews these aspects of dyslipidemia and RAS activation.

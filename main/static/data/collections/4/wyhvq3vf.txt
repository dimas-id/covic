Abstract Neonates are highly susceptible to viral infections in the periphery, potentially due to deviant cytokine responses. Here, we investigated the role of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), a key anti-viral in the neonatal brain. We found that (i) IFNγ, which is critical for viral control and survival in adults, delays mortality in neonates, (ii) IFNγ limits infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells in the neonatal brain, (iii) neonates and adults differentially express pathogen recognition receptors and Type I interferons in response to the infection, (iv) both neonates and adults express IFNγ and other Th1-related factors, but expression of many cytokines/chemokines and IFNγ-responsive genes is age-dependent, and (v) administration of IFNγ extends survival and reduces CD4 T cell infiltration in the neonatal brain. Our findings suggest age-dependent expression of cytokine/chemokine profiles in the brain and distinct dynamic interplays between lymphocyte populations and cytokines/chemokines in MV-infected neonates.

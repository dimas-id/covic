Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is used to treat various cardiopulmonary disorders associated with pulmonary hypertension. The rationale is based on the fact that NO, given by inhalation, only dilates those pulmonary vessels that perfuse well-ventilated lung units. As a result, pulmonary gas exchange is improved while pulmonary vascular resistance is reduced and pulmonary blood flow is increased. Inhaled NO has been succesfully applied to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, reducing the need for extracorporeal life support. Although pulmonary hypertension and altered vasoreactivity contribute to profound hypoxaemia in adult and paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the benefit of inhaled NO still remains to be established in patients with ARDS. ARDS is a complex response of the lung to direct or indirect insults, leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and various inflammatory responses. Recent randomized trials suggest that inhaled NO only causes a transient improvement in oxygenation. Whether this effect is important in the long-term management of ARDS remains to be established. NO, measured in the exhaled breath, is an elegant and non-invasive means to monitor inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the normal upper airways, the bulk of exhaled NO originates from the paranasal sinuses. Exhaled NO is increased in nasal allergy and decreased in cystic fibrosis, nasal polyposis and chronic sinusitis. That NO production is increased in asthmatic airways is also well established. However, several questions still need to be addressed, in particular evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of the measurement techniques, and assessment of the bronchodilator action of endogenous NO.

BACKGROUND No data are available concerning the results on weight loss, correction of co-morbidities, and satisfaction rates in patients with healed gastric leak (GL) after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). OBJECTIVE Evaluate weight loss, correction of co-morbidities, and satisfaction rate of patients with healed GL after SG. SETTING University hospital, France, public practice. METHODS Between March 2004 and October 2012, all patients managed for GL after SG with a minimum of 1 year follow-up were included. These patients (GL group) were matched in terms of preoperative data and type of surgical procedure (first- or second-line SG) on a 1:2 basis with 74 patients without GL (control group) selected from a population of 899 SGs. Primary endpoint was the weight change over a 1-year period after performing SG. Secondary endpoints were GL data, co-morbidities data, and satisfaction rates 1 year after SG. RESULTS The GL group consisted of 37 patients (27 first-line SG [73%]). The mean EWL in the GL group was 52.2% and 68.8% at 6 and 12 months, whereas the mean EWL in the control group was 58.9% and 72.2%, respectively (P = .12; P = .46). No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of correction of co-morbidities. At 12 months follow-up, mean BAROS score was 6.02 in the GL group and 7.14 in the control group (P = .08). No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of the SF-36 questionnaire. CONCLUSION Despite the morbidity associated with GL, the results on weight loss, correction of co-morbidities, and satisfaction rates were similar in patients with healed GL and in patients without GL.

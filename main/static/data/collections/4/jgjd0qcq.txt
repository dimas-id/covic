BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the predominant viral cause of childhood pneumonia. Little is known about the role of viral-coinfections in the clinical severity in children infected with RSV. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of publications comparing the clinical severity between RSV mono-infection and RSV co-infection with other viruses in children under five years (<5y). Clinical severity was measured using the following six clinical outcomes: hospitalisation, length of hospital stay, use of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and deaths. We summarised the findings by clinical outcome and conducted random-effect meta-analyses, where applicable, to quantitatively synthesize the association between RSV mono-infection/RSV co-infection and the clinical severity. RESULTS: Overall, no differences in the clinical severity were found between RSV mono-infection and RSV co-infection with any viruses, except for the RSV-human metapneumovirus (hMPV) co-infection. RSV-hMPV coinfection was found to be associated with a higher risk of ICU admission (odds ratio (OR) = 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.1-25.1; OR after removal of the most influential study was 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1-12.3). We also observed a trend from three studies that RSV-hMPV coinfections were likely to be associated with longer hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that RSV-hMPV coinfections might be associated with increased risk for ICU admission in children <5y compared with RSV mono-infection but such association does not imply causation. Our findings do not support the association between RSV coinfections with other viruses and clinical severity but further large-scale investigations are needed to confirm the findings.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread since it was first detected in December of 2019 to a global pandemic with over 1.7 million confirmed cases in over 200 countries around the world at the time this document is being prepared. Due to the novel nature of the virus and the rapidly evolving understanding of the disease, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia in pediatric patients. Chest imaging plays an important role in evaluation of pediatric patients with COVID-19, however there is currently little information available describing imaging manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 and even less discussing utilization of imaging studies in pediatric patients. To specifically address these concerns, a group of international experts in pediatric thoracic imaging from 5 continents convened to create a consensus statement describing the imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in the pediatric population, discussing the potential utility of structured reporting during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, and generating consensus recommendations for utilization of chest radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of pediatric patients with COVID-19. The results were compiled into 2 structured reporting algorithms (one for CXR and one for chest CT) and 8 consensus recommendations for utilization of chest imaging in pediatric COVID-19 infection.

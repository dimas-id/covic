In unprecedented times OMFS surgeons are faced with dilemmas over treatment priority, safety of staff, safety of patients and the most appropriate use of available resource. Efforts should be made to provide best evidence based care, this will mean revisiting old techniques, and risk stratifying patients on a case by case basis. Recent experience from colleagues internationally has shown that even the wealthiest health care infrastructure is at best fragile. We hope this paper will add to the debate and hopefully provide a framework to decision making in OMFS trauma care during this difficult time.

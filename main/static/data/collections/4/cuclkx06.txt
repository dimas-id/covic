We thank So for the interest in our letter and for sharing the results about COVID-19 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Hong Kong (1). We agree that the quantification of the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory coronaviruses- 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in SLE patients is a major concern.

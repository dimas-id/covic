The purpose of this study was to investigate the early risk factors for the exacerbation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Restrospective analysis of clinical data of 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, including gender, age, comorbidities, symptoms, blood routine, clotting profile, biochemical examination, albumin, myocardial enzyme profile, inflammatory markers, and chest CT. All laboratory examination were measured within first 24 hours after admission, and chest CT were performed before admission. 56 (65.9%) patients had a history of exposure to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Fever and dry cough accounted for the highest percentage of all symptoms. Male COVID-2019 patients were more likely to develop severe pneumonia. Patients with severe and critical conditions are older and have higher rates of hypertension (p=0.003) and coronary heart disease (p=0.017). All severe and critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed bilateral lung involvement and have more multiple lobes involvement than common patients (p<0.001). Severe and critical patients showed higher WBC count (p=0.006), NEU count (p=0.001), NEU% (p=0.002), PCT (p=0.011), CRP (p=0.003), PT (p=0.035), D-dimer (p=0.025), AST (p=0.006), and lower LYM count (p=0.019), LYM% (p=0.001), ALB (p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed NEU count is a independent risk factor for deterioration, with the threshold of 6.5×109 ·L-1 . We concluded that the laboratory independent risk factor for the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia is NEU count. In addition, COVID-19 patients with bilateral lung involvement or multiple lobes involvement should be taken seriously and actively treated to prevent deterioration of the disease.

Chronic total occlusion (CTO) revascularization is traditionally limited by the challenges related to lesion crossing. In a smaller number of cases, however, inability to advance the balloon catheter to the crossing site can account for recanalization failure ("balloon uncrossable" CTO). We describe a case of a "balloon uncrossable" CTO in which balloon crossing was achieved after subintimal dilation and "external crushing" of the CTO lesion resulting in significant modification of the CTO atheromatous plaque.

SARS-CoV-2-caused COVID-19 cases are growing globally, calling for developing effective therapeutics to control the current pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18F3 recognized conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, whereas 7B11 recognized epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor. Our study provides an alternative approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection using anti-SARS-CoV nAbs.

BACKGROUND To correlate CD44/CD24 expression with gastric cancer recurrence and prognosis. Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality due to the high recurrence rate, of which the molecular signature has not yet been identified. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of patients with gastric cancer. Among 500 patients receiving curative resection, 95 patients had recurrence. Twenty patients from the recurrence group (95 patients) and 20 patients from the non-recurrence group (405 patients) were randomly selected and identified as "study" and "control" groups, respectively. We reviewed patients' histological study of CD44/CD24 expression by performing immunohistochemistry and recurrence rate. RESULTS Study group had higher TNM stage (III-IV) than control group (80% vs. 25%, P = 0.001). Proportion of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in study group than that in control group (90% vs. 45%, P = 0.002), and proportion of patients with 5 or more metastatic lymph nodes was also significantly higher in study group than in control group (45% vs. 15%, P = 0.007). Univariate analysis revealed no difference in risk of gastric cancer recurrence between CD44+ and CD44- patients (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.29-3.45, P =1.000). CD24+ patients showed no greater significance of gastric cancer recurrence than CD24- patients (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 0.52-6.61, P = 0.339). After adjusting for other risk factors, the association of CD44 expression (aOR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.10-4.26, P = 0.658), CD24 expression (aOR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-1.35, P = 0.081) or combined (CD44/CD24) with gastric cancer recurrence were not significant. CONCLUSION Neither individual expression of CD24 or CD44, nor combined expression of CD44/CD24 was associated with recurrence of gastric carcinoma.

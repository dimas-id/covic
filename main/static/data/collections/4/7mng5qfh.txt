The end of 2019 marked the start of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from China, which went on to envelope more than 190 countries and territories across the globe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from a group of betacoronaviruses, is responsible for COVID-19. The virulent factors include the presence of envelope and spike proteins having receptor bonding domains (RBD). Clinical manifestations can range from mild respiratory infections to fatal outcomes. The viability of virus ranges from 3 to 72 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in this pandemic situation. Due to the absence of specific antivirals and vaccine, adoption of preventive option can help to combat the specific life-threatening outcomes.

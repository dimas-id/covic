BACKGROUND Reduced-port laparoscopic surgery is the latest innovation in minimally invasive surgery. We performed single-incision plus one additional port laparoscopy-assisted anterior resection (SILS + 1-AR) starting in August 2010. This study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of SILS + 1-AR and comparing it with that of conventional laparoscopy-assisted anterior resection (C-AR). METHODS Patients with preoperative clinical stage 0 to stage III rectal cancer were included. Demographic, intraoperative, and pathological examination data, as well as short-term outcome data, of 20 patients who underwent SILS + 1-AR were retrospectively compared with that of 20 patients who underwent C-AR. Invasiveness of the two procedures was also evaluated through a vital signs diary and hematological examination on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS Operating time, mean estimated blood loss, the number of lymph nodes dissected, the number of lymph node metastases, and the mean distal resection margin length were not significantly different. However, postoperative neutrophil counts in the SILS + 1-AR group were lower than those in the C-AR group (P = 0.085). A significant difference in body temperature was observed in the SILS + 1-AR group on POD 1 (P = 0.028). No significant differences were observed in perioperative and overall morbidity between the two groups. Conversion to open surgery was required in 2 (10 %) of the 20 patients in the SILS + 1-AR group. The mean postoperative length of stay and recurrence rates were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION SILS + 1-AR for rectal cancer is similar to C-AR in safety, feasibility, and provision of oncological radicality.

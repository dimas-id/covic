The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sleep problems, depression and anxiety symptoms among conscripted frontline nurses fighting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan.This study was a cross-sectional study conducted with 100 frontline nurses. Sleep quality, depression, and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively.Mean sleep duration was 5.71âhours (SDâ=â1.09) and mean sleep latency was 33.49âminutes (SDâ=â28.87). A total of 76%, 81%, 45%, and 19% reported difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS) or early morning awakening (EMA), nightmares and using hypnotics respectively. Among 100 participants in this study, 60 (60%) had poor sleep quality, 46 (46%) suffered depression symptoms and 40 (40%) reported anxiety symptoms. Sleep quality (ORâ=â3.16, 95% CI: 1.17-8.52) and anxiety symptoms (ORâ=â8.07, 95% CI: 2.92-22.33) were significantly associated with depression symptoms. Depression symptoms (ORâ=â7.92, 95% CI: 2.89-21.73) were related to anxiety symptoms. Similarly, depression symptoms (ORâ=â3.24, 95% CI: 1.19-8.79) were associated with poor sleep quality.Sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety symptoms are very common among frontline nurses who treating patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Comprehensive measures that involve psychosocial and personal behaviors should be implemented to improve sleep quality and prevent depression and anxiety symptoms.

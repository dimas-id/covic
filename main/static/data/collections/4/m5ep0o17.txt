Purpose of the study The purpose was to explore the experience, information, support needs and decision-making of parents with congenital heart disease (CHD) during the COVID-19 crisis. Study design On-line survey design Setting An on-line survey with open/closed questions to explore the experiences of parents of children, as well as children and young people (CYP) with CHD during the COVID-19 crisis Patients Parents of children with CHD and CYP Results 184 parents and 36 CYP completed the survey. Parents worry about the virus (86.4%) vs. CYP (69.4%), whilst (89%) parents are vigilant for symptoms of the virus vs. CYP(69.4%). A thematic analysis of the qualitative comments covered 34 subthemes, forming eight-overarching themes: Virus 1)risk of infection, 2)information, guidance and advice, 3)change in health care provision, and 4)fears and anxieties; Lockdown and isolation 5)psychological and social impact, 6)keeping safe under lockdown, 7)provisions and dependence on others, 8)employment and income. Conclusions Parents and CYP were worried about the virus, although CYP less so. Parents and children however, were frustrated with the lack of specific and paediatric focused information and guidance, expressing disappointment with the adult centric information available. Parents also felt alone, especially with their concerns around the implications of cardiac service suspension and the implication for their childs health. In order to better support children and their families, resources need to be developed to address families and CYP concerns for their health during this pandemic.

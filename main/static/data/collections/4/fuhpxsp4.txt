Bats and dogs are the main reservoirs of rabies virus (RABV) in Latin America and are responsible for the maintenance of different cycles of infection. In the two neighbour and most southern Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and Santa Catarina (SC), rabies in dogs has been successfully controlled for more than 30 years. However, rabies associated to the rural cycle remains endemic, with a significant, though oscillatingâ€”annual incidence of rabies in cattle. Despite the plethora of studies on genetic analyses of Brazilian RABV, isolates from southern Brazil have only scarcely been investigated. This work was performed to identify the genetic lineages of RABVs circulating in states of RS and SC. Fifty-nine RABV cattle isolates from RS and SC were selected and submitted to reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene. In RS, the circulation of two sublineages (1A and 1B) of RABV was detected, both with characteristics of lineages usually detected in vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). In SC, only one sublineage of RABV (1B) was detected. Nevertheless, the findings reported here are expected to contribute to the understanding of the biology of the virus in the region and its interactions with the natural host D. rotundus.

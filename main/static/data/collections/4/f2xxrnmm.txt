Earlier reports on COVID‐19 have reported certain orofacial manifestations like taste loss and salivary gland infection (Dar‐Odeh et al, 2020). More recently, two studies from Spain and France reported oral ulcerative lesions in COVID‐19 patients ( Chaux‐Bodard et al, 2020; Carreras‐ Presas et al, 2020). The study from Spain included three patients. The first two cases (males) were suspected cases of COVID‐19 as testing was not done for them. Intraorally, they had oral ulcers affecting the hard palate unilaterally in the anatomic area innervated by greater palatine nerve.

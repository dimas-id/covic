Laparoscopy performed through a single incision has been increasingly reported as a novel technique implemented in a wide variety of surgical procedures. We report what we believe to be the first case of cystogastrostomy for treatment of a pancreatic pseudocyst using this technique. Patient developed pancreatic pseudocyst after severe biliary pancreatitis. The cyst was noted to increase in size on follow-up computed tomography scans. In addition, patient developed symptoms requiring intervention.

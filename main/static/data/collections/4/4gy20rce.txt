At age 2 months a male infant presented with a cyclic clinical syndrome every 14â€“21 days that included pharyngeal aphthous ulcers, high fever, lymphadenopathy, pallor, and malaise. Serial blood studies indicated cycling of all blood cell elements, compatible with a diagnosis of cyclic hematopoiesis (CH). He also manifested a progressively severe immune deficiency, not described before in human CH. When first studied at age 5 months, he was hypogammaglobulinaemic with normal B lymphocyte numbers. By 6.5 months, he was agammaglobulinaemic. At age 8 months, he developed severe pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and studies showed a state of severe combined immune deficiency. The patient received a bone marrow transplant from his HLA-identical sister with no preconditioning therapy. Subsequently, normal immune function developed and the cyclic hematopoiesis resolved. The majority of lymphocytes is of donor origin. Persistence of erythrocytes and neutrophils of recipient origin suggests that the hematopoietic stem cells were not abnormal. We speculate that this patient had a primary deficiency of a differentiation factor affecting maturation of lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cells.

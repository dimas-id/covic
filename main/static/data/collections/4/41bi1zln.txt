Objective: To observe clinical and imaging manifestations of family clustering corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Data of 16 COVID-19 patients from 7 groups of families were enrolled, and the family epidemiological history, onset time, clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Positive findings of the first X-ray films existed in 9 cases, negative in 5 cases, while 2 cases were found with suspicious pneumonia. Positive CT findings were observed in 15 cases, including 12 with bilateral lung lesions and 3 with lesions in unilateral lung, while 1 case was found without abnormality. Pure ground glass opacities (GGO) were detected in 4 cases, pure small nodule in 1 case, coexisting of GGO, consolidation and nodule in 11 cases. Pericardial effusion was noticed in 1 case, pleural and interlobar pleural thickening in 4 cases, and small amount of pleural effusion in 1 case. After effective treatment, lesions were absorbed more than 50% in 12 (12/15,80.00%) patients, whereas residual lesions were still observed in 14 patients. Conclusion: Family clustering corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has certain clinical characteristics. Combined with epidemiology and clinical symptoms, CT has important role in screening, early diagnosis, evaluation and follow-up of COVID-19.

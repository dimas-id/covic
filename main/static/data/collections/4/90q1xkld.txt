Abstract Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate whether a molecular point-of-care test (POCT) for viral and atypical pathogens added to routine real-time PCR could reduce duration of intravenous antibiotics in hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) compared with routine real-time PCR. Methods In this single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled study, we enrolled hospitalized adults diagnosed with LRTI. Patients were randomized to an intervention group (POCT FilmArray Panel for 20 viruses, atypical pathogens and bacteria plus routine real-time PCR) or a control group (routine real-time PCR for ten pathogens). The primary outcome was duration of intravenous antibiotics during hospitalization. The secondary outcomes included length of stay, cost of hospitalization and de-escalation within 72 hours and between 72 hours and 7 days. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. Results Between October 2017 and July 2018, we enrolled 800 eligible patients (398 in the intervention group and 402 in the control group). Duration of intravenous antibiotics in the intervention group was shorter than in the control (7.0 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5.0–9.0) versus 8.0 days (IQR 6.0–11.0); p <0.001). Length of hospital stay in the intervention group was significantly shorter (8.0 days (IQR 7.0–11.0) versus 9.0 days (IQR 7.0–12.0; p <0.001) and the cost of hospitalization in the intervention group was significantly lower ($1804.7 (IQR 1298.4–2633.8) versus $2042.5 (IQR 1427.4–2926.2); p 0.002) than control group. More patients in the intervention group achieved de-escalation within 72 hours (7.9%, 29/367 versus 3.2%, 12/377; p 0.005) and between 72 hours and 7 days (29.7%, 109/367 versus 22.0%, 83/377; p 0.024). Conclusions Use of molecular POCT testing for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens might help to reduce intravenous antibiotic use in hospitalized LRTI patients.

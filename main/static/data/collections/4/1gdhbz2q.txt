BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining credibility as a simple and efficient bariatric procedure with low surgical risk. Since surgical treatment for morbid obesity is relatively rare in adolescents, few results have bten accumulated so far. OBJECTIVES To prove the safety and efficacy of LSG turgery in an adolescent population METHODS Data were prospectively collected regarding adolescent patients undergoing LSG. All patients underwent pre- and postoperative medical and professional evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS Between the years 2006 and 2011, 32 adolescents underwent LSG in our center (20 females and 12males). Mean age was 16.75 years (range 14-18 years), mean weight was 121.88 kg (83-178 kg), and mean body mass index 43.23 (35-54). Thirty-four comorbid conditions were identified. LSG was the primary bariatric procedure in all the patients. Mean operative time was 60 minutes (range 45-80 min). Tiere were two complications (6.25%): an early staple line leak and a late acute cholecystitis. There were no deaths. Mean percent excess weight loss at 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-surgery was 27.9%, 41.1%, 62.6%, 79.2%, 81.7%, 71%, 75%, 102.9% and 101.6%, respectively. Comorbidities were completely resolved or ameliorated within 1 year folllowing surgery in 82.4% and 17.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LSG is feasible and safe in morbidly obese adolescents, achieving efficient weight loss and impressive resolution of comorbidities. Further studies are required to evaluate the long-term results of this procedure as well as its place among other bariatric options.

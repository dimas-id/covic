Background Breast reconstruction has a well-documented positive impact on the psychosocial well-being of women recovering from breast cancer Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are rising, and more women are seeking mastectomy as treatment and as prophylaxis Methods: Postmastectomy breast reconstruction often begins at the time of mastectomy in coordination with the oncologic breast surgeons Immediate breast reconstruction increases complication rate (11% vs 4%) and unplanned reoperation rate (7% vs 4%), requiring more personnel and resources used during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of patient care Discussion: In the setting of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), breast reconstruction demands a unique and nuanced approach, as most forms of breast reconstruction can occur successfully in a delayed fashion While this may prolong the overall time until completion of reconstruction, other factors come into play in the setting of a communicable (potentially deadly) illness Factors that must be considered include allocation of essential resources and protection of patients and families from disease transmission Conclusions: Plastic surgeons performing breast reconstruction must take these factors into account when counseling their patients, colleagues, and institutions and be proactive in determining which procedures are time-critical and which should be postponed until the disaster situation has relieved Published online 9 June 2020 Received for publication May 15, 2020;accepted May 19, 2020 Disclosure: The authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article Clara Lee is supported by a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, R18 HS026699-01A1 Matthew D Chetta, MD, FACS Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery The Ohio State University 915 Olentangy River Rd, Ste 2100 Columbus, OH 43212 E-mail: matthew chetta@osumc edu This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4 0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited The work cannot be changed in any way or used commercially without permission from the journal Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc on behalf of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons All rights reserved

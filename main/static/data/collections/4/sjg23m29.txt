INTRODUCTION Synchronous colon and gastric cancer is a rare clinical entity. In the present case, it is aimed to show that in a patient with synchronous colon and gastric cancer, laparoscopic resection can be safely performed and both specimens can be delivered through a natural orifice. In our knowledge, this is the first example showing the delivery of the gastric resection specimen through the anus in a human being. CASE REPORT Sixty-six years old male patient with an upper gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction symptoms was admitted to our department and the evaluation revealed an advanced stage gastric and a synchronous colon cancer. A laparoscopic palliative subtotal gastrectomy with a subtotal colectomy was performed. All anastomoses were performed intracorporeally and colectomy and subtotal gastrectomy specimens were successfully delivered via trans-anal route without any difficulty. Despite major abdominal organ resections, the patients required quite less analgesics in the postoperative period. DISCUSSION Specimen extraction through the natural orifices eliminates the need and problems of performing additional abdominal incisions to the patients which also leads to reduced postoperative pain. Synchronous surgical procedures do not prevent the natural orifice surgery.

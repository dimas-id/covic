This chapter is the second of a sequence of three chapters that appears in successive volumes of this series dealing with the chemistry of acyclonucleosides. The first chapter appeared in the previous volume [97AHC391] and dealt with seco-nucleosides (one bond disconnection). This chapter deals with diseco-nucleosides (two bond disconnections). The final chapter of this series will deal with tri-, tetra-, and pentaseco-nucleosides, as well as contain an appendix of the literature that appeared after the three chapters were prepared.

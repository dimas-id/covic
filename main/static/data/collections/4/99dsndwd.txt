Hematopoietic transplantation is increasingly being used as treatment for a variety of severe diseases. Data from International Registries indicate that more than 25,000 transplants are performed every year in Europe, and a similar number in the United States (US) (Copelan 2006; Gratwohl et al. 2007). The objectives of this procedure are: (1) to replace hematopoiesis affected by a severe and irreversible disorder, (2) to rescue the patient from intense marrow toxicity induced by high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation, and (3) to use a fraction of cells contained in the graft as anti-tumor immunotherapy. Of note, one or more of these objectives may be pursued in a particular situation; for example, in a patient with acute leukemia, transplantation aims to replace the neoplastic hematopoiesis by administering high-dose cytotoxic therapy and taking advantage of the graft-versus-leukemia effect of donor T-lymphocytes from the graft. In contrast, in aplastic anemia the only goal of the procedure is to restore an adequate hematopoiesis.

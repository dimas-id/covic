OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to present strategies and guidelines that can be implemented in the performance of cross-sectional interventional procedures during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION. Radiologists who perform cross-sectional interventional procedures can take several steps to minimize the risks to patients and radiology personnel, including screening referred patients to decide which procedures can be postponed, using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), minimizing the number of people involved in procedures, preserving PPE when possible, and applying proper room and equipment cleaning measures.

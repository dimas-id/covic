BACKGROUND There are still few reports on thoracoscopic lobectomy in neonates. The rate of prenatally diagnosed congenital cystic lung diseases is increasing, and such diseases appear to be a good indication for thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS We performed a prospective trial of thoracoscopic lobectomy for all congenital cystic lung diseases in children. Complete thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed by employing carbon dioxide insufflation without single lung ventilation. The results were analyzed, comparing patients with pre- and postnatal diagnoses. RESULTS Seven patients were prenatally diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) between January 2008 and August 2009, and all but one underwent surgery during the neonatal period (prenatal group). Nine patients underwent surgery after infection subsided due to lesions (7 CPAM, 2 intrapulmonary sequestration) postnatally identified by infection presence (median 2 years; range 15 days to 14 years) (postnatal group). The prenatal group showed a significantly lower rate of adhesions, shorter operation time, and smaller volume of blood loss. There were two conversions in the postnatal group. There were two postoperative complications (persistent air leak and phrenic nerve paralysis) in the prenatal group. The esthetic results were good. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic lobectomy for congenital cystic lung diseases in neonates was practicable, with good esthetic results. Dissection was easier with significantly less blood loss in patients without adhesions, even in neonates. However, this procedure necessitated highly skilled endoscopic maneuvers within a small working space.

Abstract Background Phyloepidemiologic approaches have given specific insight to understanding emergence and evolution of infection. Knowledge on the outbreak and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria would assist in providing preventive measures to reduce transmission among populations at risk. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. Materials and Method A total of 39 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the GISAID EpiFluTM database on March 29th 2020 to investigate its evolution in Nigeria. Sequences were selected based on the travel history of the patient and the collection date. Other sequences were not selected because they were short, contained artefacts, not from original source or had insufficient information. Evolutionary history was inferred using Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the common ancestor of each strain. Results The phylogenetic analysis showed the strain in Nigeria clustered in a monophyletic clade with a Wuhan sublineage. Nucleotide alignment also showed a 100% similarity indicating a common origin of evolution. Comparative analysis showed 27,972 (93.6%) identical sites and 97.6% pairwise identity with the consensus. Conclusion The study evidently showed the entire outbreak of COVID-19 infection in Nigeria stemmed from a single introduction sharing consensus similarity with the reference SARS-CoV-2 human genome from Wuhan. Preventive measures that can limit the spread of the infection among populations at risk should be implemented.

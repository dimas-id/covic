OBJECTIVES Focused transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is used perioperatively for surgical patients. Intraoperative application of TTE is feasible, but its benefits remain unclear. The intention of this study was to investigate the effect of intraoperative TTE on the management of high-risk noncardiac surgery patients. DESIGN A prospective interventional study. SETTING Single-center university hospital. PARTICIPANTS Fifty consecutive hemodynamically unstable high-risk patients anesthetized for noncardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS Focused TTE was performed on hemodynamically unstable anesthetized patients whenever circulatory instability (defined as hypotension or low cardiac output) occurred intraoperatively. A cardiac output monitoring system using pulse contour analysis was established before induction of anesthesia. The intended therapy for stabilizing the patient was documented; however, the management actually administered was guided by the results of the TTE. Differences between the 2 lines of management were documented and analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Intraoperative TTE was applied successfully in all 50 unstable patients. In 33 patients (66%, 95% confidence interval, 52.11-77.61) TTE led to a change of management. Altogether, 82 episodes of hemodynamic instability were recorded, including 38 episodes (46.34%, 95% confidence interval, 35.95-57.06) in which TTE led to a change of treatment. The most common pathologic finding was hypovolemia (66%); in contrast, in 22%, right-heart overload or right-heart failure (4%) was detected. CONCLUSIONS Focused TTE by anesthesiologists can provide new information that may alter the hemodynamic management of unstable high-risk noncardiac surgery patients in the operating room.

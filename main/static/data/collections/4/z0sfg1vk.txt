Wandering spleen is a rare condition with a reported incidence of less than 0.5% in which the spleen migrates from its normal anatomical location to any other position in the abdomen. Women constitute 80% of cases and one third of the overall patients are children. It has different clinical presentations such as asymptomatic, painless mass in the abdomen, intermittent abdominal pain and acute abdomen due to torsion of the vascular pedicle. Here we present a case of wandering spleen causing chronic pelvic pain. Laparoscopic splenopexy was the treatment choice but it could not be performed due to huge size of the wandering spleen.

Cylindrical and horizontal sticky traps painted in a range of spectral colours were used to determine the flight and landing behaviour of aphids. Data are also presented on aphid catches in suction traps at two heights and in light traps. Apart from colour sensitivity (yellow versus white) there was apparently a separate response to colour which in some species varied with season. Within yellow‐sensitive species there was also a differential response to colour. With the experimental methods used, it was not possible to define mathematically the active and passive landing components on cylindrical traps. Though the active landing component was large it varied between aphid species. Most species caught on horizontal traps at ground level had been flying above 1 m. In some species the response of males to colour and their landing behaviour differed from that of viviparae and oviparae. Four years data from suction traps suggest that aphid species can be divided into three categories on the basis of the height at which they normally fly. One group, mostly tree‐feeders, always show the greatest density at a high level (12.2 m) throughout the season. The second group always have the highest density at a low level (1 m) whilst a third group of species change at a specific date each autumn from a maximum density at 1–12.2 m. Attraction to light (moth trap) appeared to be linked with the grouping of species by height of flight. The interpretation of catch data is discussed in the light of these observations.

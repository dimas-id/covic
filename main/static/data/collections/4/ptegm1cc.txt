BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) should be deeply concerned all over the world. Panax ginseng (ginseng) as traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in the treatment and health care for respiratory diseases. However, only one similar systematic review based on common cold has been published in 2011. New studies have occurred and a new systematic evaluation which could describe ARTI is needed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search for randomized control trials of ginseng on preventing acute respiratory tract infection in the following 8 databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (via OVID) and 4 Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and Wan fang Database). The time is limited from the construction of the library to April 2020. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality of assessment will be conducted independently by 2 reviewers. The morbidity of ARTI by assessing self-report, caregiver report or clinical confirmation will be considered as the primary outcome. ARTI-related death among children or adults, other adverse events, absenteeism, laboratory-confirmed infection will be regarded as secondary outcome. All reported side effects and adverse events will be included as safety outcomes. Standard meta-analysis will be performed using Rev Man software V5.3. RESULTS: This study will provide a better understanding of the association between P ginseng and ARTI. CONCLUSION: This systematic review may offer stronger evidences for the clinicians to prevent the patients from ARTI and update the former one based on basic diseases and the safety.

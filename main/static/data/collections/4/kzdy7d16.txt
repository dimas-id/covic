PRESENTATION: Patient is a 6-year-old male with CF, MRSA colonization, and pancreatic insufficiency that presented with worsening ppFEV1 and systemic symptoms despite multiple interventions. BAL grew NTM, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Inquilinus limosus, a rare organism found in patients with CF. COURSE: I. limosus treatment was deferred. Despite treatment of other pathogens, symptoms worsened. I. limosus was targeted with meropenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin along with clindamycin for MRSA colonization. Within weeks, symptoms had resolved with ppFEV1 improvement. DISCUSSION: This case discusses the importance of a rare organism in the CF population. Targeting I.limosus was key to recovery, revealing its potential pathogenicity.

Hospital hygiene is of pivotal importance in radiology departments, where patient throughput is high and staff come into direct contact with both inpatients and outpatients. Every member of the medical and technical team should be aware of all the general and specific hygiene requirements and ensure that they are considered during the daily routine. Failure to do so on the part of just one individual can result in bacterial contamination in the department, exposing both patients and staff to the risk of infection. For the purposes of performing examinations and interventions in infectious patients, the hospital hygienist and medical hygiene officer should introduce appropriate organisational structures to ensure that an appropriate level of hygiene is guaranteed and can be adapted to each patient. This will ensure a minimal degree of disruption to work flow in the radiology department. It is of particular importance that medical and technical staff receive regular hygiene training and instruction. Such training ensures that members of staff are fully aware of the hygiene requirements, are responsibly engaged and that they each possess the expertise and confidence to deal with general and specific hygiene issues in any particular case.

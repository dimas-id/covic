Cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived and conventionally reared pigs were orally inoculated with the coronavirus-like agent, CV 777, isolate from an outbreak of epizootic diarrhea in swine of all ages. Viral particles detected by electron microscopy in the feces and intestinal contents of inoculated pigs had the typical coronavirus morphology. The present studies provided further evidence that this coronavirus-like agent is different from the two known porcine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. The experimental infection of pigs with this new agent resulted in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. This coronavirus-like agent was shown to replicate in the epithelial cells covering the small intestinal villi but, unlike transmissible gastroenteritis virus, it also replicated in the epithelial cells covering the large intestinal villi.

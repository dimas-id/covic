Abstract Early detection and identification of SARS-CoV-infected patients and actions to prevent transmission are absolutely critical to prevent another SARS outbreak. Antibodies that specifically recognize the SARS-CoV spike and nucleocapsid proteins may provide a rapid screening method to allow accurate identification and isolation of patients with the virus early in their infection. For this reason, we raised peptide-induced polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike protein and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein using 6Ã— His nucleocapsid recombinant protein. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining showed that these antibodies specifically recognized SARS-CoV.

Abstract Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) is widely used in the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases. However, the operative mechanisms of TCHM remain largely obscure, mainly because of its complicated nature and the fragmented nature of research. In recent years, systematic methodologies have been developed to discover the active compounds in TCHM and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent progress in TCHM-based antiviral research in China and other Asian countries. In particular, this review focuses on progress in targeting key steps in the viral replication cycle and key cellular components of the host defense system. Recent developments in centralized and standardized TCHM screening and databases are also summarized.

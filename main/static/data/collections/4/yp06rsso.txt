Tracking suspected cases of COVID-19 is crucial to suppressing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Active monitoring and proactive inspection are indispensable to mitigate COVID-19 spread, though these require considerable social and economic expense. To address this issue, we introduce CareCall, a call-based dialog agent which is deployed for active monitoring in Korea and Japan. We describe our system with a case study with statistics to show how the system works. Finally, we discuss a simple idea which uses CareCall to support proactive inspection.

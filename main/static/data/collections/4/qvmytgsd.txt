INTRODUCTION Entero-atmospheric fistula (EAF) is an uncommon complication. Its timing and surgical management could be extremely challenging because extensive adhesions may heavily affect the approach to the abdominal cavity. PRESENTATION OF CASE We hereby report a case of EAF in a 70 year-old man. In order to control the fistula output and the surrounding tissue damage from enteric content, the patient was managed conservatively using different technical solutions. Finally, the patient underwent surgery that started with a laparoscopic approach in order to avoid the hostile abdomen. DISCUSSION Due to the lack of guidelines, treatment of EAF requires a multidisciplinary approach and different technical options based on the experience and inventiveness of the surgeon. Among others, the vacuum assisted wound management proved to be a useful support andlaparoscopy demonstrated to be valuable in approaching the abdominal cavity. CONCLUSION According to our experience the success of the treatment of EAF may be improved adopting a multidisciplinary approach and well-planned surgery in referral centers.

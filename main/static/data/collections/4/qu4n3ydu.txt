BACKGROUND The management of severe patellofemoral arthritis in young patients remains a significant problem. For many, patellofemoral replacement is not a desirable option. Current surgical techniques for patellectomy disrupt the extensor lever arm causing weakness. We describe a new technique that maintains the extensor mechanism tension and a case series showing good results for patella-only arthritis at a mean follow-up of 11 years. METHODS Eight patellectomies were performed using a new surgical technique in patients with a mean age of 38 years, and an average follow-up of 11 years (range 8-16 years). Patients were followed up using a pain visual analogue scale, Lysholm knee score and patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS All patients experienced pain relief following surgery. Those with patella-only arthritis had better outcomes than patients who had patella and trochlea disease. All patients had either full or near full extension. Lysholm scores were better in patients who had disease confined to the patella. CONCLUSION We believe patellectomy with this tension-preserving technique has a role for the management of anterior knee pain secondary to severe patella-only arthritis in young patients where arthroplasty is not desirable.

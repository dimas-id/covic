Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer is now widely accepted and has become a standard surgery. This study investigated the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic visualization for laparoscopic gastrectomy over a conventional two-dimensional (2D) planar screen. The primary outcome of this study was operative time. Ninety-four consecutive cases of gastric cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) (25 cases) or laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) (69 cases) were enrolled in this study before and after the introduction of the 3D system. Operative time was significantly shorter in the 3D groups for both LTG (351 vs. 406 min, P = 0.026) and LDG (269 vs. 344 min, P < 0.01). During intracorporeal procedures, dissection time was significantly shorter in the 3D groups for both LTG (183 vs. 232 min, P = 0.011) and LDG (161 vs. 213 min, P < 0.01), although the time needed for anastomosis was similar between the groups. However, operators preferred intracorporeal knot-tying as a ligature for anastomosis under 3D (LTG, P = 0.012; LDG, P < 0.01). These data suggest that 3D stereoscopic visualization shortens the operative time of laparoscopic gastrectomy by reducing the intracorporeal dissection time.

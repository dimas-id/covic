Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic in just a few months, causing millions infected. Nearly 20% of COVID-19 patients present severe coagulation abnormalities, which may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases. Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders. Based on frontline practical experience and comprehensive literature review, here a panel of experts and physicians from China and Europe developed an evidence and opinion-based consensus on the prophylaxis and management of VTE associated with COVID-19. This statement aims for clinicians treating COVID-19 and provides practical recommendations in detailed situations, for example, how to choose thromboprophylactic measures for patients with diverse severity of disease and bleeding risk, or which kind of anticoagulant should be prescribed. With limited experience on COVID19-associated VTE, this expert consensus statement should be helpful for clinicians worldwide with specific suggestions.

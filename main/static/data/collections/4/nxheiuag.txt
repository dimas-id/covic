Intestinal contents of suckling (n = 45) and newly weaned (n = 45) piglets, suffering from diarrhea in the province of Villa Clara in Cuba, were tested for viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteropathogens from May to June 2008. At least one enteropathogen was identified in 53.3 % of piglets and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC; 25.6 %) was the major pathogen; mostly STa(+)/STb(+) or F4(+)/STa(+)/STb(+) ETEC were isolated. The overall occurrence of the rest of pathogens was 10 % for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and Cryptosporidium parvum, 6.7 % for rotavirus A and Isospora suis, 5.6 % for α-toxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 3.3 % for verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC), and 2.2 % for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Newport. TGEV and α-toxigenic C. perfringens were only identified in suckling piglets, while Salmonella Newport and VTEC were only detected in weaned pigs. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), β-toxigenic C. perfringens, Eimeria spp., and helminths were not identified. Eight kinds of mixed infections were detected in 25 % of enteropathogen positive piglets. ETEC was present in 10 of 12 mixed infections, and TGEV infections were never combined. This survey demonstrates that several enteropathogens are circulating in piggeries located in the province of Villa Clara in Cuba, and that is necessary to improve surveillance, prevention, and control of enteric infections in order to increase production efficiency.

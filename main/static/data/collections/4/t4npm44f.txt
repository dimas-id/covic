BACKGROUND This study aimed to determine whether the use of desflurane (DES) anesthesia combined with bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and warming is effective in reducing anesthesia-controlled operating room time (ACT) in patients undergoing lengthy abdominal surgery. METHODS Seventy patients, 40 years of age or older, undergoing abdominal surgery expected to last three to five hours were randomly assigned to the DES group (n = 35) or the control group (n = 35). Patients in the DES group were maintained with desflurane anesthesia and received BIS monitoring and warming. Patients in the control group were given non-desflurane anesthesia for maintenance, and the usage of BIS monitoring and warming were not mandatory and determined by anesthesia care providers. Early postoperative recovery times were recorded. RESULTS The times to extubation (8.8 ± 8.5 vs 14.7 ± 13.7 min, P = 0.035), eye opening (8.4 ± 8.6 vs 14.4 ± 13.4 min, P = 0.028), responds on command (8.2 ± 8.5 vs 14.4 ± 13.0 min, P = 0.022), and the ACT (23.8 ± 11.4 vs 32.7 ± 15.4 min, P = 0.009) were significantly less in the DES group than that in the control group. The postanesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay, incidence of prolonged extubation, and surgeon and anesthesiologist satisfaction were similar in two groups. Also, the result of multivariable linear regressions showed that patients who were younger, female, lower BMI and non-DES anesthesia regimen resulted in prolonged extubation. CONCLUSIONS Desflurane anesthesia combined with BIS monitoring and warming is associated with early postoperative recovery in lengthy abdominal surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION ChiCTR-INR-17013333 .

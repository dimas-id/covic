While children, particularly infants, are susceptible to severe and critical COVID-19 disease, over 55% of pediatric cases are present in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children. Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 viral particles remain viable for up to 3 hours, raising concern about risk to healthcare workers during aerosol generating procedures (APGs) in the airway and nasopharynx. Herein we describe the first case of a nasal foreign body in an asymptomatic child with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We discuss management of this child and highlight the importance of considering asymptomatic infection and preoperative testing when planning procedures of the airway in the COVID-19 era.

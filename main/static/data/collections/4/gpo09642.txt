OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and security of ERBE BiClamp(®) forceps in radical abdominal hysterectomy for managing those cervical cancers, extending to other gynecologic cancers such as endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer as well. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was made in 391 cases from 450 FIGO IA2-IIB cervical cancers between November 2005 and September 2010. After baseline character analysis, the conventional group (n = 195) was compared with the BiClamp group (n = 196) on the basis of surgical outcome and complications. Data analysis was based on intention to treat with statistics software SPSS17.0. RESULTS Comparison between conventional suture ligation and BiClamp(®) forceps is as follows: the operation time was 247.7 ± 47.7 min for the conventional suture ligation versus 224.1 ± 36.2 min (P < 0.001) for BiClamp(®) forceps, estimated blood loss was 769.2 ± 310.4 ml versus 534.8 ± 232.5 ml (P < 0.001), gauze consumption was 35.3 ± 10.6 sheets versus 28.2 ± 7.4 sheets (P < 0.001), intra-operative blood transfusion rate was 75.9 versus 28.1% (P < 0.001), hemoglobin decline was 29.2 ± 10.1 g/L versus 26.5 ± 9.2 g/L (P = 0.085), postoperative blood transfusion rate was 17.0 versus 15.6% (P = 0.818), closed suction drainage was 268.8 ± 162.0 ml versus 208.3 ± 141.7 ml (P < 0.001), hospital stay was 8.8 ± 2.5 days versus 7.1 ± 2.2 days (P < 0.001), postoperative complications was 23.6 versus 14.8% (P = 0.027). CONCLUSION With obvious decrease of operation time, blood loss, postoperative complications, hospital stay and particularly, intra-operative blood transfusion rate, BiClamp(®) forceps has been proved more efficient and controllable in radical abdominal hysterectomies of cervical cancers than conventional suture ligations, extending to endometrial cancers and ovarian cancers, hence deserves to be popularized.

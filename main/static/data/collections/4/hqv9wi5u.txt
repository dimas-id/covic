Every person on Earth has been affected in some way by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there is a marked inequity in the impact and threat of the disease for the 370 million Indigenous Peoples worldwide. While honouring diversity in peoples and cultures, this editorial (written by a collaborative of Indigenous nurses from Australia, Aotearoa (New Zealand), Canada, the United States of America and Central America), explores contemporary issues raised for Indigenous communities by this latest public health emergency. Please note, while we may describe a situation about a specific Indigenous group, readers can be assured that the issues we raise are endemic across colonised Indigenous communities globally.

OBJECTIVES This pilot study aimed to assess dimensional changes following two different alveolar socket sealing techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-one patients requiring tooth extraction and implant placement were randomly allocated to two different alveolar ridge preservation techniques. In the control group, demineralized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) and a gingival soft tissue punch were used to fill and seal the socket, whereas in the test group, the extraction socket was filled with DBBM and sealed with a hemostatic gelatin sponge. Digitalized impressions were taken before and 6 months after tooth extraction. The comparison was made on horizontal and vertical dimensional changes. RESULTS The mean vertical loss was 0.8 ± 0.6 mm for the control group and 0.7 ± 0.5 mm for the test one. No statistical difference was found between groups for the vertical shrinkage. The horizontal dimensional narrowing of the alveolar socket was respectively 7.1/4.0/2.5 mm at levels 1, 3, and 5 mm from a coronal reference level for the control group. The test group showed dimensional changes of 4.8/2.3/1.3 mm at the three different levels, respectively. A significant difference was found at levels 3 and 5 mm. Referring to a visual analog pain scale, patients reported more severe pain in the control group (5.7/10) when compared with the test group (2.8/10). The difference was statistically highly significant (P ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A significant difference was found between control and test groups regarding the horizontal dimensional changes and the post-operative pain. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Regarding this primary result, the socket sealing technique with a hemostatic sponge provides an effective and inexpensive protocol with less post-operative pain.

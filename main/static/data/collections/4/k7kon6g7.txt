Specimens from patients with gastroenteritis (GE) collected during outbreaks and from sporadic cases reported in the USSR in 1979-1984 were examined by electron microscopy (EM), enzyme immunoassay, rotavirus neutralization test in cell culture. All the winter-spring outbreaks and a considerable number (34.9%) of sporadic GE cases were caused by rotaviruses. The summer-autumn outbreaks were of non-rotavirus nature. In water-borne winter-spring outbreaks in adults, severe forms of GE with signs of dehydration were observed. Among infants, cases of virus-carrier state were detected. The rate of rotavirus detection by EM in winter-spring outbreaks depended on the time of specimen collection and decreased after 4 days from the onset of the disease. Apart from rotaviruses, adeno-, astro-, calici-, coronaviruses, and picornavirus-like particles were detected by EM in feces from GE patients.

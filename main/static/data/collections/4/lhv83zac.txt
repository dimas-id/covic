We use Bayesian Estimation for the logistic growth model in order to estimate the spread of the coronavirus epidemic in the state of New York. Models weighting all data points equally as well as models with normal error structure prove inadequate to model the process accurately. On the other hand, a model with larger weights for more recent data points and with t-distributed errors seems reasonably capable of making at least short term predictions.

Low-impact laparoscopic (LIL) cholecystectomy is an innovative surgical protocol that combines the use of mini-laparoscopic instruments (3-mm ports) under a low- and stable-pressure pneumoperitoneum (8 mmHg), with the aim of minimizing the surgical invasiveness and the risks related to CO2 insufflation on the peritoneal environment. In day-surgery settings, LIL may contribute to increase the surgical success due to several potential benefits in terms of postoperative pain intensity and time to full recovery. In 14 consecutive patients requiring cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis, LIL was carried out uneventfully. No conversion, intra-operative or postoperative complications occurred. All patients were discharged the same day of surgery. Postoperative pain was well tolerated with no need of prolonged opioid therapy. Technical aspects and indications for LIL cholecystectomy are detailed.

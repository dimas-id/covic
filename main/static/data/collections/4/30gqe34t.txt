Abstract Cold supply chains or cold-chain systems are emerging rapidly in China. This chapter presents an overview of cold-chain systems in China, including those in fresh agricultural products, frozen processed products, and biopharmaceutical products. The rapid growth of the cold-chain supply systems emphasizes the need to establish integrated systems. We attempt to explain the integration of cold supply chains in China. This chapter is based on case studies of cold-chain companies in China within the framework of value-chain analysis. Recent integrations of cold-chain suppliers in China are reviewed along with the rationales behind the integration in terms of value creation. The findings will be of use for cold-chain practitioners and policy-makers to understand the observed behaviors of cold-chain systems. Practitioners will also be able to use the findings to guide supply chain integration decisions. This study will guide policy-makers and other stakeholders to manage the sustainable development of cold-chain systems.

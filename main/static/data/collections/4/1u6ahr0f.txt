Inoculation of specific-pathogen-free chickens and turkeys with five chicken parvoviruses (ChPV) and five turkey parvoviruses (TuPV) resulted in productive virus replication only in the homologous host species. A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of the VP1 gene segment revealed a host-specific clustering of the virus strains. These results suggest that the VP1 gene plays an essential role in host specificity of ChPV and TuPV strains and could be a relevant target sequence for strain classification.

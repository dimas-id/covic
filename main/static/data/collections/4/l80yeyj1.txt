One of the arguments in favor of a viral pathogenesis for multiple sclerosis is the existence of several experimental and natural animal models of virus‐induced primary demyelination. This review deals comprehensively with such models. Well‐known examples of demyelinating viral infections in their natural host are JHM, Theiler, visna, and canine distemper encephalomyelitides. Recent reports of experimental murine infections with pathogens such as vesicular stomatitis, Chandipura, herpes simplex, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, and Semliki Forest viruses are also discussed. The thrust of the review is to include viral models suspected of producing primary demyelination on an immunopathological basis.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic worsens, this global pandemic is impacting more than 200 countries/regions and more than 4,500,000 confirmed cases worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which might attack not only the respiratory system, but also the other important organs, including the heart. It was reported that COVID-19 patients with a past history of cardiovascular diseases would have a higher mortality. Meanwhile, elevated troponin levels were frequently observed in COVID-19 cases. Besides the comprehensive treatments for COVID-19, as a cardiologist, we should also remain vigilant about the cardiac injuries, especially those with severe emergent cardiovascular symptoms.

Pleomorphic, enveloped, virus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in the stools of symptomatic infants during an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in a neonatal intensive-care unit. To determine the incidence of virus-like particles in the stool and their relation to gastrointestinal symptoms, eight surveys of stools for the particles were conducted over 40 weeks. The incidence of virus-like particles in the stool decreased from 69% to <10% over the study period. Most infants surveyed were premature; overall, 32 (36%) of 88 neonates were positive for virus-like particles. Statistically significant associations were found between virus-like particles in the stool and gastrointestinal symptoms within one week of each survey. These symptoms included water-loss stools, blood in the stool, gastric retention, bilious gastric aspirates, and abdominal distention. Several infants with virus-like particles whose mothers had gastrointestinal or “flu-like” symptoms before delivery were identified in the community (not part of the survey study).

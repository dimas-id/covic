BACKGROUND One-stop surgery was developed for patients to undergo surgical evaluation, anesthesia, surgery, and discharge all within 1 day. This study aimed to assess the feasibility, patient satisfaction, and potential of one-stop endoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia surgery. METHODS After general practitioners had been informed, prospectively selected patients with unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia underwent one-stop surgery by TEP. Pre- and postoperative questionnaires were used to evaluate patient satisfaction. RESULTS During 12 months, 52 patients were referred for one-stop surgery. There were no "no shows". The general practitioner correctly diagnosed inguinal hernia in 51 patients. On the scheduled date, 50 patients successfully underwent surgery using TEP, and 49 of these patients were satisfied with the procedure and would repeat one-stop surgery when indicated. CONCLUSION One-stop endoscopic TEP inguinal hernia surgery is feasible and safe. The majority of patients would give preference to a repeated procedure if necessary. This clinical pathway reduces the number of patient visits to the hospital for inguinal hernia repair and also suggests cost efficiency.

This study aimed to assess the clinical applicability of MRI criteria for differentiation of pituitary adenomas and cystic pituitary lesions. One hundred ninety-eight consecutive patients with surgical resection of a pituitary adenoma/cystic pituitary lesion were retrospectively analyzed, blinded to clinical data and histopathological diagnosis. Different morphologic criteria were assessed: signal intensity in T2/T1w images, pattern of contrast enhancement, size, super-/infrasellar extension, and invasion of the cavernous sinus. For validation of the criteria, a second independent patient cohort (n = 102) was analyzed for diagnostic accuracy of the criteria. We identified differences between subtypes of pituitary adenomas regarding morphological MRI criteria. Especially, ACTH-producing adenomas and GH-producing adenomas showed partially specific imaging features. Application of our criteria on the second patient cohort (n = 102) did however not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. Only differentiation between cystic pituitary lesions and adenomas was facilitated using these criteria, but did not reach statistical significance in this cohort (P = 0.352). MRI criteria might facilitate differentiation between pituitary adenomas and cystic pituitary lesions, but not between subtypes of pituitary adenomas. These subtypes show partially specific MR imaging features, however, due to a high variability knowledge of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings remain essential for the correct diagnosis.

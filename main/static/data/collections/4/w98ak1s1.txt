BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus emerged from an animal reservoir in 2002 and has the potential to reemerge, as shown by the occurrence of non-laboratory-associated new cases in the winter of 2003. In the absence of a vaccine, broad spectrum anticoronaviral medications are needed. OBJECTIVE Anticoronavirals targeting viral entry were reviewed in part I. Here we review anticoronaviral therapies directed against the intracellular life cycle, with an emphasis on allowed patents and pending patents. METHOD The published literature, in particular, patent publications is searched for relevant documents. The information is organized and critiqued. RESULTS/CONCLUSION Many promising anticoronaviral strategies are identified. Monoclonal antibodies, protease inhibitors, interferon-based drugs and nucleic-acid based antivirals are most advanced, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. A multi-pronged approach, keeping all venues open, is advocated.

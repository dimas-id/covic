Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are crucial in anti-viral immunity, acting as regulators in both adaptive and innate immunity. In this study, brief heat stress caused a decrease in splenic pDC activity in mice. Administration of Lactococcus lactis strain Plasma (LC-Plasma) significantly suppressed the decrease in pDC activity and IFN-Î± production. Abbreviations: LC-Plasma: Lactococcus lactis strain Plasma; LAB: lactic acid bacteria; pDC: plasmacytoid dendritic cell; IFN: interferons; mDC: myeloid dendritic cells.

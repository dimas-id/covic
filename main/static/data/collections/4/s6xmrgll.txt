Abstract Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to evade the immune response, including proteins that target the function of cytokines. This article provides an overview of the different strategies used by viruses to block the induction of cytokines and immune signals triggered by cytokines. Examples of virus evasion proteins are presented, such as intracellular proteins that block signal transduction and immune activation mechanisms, secreted proteins that mimic cytokines, or viral decoy receptors that inhibit the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptors. Virus-encoded proteins that target cytokines play a major role in immune modulation, and their contributions to viral pathogenesis, promoting virus replication or preventing immunopathology, are discussed.

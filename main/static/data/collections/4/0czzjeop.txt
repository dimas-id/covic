Attenuated Salmonella have been used as vectors to deliver foreign antigens as live vaccines. We have previously developed an efficient surface-display system by genetically engineering 987P fimbriae to present transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) C and A epitopes for the induction of anti-TGEV antibodies with a Salmonella vaccine vector. Here, this system was compared with an autotransporter protein surface display system. The TGEV C and A epitopes were fused to the passenger domain of the MisL autotransporter of Salmonella. Expression of both the MisL- and 987P subunit FasA-fusions to the TGEV epitopes were under the control of in vivo-induced promoters. Expression of the TGEV epitopes from the Salmonella typhimurium CS4552 (crp cya asd pgtE) vaccine strain was greater when the epitopes were fused to MisL than when they were fused to the 987P FasA subunit. However, when BALB/c mice were orally immunized with the Salmonella vector expressing the TGEV epitopes from either one of the fusion constructs or both together, the highest level of anti-TGEV antibody was obtained with the 987P-TGEV immunogen-displaying vector. This result suggested that better immune responses towards specific epitopes could be obtained by using a polymeric display system such as fimbriae.

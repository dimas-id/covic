Abstract Trifluorothymidine (TFT) is known to be concentrated in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cells in vitro in the form of phosphorylated derivatives. We studied a murine hepatitis model of HSV infection to determine whether this in vitro observation would also be demonstrable in vivo. Following i.v. injection of 100 or 160 mg/kg TFT, TFT was found in significantly higher concentrations in the livers of HSV-2 infected mice than in the livers of uninfected mice, mice infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) or mice with hepatitis from carbon tetrachloride treatment. Neither altered renal function, nor altered pharmacokinetics could account for this difference. 19F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy readily detected the 19F from TFT in both liver extracts and whole livers, particularly at higher tissue levels, i.e. > 50 Î¼g/g tissue. If further studies with living animals support these preliminary observations, clinical application could be pursued.

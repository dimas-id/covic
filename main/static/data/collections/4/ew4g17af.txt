In Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, construction of the gastrojejunostomy is commonly performed using a circular stapler. The initial description for placement of the anvil was via the transoral approach. Although the concept was ingenious, technical difficulty was encountered during passage resulting in complications such as hypopharyngeal perforation and esophageal mucosal injury. As a result, most surgeons subsequently changed their route of anvil placement to the transabdominal approach. Advances in stapler technology now allow the head of the anvil to be pre-tilted, permitting transoral introduction with greater ease and safety. This paper describes this improved method for transoral placement of the anvil during laparoscopic gastric bypass and reoperative bariatric surgery.

Abstract Bacterial and epithelial cell samples were obtained, within 24 h of onset of pharyngeal symptoms, from the palatine tonsils of nine patients (four female and five male; age range 10â€“40 years, median age 23) with acute tonsillitis, culture-positive for Streptococcus pyogenes. The specimens were examined using fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC) and gold-labelled antiserum to S. pyogenes and fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. S. pyogenes could be identified both in the mucous layer covering the tonsils and attached to the surface epithelial cells. Long chains of coccus-shaped bacteria could be seen encroaching on the epithelial cell borders. S. pyogenes can apparently penetrate the mucous barrier, attach to the epithelial cells, spread from cell to cell and possibly penetrate into the outermost layer of the epithelial cells. These events in turn provoke cytokine production and/or complement activation, which induce inflammatory reaction in the tonsillar tissue.

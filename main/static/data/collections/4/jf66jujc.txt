Faecal samples from 554 bovines randomly selected at 30 farms in Aragón were examined to investigate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections. C. parvum oocysts were identified by using the Ziehl-Neelsen modified technique in 109 (19.7%) bovines ranging from 3 days old to adults. Positive animals were found in 19 (63.3%) farms. As much as 44.4% of calves aged 3–4 days were infected, but infection rates peaked at 6–15 days of age (76.7%). Nevertheless, prevalence was also high in weaning calves aged 1.5–4 months (14%), fattening calves and heifers 4–24 months old (7.7%) and adults (17.8%). Diarrhoea was recorded in 78.6% of suckling and 29.4% of weanling calves infected by C. parvum, but it was only found to be statistically associated with infection in suckling calves (P < 0.01). All calves shedding moderate or many oocysts had diarrhoea, whereas asymptomatic infection was always correlated with few oocysts in faeces. Cryptosporidial infections were always asymptomatic in bovines older than 4 months. Giardia cysts were identified in 65 bovines (11.7%) from 16 (53.3%) of the farms surveyed. Infection rates were significantly higher in suckling (14.1%) and weanling calves (38%) than in bovines older than 4 months (2.2%) (P < 0.001). Diarrhoea was recorded in 45.5% of suckling and 10.9% of weanling calves infected by Giardia, but it was not found to be statistically associated with infection. In fact, infection rates were higher in non-diarrhoeic than in diarrhoeic calves.

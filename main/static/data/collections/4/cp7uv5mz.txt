While most pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appear to experience a milder clinical course [1,2], the present report describes a critical case of COVID-19 in a pregnant woman. We discuss the identification, diagnosis, disease progression, and treatment outcome in a 31-year-old pregnant woman admitted to Xiaolan People's Hospital of Zhongshan at 35+2 weeks of pregnancy with no known comorbidity or history of chronic illness. Onset of symptoms in the patient began with a sore throat and dry cough for 4 days, followed by fever and dyspnea for half a day.

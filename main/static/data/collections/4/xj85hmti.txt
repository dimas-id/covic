PURPOSE To report the initial use of a novel thrombectomy device for revascularization of below-the-knee thromboembolic occlusions encountered during proximal revascularization procedures. CASE REPORTS The ReVive PV Peripheral Thrombectomy Device is a non-detachable, self-expanding stent-like device recently approved for peripheral thrombectomy. Four patients (3 women; mean age 68.8 years) undergoing proximal revascularization procedures experienced embolic occlusions of all 3 trifurcation vessels in 1 patient, the tibioperoneal trunk alone in 2 cases, and the peroneal artery alone in the last patient. In all cases, the involved arteries represented the primary or sole vessel(s) providing outflow to the lower extremity. In each case, the ReVive PV device was used to successfully extract the thrombus and restore flow to the distal extremity. No complications were encountered during any of the procedures. CONCLUSION The ReVive PV peripheral thrombectomy device may facilitate the safe and efficient revascularization of distal arterial embolic occlusions.

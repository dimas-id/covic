Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with old age and underlying conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. ICH patients are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop serious complications as a result of infection. The pathophysiology of ICH patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection includes viral invasion, dysfunction of the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-MasR and ACE-Ang II-AT1R axes, overactive immune response, cytokine storm, and excessive oxidative stress. These patients have high morbidity and mortality due to hyaline membrane formation, respiratory failure, neurologic deficits, and multiple organ failure.

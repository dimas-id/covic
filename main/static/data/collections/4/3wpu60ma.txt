PURPOSE OF REVIEW Stents and flow diverters have revolutionized the treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Guglielmi coils, flexible microcatheters, and first-generation intracranial stents, such as Neuroform (Stryker Neurovascular) and Enterprise stents (Codman/DePuy-Synthes), have paved the way for the development of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) (ev3/Covidien/Medtronic) and other endovascular approaches. RECENT FINDINGS This review discusses the historical development of flow diverter technologies from the PED to similar devices, such as the Surpass stent (Stryker Neurovascular), the Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED; MicroVention, Inc.), the SILK stent (Balt Extrusion), and the p64 Flow Modulation Device (Phenox). In addition, the potential use of drug-eluting stents and various bioresorbable scaffolds (e.g., poly-L-lactic acid, magnesium), new developments in stent material (e.g., thin-film nitinol), design (e.g., biocompatible polymers, embedded microcircuitry, flow models), and potential applications for flow diverters will be considered. Endovascular treatment of cerebrovascular disease is rapidly advancing via continued development of new technology.

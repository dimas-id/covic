BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stroke at a young age is a societal challenge with a rising incidence. Our aim was to investigate sex differences in risk factors, etiology, and diagnostic process of ischemic stroke in Chinese young adults. METHODS: We retrospectively recruited 411 consecutive patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who were 18 to 50 years of age (mean age, 38.2 Â± 8.1 years, women 31.4%), admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2007 to 2018. Sex differences in demographics, risk factors, etiology, and diagnostic testing were analyzed. RESULTS: Females were significantly younger than males (36.9 versus 38.7 years, P<0.05). Hypertension (43.0%), smoking (41.1%), hyperlipidemia (37.2%), and hyperhomocysteinemia (27.9%) were common risk factors, statistically higher among males than females (P<0.05). Stroke etiology showed a significant sex difference that large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel diseases were more common among males than females (48.6% versus 19.4%, P<0.001; 9.9% versus 3.1%, P<0.05, respectively). Stroke of other determined etiology was more common among females (50.4% versus 19.1%, P<0.001). Relevant abnormality rates were higher among females on screening for autoimmune diseases and thrombophilia (23.3% versus 11.1%, P<0.05 and 50.0% versus 16.7%, P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of the traditional stroke risk factors and etiological subtype of large artery atherosclerosis in males were found, as well as prominent sex differences in relevant diagnostic testing abnormality rates, providing useful information for developing sex-specific strategies in stroke evaluation and prevention in young adults.

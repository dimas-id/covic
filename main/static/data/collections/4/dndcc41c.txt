The medium arcuate ligament syndrome is a rare disorder that results from luminal narrowing of the celiac artery by the insertion of diaphragmatic muscle or the celiac nerve plexus. The syndrome is characterized by weight loss, postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and an epigastric murmur. Surgical management involves the complete division of the medial arcuate ligament. We present two cases satisfactorily treated by laparoscopic surgery. The role of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of this syndrome is a safe alternative approach to open surgery.

Antiviral agents are urgently needed to fight severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We showed that niclosamide, an existing antihelminthic drug, was able to inhibit replication of a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV; viral antigen synthesis was totally abolished at a niclosamide concentration of 1.56 microM, as revealed by immunoblot analysis. Thus, niclosamide represents a promising drug candidate for the effective treatment of SARS-CoV infection.

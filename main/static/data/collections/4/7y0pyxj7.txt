Logistic complexities of heart transplantation embossed the necessity of utilizing novel methods, which enable heart regeneration. Human cardiosphere-derived cells (hCDCs) are taken into consideration as a promising cell resource in cell therapy in recent years. In this study, we designed an electrochemical stimulation system, which sends square pulses to the hCDCs and records their electrical response. Morphology, viability and differentiation of hCDCs are monitored at certain time courses of the treatment. Differentiating hCDCs aligned perpendicularly with respect to the direction of applied electric current, and obtained a spindle-like morphology, while they remained viable. At the same time, specific cardiac marker genes including GATA4, cTnT and &#945;-MHC showed a considerable up-regulation. Our findings confirm that hCDCs differentiate to committed cardiomyocytes when hCDCs receive an electrical energy of 0.06 - 0.12 Wh. This amount of electrical energy could be applied to the stem cells using versatile electrical stimulation patterns via commercially available devices.

The most common symptom of COVID-19 in critically ill patients is ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), with many patients requiring invasive or noninvasive respiratory support in the intensive care unit. Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be a consequence of the respiratory-swallowing incoordination common in ARDS or may occur following the respiratory support interventions. In this commentary, we highlight the risk and complications of oropharyngeal dysphagia in patients with COVID-19 and urge medical and rehabilitation professionals to consider dysphagia a prognostic complication, provide appropriate referrals, and initiate early interventions as appropriate.

Infections have plagued doctors for centuries, in both the diagnosis of the specific diseases and the identification and subsequent management of the causative agents. There is a constant need for information as new organisms emerge, existing ones develop resistance to current drugs or vaccines, and changes in epidemiology and prevalence occur. In the 21st century, obtaining this information has never been more important. Population migration and the relatively low cost of flying means that unfamiliar infectious diseases may be brought into industrialized countries. An example of this was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was first recognized in 2003. Despite modern technology and a huge input of money, it took months for the agent to be identified, a diagnostic test to be produced, and a strategy for disease reporting and isolation to be established. There is no doubt that other new and fascinating diseases will continue to emerge.

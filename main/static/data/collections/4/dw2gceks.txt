Hyperkalemia has been associated with cardiac abnormalities and muscular disorders. Hyperkalemia is a common problem associated with the acid‐base and electrolyte disturbances that occur in neonatal calves having acute diarrhea. Occasional calves with acute neonatal diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia have cardiac rate or rhythm abnormalities. Bradycardia observed in three such calves was found to represent atrial standstill and was attributed to hyperkalemia. (Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine 1992; 6:294–297)

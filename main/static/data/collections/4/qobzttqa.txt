Rapid progress in the synthetic application of benzotriazole derivatives in the last 20 years has resulted in over 1000 scientific papers on the subject. This fact is reflected in Section 5.01.7, which involves almost a half of the volume of this chapter. The section is arranged according to hybridization of the C-α atom and atomic numbers of the atoms in positions β and γ to allow an easy access to the material of interest. Recent discovery of copper catalysis in [3+2] cycloadditions of azides to acetylenes, the so-called ‘click chemistry’, which boosted application of the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives, especially in medicinal chemistry, is presented in Section 5.01.9. From the point of view of practical applications, Section 5.01.11 is organized according to the number, position, and combination of the substituents at the aromatic rings. Another novel feature that has no precedence in the previous editions of Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry is an addition of triazole and benzotriazole complexes with various transitions metals to Section 5.01.4.

A heightened state of alert due to the COVID-19 outbreak was declared by the Singapore Ministry of Health on February 7th, 2020. Within the hospital, team reorganizations, workflow revisions and physical segregation caused anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs). Fear of the unknown, emotional and physical fatigue started to take their toll on HCWs. We share our learning journey over the first 8 weeks of COVID-19: the importance of acknowledging fears and questions, and transforming them to collective knowledge; the role of empathic, hands-on leadership which brings camaraderie and calms scepticism; the importance of validating efforts and acknowledging hardship; and most importantly, the security that comes from camaraderie, breaking down hierarchical barriers and motivating each other to keep on going.

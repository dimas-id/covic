Throughout the world, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exposed the older population to health, social and financial risks. With the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on social security schemes and individuals' income, dependent older people's needs are critically at stake. Like other developing countries, older people in Ghana need to rely on their social networks through family ties, friends and social organisations for support. Also, there is the need for social security institutions, including the Social Security and National insurance Trust, to make provisions for older people aged 50+ to receive part of their pension package to meet their basic needs during the pandemic. In a period like this, social services are required as older people may need practical support in terms of having someone to run errands for them. However, government should improve social intervention package, particularly the livelihood empowerment against poverty grant for older adults with very low income in order to enhance their living conditions.

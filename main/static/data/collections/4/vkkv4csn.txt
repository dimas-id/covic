Fifty-six isolates of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were obtained from different field outbreaks in China in 2010, and they were genotyped by comparison with 19 reference strains in the present study. The results showed that LX4-type isolates are still the predominant IBVs circulating in chicken flocks in China, and these isolates could be grouped further into two clusters. Viruses in each cluster had favored amino acid residues at different positions in the S1 subunit of the spike protein. In addition, a recombination event was observed to have occurred between LX4- and tl/CH/LDT3/03I-type strains, which contributed to the emergence of a new strain. The most important finding of the study is the isolation and identification of Taiwan II-type (TW II-type) strains of IBV in mainland China in recent years. The genome of TW II-type IBV strains isolated in mainland China has experienced mutations and deletions, as demonstrated by comparison of the entire genome sequence with those of IBV strains isolated in Taiwan. Pathogenicity testing and sequence analysis of the 3' terminal untranslated region revealed that TW II-type IBV strains isolated in mainland China have a close relationship with the embryo-passaged, attenuated TW2296/95.

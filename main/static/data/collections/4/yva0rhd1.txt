This tutorial review briefly surveys the chronological evolution of biosensor concepts based on electrogenerated polymers. The most common procedures of biomolecule immobilization are classified as direct electropolymerization, physical entrapment, covalent linkage, and anchoring by affinity interactions via electropolymerized films. These are discussed, and recent bioanalytical applications are described. The discussion emphasizes the use of templates for controlling the formation of nanowires and composite polymers. Recent advances in the design of three-dimensional biological architectures are also highlighted.

While some risk factors have been identified, the reasons for the disparities in disease progression with COVID-19 are unclear, with some patients developing progressive and severe disease while in others the course is benign. Given this sense of randomness, and in the absence of a definitive treatment, medical professionals can feel helpless. It is useful to remember how much can be done to affect the trajectory of illness, even without a 'magic bullet'. With evidence emerging that late presentation is directly associated with increased mortality, we make the case for increased vigilance in the community and earlier intervention.

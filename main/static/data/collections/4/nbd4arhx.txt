Observations made from papers submitted to preprint servers, and the speculation of editors on social media platforms, suggest that women are submitting fewer papers to scholarly journals than are men during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here I examine whether submissions by men and women to six ecology journals (all published by the British Ecological Society) have changed since the start of COVID disruptions. At these six ecology journals there is no evidence of a decline in the proportion of submissions that are authored by women (as either first or submitting author) since the start of the COVID-19 disruptions; the proportion of papers authored by women in the post-COVID period of 2020 has increased relative to the same period in 2019, and is higher than in the period pre-COVID in 2020. There is also no evidence of a change in the geographic pattern of submissions from across the globe.

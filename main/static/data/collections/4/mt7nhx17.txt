We report the clinical details, imaging findings, and management of a 74-year-old male who had recurrent episodes of massive hematemesis secondary to rupture of a cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm. Ruptured ICA aneurysms may present with epistaxis. However, intracranial aneurysmal rupture with hematemesis as the presenting complaint has not been described previously in the literature. In this case report we describe the pathophysiology of cerebral aneurysm as a cause of hematemesis and its management.

BACKGROUND There is a paucity of literature reporting minimally invasive proctectomy for ulcerative colitis (UC). We report a novel application of a robotic system to perform restorative proctectomy in patients with toxic UC. METHODS Retrospective review, case series report. RESULTS Robotic-assisted laparoscopic proctectomy with ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis was performed in three patients with toxic UC. All patients previously underwent urgent laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy. One female and two male patients were aged 39, 24 and 43, respectively. The procedures were performed safely with minimal complications. The robotic proctectomy operative time was reduced from 134 to 106 min. None of the patients have experienced fecal incontinence, nocturnal seepage or sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS This is a case series report of a robotic-assisted laparoscopic proctectomy with restorative ileal J-pouch in patients with toxic UC. This technique has been previously described for use in patients with medically refractory UC and neoplasia associated with chronic UC. This series exemplifies an ideal application of a robotic system with improved visibility, rotation and ergonomics.

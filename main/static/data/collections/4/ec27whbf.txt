This chapter discusses the management of immunocompromized and infected animals. The microbiological quality of laboratory animals is a direct result of colony management practices, and monitoring provides an after-the-fact assessment of the adequacy of those practices. In the case of immunocompromised animals or in infection experiments, however, monitoring for a comprehensive list of micro-organisms is reasonable. The testing of animals usually starts with necropsy and blood sampling for serology, followed by microscopic examination for parasites and sampling of organs for bacteriology, pathology, and, in rare cases, virological examinations. Biological materials represent a high risk, if they originate from or have been propagated in animals. In particular, tumors, viruses, or parasites that are serially passaged in animals often pick up pathogens, and therefore a high percentage of these are contaminated. It has been shown in mice and rats that all preimplantational stages can be revitalized successfully upon freezethaw procedures. For long-term storage, eight-cell stages have been recommended in the chapter, while two-cell stages were considered to be less suitable. One embryo batch (inbred strain) derived from a single pedigree donor pair may be regarded as a prospective breeding nucleus, if one fertile breeding pair is obtained upon revitalization. Assuming an average revitalization rate of 20% (fertile breeders), one embryo batch should contain a minimum number of 10 embryos to obtain at least one breeding pair with a 50% chance of revitalization.

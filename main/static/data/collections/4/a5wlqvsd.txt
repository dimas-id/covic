Abstract Natural products are the basis of treatment since the dawn of human civilization, and modern medicine has gradually developed, over the years, by scientific and observational efforts from traditional medicine. Today most of the synthetic drugs showed adverse and unacceptable side effects, however, impressive bioactivities with reduced toxicities were reported for many botanicals against several chronic or difficult-to-treat diseases. A whole range of viral diseases including human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Rabies, Dengue, and Herpes need effective drugs. Considerable research has been carried out on the pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and therapeutics of traditional medicines of diverse cultures, and many pharmaceutical companies have renewed their strategies for antiviral drug development where no effective drugs or vaccine exist. Thus, phytochemicals with antiviral potentials need to be studied in depth with standardization, chemical isolation, effectivity, molecular mechanism, along with in vivo toxicity and efficacy to reduce cost and time. This review will portray the scientific approaches and methodologies used for the development of antiviral leads from traditional medicines against selected genetically and functionally diverse viral infections.

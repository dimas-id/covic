OBJECTIVE To compare the morbidity, functional results and quality of life after laparoscopic promontofixation for the cure of genital prolapsed according with the type of fixation of the posterior mesh. PATIENTS AND METHOD From 2001 to 2009, 89 patients with genital prolapse of grade greater than or equal to 2 (POP-Q classification) were operated on by laparoscopy including 47 patients with the suture of the posterior mesh (group suture) and 39 patients with staplin (group staples). Complications per- and postoperative were assessed. Quality of life was evaluated using the questionnaires Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI 20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PISQ 7) and Pelvic Organ Prolaps/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ 12). RESULTS Except for the mean parity that was higher in the group staples, no difference was found between the groups in the mean age, prior surgery, and genital prolapsed stage. Operating time was shorter in the group staples (P=0.005). No difference was found between the groups in the rate of intra- and postoperative complications. Hospital stay was shorter for the group staples (P=0.007). No difference between the groups was found in de novo symptoms, as well as in the improvement of quality of life. CONCLUSION Our results support that stapling of the posterior mesh for the laparoscopic promontofixation is associated with decrease in operating time and hospital stay compared to the suture without affecting functional results and quality of life.

The number of women who decide to have a child after organ transplantation has increased. We determined the outcomes of 67 pregnancies of women who had undergone kidney, liver or heart transplantation. All recipients had been maintained on immunosuppressive therapy before and during pregnancy. Pregnancy complications at term were observed in 17 out of 67 women (25%), hypertension being the most frequent complication (16.17%). Two transplant rejections were reported. Sixty-eight infants were delivered (including one pair of twins); five women had two pregnancies at term. Twenty-eight miscarriages (29.2%) were recorded. Of these 68 babies (including the pair of twins), 40 (58.8%) were born at term and 28 (41.2%) before term. The babies were followed-up for 2 months to 13 years. According to our previous experience, our study shows that patients who have undergone organ transplantation can give birth to healthy infants as long as they are monitored accurately during pregnancy.

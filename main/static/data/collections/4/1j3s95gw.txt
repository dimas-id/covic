Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are arguably the most significant class of biologics for use as pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Many technological concepts exist for the generation and identification of therapeutically relevant mAbs, including the isolation and cloning of immunoglobulin (Ig) encoding genes from single B-lineage cells. This review summarizes various single B cell approaches and describes their use for the discovery of mAbs with potential therapeutic values or in basic research.

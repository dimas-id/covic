INTRODUCTION Injuries to the internal carotid artery close to the cavernous sinus may result in a fistulous connection between the artery and the venous sinus. Symptoms include pulsatile tinnitus, intracranial bruit, ophthalmological symptoms, and risk of intracerebral hematoma in cases of cortical venous reflux. Previous treatment strategies have included detachable latex balloons, coils, covered stents, or combinations thereof. Today, detachable latex balloons are phased out or withdrawn from several markets. Acrylic glue is a proven stable material used for embolization of arteriovenous shunts. It is a precise, fast, and cost-effective method of endovascular embolization, and it does not cause artifacts on MRI or MRA. METHODS We treated nine patients suffering from direct fistulas with acrylic glue without any permanent neurological adverse events. RESULTS Four patients were treated with glue embolization of the fistula without occlusion of the parent artery. Five patients with long-lasting symptomatology, large tears in the ICA, and with full collateral cerebral circulation were treated with glue embolization of the fistula and sacrifice of the ICA antero- and retrograde via the ICA and the posterior communicating artery. CONCLUSION We suggest acrylic glue to be added to the panel of embolic materials used to treat CCFs.

INTRODUCTION Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel play an integral role during the national response to a pandemic event. To help ensure their health and safety, especially during the early stages of an outbreak, knowledge and adherence with personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control strategies will be essential. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a multi-method, pandemic preparedness training intervention using a pre-/post-test design. METHODS A convenience sample of 129 EMS personnel participated in a training program on pandemic preparedness. Training consisted of an educational intervention with a focus on the routes of transmission of the influenza virus, proper use of respiratory PPE, agency policies regarding infection control practices, and seasonal influenza vaccination. This was followed by a skill-based drill on respirator fit-checking and proper respirator donning and doffing procedures. RESULTS Pre-/post-test results indicate a significant increase in knowledge and behavioral intentions with respect to respirator use, vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine, and willingness to report to duty during a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS This method was effective in increasing knowledge and compliance intentions in EMS healthcare personnel. Further research should focus on whether training results in behavior modification.

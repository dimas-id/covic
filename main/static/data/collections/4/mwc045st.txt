Isolated parenchymal splenic lesions are very rare and may occur as recurrences in the form of epithelial tubo-ovarian cancer (ETOC). We report a case of solitary parenchymal splenic recurrence of ETOC, which developed 50 months after the initial treatment. A 66-year-old woman underwent laparotomic primary cytoreduction in 2008. After platinum-based chemotherapy, she developed recurrences; thus, she underwent secondary and tertiary cytoreduction in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In April 2013, CT scan documented a solitary parenchymal splenic lesion and it was confirmed by FDG PET/CT. She underwent quaternary cytoreduction by laparoscopic splenectomy. Histopathological evaluation revealed metastatic parenchymal disease consistent with recurrent ETOC. She was alive and disease-free for ten months since splenectomy. In literature there are 35 cases of isolated spleen parenchymal metastasis of ETOC and our report is the first case of laparoscopic splenectomy in the setting of quaternary cytoreduction. Laparoscopic splenectomy as quaternary cytoreduction is safe and feasible and could be congruent to the well-established experiences already reported for the primary, secondary or even tertiary cytoreduction where the absence of residual disease has been translated in a significant survival benefit.

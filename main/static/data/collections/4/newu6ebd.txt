PURPOSE To report our initial results of robotic appendicovesicostomy (APV) revision in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS Three patients (median age 6 years; range 6-13) underwent robot-assisted APV surgery for bladder dysfunction because of posterior urethral valves, myelomeningocele, and traumatic spinal cord transection. Leakage developed in each patient from the APV. After failing more conservative treatments, the patients subsequently underwent robot-assisted APV revision. RESULTS Robot-assisted APV revision was conducted at a median 14 months (range 6-34 mos) after initial surgery. Median operative time was 165 minutes (range 106-232 min), and blood loss was â‰¤5 mL for all patients. Intraoperative findings ranged from partial to complete separation of the APV from the bladder tunnel. APV leakage resolved for all patients at last follow-up (median 5 months; range 2-9 mos). CONCLUSION This initial series expands the scope of robotic surgical procedures in children. Robot-assisted APV revision was technically feasible and safe in this early experience.

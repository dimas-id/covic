- Case numbers in China are clearly declining, case numbers in many European regions are no longer increasing exponentially.- Data on mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are contradictory; mortality is certainly lower than for SARS and MERS, but probably higher than for most seasonal flu outbreaks in recent years- The main complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)- Asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic courses with virus shedding are not uncommon; they may be more frequent in children than in adults. Virus excretion in asymptomatic people and in the pre-symptomatic phase of an infection is relevant for transmission- An effective antiviral therapy has not yet been established. Steroids for anti-inflammatory therapy are not recommended- It is very important to prepare all actors in the health care system for a longer-term burden of inpatients and complications and to create the necessary capacities. Low-threshold diagnostic testing and rapid detection of infection chains remain essential for better control of the pandemic. An effective vaccine is urgent.

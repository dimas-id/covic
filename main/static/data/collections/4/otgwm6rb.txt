A new bat herpesvirus was detected in the spleen of an insectivorous bat (Hipposideros diadema, family Hipposideridae) collected on Panay Island, the Philippines. PCR analyses were performed using COnsensus-DEgenerate Hybrid Oligonucleotide Primers (CODEHOPs) targeting the herpesvirus DNA polymerase (DPOL) gene. Although we obtained PCR products with CODEHOPs, direct sequencing using the primers was not possible because of high degree of degeneracy. Direct sequencing technology developed in our rapid determination system of viral RNA sequences (RDV) was applied in this study, and a partial DPOL nucleotide sequence was determined. In addition, a partial gB gene nucleotide sequence was also determined using the same strategy. We connected the partial gB and DPOL sequences with long-distance PCR, and a 3741-bp nucleotide fragment, including the 3′ part of the gB gene and the 5′ part of the DPOL gene, was finally determined. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequence was novel and most similar to those of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae.

INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most popular bariatric procedures. The procedure is associated with serious staple-line complications such as bleeding, leaks, and stenosis. AIM To determine whether oversewing the staple line, compared with clipping, in LSG reduces the incidence of postoperative bleeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a parallel-group, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 100 patients who underwent LSG for obesity at a single institution between May 2014 and August 2015. Patients were assigned to one of two groups for reinforcement of the staple line: the oversewing group (staple line oversewn) or the clipping group (staple line clipped). The primary outcome was reoperation for hemodynamic instability caused by staple-line bleeding within 72 h postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were operative duration, length of hospital stay, postoperative leaks, and postoperative stenosis. RESULTS Mean operative duration was longer in the oversewing group (78.2 ±20.5 min) than in the clipping group (64.1 ±16.5 min, p < 0.001). Mean length of hospital stay was comparable in both groups. Postoperatively, there was no significant between-group difference in bleeding (oversewing, n = 0 vs. clipping, n = 2 (4.6%); p = 0.21) or in stenosis and leakage (both outcomes: oversewing, n = 0, vs. clipping, n = 1 (2.3%); p = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS Oversewing the staple line prolongs operative duration. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of oversewing on staple-line bleeding, postoperative leakage and stenosis, or length of hospital stay.

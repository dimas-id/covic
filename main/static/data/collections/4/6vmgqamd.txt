The presented cross-sectional dataset can be employed to analyze the governmental, trade, and competitiveness relationships of official COVID-19 reports. It contains 18 COVID-19 variables generated based on the official reports of 138 countries [1,2], as well as an additional 2203 governance, trade, and competitiveness indicators from the World Bank Group GovData360[3] and TCdata360[4] platforms. From these platforms, only annual indicators from 2015 and later were collected, and their missing values were replaced with previous annual values, in descending order by year, until 2015. During preprocessing, indicators (columns) were filtered out when the ratio of missing values exceeded 50%. Then, the same filtration was applied for the ratio of missing values above 25% in the case of countries (rows). Finally, duplicated variables were removed from the dataset. As a result of these steps, the missing value rate of the employed indicators was reduced to 4.25% on average. In addition to the database, the Kendall rank correlation matrix is provided to facilitate subsequent analysis. The dataset and the correlation matrix can be updated and customized with an R Notebook file, which is also available publicly in Mendeley Data [5].

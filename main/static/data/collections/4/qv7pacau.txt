OVID-19 is a world-wide disease that has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Computer Tomography (CT) imaging of the chest seems to be a valid diagnosis tool to detect COVID-19 promptly and to control the spread of the disease. Deep Learning has been extensively used in medical imaging and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been also used for classification of CT images. We propose a light CNN design based on the model of the SqueezeNet, for the efficient discrimination of COVID-19 CT images with other CT images (community-acquired pneumonia and/or healthy images). On the tested datasets, the proposed modified SqueezeNet CNN achieved 83.00\% of accuracy, 85.00\% of sensitivity, 81.00\% of specificity, 81.73\% of precision and 0.8333 of F1Score in a very efficient way (7.81 seconds medium-end laptot without GPU acceleration). Besides performance, the average classification time is very competitive with respect to more complex CNN designs, thus allowing its usability also on medium power computers. In the next future we aim at improving the performances of the method along two directions: 1) by increasing the training dataset (as soon as other CT images will be available); 2) by introducing an efficient pre-processing strategy.

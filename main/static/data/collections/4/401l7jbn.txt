Background: We share our experience in COVID-19 pneumonia management at Saint George Hospital University Medical Center (SGHUMC) in Lebanon. In the absence of a standard of care, early diagnosis and opt-in therapy with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were offered. Methods: We reviewed records of COVID-19 pneumonia patients from March 16-April 26 2020. Based on NEWS score, we stratified patients as A: low B: medium, and C: high clinical severity and obtained pharmacotherapy data. Chest-CT-severity-score (CTSS) was used. We defined clinical cure as resolution of symptoms and biomarkers and virologic cure as a PCR above 35 cycles(Ct). Results: We recorded 21 COVID-19 pneumonia patients of whom 19 opted for treatment. Clinical symptoms and laboratory markers at presentation did not significantly correlate with severity. Lower initial viral load significantly correlated with lower levels of clinical and radiological severity (p=0.038). Virologic cure, Ct>35, by day 10, was only 33% in high severity significantly less than categories A and B. We observed 100% clinical cure at day 10 in Category-A, 67% in B, and 33% in C(p<0.05). Patients with the lowest severity had the fastest virologic cure in a mean of 5.8 days from diagnosis, shortest hospitalization and earlier radiological improvement(p<0.005). Ultimately, 18 patients were discharged home in good condition and one remains in the ICU. Conclusion: Viral dynamics matter in COVID-19 pneumonia. An early control of replication may be crucial in averting complications. Early administration of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin potentially explains our 94.7% success rate in treating a fairly complex cohort of COVID-19 pneumonia.

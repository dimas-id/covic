AIM SILS is an area of growing interest in colorectal surgery. We report our preliminary experience of 13 consecutively selected patients undergoing colonic surgery using SILS. METHOD From July 2009 to January 2010, 13 patients (five men) of median age 56 (23-82) years and a body mass index (BMI) of 23.5 (18-30) kg/m(2) underwent colonic surgery. Procedures included subtotal colectomy (1), ileocolic resection (2), right colectomy (4) and sigmoidectomy for benign disease (6). Three instruments (including camera) were introduced through a single 2.5-cm port (SILSâ„¢ Port Multiple Instrument Access Port; Covidien Inc., Norwalk, Connecticut, USA) inserted at the umbilicus. RESULTS The median operating time was 150 (100-240) min, and the median size of the umbilical port incision was 32 (25-50) mm. There was no postoperative mortality and morbidity, and the median hospital stay was 6 (4-10) days. The cosmetic result was judged to be excellent in 12 of 13 patients who felt it to be better than expected. CONCLUSION This preliminary experience shows that SILS is technically feasible and safe for colonic resection.

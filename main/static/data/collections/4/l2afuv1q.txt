The feasibility of extending the VATS approach to locally advanced NSCLC has been described with good clinical outcome. These complex resections are still technically challenging and patient safety must remain the highest priority. In this article, we describe our routine VATS approach for left upper lobectomy in proximal, locally advanced lesions. Both surgical and anaesthesiology teams are trained during simulation sessions to respond rapidly in case of urgent thoracotomy. Encircling arterial and venous vessels allow control of inadvertent bleeding during difficult dissection. Also, whenever needed the double vessel control technique is a time saver waiting for conversion to thoracotomy.

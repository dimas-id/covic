We describe traditional antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) activities with a discussion of how these activities can be refocused in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we discuss possible adverse consequences of ASP attention diversion on COVID-19 response efforts and overall implications for future pandemic planning. We also discuss ASP in collaboration with other groups within health systems and how COVID-19 may affect these relationships long term. Despite the paucity of literature on Antimicrobial Stewardship and COVID-19, the potential contributions of ASPs during a pandemic are numerous. ASPs can develop strategies to identify patients with COVID-19-like-illness; this is particularly useful when these patients are missed at the time of health system entry. ASPs can also play a critical role in the management of potential drug shortages, developing local treatment guidelines, optimizing the use of antibiotics, and in the diagnostic stewardship of COVID-19 testing, among other roles. Importantly, it is often difficult to ascertain whether critically ill patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have concurrent or secondary bacterial infectionsâ€”ASPs are ideally situated to help optimize antimicrobial use for these patients via a variety of mechanisms. ASPs are uniquely positioned to aid in pandemic response planning and relief efforts. ASPs are already integrated into health systems and play a key role in optimizing antimicrobial prescribing. As ASPs assist in COVID-19 response, understanding the role of ASPs in pandemic relief efforts may mitigate damage from future outbreaks.

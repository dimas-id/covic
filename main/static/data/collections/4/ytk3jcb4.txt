Abstract A 67-year-old female presented with upper respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19. She was found to have a large hemorrhagic pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade and mild left ventricular impairment. Clinical course was complicated by development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was treated with pericardiocentesis, colchicine, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine with improvement in symptoms.

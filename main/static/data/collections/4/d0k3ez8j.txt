Nrf2 is a key transcription factor responsible for antioxidant defense in many tissues and cells, including alveolar epithelium, endothelium, and macrophages. Furthermore, Nrf2 functions as a transcriptional repressor that inhibits expression of the inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection often present signs of high oxidative stress and systemic inflammation â€“ the leading causes of mortality. This article suggests rationale for the use of Nrf2 inducers to prevent development of an excessive inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients.

Abstract The oceans are unique resources that provide a diverse array of natural products, primarily from invertebrates such as sponges, tunicates, bryozoans and molluscs and from marine bacteria and cyanobacteria. Pharmacologic research with marine chemicals continue to contribute potentially novel chemical leads in the ongoing global search for therapeutic agents in the treatment of multiple diverse categories. As infectious diseases evolve and develop resistance to existing pharmaceuticals, the marine environment provides novel leads against fungal, parasitic, bacterial and viral diseases. Limitations in our current antiviral treatment options and the continuing emergence of new pathogenic viruses have contributed to a growing need for new and effective chemotherapeutic agents to treat viral diseases. The search for potent antiviral agents is urgent in view of the dramatic situation of the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, a possible spread of avian influenza and of other viral diseases. Effective antiviral therapeutics are not available, and the presently approved therapy for HIV has been recognized to be toxic, unable to eradicate the causative virus, and to induce severe drug resistance. The marine environment provides a rich source of chemical diversity for the screening and identification of new compounds with desirable antiviral properties. Antiviral testing has revealed numerous compounds from structural classes including polysaccharides, terpenoids, steroids, alkaloids and peptides that potentially inhibit both RNA and DNA viruses. This review presents an account of some research directed toward the discovery of new antiviral agents from marine sources.

Patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) typically present with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification with a peripheral distribution. The utility of point-of-care ultrasound has been suggested, but detailed descriptions of lung ultrasound findings are not available. We evaluated lung ultrasound findings in 10 patients admitted to the internal medicine ward with COVID-19. All of the patients had characteristic glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant (white lung). Thick irregular pleural lines and confluent B lines were also present in all of the patients. Five of the 10 patients had small subpleural consolidations. Point-of-care lung ultrasound has multiple advantages, including lack of radiation exposure and repeatability. Also, lung ultrasound has been shown to be more sensitive than a chest radiograph in detecting alveolar-interstitial syndrome. The utilization of lung ultrasound may also reduce exposure of healthcare workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 and may mitigate the shortage of personal protective equipment. Further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.

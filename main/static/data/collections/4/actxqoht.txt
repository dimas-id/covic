MDL-860 is a broad-spectrum antipicornavirus compound discovered in 1982 and one of the few promising candidates effective in in vivo virus infection. Despite the effectiveness, the target and the mechanism of action of MDL-860 remain unknown. Here, we have characterized antipoliovirus activity of MDL-860 and identified host phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III beta (PI4KB) as the target. MDL-860 treatment caused covalent modification and irreversible inactivation of PI4KB. A cysteine residue at amino acid 646 of PI4KB, which locates at the bottom of a surface pocket apart from the active site, was identified as the target site of MDL-860. This work reveals the mechanism of action of this class of PI4KB inhibitors and offers insights into novel allosteric regulation of PI4KB activity.

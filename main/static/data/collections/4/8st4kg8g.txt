OBJECTIVE: A higher prevalence of disordered eating behavior (DEB) has been demonstrated in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared to healthy aged-matched peers. DEB is associated with higher HbA1c levels and increased risk of developing complications to T1D. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of DEB in a Danish cohort of children and adolescents with T1D aged 11-19 years and to characterize them regarding metabolic control and relevant clinical data. RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence of DEB using the revised Diabetes Eating Problem Survey (DEPS-R) questionnaire. HbA1c and relevant clinical data were obtained at the time they filled in the questionnaire. RESULTS: 192 children and adolescents (46% girls) aged 11-19 years with T1D were included from the pediatric diabetes outpatient clinic. A total of 40 participants (21%) had DEB. The prevalence was higher amongst girls compared with boys (34.1% vs 8.9%) and those who had DEB were older (16.7 vs 15.0 years, P < 0.001), had longer duration of T1D (7.5 vs 4.9 years, P < 0.001), higher BMI Z-scores (1.2 vs 0.3, P < 0.001), higher HbA1c (72.8 (8.8%) vs 62.0 (7.8%) mmol/mol, P < 0.001), higher total cholesterol (4.6 mmoL/L vs 4.2 mmoL/L, P = 0.0048) and LDL (2.7 vs 2.3, P = 0.001) compared with those with no signs of DEB. CONCLUSION: As in other countries, the prevalence of DEB is high in Danish adolescents with T1D. Early detection of DEB is essential to prevent short- and long-term complications to T1D.

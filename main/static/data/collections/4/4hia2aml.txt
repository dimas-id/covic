OBJECTIVE This study aimed to review the surgical outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of total vaginal (TVH) and single-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy (SP-TLH) for uterine benign diseases. STUDY DESIGN This study included 121 patients who had undergone TVH or SP-TLH for uterine benign diseases between April 2011 and July 2012. Surgical outcomes, complications, and HRQOL were reviewed in the two groups. Preoperative and postoperative HRQOL data from the 36-item Short Form questionnaire (SF-36) were recorded for all patients. RESULTS TVH was performed more often for the patients who had fewer previous operations (p = 0.32). In the TVH, there were fewer combined surgical procedures (p < 0.01), shorter operation times (p < 0.01), shorter vaginal stump suture times (p = 0.03) and lower complication rates (p < 0.01) than in SP-TLH. Overall, all SF-36 scales improved after surgery, except for the Social Functioning scale. There was no significant difference in any of the scales between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS TVH has equivalent effects on HRQOL as SP-TLH. SP-TLH is preferred for the cases with complicated and combined procedures.

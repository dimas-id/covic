We demonstrate that the Haldane phase can be realized with ultracold spin-1 atoms loaded on a lattice which has a flat band at the bottom of the band structure. The many-body ground state of the model Hamiltonian is exactly solvable in a special case, which turns out to serve as a representative of the Haldane phase. In this system, the Haldane phase is protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ spin rotation symmetry or time-reversal symmetry. Depending on several parameters, the Hamiltonian can either be in a gapped Haldane or a gapless critical phase. In a certain limit, the phase diagram is determined analytically by perturbation theory, while for general cases, the phase diagram is studied numerically by the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm.

Objective: To evaluate the performance of three antibody kits for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and to investigate the feasibility and advantages of them in clinical application. Methods: A total of 104 patients who were admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital with COVID-19 from January to February 2020 were selected as research group. Fifty-one healthy subjects were selected during the same period as negative control group. Serum antibodies (IgM/IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using two kinds of colloidal gold kits (A and B kits) and one chemiluminescence kit (C kit). The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in different samples from patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The clinical sensitivity of A kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG was 77.88% (81/104) and 65.38% (68/104), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 70.59% (36/51) and 100.00% (51/51). However, the false positive rate in IgM detection was as high as 29.41% (15/51). The sensitivity of B kit to test total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 63.46% (66/104), and the clinical specificity was 94.12% (48/51). The clinical sensitivity of C kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG were respectively 31.73% (33/104) and 64.42% (67/104), and the clinical specificity were both 98.04% (50/51). There was a moderate correlation between the detection results of two colloidal gold kits and the chemiluminescence kit with the Kappa values of 0.462 and 0.587 (Z=6.157, P&lt;0.01; Z=7.345, P&lt;0.01). C kit had the highest positive detection rate for IgG, and would be more reliable to be used for IgG detection in COVID-19 patients 14 d after onset. The total positive detection rate of nucleic acid in all types of samples was 63.46% (66/104). The highest positive detection rate was in throat swabs or sputum samples, followed by those in blood samples and anal swabs. No viral nucleic acid was detected in urine samples for the time being. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies could be detected in the early or late stage of COVID-19. The method of antibody detection has the advantages of shorter detection time, simple operation and high biological safety, indicating that it could be used as a supplementary or auxiliary detection for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases with negative nucleic acid test results. The chemiluminescence kit has good sensitivity and specificity, and is well recommended for clinical laboratories.

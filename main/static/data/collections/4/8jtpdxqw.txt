Many treatment modalities have been developed for axillary osmidrosis. It is well known that the surgical treatment has the best results. However, there is a high possibility of side effects. The 1,444-nm lipolysis laser has been recently introduced to remove the apocrine glands. So far, subdermal coagulation treatment with a 1,444-nm Nd:YAG laser may be the least invasive and most effective therapy for axillary osmidrosis. However, according to our previous experience, the recurrence rate was 20%~30%. This emphasizes the need for combination of surgical method and non-surgical method and we combined subcutaneous tissue removal and photothermocoagulation with a 1,444-nm Nd:YAG laser. Three patients for bilateral axillary osmidrosis were enrolled. After an incision of about one-third the length of the widest transverse diameter, the apocrine glands were separated from the skin. And then apocrine glands within the marked area were destroyed by irradiation with a 1,444-nm Nd:YAG laser thereafter. All patients exhibited no relapse of axillary osmidrosis and were satisfied with the treatment results. A combination of subcutaneous tissue removal and Interstitial laser photothermocoagulation with a 1,444-nm Nd:YAG laser could be an effective treatment for mild to moderate axillary osmidrosis.

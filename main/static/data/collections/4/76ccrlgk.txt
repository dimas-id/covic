Deaths due to infectious diseases are common worldwide. The autopsy, although less frequently performed than previously, is important to our understanding of disease pathogenesis. The autopsy also provides critical information regarding potential disease outbreaks. To optimize the benefits of an autopsy, the pathologist should approach the autopsy with a well-constructed differential diagnosis that provides the framework for appropriate selection of diagnostic specimens and tests. Standard microbiologic cultures, although necessary and important, are often insufficient and must be supplemented by newer molecular methodologies.

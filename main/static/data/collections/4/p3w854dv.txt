BACKGROUND The application of mesh-reinforced hiatal closure has resulted in a significant reduction in recurrence rates in comparison with primary suture repair. One of the most debated issues is the risk of complications related to the use of the prosthesis, such as esophageal erosion and postoperative dysphagia. The aim of this study is to present our short-terms results in the treatment of laparoscopic paraesophageal hiatal hernia (LPHH) with a synthetic polyglycolic acid:trimethylene carbonate mesh (Gore Bio A(®)). METHODS From January 2011 to December 2012, 10 patients with large paraesophageal hiatal hernias and hiatal defect over 5 cm were included. Primary simple suture of the crura and additional reinforcement with a Gore Bio A(®) mesh was performed. Hiatal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms recurrence, dysphagia and mesh-related complications were investigated. RESULTS Of the 10 patients undergoing mesh repair, there were 7 women and 3 men with a mean age of 65.5 years. All operations were completed laparoscopically. Median postoperative stay was 3 days. After a median follow-up of 20.3 months, one patient developed a recurrent hiatal hernia (10%). There were no mesh-related complications. CONCLUSIONS The use of Gore Bio A(®) mesh for the laparoscopic repair of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias is safe and with a reasonably low recurrence rate in this short-term study. Additional long-term studies with ample numbers carried out for years will be necessary to see if this synthetic mesh is not only safe but also successful in the prevention of recurrences.

Macrophages (Mφ) are central players in mediating proinflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. Unchecked Mφ activities contribute to pathology across many diseases, including those caused by infectious pathogens and metabolic disorders. A fine balance of Mφ responses is crucial, which may be achieved by enforcing appropriate bioenergetics pathways. Metabolism serves as the provider of energy, substrates, and byproducts that support differential Mφ characteristics. The metabolic properties that control the polarization and response of Mφ remain to be fully uncovered for use in managing infectious diseases. Here, we review the various metabolic states in Mφ and how they influence the cell function.

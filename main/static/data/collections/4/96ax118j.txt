To achieve the full potential of pharmacogenomics, one must accurately predict the functional outcomes that arise from amino acid substitutions in proteins. Classically, researchers have focused on understanding the consequences of individual substitutions. However, literature surveys have shown that most substitutions were created at evolutionarily conserved positions. Awareness of this bias leads to a shift in perspective, from considering the outcomes of individual substitutions to understanding the roles of individual protein positions. Conserved positions tend to act as “toggle” switches, with most substitutions abolishing function. However, nonconserved positions have been found equally capable of affecting protein function. Indeed, many nonconserved positions act like functional dimmer switches (“rheostat” positions): this is revealed when multiple substitutions are made at a single position. Each substitution has a different functional outcome; the set of substitutions spans a range of outcomes. Finally, some nonconserved positions appear neutral, capable of accommodating all amino acid types without modifying function. This paper reviews the currently-known properties of rheostat positions, with examples shown for pyruvate kinase, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1, the beta-lactamase inhibitory protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Outcomes observed for rheostat positions have implications for the rational design of drug analogs and allosteric drugs. Furthermore, this new framework—comprising three types of protein positions—provides a new approach to interpreting disease and population-based databases of amino acid changes. In conclusion, although a full understanding of substitution outcomes at rheostat positions poses a challenge, utilization of this new frame of reference will further advance the application of pharmacogenomics.

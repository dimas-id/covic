The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has further spread, and there is an increasing number of confirmed cases in many countries. On February 28, 2020 of Geneva time, the World Health Organization has raised global risk level to the very high level in view of outbreak of COVID-19. Since some patients' condition appeared to deteriorate rapidly after infection of this 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV), a variety of treatments should be considered. Holistic view and syndrome differentiation are the two characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome diffe-rentiation of TCM has achieved good effects in the treatment of COVID-19. This treatment mainly aimed at eliminating pathogens and strengthening overall health, regulating the balance of body and coordinating various of functions of Zangfu organs. In addition, modern medical proposes host-directed therapy(HDT), a strategy aims to interfere with host cell mechanism, enhance immune responses, and reduce exacerbated inflammation. To some extent, the combined application of HDT and antiviral therapy is highly consistent with the therapeutic concept of the holistic view of TCM. Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome differentiation of TCM uses treatments, such as clearing heat, detoxification, relieving asthma, clearing damp and phlegm, together with Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Maxing Shigan Decoction, and Haoqin Qingdan Decoction under the guidance of these therapeutic methods. These therapeutic methods and prescriptions intervened with both virus and host at the same time in the treatment of COVID-19, which has important implications for the effective clinical treatment of COVID-19.

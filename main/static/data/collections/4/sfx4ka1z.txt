Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease with millions of people have been infected. However, there is limited data regarding clinical features, disease courses and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Herein, we presented the demographic data, clinical characteristics and outcomes of nine confirmed COVID-19 patients with HIV infection admitted to our hospital located in south Bronx, New York City. Our study revealed very high mortality rate at 78%, which may contradict to the hypothesis that immunosuppression from HIV infection prevents against severe COVID-19. More research is needed to determine the impact of HIV on the clinical course of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

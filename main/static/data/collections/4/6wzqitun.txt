A previously healthy 57‐year‐old woman presented with fever (39 °C) lasting for 4 days, and dry cough and rash appeared 2 days before. Diffuse fixed erythematous blanching maculopapular lesions were present, asymptomatic over the limbs and trunk, with burning sensation over the palms (a, b). She denied any drug intake, excepting paracetamol for fever. Thorax computed tomography scan was typical of COVID‐19; nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2. Infectious enquiry was otherwise negative. Skin biopsy specimen showed slight spongiosis, basal cell vacuolation and mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (c).

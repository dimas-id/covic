The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in cancer care around the world due to logistical and psychosocial reasons. This paper was written with the primary objective of providing a guide for medical oncologists in addressing concerns in the management of adult patients with solid tumours in the Philippines and for those working under similar circumstances. These recommendations are divided into prioritisation of cancer care, ensuring a safe work environment, organising the transition of cancer care, and maintaining cohesion in a time of isolation.

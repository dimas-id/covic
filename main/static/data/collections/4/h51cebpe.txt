Abstract A f√¶cal suspension from a patient with gastroenteritis, which contained large numbers of coronavirus particles when examined by electron microscopy, was inoculated into human embryo intestinal-organ cultures and primary human embryo-kidney monolayers. In the organ cultures, the villous epithelium became detached and large numbers of coronavirus particles were seen by electron microscopy both in the medium and in thin sections of the intestinal epithelial cells, where the virus appeared to be multiplying. In organ cultures and in human embryo-kidney cells, intracytoplasmic virus was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence with convalescent serum from the patient.

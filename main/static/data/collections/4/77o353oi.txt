BACKGROUND In the clinical practice, transparent films are used as sterile interfaces in in vivo dermatologic imaging in order to prevent the transmissions of infections. However, in our experience, the use of a transparent film can alter skin images. Our study aimed to compare the optical quality of a series of different plastic films used as interfaces in order to understand if some might be more suitable for imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We tested the optical properties of 11 different protective transparent films that are marketed in France with a transparency meter and a spectrophotometer. RESULTS Transmission, minimal diffusion, amount of gray, and contrast were obtained for each transparent film. Transmission ranged from 93.24% to 96.88% (mean 95.36; standard deviation SD 1.02), minimal diffusion from 88.28% to 123.87% (mean 101.04; standard deviation SD 10.02) and contrast from 11.01 to 15.88 (mean 13.93 and SD 1.3). For some films, the transmission was lower at lower wavelengths. CONCLUSION All tested films had excellent optical properties. However, some of them had better optical qualities and seemed more suitable for their use in dermatologic imaging.

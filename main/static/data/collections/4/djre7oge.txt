Background Spinal Anaesthesia (SA) has been firmly established as an efficient and safe technique, with minimal cardio-respiratory disturbance when administered in the neonatal period. Our objective was to assess the haemodynamic consequences of SA in infants, particularly its impact on cerebral perfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based cerebral oximetry (rSco2). Methods All infants up to 60 weeks' postmenstrual age, whether formerly preterm or not, and undergoing spinal anaesthesia, were enrolled. Haemodynamic data records, rSco2 and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), were prospectively collected before SA (T0) and every five min for 30 min (T30) after the puncture. Compared with baseline measures, any changes of > 10% in rSco2 and of > 20% in MAP were considered clinically significant. Relative variations of data between T0 and T30 were analysed. Results Data of 103 infants were analysed. The mean relative changes in rSco2 were -2.25% (97.5% CI [-3.97; -0.5]) at T15, and 0.11% (97.5% CI [-1.67; 1.90]) at T30. No significant variation of rSco2 was recorded. The mean changes in MAP were respectively -13.94% (97.5% CI [-17.74; -10.14]) at T15 and -20.27% (97.5% CI [-24,25; -16.29]) at T30. MAP decrease was statistically and clinically significant 30 min after SA. No correlation between changes in MAP and rSco2 was found. The subgroup analysis did not reveal any effect of added intrathecal clonidine or preterm birth history on these results. Conclusions In neonate and infants, SA did not cause clinically significant variation in cerebral oxygen saturation. Despite a significant decrease in MAP, cerebral auto-regulation seems to remain effective in neonates and not altered by spinal anaesthesia.

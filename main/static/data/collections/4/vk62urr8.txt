Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the first severe new infectious disease of this millennium, caused widespread public disruption. By July 2003, 8427 probable SARS cases had been reported from 29 countries with a case fatality rate of 9.6%. The new febrile respiratory illness spread around the world along the routes of international air travel, with outbreaks concentrated in transportation hubs or densely populated areas. The etiologic agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The disease is transmissible person-to-person through direct contact, large droplet contact and indirect contact from fomites and unwashed hands. Saudi Arabia successfully prevented the entry of the disease by imposing travel restrictions, special entry requirements, screening procedures at airports, including temperature checks, and quarantine. Ongoing efforts are aimed at developing case investigation, case management and surveillance protocols for SARS.

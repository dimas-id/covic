Viral diarrhea remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Tunisia, no comprehensive studies of all viral agents related to diarrhea in children have yet been conducted. The present study was performed to investigate the role of enteric viruses in acute diarrhea in the country. Six hundred thirty‐eight stool samples were collected from children under 5 years of age seeking medical care for acute diarrhea between October 2003 and September 2005 in hospitals from the Eastern‐Center Tunisia. All samples were tested for rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus using commercial antigen enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Positive samples for rotavirus and astrovirus were confirmed by an “in‐house” reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Samples positive for adenovirus antigen were subjected to further EIA screening for species F enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41. At least one viral agent was found in 30% of the specimens. The frequency of rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus was 20%, 7%, and 6%, respectively. Of the stool samples containing adenovirus, 57% (20/35) were found to be positive for species F adenovirus types 40/41. Dual infections were found in 9% (17/191) of the positive samples. Enteric viruses appear to play an important role in pediatric diarrhea in Tunisia. The introduction of affordable viral diagnosis in pediatric hospitals will improve patient care by reducing the unnecessary use of antibiotics. J. Med.

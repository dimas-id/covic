We revisit constraints on anomalous $Wtb$ couplings from $B$-physics experiments, performing a correlated analysis allowing all anomalous couplings to differ simultaneously from their Standard-Model (SM) values. The $B$-physics observables allow one to probe the three linear combinations out of the four anomalous couplings, which parameterize the $Wtb$ vertex under the assumption that the SM symmetries remain the symmetries of the effective theory. We take into account constraints coming from the inclusive $B\to X_s\gamma$, $B\to X_s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays, the $\bar B^{0}-B^0$ oscillations, the leptonic $B\to \mu^+\mu^-$ decays, and the exclusive $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ decays at low $q^2$. We find that the SM values belong to the 95% CL allowed region obtained this way; however, the SM values are not the most probable values given by the fit. We also report that the distributions of the anomalous couplings obtained within our 3D scenario differ noticeably from the 1D scenario, when only one of the couplings is allowed to deviate from its SM value.

BACKGROUND Age is often related to the increase of perioperative complications and reoperation rates. The authors aimed to determine the influence of age on outcomes of most commonly performed bariatric procedures. METHODS The retrospective study included patients qualified for primary Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) or Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) in two academic hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups: ≥50 (21.2-26.9%) and <50 (57.6-73.1%) years old. Endpoints assessed the influence of patients' age on the perioperative and the one-year postoperative period. RESULTS Operative time was longer in the ≥50-year-old group, but only for LRYGB. There were no differences in the intraoperative adverse events, postoperative morbidity, reoperation and readmission rates between the groups. The risk of port site hernia was increased (OR: 4.23, CI: 1.49-12.06) in the ≥50-year-old group. The mean % of total weight loss 12 months after the bariatric procedure was comparable, but % of excess weight loss and % of excess body mass index loss were lower in the ≥50-year-old group (p = .033 and .032). CONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery is safe and feasible in patients over 50 years old. The weight loss effect can be worse among patients over 50 years old; nevertheless, the treatment should be considered as effective.

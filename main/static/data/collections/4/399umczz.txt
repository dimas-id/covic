Publisher Summary This chapter describes the different RNA viruses that have been detected at least once in parasitoid wasps. It could be wondered whether the other families of parasitoids are really absent, or if this is due to the fact that inadequate techniques were used to detect viruses. In fact, several different methods have been used: TEM of the venom glands of females, extraction of nucleic acids, followed by DNAse digestion to eliminate the polydnavirus or ascovirus genome, RT-PCR with primers specific of RdRp or data mining in an EST library. To resolve this problem of detecting RNA viruses, a systematic search for viruses in parasitoids should be carried out using a combination of these different methods. Only a few hymenopteran species are known to be infected by RNA viruses, although thousands of species are known to carry polydnaviruses or VLPs. This could suggest that the presence of polydnaviruses or VLPs may block infections with other viruses.

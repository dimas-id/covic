The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 may present as acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases, and patients with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities are reported to be the most vulnerable. Notably, acute myocardial injury, determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels, is commonly observed in severe cases, and is strongly associated with mortality. Therefore, understanding the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is essential for providing comprehensive medical care for critically ill patients. In this review, we summarize the rapidly evolving data and highlight the cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19.

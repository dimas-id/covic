Podcasting is used in higher education so various digital resources can be shared with students. This review aims to synthesise evidence on podcasting in nursing and midwifery education. PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and ERIC databases were searched using key terms. 242 articles were found and screened. Data extraction, quality assessment and data analysis, underpinned by a Social Media Learning Model, were conducted on relevant studies. Twenty-six studies were included in the review. Three themes emerged; 1) learning and other outcomes, 2) antecedents to learning, and 3) learning process. Students seemed to acquire new knowledge and skills by using podcasts and it also appeared to improve clinical confidence. The organisation of podcasting, digital literacy and e-Professionalism, the personal motivation of learners, and flexible access to the technology seemed to impact the delivery of this educational intervention. Mechanisms that appeared to affect the learning process were the speed of exchange, the type of social media user, the timeframe, quality of information, the functionality of podcasts and other learning activities. This review synthesised evidence on podcasting in nursing and midwifery education. The technology was seen as a positive learning tool but more robust research examining its efficacy in improving learning outcomes is needed.

AIMS Comparing the risk of abnormal liver function tests between severe and non-severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by meta-analysis. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using fixed- or random-effects models. Publication bias was detected by the Harbord test. RESULTS We included 8 articles comprising 7,467 COVID-19 patients. When compared between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, the pooled ORs of elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were 2.35 (95% CI 1.38-3.98), 3.21 (95% CI 2.59-3.98), 1.87 (95% CI 1.32-2.65), and 4.83 (95% CI 2.90-8.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The severity of COVID-19 is associated with liver damage, and can be a risk factor for abnormal liver function tests.

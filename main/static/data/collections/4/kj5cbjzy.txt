PURPOSE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for localised renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and examine potential associations between age, gender, tumour size, location, chronic kidney disease, comorbidities, learning curve and local recurrence. METHODS We retrospectively analysed survival outcomes for patients with biopsy-proven RCC treated by RFA at Westmead Hospital. Complication data were gathered from all patients that underwent renal RFA. 3 and 5 year local recurrence-free (RFS), disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes were reported. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to examine each potential predictor. RESULTS A total of 168 patients were eligible for the study. Forty-eight patients with biopsy-proven RCC had minimum 3-year follow-up. Our complication rate was 1.2 % (2/168) and local recurrence rate 10.4 % (5/48). Five-year RFS, DFS and OS were 86.8, 82.3 and 92.6 % on a median 4.1-year follow-up (IQR 3.4-4.9). None of the patient or tumour-specific characteristics were associated with RFS. CONCLUSION Radiofrequency ablation performed at our centre was a safe and effective procedure with low complication rates and durable RFS. Tumour characteristics, comorbidities and learning curve were not associated with local recurrence.

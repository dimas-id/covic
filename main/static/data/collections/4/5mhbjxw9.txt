Summary Salmonellosis is an enteric or multisystemic disease of global distribution that affects numerous animal species. Although Salmonella enterica has been associated with urinary tract lesions in man, information on urocystitis/ureteritis in cattle caused by salmonellae is lacking. This communication describes lesions of the inferior urinary tract in four Holstein calves with septicaemia caused by S. enterica subsp. enterica serotype Dublin. Examination of the urinary bladder revealed either diffuse irregular thickening (three cases) or petechiation (one case) of the mucosa. On histopathological examination, urocystitis with submucosal histiocytic, lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration and neutrophil transmigration through the urothelium was noted in all cases. In one case, a fibrinosuppurative ureteritis was detected. Salmonella Dublin was identified by culture, 16S rDNA sequencing and serotyping and Salmonella antigen was detected intralesionally by immunohistochemistry. Other lesions, indicative of septicaemia included hepatitis, enteritis, pericarditis, splenitis, lymphadenitis and pneumonia. We conclude that S. Dublin can be uropathogenic in cattle with septicaemia.

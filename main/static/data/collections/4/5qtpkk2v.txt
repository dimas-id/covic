The sudden and unanticipated COVID-19 viral pandemic of 2020 and its profound impact on the NHS prompted an almost overnight change in the services we are able to offer our patients to fulfil clinical demands. From March 2020 we have changed outpatient appointments from face-to-face to telephone led consultations. We have performed an early review of this service to ensure its sustainability during the unknown duration of this current crisis and to establish its potential utility when normal services resume in the future. Our results show a patient satisfaction of 93% with 83% happy to have telephone follow-up in the future and a clinician satisfaction of 82% in adequacy of the telephone consultation in making a clinical decision. Telephone clinics are a safe and efficient alternative to face-to-face outpatient consultations for many patients, particularly non-complex benign follow-ups.

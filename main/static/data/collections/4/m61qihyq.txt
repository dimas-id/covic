A recent study by Tang et al. (2020) claimed that two major types of SARS-CoV-2 had evolved in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and that one of these types was more “aggressive” than the other. Given the repercussions of these claims and the intense media coverage of these types of articles, we have examined in detail the data presented by Tang et al, and show that the major conclusions of that paper cannot be substantiated. Using examples from other viral outbreaks we discuss the difficulty in demonstrating the existence or nature of a functional effect of a viral mutation, and we advise against overinterpretation of genomic data during the pandemic.

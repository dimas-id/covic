OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare clinical findings and outcomes of Enterprise and Solitaire stent-assisted coiling (SAC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2012 and March 2014, 86 patients (mean age, 60.3 years) harboring 89 aneurysms were treated with Enterprise (n = 57) or Solitaire (n = 32) SAC. The patients' demographics, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS There were no cases of stent navigation, deployment failure, arterial dissection, or intraoperative aneurysmal rupture. Angiographic follow-up imaging was available for 86 (96.6%) aneurysms (Enterprise group, n = 55; Solitaire group, n = 31). Immediate postoperative and follow-up angiographic results showed no flow or only minimal flow into the neck in 83% (Enterprise group, 77.2%; Solitaire group, 93.8%) and 95.3% (Enterprise group, 92.7%; Solitaire group, 100%) of SAC-treated aneurysms, respectively. Both stent groups showed good immediate postoperative and follow-up clinical outcomes. Excepting 2 cases, all patients achieved modified Rankin Scale scores of 0. Coil loop or tail protrusion into the parent artery was observed in 17 (29.8%) and 7 (21.9%) cases in the Enterprise and Solitaire groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference in terms of angiographic results or clinical outcomes was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION Excellent and comparable clinical and angiographic outcomes for wide-neck intracranial aneurysms were achieved using both stents. Because of its higher radial strength and better vessel wall apposition, we cautiously propose that the Solitaire stent may be more effective for SAC of aneurysms harboring a large or severe tortuous parent artery.

CDC protocol for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) include 3 targets for detection (N1, N2 and RP) labelled with FAM so 3 PCR reactions are required per sample. We developed a triplex, real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 that maintained clinical performance compared with CDC singleplex assay. This protocol could speed up detection and save reagents during current SARS-CoV-2 testing supplies shortage.

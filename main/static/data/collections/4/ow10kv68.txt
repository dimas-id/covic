BACKGROUND Three laparoscopic ports are traditionally required to complete a laparoscopic appendectomy. We describe a novel, innovative 2-port laparoscopic technique, in which intracorporeal appendectomy can be completed safely with standard instrumentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight consecutive patients were prospectively assigned to undergo 2-port laparoscopic appendectomies for presumed appendicitis. The technique involves the placement of one 12-mm infraumbilical port for the working instruments and one 5-mm left lower quadrant port for the camera. A suture is tied in a loop to the anterior abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant, which is subsequently used as an axle. A pretied suture placed on the appendix is passed through the loop suture and then through the port to the outside of the abdomen. This technique allows exposure of the base of the appendix and compensates for the lack of the third port usually required for the retraction of the appendix. The mesoappendix and appendix are stapled and removed from the abdomen in an extrication bag. RESULTS All 8 laparoscopic procedures were completed without difficulty. The mean operative time was 64.1 min. Length of hospitalization was 1 d or less. No major complications were encountered. One minor postoperative complication occurred in which the patient developed periumbilical cellulitis, which was completely resolved at the 1-wk postoperative visit. CONCLUSION In times where surgeons are focusing on transluminal approaches to access the abdominal cavity, we favor laparoscopy for the enhanced exposure, instrument diversity, and overall patient safety. Two-port laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe, novel laparoscopic technique, which minimizes minimally invasive surgery even further to a new level of decreased invasiveness and improved cosmesis.

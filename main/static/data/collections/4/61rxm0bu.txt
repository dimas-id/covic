Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were challenged with 10(7) PFU of a clinical isolate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Some of the animals developed a mild self-limited respiratory infection very different from that observed in humans with SARS. The macaque model as it currently exists will have limited utility in the study of SARS and the evaluation of therapies.

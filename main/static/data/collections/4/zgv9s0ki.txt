This article reports the diagnosis and treatment of two children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hypertension. Case 1 was a boy aged 13 years and 3 months, with the main manifestations of fever and dry cough; chest CT showed ground-glass opacities, and the nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) yielded a positive result. Case 2 was a boy aged 13 years and 8 months and had no clinical symptoms; chest CT showed no abnormality, while the nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 yielded a positive result. Both cases were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They had obesity and a family history of hypertension. Continuous blood pressure monitoring in the resting state during hospitalization showed that blood pressure was above the 95% reference interval of normal value for children of the same age, and the two boys were given calcium channel blockers or ÃŸ-receptor blockers and were then recovered. It is concluded that comprehensive management of children with COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, should be taken seriously during the epidemic.

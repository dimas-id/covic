The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is among the most studied species of the Order Euphausiacea in biological and ecological aspects; however, reports of their parasites and diseases are relatively scarce. A worldwide overview of all parasites known for 48 out 86 extant euphausiid species includes 17 distinct types of epibionts, pathogens, parasites, and parasitoids. So far, only seven of them have been reported interacting with E. superba [epibionts: exuviotrophic ciliates (Foettingeriidae) and microplanktophagous ciliates (Suctoridae, Ephelota), pathogens: chitinoclastic bacteria and fungi; and trophically transmitted endoparasites: Apicomplexans (Gregarinidae, Cephaloidophora), nematode infecting krill’s eggs (under laboratory conditions), and histophagous parasites: Apostomatida ciliates of the family Pseudocollinidae]. The epibionts have interspecific associations that strongly depend on the krill’s moult cycle, discarding them at each moulting event. Their colonization and intensity show a remarkable synchronization with the krill moulting process at individual, school, and population levels. The social and sometimes highly dense swarms and schools of E. superba, its keystone trophic function (both as voracious predator and as prey to multiple predators) should make it a critical vector for trophically transmitted parasites in the food web. However, E. superba interacts with a relatively low diversity of epibionts, pathogens, and parasites, in comparison with parasite diversity known for relatively well-studied temperate (Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Euphausia pacifica) and subtropical (Nyctiphanes simplex) euphausiid species. The apparently low parasite diversity of E. superba is likely associated with its Antarctic zoogeographic pattern; where, parasites have not invaded the Antarctic krill with the same evolutionary success as have occurred with other euphausiid species from tropical, subtropical, temperate, and even Arctic ecosystems.

In late December 2019, some cases of atypical pneumonia, at that time of unknown origin, were reported in Wuhan, China. Days later, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus. This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it produces was named COVID-19. The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector. Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic. The purpose of this review is to study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen, as well as epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, transmission, prevention, and treatment of the disease.

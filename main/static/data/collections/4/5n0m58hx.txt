Abstract Reductionism is ubiquitous in Medicine. In this paper, I argue that the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis is also a crisis of reductionism, with a narrow view on a virus without consideration of interdependencies between virology, epidemiology, immunity, economics and a diversity of other scientific disciplines. For optimal management of this crisis, systems thinking and transdisciplinary science would be much more appropriate. Some examples to underline my argument are provided.

Bovine torovirus (BToV) is a diarrhea-causing pathogen. In this study, 92 diarrheic fecal samples from five farms in four provinces in China were collected and tested for BToV using a RT-PCR assay, and 21.73% samples were found to be BToV positive. Moreover, two complete BToV genome sequences (MN073058 and MN073059) were obtained from the clinical samples, which were 28,297 and 28,301 nucleotides in length, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that the two isolates shared 10 identical amino acid mutations in the S protein compared to the complete S sequences of BToV available in the GenBank database. In addition, seven consecutive amino acid mutations were found from aa 1,486 to 1,492 in the S protein of isolate MN073058. Moreover, the two isolates shared one identical amino acid mutation in the receptor binding sites of the HE protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the epidemic and genomic characterization of BToV in China, which is helpful for further understanding the genetic evolution of BToV.

Advances in the management of patients in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of hematologic malignancies and treatment-related complications, especially infectious complications, have increased survival time. However, more than half of the patients treated for hematologic malignancies will develop a pulmonary complication during their follow-up, infectious pneumonia remaining the most common diagnosis that should be considered first in regard to its potential severity. Otherwise, new complications that may involve different organs, including the lungs, have been increasingly reported. Currently, over a quarter of lung infiltrates occurring in the context of hematological diseases are due to noninfectious causes. Thus, lung physicians may be increasingly confronted with these lung disorders. Various noninfectious pulmonary complications have been described in the different hematological malignancies; however, these complications are most often studied in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this chapter, we will briefly review the lung diseases associated with various hematological malignancies before focusing on noninfectious pulmonary complications following allogeneic HSCT.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Human bocavirus (HBoV), a parvovirus, was discovered in 2005 with the use of nonspecific genome amplification techniques. Since its discovery, HBoV has been identified worldwide. This review will focus on the epidemiology and clinical features associated with HBoV infection. RECENT FINDINGS Initial studies demonstrated the presence of HBoV DNA in respiratory specimens of individuals with respiratory tract disease. Data from some studies suggest that HBoV may be the etiological agent responsible for respiratory tract disease, particularly in young children. HBoV, however, is frequently detected in the presence of other common respiratory viruses. HBoV is not confined to the respiratory tract as evidence of the virus has been detected in serum and stool, the significance of which remains unclear. Presence of the virus in respiratory secretions, serum and stool suggests that this virus may cause systemic illness. SUMMARY HBoV is an emerging human parvovirus. The full spectrum of disease associated with HBoV remains to be defined.

Abstract It is possible to visualize rapidly viral particles by electron microscopy (EM) in patient samples and in cell cultures, and characterize the particles on the basis of their size and morphology. In many instances, EM has contributed to the diagnosis of specific infectious agents. Four different types of viruses with different characteristics of particle size, capsid structure, the presence or absence of an envelope, genomic content and stability outside the host were screened and diagnosed by EM at the level of family/genus. The results were confirmed at the species level by elution of the sample material from the grids used for EM examination and nucleic acid amplification. This approach could be valuable in situations where the immediate diagnosis is unclear, or when new infectious agents appear.

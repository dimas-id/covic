SIMPLE SUMMARY: In this study, the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii (SB) supplement on the performance and physiological traits of Holstein calves under heat stress were investigated using a climatic chamber. We revealed that supplementation with SB incorporated into milk replacer can ameliorate the negative impact of heat stress on Holstein dairy calves by increasing dry matter intake (DMI), reducing rectal temperature and heart rate, and alleviating diarrhea via modulating pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tract. The results showed that SB can be used as an alternative anti-stressor in the diet of young dairy calves under heat stress (HS). ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-1079 (SB) as a feed additive on performance, diarrhea frequency, rectal temperature, heart rate, water consumption, cortisol level, and fecal bacteria population in Holstein calves (28 ± 1.6 days of age, body weight of 45.6 ± 1.44 kg, n = 16) under thermal neutral (TN) and heat stress (HS) conditions. During the TN period for 21 days (d 1 to 21), calves receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher dry matter intake (DMI, p = 0.002), and water consumption (p = 0.007) but lower frequency of fecal diarrhea (p = 0.008), rectal temperature (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.001), and fecal microbiota at 21 day (Escherichia coli, p = 0.025; Enterobacteriaceae, p = 0.041). Meanwhile, calves exposed to HS for 7 days (d 22 to 28) receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher DMI (p = 0.002) but lower water consumption (p = 0.023), rectal temperature (p = 0.026), and cortisol level (p = 0.014). Our results suggest that live SB is useful in the livestock industry as an alternative to conventional medication (especially in times of suspected health problems) that can be added to milk replacer for young dairy calves experiencing HS.

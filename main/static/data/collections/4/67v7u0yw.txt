Predicting the effects of volume expansion on cardiac output and oxygen delivery is of major importance in different clinical scenarios. Functional hemodynamic parameters based on pulse waveform analysis, which are relying on the effects of mechanical ventilation on stroke volume and its surrogates, have been shown to be reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness during anesthesia and intensive care unit treatment, as demonstrated by several clinical studies and meta-analyses. However, different limitations of these parameters have to be considered when they are used in clinical practice. Today, they can be continuously and automatically monitored by a variety of commercially available devices. These parameters have been introduced into the concept of perioperative fluid management and hemodynamic optimization - an approach that may positively impact postoperative patients' outcomes. In this article, technical aspects of the assessment of the functional hemodynamic parameters derived from pulse waveform analysis are summarized, emphasizing their advantages, limitations and potential applications, primarily in a perioperative setting in order to improve patient outcome.

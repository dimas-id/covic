OBJECTIVE Animal model of tracheal stenosis based on pathophysiology of prolonged endotracheal intubation has been rarely reported. We sought to verify the feasibility of inducing an animal model of tracheal stenosis by segmented endotracheal tube insertion in the New Zealand white rabbit model. METHODS Tracheal stenosis was induced by inserting a segmented endotracheal tube of 1.5cm length which was wrapped with a commercialized absorbable hemostat in 15 New Zealand white rabbits, while sham surgery controls (n=3) underwent tracheotomy and direct closure of tracheal exposure. The tube was removed transorally, 1 week after tube insertion. All rabbits were evaluated endoscopically at 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after the tube insertion. The rabbits were sacrificed 3 weeks after the surgery, and the excised tissue of trachea was processed along with the procedure of standard hematoxylin eosin staining and observed under a microscope. RESULTS Tracheal stenosis was induced in all rabbits (range 32-84% stenosis) with no death of rabbits during the study. The histological features of tracheal stenosis demonstrated thickening and fibrosis of lamina propria and submucosa with relatively intact cartilage framework. CONCLUSIONS We developed a rabbit model of tracheal stenosis induced by endotracheal intubation using a segmented tracheal tube. Since the model is based on the physiologic condition of prolonged endotracheal intubation, it may be used in variable studies related to tracheal stenosis.

In this review, I will suggest to divide all the approaches united now under common term “gene therapy” into two broad strategies of which the first one uses the methodology of targeted therapy with all its characteristics, but with genes in the role of agents targeted at a certain molecular component(s) presumably crucial for cancer maintenance. In contrast, the techniques of the other strategy are aimed at the destruction of tumors as a whole using the features shared by all cancers, for example relatively fast mitotic cell division or active angiogenesis. While the first strategy is “true” gene therapy, the second one is more like genetic surgery when a surgeon just cuts off a tumor with his scalpel and has no interest in knowing delicate mechanisms of cancer emergence and progression. I will try to substantiate the idea that the last strategy is the only right one, and its simplicity is paradoxically adequate to the super-complexity of tumors that originates from general complexity of cell regulation, strongly disturbed in tumor cells, and especially from the complexity of tumors as evolving cell populations, affecting also their ecological niche formed by neighboring normal cells and tissues. An analysis of the most widely used for such a “surgery” suicide gene/prodrug combinations will be presented in some more details.

A vaccine to protect against COVID-19 is urgently needed. Such a vaccine should efficiently induce high-affinity neutralizing antibodies which neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. However, there is a concern regarding both vaccine-induced eosinophilic lung disease and eosinophil-associated Th2 immunopotentiation following infection after vaccination. Here, we review the anticipated characteristics of a COVID-19 vaccine to avoid vaccine-associated eosinophil immunopathology.

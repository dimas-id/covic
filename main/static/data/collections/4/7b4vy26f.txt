A novel multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex RT-PCR) that can detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine group A rotavirus (GAR) was developed. The 3 viruses (PEDV, TGEV, and porcine GAR) are major agents in viral enteric diseases of piglets. As the clinical signs of these diseases are similar, including watery diarrhea, differential detection is required for etiologic diagnosis. A mixture of 3 pairs of published primers was used for amplification of viral nucleic acids, yielding 3 different amplicons with sizes of 859 bp, 651 bp, and 309 bp for TGEV, PEDV, and porcine GAR, respectively. A total of 157 specimens (78 fecal and 79 intestinal samples) from piglets with acute gastroenteritis were collected in Korea between January 2004 and May 2005. They were tested for the presence of 3 viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Coinfections with PEDV and porcine GAR were identified in 16 farms (43.2%). PEDV, porcine GAR, and TGEV infection were 26.3%, 13.2%, and 2.7% respectively. The relative sensitivity and specificity of multiplex RT-PCR were evaluated, with results suggesting that this assay is equal in quality to conventional single-agent RT-PCR assays (sensitivity:100%, 92.9%, 100% for TGEV, PEDV, GARs; specificity: 100% for all 3 viruses). This multiplex RT-PCR is a simple assay and may be a potentially useful for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective etiological diagnostic tool for acute viral gastroenteritis in piglets.

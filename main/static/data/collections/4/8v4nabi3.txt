Abstract Biological high-risk pollutants (HRPs) have become a serious threat to human health worldwide, and wastewater is one of the major sources of them in a natural environment. Despite the long history of wastewater research, comprehensive understanding of the role and behavior of HRPs during wastewater treatment is still limited owing to the complexity of the community. In recent decades, the rapid development of molecular tools, especially the wide application of next generation sequencing technologies, helps to unravel the community composition, structure, and dynamic variation in wastewater. Overall, this chapter mainly focuses on biological HRPs, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminth, biotoxins, antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater. The characteristics, classification, fates, functions, and health implications of these HRPs are introduced in detail. Moreover, the biogeography of HRPs is a research hotspot in recent years, and available information is also summarized in this chapter. Finally, we also propose the future research needs of HRPs in wastewater after the comprehensive summary of the existing research reports. This chapter is wished to be helpful for beginners to quickly understand the biological HRPs in wastewater.

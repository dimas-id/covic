Blood coagulation and inflammation are universal responses to infection and there is crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation that can either amplify or dampen the responses. Loss of appropriate interactions between these systems probably contributes to morbidity and mortality in infectious diseases. For instance, inflammatory cytokines and leukocyte elastase can downregulate natural anticoagulant proteins that help to maintain endothelial-cell integrity, control clotting, inhibit vasoactive peptides and dampen leukocyte infiltration into the vessel wall. This Review will summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between these two important systems.

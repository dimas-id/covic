The last decade has witnessed remarkable improvements in the analysis of inconsistent formulas, namely in the case of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formulas. However, these successes have been restricted to monotonic logics. Recent work proposed the notion of strong inconsistency for a number of non-monotonic logics, including Answer Set Programming (ASP). This paper shows how algorithms for reasoning about inconsistency in monotonic logics can be extended to the case of ASP programs, in the concrete case of strong inconsistency. Initial experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed approach.

In this article, we are going to show how to find out short term forecasts of the total number of COVID-19 cases in India in an easy way. Initially the spread of the disease was observably slow in India. Since the first week of May a highly nonlinear pattern has started to take shape. It can be observed that currently in India the spread pattern is nearly exponential. It can be seen further that the number of cases is still continuing to grow very fast. Therefore, instead of going for rigorous time series analysis, we may opt for looking at the data from a recent date downwards, and short term forecasts based on simple numerical analytical methods can be made accordingly.

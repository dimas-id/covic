Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is a new infectious disease pandemic with important public health concerns. The high infectivity rate by means of droplet transmission places health care workers at substantial risk of contracting the disease. Radiology departments are particularly affected, since imaging plays a vital role in both diagnosis and follow-up of this disease. The authors outline their experience in infection control and isolation procedures during this outbreak. Barrier precautions, reconfiguration of the department, separation of imaging equipment, cleaning procedures, personal protective equipment, and staff safety are discussed.

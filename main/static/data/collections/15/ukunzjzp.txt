OBJECTIVE To compare laparoscopic manual esophagoenterostomy and esophagoenterostomy with mechanical stapling anastomotic devices after laparoscopic gastrectomy for stomach cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 34 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for stomach in 2015-2018. Roux-en-Y esophagoenterostomy was used to reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract. Manual anastomoses were performed in 18 patients (group 1), stapled anastomoses (endogia 45 mm, covidien, mansfield, ma, usa) - in 16 patients (group 2). There was no randomization. Surgery duration, length of icu-stay, terms of enteral nutrition initiation, postoperative complications, hospital-stay were analyzed. RESULTS Mean duration of surgery in the first group was 217 (184-302) min, in the second group - 201 (162-311) min. Duration of surgery in the first group was 1.08-fold higher than in the second group (95% CI 1.03-1.13, p=0.05). Mean blood loss was 145 ml in both groups. Mean icu-stay was 20.2 (17-42) hours in the first group and 21.1 (16.2-46) hours in the second group (ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-1.01, p=0.06). Total enteral feeding (sipping) was initiated on the third day in both groups. Mean postoperative hospital-stay was 9.21 (6-13) days in the first group and 9.23 (6-12 days) days in the second group (ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0,95-1.02, p=0.06). Postoperative morbidity was 5.5% in the first group and 6.25% in the second group. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic manual esophagoenterostomy proposed by our surgical team does not have disadvantages in comparison with stapling anastomotic devices and these methods may be alternative to each other.

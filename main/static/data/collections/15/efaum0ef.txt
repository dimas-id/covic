Abstract Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of morbidity and mortality in cattle and interactions of factors associated with the animal, the pathogen and the environment are central to its pathogenesis. Emerging knowledge of a role for pathogens traditionally assumed to be minor players in the pathogenesis of BRD reflects an increasingly complex situation that will necessitate regular reappraisal of BRD pathogenesis and control. This review appraises the role of selected key pathogens implicated in BRD pathogenesis to assess how our understanding of their role has evolved in recent years.

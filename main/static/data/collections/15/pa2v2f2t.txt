OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony and different types of asynchrony in preterm infants treated with non-synchronised nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nIPPV). DESIGN An observational study was conducted including preterm infants born with a gestational age (GA) less than 32 weeks treated with non-synchronised nIPPV. During 1 hour, spontaneous breathing was measured with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm simultaneous with ventilator inflations. An asynchrony index (AI), a percentage of asynchronous breaths, was calculated and the incidence of different types of inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony were reported. RESULTS Twenty-one preterm infants with a mean GA of 26.0±1.2 weeks were included in the study. The mean inspiratory AI was 68.3%±4.7% and the mean expiratory AI was 67.1%±7.3%. Out of 5044 comparisons of spontaneous inspirations and mechanical inflations, 45.3% of the mechanical inflations occurred late, 23.3% of the mechanical inflations were early and 31.4% of the mechanical inflation were synchronous. 40.3% of 5127 expiratory comparisons showed an early termination of ventilator inflations, 26.7% of the mechanical inflations terminated late and 33.0% mechanical inflations terminated in synchrony with a spontaneous expiration. In addition, 1380 spontaneous breaths were unsupported and 611 extra mechanical inflations were delivered. CONCLUSION Non-synchronised nIPPV results in high patient-ventilator asynchrony in preterm infants during both the inspiratory and expiratory phase of the breathing cycle. New synchronisation techniques are urgently needed and should address both inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony.

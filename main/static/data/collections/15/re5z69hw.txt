Disinfecting, nonbleaching compound 1-chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-imidazolidinone (MC) was uniformly coated onto polypropylene melt-blown nonwoven fabrics having basis-weights of 22 and 50 g/m(2) in order to impart antimicrobial properties via a pad-dry technique. The antimicrobial efficacies of the tested fabrics loaded with MC compound were evaluated against bioaerosols of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli O157:H7 utilizing a colony counting method. It was determined that both types of coated fabrics exhibited superior antimicrobial efficacy upon exposure to aerosol generation for 3 h. The effect of the coating on air permeability was found to be minimal. Samples were stable for a 6 month time period when they were stored in darkness. However, when the fabrics were exposed to fluorescent light, partial chlorine loss was observed. The MC-coated fabrics exhibited great potential for use in protective face masks and air filters to combat airborne pathogens.

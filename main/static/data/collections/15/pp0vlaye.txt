The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a global public health emergency infected by SARC-CoV-2 has caused devastating loss around the world. Currently, a lot of diagnosis methods have been used to detect the infection. The nucleic acid (NA) testing is reported to be the clinical standard for COVID-19 infection. Evidence shows that a faster and more convenient method to detect in the early phase will control the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a method to detect SARC-Cov-2 infection within two hours combined with Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) reaction and nanopore Flongle workflow. In this approach, RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification reaction with one step in 30 minutes at 60-65Â°C constant temperature environment, nanopore Flongle rapidly adapter ligated within 10 minutes. Flongle flow cell sequencing and analysis in real-time. This method described here has the advantages of rapid amplification, convenient operation and real-time detection which is the most important for rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Moreover, this approach not only can be used for SARS-CoV-2 detection but also can be extended to other respiratory viruses and pathogens.

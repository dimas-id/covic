Today, recombinant antibodies can replace animal-derived primary antibodies in almost all applications. Due to their monoclonal origin and always known sequence, they offer optimal reproducibility. In contrast, almost all secondary antibodies are still made from animal sera. Multiclonal antibodies made by animal-free recombinant methods here offer a higher quality replacement for serum-derived secondary antibodies.

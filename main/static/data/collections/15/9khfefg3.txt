BACKGROUND Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. The global prevalence of IBS is estimated to be as high as 15%. For many patients, IBS is a chronic disorder which can significantly reduce quality of life. Just as important as the effects on any one individual, IBS also places a significant impact on the population as a whole with its negative effects on the health care system. Irritable bowel syndrome is categorized into one of three main categories: IBS with diarrhea, IBS with constipation, and IBS with mixed bowel habits. Patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) comprise a substantial proportion of the overall IBS population. A number of therapeutic options exist to treat the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and fecal urgency, including non-pharmacologic therapies such as dietary changes and probiotics, or pharmacologic therapies such as loperamide and alosetron. However, many patients have persistent symptoms despite these therapies. This unmet need led to the development of eluxadoline, a mu-opioid receptor agonist/delta-opioid receptor antagonist/kappa-receptor agonist. Approved by the FDA in May 2015, this medication shows promise in the treatment of diarrhea-predominant IBS for both men and women. PURPOSE This monograph will briefly review the impact of IBS, discuss current treatments for IBS-D, and then focus on the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of eluxadoline. Potential mechanisms related to rare events of acute pancreatitis or elevated liver tests will be discussed.

Severe and critical coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) often occurs in elder patients with multiple comorbidities, and severe hypoxemia events constitute a key factor for the deterioration of some cases. The critical type of COVID-19 could progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction, which are the major causes of death. Early non-invasive ventilation (NIV) treatment of possible pathophysiological abnormalities is helpful to improve prognosis. Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing patients' oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapid handling of severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for successful NIV treatment. In addition, active adjuvant therapies such as correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support, accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring are of great significance.

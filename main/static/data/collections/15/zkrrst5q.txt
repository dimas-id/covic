OBJECTIVE This retrospective study aimed to analysis clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). METHOD Medical records, laboratory results and radiologic findings of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were collected, clinical characteristics and outcomes were summarized. RESULTS A total of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were included. Median age of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 was 63 years (34-98). 33(63.5%) patients were mild and 19(36.5%) were severe/critical. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (10, 19.2%). The common symptoms were as follows: fever (25%), dry cough (17.3%), chest distress (11.5%) and fatigue (9.6%).There were 33(63.5%) patients had comorbidities, the most common symptom was hypertension (17, 51.5%). 26(78.8%) patients developed pneumonia on admission. Lymphocytes (0.6Ã—109 /L) decreased in both mild and severe/critical patients. Median levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein(CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) were 2.8 mg/L, 70.5 mg/L, 0.3 ng/mL, and 318 U/L respectively, which increased significantly in severe/critical patients compared to the mild patients. Interleukin 6(IL-6) (12.6 pg/ml) increased in both mild and severe/critical patients, there was a significant difference between them. Complications were observed in 29(55.8%) patients, such as liver injury (19, 36.5%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (9, 17.3%), sepsis (8, 15.4%), myocardial injury (8, 15.4%), renal insufficiency (4, 7.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (3, 5.8%).11(21.2%) cancer patients died. CONCLUSION The infection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-COV-2) in cancer patients was higher than the general population, cancer patients with COVID-19 showed deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes.

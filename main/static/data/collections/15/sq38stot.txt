BACKGROUND The attainment of technical competence for surgical procedures is fundamental to a proficiency-based surgical training program. We hypothesized that aptitude may directly affect one's ability to successfully complete the learning curve for minimally invasive procedures. The aim was to assess whether aptitude has an impact on ability to achieve proficiency in completing a simulated minimally invasive surgical procedure. The index procedure chosen was a laparoscopic appendectomy. STUDY DESIGN Two groups of medical students with disparate aptitude were selected. Aptitude (visual-spatial, depth perception, and psychomotor ability) was measured by previously validated tests. Indicators of technical proficiency for laparoscopic appendectomy were established by trained surgeons with an individual case volume of more than 150. All subjects were tested consecutively on the ProMIS III (Haptica) until they reached predefined proficiency in this procedure. Simulator metrics, critical error scores, and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores were recorded. RESULTS The mean numbers of attempts to achieve proficiency in performing a laparoscopic appendectomy for group A (high aptitude) and B (low aptitude) were 6 (range 4 to 7) and 14 (range 10 to 18), respectively (p < 0.0001). Significant differences were found between the 2 groups for path length (p = 0.014), error score (p = 0.021), and OSATS score (p < 0.0001) at the initial attempt. CONCLUSIONS High aptitude is directly related to a rapid attainment of proficiency. These findings suggest that resource allocation for proficiency-based technical training in surgery may need to be tailored according to a trainee's natural ability.

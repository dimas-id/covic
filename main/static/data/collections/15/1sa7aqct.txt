OBJECTIVE: In this brief review, we intend to evaluate the regulatory changes that have taken place, the impact of these changes, and the additional opportunities for outpatient pharmacists to receive compensation while providing distant health care. SUMMARY: The 2020 coronavirus disease pandemic in the United States has created a dramatic need for the rapid implementation of telehealth services in areas of the country where telehealth is limited in scope. This implementation would not be possible without changes in how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provide reimbursement for these services. Reimbursement options remain open to pharmacists, but depend on local regulation or the ability to alter practice at the site. CONCLUSION: Though pharmacists provide high-quality direct patient care, they are excluded from seeking compensation for providing this care, even as the nation expands the telehealth model. This overview shows that despite changes in telehealth service compensation for health care providers, pharmacists remain unable to seek appropriate compensation for their direct patient care services.

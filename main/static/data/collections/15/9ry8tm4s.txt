Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since become a global pandemic. Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected and reported its first case in January 2020. Strategies that were deployed successfully during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome have had to evolve to contain this novel coronavirus. Like the rest of the health care services in Singapore, the practice of ophthalmology has also had to adapt to this rapidly changing crisis. This article discusses the measures put in place by the 3 largest ophthalmology centers in Singapore's public sector in response to COVID-19, and the challenges of providing eye care in the face of stringent infection control directives, staff redeployments and "social distancing." The recently imposed "circuit breaker," effectively a partial lockdown of the country, has further limited our work to only the most essential of services. Our staff are also increasingly part of frontline efforts in the screening and care of patients with COVID-19. However, this crisis has also been an opportunity to push ahead with innovative practices and given momentum to the use of teleophthalmology and other digital technologies. Amidst this uncertainty, our centers are already planning for how ophthalmology in Singapore will be practiced in this next stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond.

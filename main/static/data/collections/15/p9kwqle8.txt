Abstract Beet black scorch virus (BBSV) encodes three movement proteins (P7a, P7b and P5′) that facilitate its cell-to-cell movement. An arginine-rich motif of P7a N-terminus was found to determine nuclear and nucleolar localization. Amino acids substitution or deletion of the R-rich motif interfered with P7a nuclear and nucleolar localization. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed that P7a protein interacted with Nicotiana benthamiana nuclear import factor importin α, suggesting that P7a is translocated into the nucleus by the classical importin α/β-dependent pathway. Moreover, P7a also interacted with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin. Mutations in the R-rich motif of P7a diminished P7a interactions with importin α and fibrillarin, influenced viral replication in Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts and altered the symptom phenotype and viral RNA accumulation in Chenopodium amaranticolor plants. These results demonstrate that the R-rich motif of P7a is correlated with nuclear and nucleolar localization, viral replication and virus infection.

PURPOSE The experience of endoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of recurrent inguinal hernia in a major teaching hospital is reviewed. METHODS Between 2003 and 2008, 37 consecutive patients underwent 46 TEP repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operating time, conversion rate, intraoperative, postoperative complications and recurrence were measured. Twenty-eight patients had unilateral hernia and nine patients had bilateral hernias. The mean age was 59 years old (range 22-88 years). RESULTS The mean operation duration was 88 min (range 60-120 min). Bilateral repairs took 38% longer than for unilateral repairs (108 vs 78 min). Three patients (8.1%) had conversion to open surgery. Seroma developed in two patients, which was subsequently resolved. Within 1 year of follow up evaluation, there was 1 recurrence (2.7%). The mean inpatient hospital stay was 1.6 days, and 24.3% of the operations were performed as outpatients. CONCLUSION Repair of recurrent hernia using the TEP approach can be achieved with minimum morbidity, good clinical outcomes and acceptable recurrence rates. Endoscopic repair has become the procedure of choice for the treatment of the majority of recurrent inguinal hernias at our institution.

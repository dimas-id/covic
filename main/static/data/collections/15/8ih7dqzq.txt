Abstract Rapid screening of infectious viral diseases is the key to ensure healthy development of duck livestock industry. Currently routine viral detection methods are primarily used to detect up to 3 viruses. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used for simultaneous detection and genotyping of ten viruses in duck, including Duck hepatitis A virus 1 (DHAV-1), DHAV-3, Duck astrovirus 1 (DAstV-1), DAstV-2, Duck reovirus 1 (DRV-1), DRV-2, Tembusu virus (TMUV), Avian influenza virus (AIV), Goose parvovirus (GPV) and Duck enteritis virus (DEV). The low detection limits of this proposed method for ten duck viruses ranged from 1.3 copies/μl to 7.8 copies/μl. The novel detection method with high sensitivity, good specificity and high throughput has the potential to be applied for disease diagnosis and surveillance.

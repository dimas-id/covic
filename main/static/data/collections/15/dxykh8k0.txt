We describe the clinical course of 57 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cared for through a single hospital system. Most children were mildly symptomatic, and only a few patients with underlying medical conditions required hospitalization. Systemwide patient evaluation processes allowed for prompt identification and management of patients with COVID-19.

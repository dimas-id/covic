PM(2.5) concentration is very difficult to predict, for it is the result of complex interactions among various factors. This paper combines the random forest-recursive feature elimination algorithm and lasso regression for joint feature selection, puts forward a PM(2.5) concentration prediction model based on GAM. Firstly, the original data is standardized in the data input layer. Secondly, features were selected with RF-RFE and lasso regression algorithm in the feature selection layer. Meanwhile, weighted average method fused the two feature subsets to obtain the final subset, RF-lasso-T. Finally, the generalized additive models (GAM) is used to predict PM(2.5) concentration on the RF-lasso-T. Simulated experiments show that feature selection allows GAM model to run more efficiently. The deviance explained by the model reaches 91.5%, which is higher than only using a subset of RF-RFE. This model also reveals the influence of various factors on PM(2.5), which provides the decision-making basis for haze control.

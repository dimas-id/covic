In 961 calves up to an age of 6 months which were sent to the animal health center in Oldenburg between March 1987 and March 1990 for necropsy the results of determination of different viruses were calculated: BVD-, rota-, corona-, parainfluenza-3- (PI-3)-, bovine herpes-1 (BHV-1)- and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). In 122 and 104 randomly collected health calves of 22 farms antibodies against BRSV and bovine adeno virus-types 5, 7 and 8 were determined. 50.1% of the necropsied calves were one and two weeks old. In this group in 40.2% rotavirus and in 19.0% coronavirus could be isolated. All over the calves the frequencies of isolated viruses were 13.3% for BVDV, 4.6% for BRSV, 3.2% for BHV-1, and 2.1% for PI-3. The percentages of positive findings for rota- and coronavirus increased up to 7 days after birth, and thereafter both decreased. The frequencies of BVDV and BRSV were higher in older groups. The frequency of PI-3 was low and remained constantly. Infections with rota-, corona- and with both viruses were accompanied by BVDV in 11.3, 5.3 and 14.3%, respectively. Against bovine adenoviruses and BRSV in the first 8 weeks and after 14 weeks of life in more than 70% of the calves antibodies were detected.

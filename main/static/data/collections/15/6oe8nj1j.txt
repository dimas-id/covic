Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the recent developments in the field of immunosensors. Immunosensors incorporate the specific immunochemical reaction with the modern transducers including electrochemical (potentiometric, conductometric, capacitative, impedance, amperometric), optical (fluorescence, luminescence, refractive index), and microgravimetric transducers. These immunosensor devices with dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and selectivity possess the abilities to investigate the reaction dynamics of antibodyâ€“antigen binding and the potential to revolutionize conventional immunoassay techniques. With the rapid development of immunological reagents and detection equipments, immunosensors have allowed an increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantified and in particular, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and reliable immunosensing systems have been developed for areas such as outpatient monitoring, large screening programs, and remote environmental surveillance. Immunosensors with lowered detection limits and increased sensitivities have been developed in various fields, particularly in clinical analysis. A noticeable development trend is also observed in the development of immunosensors combining with other techniques such as flow injection analysis (FIA) or capillary electrophoretic (CE) analysis, which complement and improve the present immunoassay methods. Belov et al. have proposed a novel immunophenotyping method for leukemias which uses a cluster of differentiation antibody microarray, and a microarray of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed for autoimmune diagnosis of systematic rheumatic disease. Development of microfluidic immunosensor systems for proteomics and drug discovery have also been reported in recent years where the microfluidic system integrates multiple processes in a single device to improve analytical performance by reducing the reagent consumption and the analysis time, and increasing reliability and sensitivity through automation.

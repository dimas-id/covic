BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The effects of corticosteroid treatment on non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients are unknown. To determine the impacts of adjuvant corticosteroid administrated to patients with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD A retrospective cohort study based on propensity score analysis was designed to explore the effects of corticosteroid on several clinical outcomes. RESULTS 132 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and 35 pairs were generated according to propensity score matching. Compared to non-corticosteroid group, the CT score on day 7 was significantly higher in corticosteroid group (8.6 (IQR, 2.8-11.5) versus 12.0 (IQR, 5.0-19.3), P = 0.046). In corticosteroid group, more patients progressed to severe cases (11.4% versus 2.9%, P = 0.353), hospital stay (23.5 days (IQR, 19-29 d) versus 20.2 days (IQR, 14-25.3 d), P = 0.079) and duration of viral shedding (20.3 days (IQR, 15.2-24.8 d) versus 19.4 days (IQR, 11.5-28.3 d), P = 0.669) were prolonged, while fever time (9.5 days (IQR, 6.5-12.2 d) versus 10.2 days (IQR, 6.8-14 d), P = 0.28) was shortened, however all these data revealed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION Corticosteroid might have a negative effect on lung injury recovery in non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients, however the results of this study must be interpreted with caution because of confounding factors.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we provide an overview of how healthcare robotics can facilitate healthy aging, with an emphasis on physical, cognitive, and social supports. We next provide a synthesis of future challenges and considerations in the development and application of healthcare robots. We organize these considerations using a socio-ecological perspective and discuss considerations at the individual, care partner, community healthcare, and healthcare policy levels. RECENT FINDINGS: Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the US population. Age-related changes and challenges can present difficulties, for older adults want to age healthily and maintain independence. Technology, specifically healthcare robots, has potential to provide health supports to older adults. These supports span widely across the physical, cognitive, and social aspects of healthy aging. SUMMARY: Our review suggests that while healthcare robotics has potential to revolutionize the way in which older adults manage their health, there are many challenges such as clinical effectiveness, technology acceptance, health informatics, and healthcare policy and ethics. Addressing these challenges at all levels of the healthcare system will help ensure that healthcare robotics promote healthy aging and are applied safely, effectively, and reliably.

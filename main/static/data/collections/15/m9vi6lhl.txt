AIM To examine an organoleptic scoring method (OLS) whereby the sample is collected by negative pressure in a syringe and is subsequently smelled and rated away from the patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data of 476 patients visiting a specialized halitosis clinic in Leuven (Belgium) were reviewed retrospectively. Organoleptic (with the classic and with the negative-pressure method) and instrumental (with the Halimeter® and OralChroma™ ) ratings of breath odour were retrieved from patient files together with the final diagnosis. The correlations between the different methods were examined (Spearman correlation coefficient) as well as the positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity of all methods. RESULTS Both methods of OLS correlated similarly with the instrumental measurements (Halimeter® and OralChroma™ ). Analysis of PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity of both methods of examination showed that the negative-pressure method performed best. CONCLUSION The negative-pressure method is a valid method for organoleptic scoring of the breath odour and performs as good as the classic organoleptic method.

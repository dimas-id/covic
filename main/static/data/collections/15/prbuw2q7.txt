Air transport networks have exhibited a trend towards complex dynamics in recent years. Using Lufthansa's networks as an example, this paper aims to illustrate the relevance of various network indicators — such as connectivity and concentration — for the empirical analysis of airline network configurations. The results highlight the actual strategic choices made by Lufthansa for its own network, as well in combination with its partners in Star Alliance.

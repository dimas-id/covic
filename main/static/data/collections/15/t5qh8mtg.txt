Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy is now well established and performed all around the world. We are going to share the surgical technique for uniportal VATS right upper lobectomy based on our experience. A 62-year-old patient underwent Uniportal VATS right upper lobectomy for a primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our patient had no perioperative complications and was then discharged to his home on postoperative day 4. The patient's pain was managed with a paravertebral catheter during the first 48 hours and then with oral analgesics. Pathology report: well-differentiated adenocarcinoma; the size of the tumour was 1 cm × 0.8 cm × 1 cm; all margins were negative for residual tumour. The patient did not require adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. Uniportal VATS lobectomy is a safe and effective procedure providing a favourable clinical outcome in the patient.

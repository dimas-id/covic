INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging viral pathogen that causes the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and may result in hypoxemic respiratory failure necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation in the most severe cases. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 related respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. DISCUSSION: In severe cases, COVID-19 leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure that may meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mainstay of treatment for ARDS includes a lung protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volumes (4â€“8 mL/kg predicted body weight), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and maintaining a plateau pressure of < 30 cm H(2)O. While further COVID-19 specific studies are needed, current management should focus on supportive care, preventing further lung injury from mechanical ventilation, and treating the underlying cause. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 related respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

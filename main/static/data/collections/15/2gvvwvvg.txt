Antisera prepared against each of three single and one pair of major structural proteins of the bovine coronavirus (Mebus strain) were used in immunoblotting studies to measure cross-reactivity with the structural proteins of the human coronavirus OC43 and the mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59. We conclude that the bovine coronavirus is comprised of four major structural proteins, gp190 (normally present as 120- and 100-kilodalton subunits), gp140, pp52, and gp26. The human coronavirus OC43 has an antigenically homologous counterpart of similar molecular mass to each of these proteins. The mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59 has an antigenically homologous counterpart to only three of these proteins: gp190, pp52 and gp26. There is no counterpart in the mouse virus to the 140-kilodalton glycoprotein, the apparent hemagglutinin of the bovine coronavirus.

The baculovirus surface display technique has provided an ideal tool to display foreign proteins with natural conformation, functions, and immunogenicity. In this work, we explored the application of this technique on SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein, and further analyzed the immunogenicity of displayed S protein. The entire ectodomain of S protein was fused between the gp64 signal peptide and the VSV-G membrane anchor and successfully displayed on the baculovirus surface. Subcutaneous injection with purified S-displayed baculoviruses without adjuvant elicited highly effective production of specific and neutralizing antibodies against S protein in mice. These results confirmed a successful surface display of S protein on baculoviruse, and suggested a potential role of S-displayed baculoviruses as a novel live virus-based vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV.

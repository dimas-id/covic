OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to compare an in-person, group-based behavioral weight loss intervention to technology-based interventions in adults with obesity. METHODS Adults (N = 39; body mass index: 39.5 ± 2.8 kg m-2; age: 39.9 ± 11.5 years) participated in a 6-month program with randomization to one of three intervention groups: standard behavioral weight loss, a technology-based system combined with a monthly intervention telephone call (TECH) or an enhanced technology-based system combined with a monthly intervention telephone call (EN-TECH). All groups were prescribed an energy-restricted diet and physical activity. Assessments occurred at 0, 3 and 6 months. Separate mixed-effects models using unstructured dependence structure were fit to the outcomes. RESULTS Weight loss (least square means ± standard error) at 6 months was -6.57 ± 1.65 kg in standard behavioral weight loss, -5.18 ± 1.72 kg in TECH and -6.25 ± 1.95 kg in EN-TECH (p-value for time effect ≤ 0.0001). A similar pattern was observed for change in body mass index, waist circumference and percent body fat. There was a decrease in total energy intake (p = 0.0005) and percent dietary fat intake (p = 0.0172), and physical activity increased (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS Findings provide initial information on the use of technology-based interventions that include wearable devices combined with brief monthly telephone calls for weight loss in adults with obesity.

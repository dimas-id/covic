Abstract The immune spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is poorly understood. To define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in SARS, serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, complement and specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and phenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry in 95 SARS-infected patients. Results showed that interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) were continuously up-regulated during the entirety of SARS. Regulated on activation normally T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were decreased, while monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was elevated in acute patients. Immunoglobulins and complement were elevated during the first month of SARS. Both serum-positive rates and titers of specific IgM and IgG antibodies responding to SARS-CoV peaked at days 41–60 from the onset of SARS. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly in acute-phase. CD3+CD8+CD45RO+ T lymphocytes were decreased by 36.78% in the convalescent patients. Conclusion: SARS-CoV seemed to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibited cellular immunity, especially CD8+ memory T lymphocytes over time. Prolonged overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-β may play an important role in the disease.

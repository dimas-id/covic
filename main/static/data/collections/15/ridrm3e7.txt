Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) continues to be one of the most important poultry pathogens worldwide. The current commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for IBV specific antibody detection are mostly based on the whole virion, and few serological tests based on nonstructural proteins of IBV have been developed. Herein, an alternative indirect ELISA for detection of IBV antibody was developed with IBV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) produced by Escherichia coli. Using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a commercial ELISA kit as reference, we optimized the nsp5-ELISA and determined its cut-off as 0.12. The diagnostic sensitivity (DSN), specificity (DSP) and accuracy of the nsp5-ELISA were 93.11%, 95.38% and 93.33%, respectively, compared with IFA in 660 field serum samples, and were 98.11%, 95.00% and 97.62%, respectively, compared with the commercial IBV ELISA kit (IDEXX) in 126 field sera samples. Furthermore, a time course of IBV specific antibody level detected by nsp5-ELISA following IBV infection and vaccination is consistent with that of IBV antibody detected by the commercial ELISA kit. The results presented in this study indicate that nsp5-ELISA has the potential to serve as a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method for IBV antibody detection. This study is the first to report the development of an nsp-based ELISA to detect an antibody to IBV.

Abstract This trial assessed the efficacy of a commercial essential oils (Eos) product on the immune response to vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) and subsequent challenge with virulent ND virus genotype VII (vNDv genotype VII) by using the following experimental groups of broiler chickens (each group had 21 birds with three replicates in each, n=seven): NC (negative control), PC (positive control), VC (vaccinated), and VTC (vaccinated and treated with EOs). Moreover, in a trial to study the effect of EOs on vNDv genotype VII in vivo as a preventive or therapeutic measure, two additional ND-vaccinated groups were used (PRV: medicated one day before vNDv challenge for 5 days; and TTT: medicated two days post vNDv challenge for 5 days). In addition, the immune-modulatory effect of EOs on the avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis (IB) and infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccines was assessed through the serological response. The use of EOs along with administration of ND vaccines (VTC) revealed lower mortality rate (42.86%), clinical signs and post mortem lesion score (11) comparing to ND vaccines alone (VC) (52.28% mortality and score 15), in addition to lower hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (p<0.05) (6.5±0.46) and viral shedding (10 log 2.28±0.24) titres one week post challenge in comparison with of VC (8.63±0.65 and 10 log 3.29±0.72, respectively). Nevertheless, the EOs mixture (VTC) (1952±28.82) did not significantly (p>0.05) improve growth performance compared to the non-treated birds (NC and VC) (1970±19.56 and 1904±38.66). Essential oils showed an antiviral effect on vNDv in vivo (in chickens) as a preventive measure (PRV) as well as some therapeutic effect (TTT) through decreasing the viral shedding titres (loNC0), mortality rate, and severity of clinical signs and post mortem lesions, in addition to serum malondialdhyde (MDA) level. Regarding the other viruses, the EOs mixture did not improve the immune response to the AI and IB vaccines but significantly (p<0.05) increased the ELISA antibody titre for IBD virus at 28th day of age (2108±341.05). The studied EOs mixture showed an immune stimulating response to ND and IBD vaccines, antiviral effect against ND virus especially if administered before the challenge, however it did not have a growth promoting effect.

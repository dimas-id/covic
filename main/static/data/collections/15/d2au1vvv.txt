INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to the need for changes in clinical practice, with new strategies to enable integrated care for patients with headache and neuralgia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Given the high spreadability of SARS-CoV-2, new safety measures are required in such procedures as onabotulinumtoxinA infiltration and nerve blocks. RESULTS: We present a series of recommendations based on the measures implemented to prevent infection in our healthcare system. We differentiate between measures related to patients and physicians, to technique, to infrastructure (waiting room and consultation), and to healthcare management.

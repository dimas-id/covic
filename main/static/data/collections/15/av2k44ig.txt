Abstract The aim of this research is to determine the levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep quality a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nursing staff experienced before and after a SARS prevention program. The 116 subjects were recruited from nursing staff in the largest obligatory SARS designated treatment hospital in Taiwan. Using general estimating equations (GEE) statistical analysis to control possible for affecting factors, we found that the nursing staff's anxiety and depression along with sleep quality started to improve 2 weeks after the initiation of SARS prevention controls. From this research, we determined that nursing staff members were anxious, depressed, and they could not sleep well at the SARS outbreak. However, the systematic SARS prevention program improved these factors. When faced with these types of diseases, related international medical organizations should establish a comprehensive program to help medical professionals cope better.

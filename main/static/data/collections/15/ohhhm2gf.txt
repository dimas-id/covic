T-cell mediated immunotherapy is a conceptually attractive treatment option to envisage for glioma, since T lymphocytes can actively seek out neoplastic cells in the brain, and they have the potential to safely and specifically eliminate tumor. Some antigenic targets on glioma cells are already defined, and we can be optimistic that more will be discovered from progress in T-cell epitope identification and gene expression profiling of brain tumors. In parallel, advances in immunology (regional immunology, neuroimmunology, tumor immunology) now equip us to build upon the results from current immunotherapy trials in which the safety and feasibility of brain tumor immunotherapy have already been confirmed. We can now look to the next phase of immunotherapy, in which we must harness the most promising basic science advances and existing clinical expertise, and apply these to randomized clinical trials to determine the real clinical impact and applicability of these approaches for treating patients with currently incurable malignant brain tumors.

It can be judged that if the detection frequency of prevalent pathogenic viruses decreases, biosecurity has been enhanced. To monitor bovine farm biosecurity levels, one-step multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the simultaneous detection of group A rotavirus (RVA), bovine torovirus (BToV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), and bovine coronavirus (BCV) was designed, with the aim of configuring candidates for “viral pathogen indicators”. A total of 322 bovine fecal samples were collected from calves aged less than three months at 48 bovine farms in Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures. At farm A, 20 calves were selected and sampled weekly for 12 weeks (184 samples); at farm B, 10 calves were selected and sampled for five weeks (50 samples); and at the rest of the 46 farms, 88 calves were sampled once. The screening on the 358 field samples proved positive for 27 RVA, 4 BToV, 55 BEV, and 52 BCV. In the successive sampling, RVA was detected once but not continuously, whereas BEV and BCV were detected in succession for up to five weeks. The results revealed that RVA was the primary agent among the positive samples obtained from calves aged three weeks or less, while BEV was the primary among those from the older than three weeks old. They can be employed as useful viral pathogen indicators for soundly evaluating biosecurity at bovine farms.

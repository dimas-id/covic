Shellfish are known as vectors for human pathogens and despite regulation based on enteric bacteria they are still implicated in viral outbreaks. Among shellfish, oysters are the most common vector of contamination, and the pathogens most frequently involved in these outbreaks are noroviruses, responsible for acute gastroenteritis in humans. Analysis of shellfish-related outbreak data worldwide show an unexpected high proportion of NoV GI strains. Recent studies performed in vitro, in vivo and in the environment indicate that oysters are not just passive filters, but can selectively accumulate norovirus strains based on viral carbohydrate ligands shared with humans. These observations contribute to explain the GI bias observed in shellfish-related outbreaks compared to other outbreaks.

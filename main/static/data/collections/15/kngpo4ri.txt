Acute respiratory distress syndrome is considered the most severe form of acute lung injury resulting in high morbidity and mortality. This syndrome is characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemia refractory to oxygen delivery. Critical care nurses should be aware of newer treatment modalities available for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

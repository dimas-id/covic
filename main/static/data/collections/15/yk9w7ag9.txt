The incidence of pulmonary nodules and lung cancer is rising. Some of this increase in incidence is due to improved pick up by newer imaging modalities. However, the goal is to diagnose these lesion, many of which are located in the periphery, by safe and relatively non-invasive methods. This has led to the emergence of numerous techniques such as electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB). Current evidence supports a role for these techniques in the diagnostic pathway. However, numerous factor influence the diagnostic accuracy. Thus despite significant advances, more research needs to be undertaken to further improve the currently available diagnostic technologies.

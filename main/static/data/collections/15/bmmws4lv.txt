Christopher Robin had wheezles and sneezles, they bundled him into his bed. They gave him what goes with a cold in the nose, and some more for a cold in the head. They wondered if wheezles could turn into measles, if measles would turn into mumps; They examined his chest for a rash, and the rest of his body for swellings and lumps. They sent for some doctors in sneezles and wheezles, to tell them what ought to be done. All sorts and conditions of famous physicians came hurrying round at a run. They all made a note of the state of his throat, they asked if he suffered from thirst; They asked if the sneezles came after the wheezles, or if the first sneezle came first. They said, ‘If you teazle a sneezle or wheezle, a measle may easily grow. But humour or pleazle the wheezle or sneezle, the measle will certainly go.’ They expounded the reazles for sneezles and wheezles, the manner of measles when new. They said ‘If he freezles in draughts and in breezles, then PHTHEEZLES may even ensue.’ Christopher Robin got up in the morning, the sneezles had vanished away. And the look in his eye seemed to say to the sky, ‘Now, how to amuse them today?’ A. A. Milne, Now We Are Six, 1927.

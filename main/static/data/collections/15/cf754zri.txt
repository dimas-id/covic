BACKGROUND In acute ischemic stroke patients with large-artery occlusion, uncertainties remain about whether clinically important outcomes are comparable between first-line contact aspiration and stent-retriever thrombectomy, although two trials have investigated whether one strategy should be preferred over another. PURPOSE The purpose of this article is to compare the efficacy and safety of first-line contact aspiration and stent-retriever thrombectomy in stroke patients with anterior circulation large-artery occlusion. METHODS We undertook a systematic review of studies of patients treated for large-artery occlusion, with the latest devices of either strategy, within six hours of stroke onset. We determined rates of final complete reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score = 3), periprocedural complications and 90-day functional independence (defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2), and excellent outcome (defined as mRS score 0-1) after contact aspiration and after stent-retriever thrombectomy using random-effects meta-analyses. Any differential effects in rates between the two strategies were assessed using random-effects meta-regressions. RESULTS Fifteen studies (1817 patients) were included. There was no difference in rates of final complete reperfusion at the end of all endovascular procedures between contact aspiration and stent retrievers (51.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 39.3-62.9; vs 38.3%, 95% CI 28.6-48.0; pint = 0.14), 90-day functional independence (45.0%, 40.7-49.2; vs 52.4%, 47.7-57.1; pint = 0.45) and excellent outcome (32.1%, 25.7-38.5; vs 34.1%, 21.2-46.9; pint = 0.94). Rates of periprocedural complications did not differ between the two strategies. CONCLUSIONS Current data suggest no difference in efficacy and safety between first-line contact aspiration and stent-retriever thrombectomy in stroke patients with large-artery occlusion.

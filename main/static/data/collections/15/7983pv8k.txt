BACKGROUND: Transmission of respiratory viruses between staff and residents of pediatric long-term care facilities (pLTCFs) can occur. We assessed the feasibility of using text or email messages to perform surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among staff. METHODS: From December 7, 2016 to May 7, 2017, 50 staff participants from two pLTCFs received weekly text or email requests to report the presence or absence of ARI symptoms. Those who fulfilled the ARI case definition (â‰¥2 symptoms) had respiratory specimens collected to detect viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. Pre- and post-surveillance respiratory specimens were collected to assess subclinical viral shedding. RESULTS: The response rate to weekly electronic messages was 93%. Twenty-one ARIs reported from 20 (40%) participants fulfilled the case definition. Respiratory viruses were detected in 29% (5/17) of specimens collected at symptom onset (influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus [CoV] 229E, rhinovirus [RV], and dual detection of CoV OC43 and bocavirus). Four participants had positive pre-surveillance (4 RV), and six had positive post-surveillance specimens (3 RV, 2 CoV NL63 and 1 adenovirus). CONCLUSIONS: Electronic messaging to conduct ARI surveillance among pLTCF staff was feasible.

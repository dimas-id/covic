The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 is currently spreading rapidly worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is usually detected via real-time RT-PCR. However, as institutions/hospitals deal with increasing numbers of specimens, a simpler detection system is required. Here, we present an ultra-rapid, real-time RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 using the PCR1100 device. Although this tests only one specimen at any one time, the amplification period is <20 min, with maintenance of the sensitivity and specificity of conventional real-time RT-PCR performed using large instruments. The method will be very helpful if SARS-CoV-2 testing is required a few times daily, for example to confirm virus-free status prior to discharge.

BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment is an alternative choice for the treatment of distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) aneurysm, in addition to open surgery; but is still seldom considered. We performed this retrospective study to evaluate the outcome of dMCA in patients. METHODS During a period of 10 years, we were able to identify seven patients with a total of eight dMCA aneurysms that were treated endovascularly. They were five men and two women, with a mean age of 36.1 years. All of the aneurysms, including five infectious and three dissecting ones, were treated for the aneurysm and its parent artery's occlusion, using coils and/or glue. RESULTS The clinical follow-up (9-96 m, mean 36.8 m) showed that they all improved over baseline; except for one patient in whom a mild right hemiparesis remained, after the hematoma evacuation. Angiographic follow-up (7-24 m; mean: 14.6 m) showed that all of them were stable and without the need for recanalization. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicated that endovascular treatment is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of dMCA aneurysms, and should be considered when treating these aneurysms.

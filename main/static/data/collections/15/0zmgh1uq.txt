INTRODUCTION Bilateral pulmonary sequestrations are rare congenital anomalies. Despite its benign nature, the potential complications of pulmonary sequestration (PS) are significant, including recurrent pulmonary infections, hemoptysis, congestive heart failure, and malignant potential. Therefore, the main treatment is surgical excision, even for patients with asymptomatic PS. CASE We present an infant in whom an intralobar PS of the right lung and an extralobar PS of the left lung were diagnosed on prenatal screening ultrasonography. Both were found to have venous drainage into the portal vein. Surgical excision was performed via video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) at 14 months of age. CONCLUSION PS may present with unique vascular connections, including venous drainage into the portal vein. VATS resection for pulmonary sequestration is feasible and effective as an alternative to bilateral thoracotomies, in the setting of extensive preoperative planning and performance by an experienced thoracoscopic surgeon.

Thanks to their strong immunostimulating properties and safety for humans, plant viruses represent an appropriate basis for the design of novel vaccines. The coat protein of Alternanthera mosaic virus can form virus-like particles that are stable under physiological conditions and have adjuvant properties. This work presents a recombinant human rotavirus A antigen based on the epitope of rotavirus structural protein VP6, using Alternanthera mosaic virus coat protein as a carrier. An expression vector containing the gene of Alternanthera mosaic virus (MU strain) coat protein fused to the epitope of rotavirus protein VP6 was designed. Immunoblot analysis showed that the chimeric protein was effectively recognized by commercial polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus and therefore is a suitable candidate for development of a vaccine prototype. Interaction of the chimeric recombinant protein with the native coat protein of Alternanthera mosaic virus and its RNA resulted in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes that were recognized by anti-rotavirus antibodies.

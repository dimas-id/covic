BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow diversion is a relatively new strategy used to treat complex cerebral aneurysms. The optimal method for radiographic follow-up of patients treated with flow diverters has not been established. The rate and clinical implications of in-stent stenosis for these devices is unclear. We evaluate the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) for follow-up of in-stent stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 28 patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) over the course of 42 months from January 2009 to June 2012. Standard conventional cerebral angiograms were performed in all patients. TCD studies were available in 23 patients. RESULTS Angiographic and TCD results were compared and found to correlate well. CONCLUSIONS TCD is a potentially useful adjunct for evaluating in-stent stenosis after flow diversion.

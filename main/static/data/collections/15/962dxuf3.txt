The expression of sialic acids (Sia) is highly conserved in deuterostomes, i.e., from echinoderms to humans. They constitute components of cell surface glycoproteins and gangliosides, where they occupy mainly the terminal position as individual monosaccharides and, more rarely, as oligo- or polymers. They are frequently found in secreted glycoconjugates and in oligosaccharides, mainly of blood serum, milk, and mucus secretions [1, 2].

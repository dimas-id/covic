Having emerged in China, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly worldwide. Pregnant women are patients who have risk factors for severe/complicated acute respiratory viral infections and influenza; however, there have been presently only few works that highlight the specific features of the course of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, in pregnant women and newborns. The aim of the review was to search for and analyze publications considering the characteristics of the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborns. Pregnancy and childbirth do not seem to aggravate the course of COVID-19; on the contrary, the latter can deteriorate the course of pregnancy: it can cause respiratory distress syndrome and lead to premature birth and miscarriage. There is no current evidence for mother-to-fetus placental transmission of COVID-19 and mother-to-baby transmission during breastfeeding. A large number of interim guidelines for the management of pregnant women with COVID-19 have been published.

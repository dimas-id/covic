Abstract Risk factors associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outcome were established by analyses of WHO data from September 23, 2012 to 18 June 2018. Of the 2220 reported cases, 1408 cases, including 451 MERS-CoV deaths, were analyzed. The case fatality rate was 32% (95% CI: 29.4–34.5). Compared to MERS patients ≤30 years old, those with >30 years had the adjusted odds ratio estimate for death of 2.38 [95% CI: 1.75–3.22]. This index was 1.43 [95% CI: 1.06–1.92] for Saudi patients in comparison to non-Saudi; 1.76 [95% CI: 1.39–2.22] for patient with comorbidity in comparison to those without comorbidity; 0.58 [95% CI: 0.44–0.75] for those who had close contact to a camel in the past 14 days and 0.42 [95% CI: 0.31–0.57] for patients with >14 days with onset of signs and hospital admission compared to patients with ≤14 days.

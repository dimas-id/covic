AIM We used near-infrared spectrophotometry to assess the initial and final abdominal and cerebral saturations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to determine if there is a correlation between increase in these saturation values and return of spontaneous circulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 34 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without witnesses brought to our emergency department. Abdominal and cerebral saturations were measured using near-infrared spectrophotometry from the start of CPR. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for a maximum of 30 minutes. The effect of abdominal saturations in patients with or without spontaneous circulation restored through CPR was then assessed. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (17 males + females) with a mean age of 63.06 Â± 11.66 years were included in the study. A significant correlation was determined between increase in abdominal saturations measured at the start and end of CPR and the return of spontaneous circulation (P < .001). A good positive correlation was also identified between abdominal saturation and return of spontaneous circulation. CONCLUSION Patients with increased abdominal and cerebral saturation values have a higher survival rate after appropriate CPR. This noninvasive measurement system and monitoring of patients during CPR may be a good method of predicting return of spontaneous circulation and assessing abdominal perfusion.

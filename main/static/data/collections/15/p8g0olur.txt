To illustrate a new technological advance in the standard drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) model, a new machine was used, the Experimental 5 Video Stream System (5VsEs), which is capable of simultaneously visualizing all the decisional parameters on a single monitor, and recording and storing them in a single uneditable video. The DISE procedure was performed on 48 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or snoring patients. The parameters simultaneously recorded on a single monitor are (1) the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol (through the target controlled infusion (TCI) pump monitor), (2) the endoscopic upper airway view, (3) the polygraphic pattern, and (4) the level of sedation (through the bispectral index (BIS) value). In parallel to the BIS recording, the middle latency auditory evoked potential (MLAEP) was also recorded and provided. Recorded videos from the 5VsEs machine were re-evaluated six months later by the same clinician and a second clinician to evaluate the concordance of the therapeutic indications between the two. After the six-month period, the same operator confirmed all their clinical decisions for 45 out of 48 videos. Three videos were no longer evaluable for technical reasons, so were excluded from further analysis. The comparison between the two operators showed a complete adherence in 98% of cases. The 5VsEs machine provides a multiparametric evaluation setting, defined as an "all in one glance" strategy, which allows a faster and more effective interpretation of all the simultaneous parameters during the DISE procedure, improving the diagnostic accuracy, and providing a more accurate post-analysis, as well as legal and research advantages.

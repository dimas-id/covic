The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), elicited by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is a pandemic public health emergency of global concern. Other than the profound severe pulmonary damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to a series of cardiovascular abnormalities, including myocardial injury, myocarditis and pericarditis, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and coagulation abnormalities. Meanwhile, COVID-19 patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases are often at a much higher risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Up-to-date, a number of mechanisms have been postulated for COVID-19-associated cardiovascular damage including SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activation, cytokine storm, hypoxemia, stress and cardiotoxicity of antiviral drugs. In this context, special attention should be given towards COVID-19 patients with concurrent cardiovascular diseases, and special cardiovascular attention is warranted for treatment of COVID-19.

Non-influenza respiratory virus infections are common worldwide and contribute to morbidity and mortality in all age groups. The recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been associated with rapidly progressive pneumonia and high mortality rate. Adenovirus 14 has been increasingly recognized in severe acute respiratory illness in both military and civilian individuals. Rhinovirus C and human bocavirus type 1 have been commonly detected in infants and young children with respiratory tract infection and studies have shown a positive correlation between respiratory illness and high viral loads, mono-infection, viremia, and/or serologically-confirmed primary infection.

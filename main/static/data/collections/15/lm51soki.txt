This paper describes the use in routine diagnosis of virological kit, which was designed to identify the 15 most common respiratory viruses in clinical specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirates, swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage. It is a one-step multiplex RT-PCR system for the detection of influenza virus type A and type B, human respiratory syncytial virus type A, B; human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43, human parainfluenza type 1, 2, 3, human rhinovirus type A, B, human enterovirus, and bocavirus 1, 2, 3, 4. The article presents research conducted on the basis of swabs collected from patients who came to the Ear, Nose, and Throat Emergency Care Unit at the Department of Otolaryngology, Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, in February 2013. Due to the nature of work in an laryngological emergency ward, the material was collected only from those patients who reported problems associated with rhinitis or any dysfunction of the upper respiratory tract. The study shows that patients who came to seek laryngological assistance were usually infected with viruses having affinity for the airway epithelium.

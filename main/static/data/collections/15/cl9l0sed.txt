We read with great interest the recent article by Beauverd et al.1 on an interesting case of severe hemolysis in a patient with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine. The authors concluded that COVID-19 infection was possibly the initial trigger for hemolysis. However, the article also suggested that hydroxychloroquine possibly worsened the hemolysis, and further cautioned the use of hydroxychloroquine in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient patients. We would like to comment on the authors' attribution of accentuated hemolysis to the use of hydroxychloroquine.

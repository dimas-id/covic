Previously we reported that a lethal strain of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infects the brain following ocular inoculation of mice. We now demonstrate that HSV-2 mediates an unusual intracellular sequestering of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. With use of an RNase protection assay, we observed a selective inhibition of IFN-Î³ and IL-6 gene transcription in brains of mice infected with HSV-2. It is likely that the inhibition of cytokine gene expression was mediated through a failure to activate CD4(+) lymphocytes. These data suggest that the infecting herpesvirus can influence the profile of intracerebrally produced cytokines, which in turn may determine the outcome of the infection.

Globalization, ease of travel, potential for spread of epidemics as well as widening health disparities between developed and resource-limited countries have made the need to conduct clinical research internationally a necessity. This reality calls for understanding the challenges and obstacles that can impact project outcome that must be overcome, to acquire new knowledge and disseminate evidence-based interventions to reduce global health disparities and inequities. These challenges include lack of an in-country skilled workforce, deficient infrastructure for research, inefficient health care system to support clinical research, poor data management, as well as inadequately structured institutional ethics boards and poor regulatory oversight. Investment in human capital development through training of research personnel, mentoring, increased support for research administration, engaging leaders in a community-engaged research partnership model prior to project initiation and wise use of technology for effective communication will promote robust clinical research in regions of the world where clinical research productivity historically has been exceedingly low.

This unit introduces the basic principles and practice of sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation for the study of reversible protein interactions, such as the characterization of self-association, heterogeneous association, multi-protein complexes, binding stoichiometry, and the determination of association constants. The analytical tools described include sedimentation coefficient and molar mass distributions, multi-signal sedimentation coefficient distributions, Gilbert-Jenkins theory, different forms of isotherms, and global Lamm equation modeling. Concepts for the experimental design are discussed, and a detailed step-by-step protocol guiding the reader through the experiment and the data analysis is available as an Internet resource.

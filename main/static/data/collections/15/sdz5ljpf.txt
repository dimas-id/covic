Acute phase proteins (APP) were first identified in the early 1900s as early reactants to infectious disease. They are now understood to be an integral part of the acute phase response (APR) which is the cornerstone of innate immunity. APP have been shown to be valuable biomarkers as increases can occur with inflammation, infection, neoplasia, stress, and trauma. All animals—from fish to mammals—have demonstrable APP, but the type of major APP differs by species. While the primary application of these proteins in a clinical setting is prognostication, studies in animals have demonstrated relevance to diagnosis and detection and monitoring for subclinical disease. APP have been well documented in laboratory, companion, and large animals. With the advent of standardized and automated assays, these biomarkers are available for use in all fields of veterinary medicine as well as basic and clinical research.

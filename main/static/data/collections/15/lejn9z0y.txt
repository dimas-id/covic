Different agent-based models have been developed to estimate the spread progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate different control strategies to control outbreak of the infectious disease. While there are several estimation methods for the disease-specific parameters of COVID-19, they have been used for aggregate level models such as SIR and not for agent-based models. We propose a mathematical structure to determine parameter values of agent-based models considering the mutual effects of parameters. Then, we assess the extent to which different control strategies can intervene the transmission of COVID-19. Accordingly, we consider scenarios of easing social distancing restrictions, opening businesses, speed of enforcing control strategies and quarantining family members of isolated cases on the disease progression. We find the social distancing compliance level in the Sydney greater metropolitan area to be around 85%. Then we elaborate on consequences of easing the compliance level in the disease suppression. We also show that tight social distancing levels should be considered when the restrictions on businesses and activity participations are easing.

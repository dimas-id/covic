In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated direct, continuous monitoring of plasma nitrite as an indicator of cerebral ischemia following clot embolization of rabbits via an indwelling carotid catheter. Two groups of rabbits were studied to compare the effects of embolization on nitrite levels. In the control group, blood was continuously obtained from a jugular venous catheter. The blood was immediately passed through an ultrafiltration filter; the filtrate was chemically reduced to convert free nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) and then measured using a NO-specific electrode. In the embolized group, after a baseline nitrite level was achieved, blood clots were injected into the brain via the carotid artery catheter, and then nitrite levels were continuously measured from jugular venous blood. The stroke group showed a significantly greater increase in nitrite as compared to controls (p=0.017). Using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) method, results reached statistical significance (p<0.05) within 3 min of embolization. In embolized rabbits, NO(2) levels increased 424Â±256% compared to baseline. This study shows that nitrite can be measured immediately following a stroke and that our system measures nitrite independent of the extent of the stroke. This study provides evidence for the feasibility of using nitrite as a marker of ischemic stroke.

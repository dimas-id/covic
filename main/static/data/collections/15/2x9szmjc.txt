World Health Organization declared on 11 March, COVID 19 as a pandemic infection that has spread rapidly across the globe. Covid-19 currently has no known treatment or a vaccine. Oral health professionals are at risk of developing COVID 19 infection as they come into close contact with patients and accompanying relatives who may be carrying the virus. Since January 2020, and by the end of April this year, more than 150 medical doctors in Italy and over 100 National Health Service workers in the UK have died in the COVID-19 crisis. While the transmission of COVID 19 via human ex-haled droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is a significant risk particularly for dental practices. The objective of this brief review is to highlight ways how dental manpower could protect from the spread of disease.

Patients with COVID-19 may experience multiple conditions (e.g., fever, hyperventilation, anorexia, gastroenteritis, acid-base disorder) that may cause electrolyte imbalances. Hypokalemia is a concerning electrolyte disorder that may increase the susceptibility to various kinds of arrhythmia. This study aimed to estimate prevalence, risk factors and outcome of hypokalemia in a cohort of non-critically ill patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 290 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at the tertiary teaching hospital of Modena, Italy. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L) was detected in 119 patients (41%). The decrease of serum potassium level was of mild entity (3-3.4 mEq/L) and occurred in association with hypocalcemia (P=0.001) and lower level of serum magnesium (P=0.028) compared to normokaliemic patients. Urine K: creatinine ratio, measured in a small subset of patients (n=45; 36.1%), showed an increase of urinary potassium excretion in the majority of the cases (95.5%). Causes of kaliuria were diuretic therapy (53.4%) and corticosteroids (23.3%). In the remaining patients, urinary potassium loss was associated with normal serum magnesium, low sodium excretion (FENa< 1%) and metabolic alkalosis. Risk factors for hypokalemia were female gender (P=0.002; HR 0.41, 95%CI 0.23-0.73) and diuretic therapy (P=0.027; HR 1.94, 95%CI 1.08-3.48). Hypokalemia, adjusted for sex, age and SOFA score, resulted not associated with ICU admission (P=0.131, 95% CI 0.228-1.212) and in-hospital mortality (P=0.474; 95% CI 0,170-1,324) in our cohort of patients. Hypokalemia is a frequent disorder in COVID-19 patients and urinary potassium loss may be the main cause of hypokalemia. The disorder was mild in the majority of the patients and was unrelated to poor outcomes. Nevertheless, hypokalemic patients required potassium supplements to dampen the risk of arrhythmias.

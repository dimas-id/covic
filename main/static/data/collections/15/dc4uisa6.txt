Context: The pandemic of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, has created an unprecedented global health burden. Objective: To investigate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes. Design: All suspected cases of pregnant women with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted into one center of Wuhan from Jan 20, 2020 to March 19, 2020 were included. Detailed clinical data of those pregnancies with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Twenty-seven laboratory or clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection pregnant women (4 early pregnancies included) and 24 neonates born to the 23 late pregnant mothers were analyzed. On admission, 46.2% (13/27) of the patients had symptoms, including fever (11/27), cough (9/27) and vomiting (1/27). Decreased total lymphocytes count was observed in 81.6% (22/27) patients. Twenty-six patients showed typical viral pneumonia by chest computed tomography (CT) scan, while one patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection showed no abnormality on chest CT. One mother developed severe pneumonia three days after her delivery. No maternal and perinatal death occurred. Moreover, one early preterm newborn, born to a mother with complication of premature rupture of fetal membranes, highly suspected with SARS-CoV-2 infection, was SARS-CoV-2 negative after repeated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. Statistical difference was observed between the groups of early pregnant and late pregnant women with COVID-19 in the occurrence of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: No major complication were reported among the studied cohort, though one serious case and one perinatal infection were observed. Much effort should be done to reduce the pathogenic effect of COVID-19 infection in pregnancies.

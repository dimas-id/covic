The review summarizes data on DNA/RNA aptamers, a novel class of molecular recognition elements. Special attention is paid to the aptamers to proteins involved into pathogenesis of wide spread human diseases. These include aptamers to serine proteases, cytokines, influenza viral proteins, immune deficiency virus protein and nucleic acid binding proteins. High affinity and specific binding of aptamers to particular protein targets make them attractive as direct protein inhibitors. They can inhibit pathogenic proteins and data presented here demonstrate that the idea that nucleic acid aptamers can regulate (inhibit) activity of protein targets has been transformed from the stage of basic developments into the stage of realization of practical tasks.

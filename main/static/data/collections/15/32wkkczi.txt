Helicobacter pylori (HP) occurs in 50% of people worldwide with higher rates reported in the bariatric population. HP has been associated with adverse outcomes following bariatric surgery; however, its true impact has not yet been defined. We aimed to systematically review the effect of HP on bariatric surgery outcomes. A comprehensive literature review was conducted yielding seven studies with 255,435 patients. Meta-analysis found comparable rates of bleeding, leak, hospital length of stay, and weight loss between HP-positive and HP-negative patients. HP was, however, found to be the largest independent predictor of marginal ulceration in those undergoing RYGB, with a tenfold increase versus HP-negative patients. Overall, HP is associated with increased marginal ulceration rates, but has little impact on other bariatric surgery outcomes.

INTRODUCTION Thymosin α 1 (Tα1) is a peptidic biological response modifier, which plays a significant role in activating and regulating various cells of the immune system. For the above-mentioned activities it is expected to exert a clinical benefit in the treatment of diseases where the immune system is altered. AREAS COVERED Several clinical trials have been carried out with Tα1 for treatment or prevention of many different infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C, sepsis and Aspergillosis in bone marrow-transplanted patients. Data available on the use of Tα1 in infectious disease as well as a vaccine enhancer will be reviewed to possibly generate new working hypothesis. EXPERT OPINION Tα1 has been widely used in thousands of patients. Nevertheless, there are some issues that have not yet been properly addressed (i.e., dose, schedule, combination treatments, end-points to be evaluated in clinical trials). In the most recent clinical trials Tα1 has been used at higher doses than those commonly used in the past showing a direct proportionality between the dose and the effect. The safety profile of Tα1 is excellent and it is virtually devoid of toxicity.

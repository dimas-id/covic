Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major worldwide pathogen for which there is still no effective vaccine or antiviral treatment available, and immunoprophylaxis with RSV-specific antibodies (e.g., palivizumab) is used in limited clinical settings. In this review, we discuss virusâ€“host interactions relevant to RSV pathobiology and how advances in cell and systems biology have accelerated knowledge in this area. We also highlight recent advances in understanding the relationship between RSV bronchiolitis and sequelae of recurrent wheezing and asthma, new findings into an intriguing interaction between RSV and air pollution, and exciting developments toward the goal of realizing a safe and effective RSV vaccine.

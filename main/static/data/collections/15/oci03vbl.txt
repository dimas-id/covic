The treatment of the severely injured is, just as the injury severity and combinations, often highly complex and leaves little leeway for delay, dissent or even error. In order to reduce this to a minimum, trained emergency room teams in addition to optimal technical and structural prerequisites are necessary. This must function in an interdisciplinary fashion according to fixed consensus algorithms which are known to all team members and have been agreed by all participants. The White Paper on treatment of the severely injured of the German Society of Trauma Surgery (DGU) and the recently published S3 guidelines offer evidence-based recommendations on the structural, technical, organizational and personnel prerequisites.

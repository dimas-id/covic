IMPORTANCE TO THE FIELD Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic opioid approved in the USA for the treatment and relief of moderate to severe pain and postoperative pain. However, the compound is short-acting, and there is no extended-release formulation clinically available. A previous hydromorphone extended-release formulation that successfully came to market was subsequently withdrawn on account of safety concerns. Clinical need supports the presence of an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Medline articles showing from a search of 'hydromorphone and OROS' were included in the review. In addition, searches were done relating to published data regarding regulatory affairs dealing with this specific topic. Physicians prescribing information for hydromorphone was also reviewed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN The reader will gain an increased understanding of the use of an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone using the OROS technology and will appreciate that this technology has safety advantages compared with previous extended-release formulations of hydromorphone. TAKE HOME MESSAGE Hydromorphone-OROS is an effective agent for the long-acting control of pain and a welcome addition to other available opioid formulations.

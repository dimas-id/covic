BACKGROUND Marginal ulceration at the gastrojejunostomy is a serious complication after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGB) and occurs in 1%-16% of patients. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might lower the occurrence of these ulcers. OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of 6 months prophylactic usage of PPIs on the development of marginal ulceration and compare this with a historic patient control group. SETTING A single institution cohort at a bariatric center of excellence, The Sint Lucas Andreas Zienkenhuis, Amsterdam METHODS A consecutive database of patients who underwent LRYGB from November 2007 to September 2012 in a single institution was retrospectively reviewed. From August 2011, patients received a standard dose of pantozol 40 mg once daily directly postoperatively for 6 months. No standard PPI prophylaxis was administered before August 2011, and the patients not using PPIs in this historic cohort served as the control group. RESULTS A total of 610 patients underwent LRYGB, of which 128 patients (21.0%) underwent revisional surgery. Postoperative PPIs were administered in the intervention group of 337 patients, compared with the historic control group consisting of 273 patients. Six patients (1.2%) who received postoperative PPIs versus 20 patients (7.3 %) in the historic control group developed marginal ulceration (P = .001). Patients using proton pump inhibitors developed fewer gastrointestinal complaints postoperatively (P< .001). CONCLUSIONS Routine usage of PPIs reduced the occurrence of marginal ulceration after LRYGB.

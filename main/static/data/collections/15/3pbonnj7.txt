Porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is the main causative agent of porcine coronavirus-associated disease, which is characterized by encephalomyelitis and involves the central nervous system. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of brain injury caused by PHEV. To gain insight into the interaction between the virus and host cells, changes in global gene expression in the cerebral cortex of PHEV- or mock-infected mice were investigated using DNA microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. The results of the microarray analysis showed that 365 genes on day 3 post-infection (p.i.) and 781 genes on day 5 p.i. were differentially expressed in response to PHEV infection in the cerebral cortex. The upregulated genes were mainly involved in immune system processes, antigen processing and presentation, the Jak-STAT signalling pathway, the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway, Toll-like receptor signalling and apoptosis-related proteases. Significantly downregulated genes were mainly involved in nervous-system development, synaptic transmission, neuron-projection development, the transmission of nerve impulses and negative regulation of glial cell differentiation. The differential expression of these genes suggests a strong antiviral host response, but may also contribute to the pathogenesis of PHEV resulting in encephalomyelitis.

The optimal treatment for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)/COVID-19 is unknown.1 We report the case of a previously fit 27-year-old male who presented with a 3-day history of fever (>39 C), swollen, erythematous elbows and no respiratory symptoms. His white blood count (WBC) was 187Ã—109 /L and bone marrow (Figure 1A & 1C) examination revealed normal karyotype AML with a fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD), wild-type NPM1 and no additional mutations on a next-generation sequencing panel.

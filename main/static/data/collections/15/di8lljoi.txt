Viruses can generate molecular mimicry phenomena within their hosts. Why shouldsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not be considered one of these?Information in this short review suggests that it might be so and, thus, encourages research aimingat testing this possibility. We propose, as a working hypothesis, that the virus induces antibodiesand that some of them crossreact with host's antigens, thus eliciting autoimmune phenomena withdevasting consequences in various tissues and organs. If confirmed, by in vitro and in vivo tests,this could drive researchers to find effective treatments against the virus.

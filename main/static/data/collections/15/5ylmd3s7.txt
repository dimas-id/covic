This article has concentrated on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of viral infections of the hand. Some of these entities are quite common, but are often misdiagnosed. Herpes simplex appears to be the most common viral infection involving the hand. These and other viral infections can have much graver consequences in immunosuppressed patients. Recurrent episodes are common in herpetic and other viral infections. Health care workers have long been at risk, but improved compliance with prophylactic measures would seem to be decreasing the number of cases in this population. A plea has been made to disregard the term herpetic whitlow because it is an inaccurate description of the lesion and implies that an inappropriate type of treatment is required. Bacterial whitlows or felons require incision and drainage of the deep pulp space. Herpetic infections in this area do not. Less common infections such as cowpox, pseudocowpox (milkers nodules), ORF, and coxsackievirus (HFMD) infection of the hand have been brought to the attention of the reader. The bothersome warts caused by the human papillomavirus have been described and the systemic ramifications of hand-to-hand contact and hand injury causing more serious viral problems has been mentioned. A common thread in the care of the patient with these types of diseases is that an adequate history and physical remain invaluable in arriving at the correct diagnosis. With this correct diagnosis all of us, as physicians, then can easily abide by one of our basic principles Primum non nocere, "Let me help--but first let me do no harm."

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is now considered to be one of the most important diseases in countries with intensive swine industries. The two major membrane-associated proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), GP5 and M (encoded by ORF5 and ORF6 genes, respectively), are associated as disulfide-linked heterodimers (GP5/M) in the virus particle. In this study, we designed 5 of the small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the GP5 and M gene of PRRSV respectively, and investigated their inhibition to the production of PRRSV. The highest activity displayed in shRNAs of the ORF6e sequence (nts 261-279), which the inhibition rate reached was 99.09%. The result suggests that RNAi technology might serve as a potential molecular strategy for PRRSV therapy. Furthermore, the transgenic Marc-145 cell line of piggyBac transposon-derived targeting shRNA interference against PRRS virus was established. It presented stable inhibition to the replication and amplification of PRRS. The work implied that shRNAs targeting the GP5 and M gene of PRRSV may be used as potential RNA vaccines in vivo, and supplied the screening methods of transformed pig embryonic fibroblast which are prerequisite for the disease-resistant transgenic pigs to PRRS.

Depth of anesthesia can be indirectly measured by Bispectral Index (BIS), therefore it is possible to administer propofol in a closed loop to maintain the optimal level of anesthesia while minimizing the dose to improve the postanesthesia recovery. High-Order Sliding-Mode control can be used to individualize drug dosing. In this study, the controller is tested with four in silico patients.

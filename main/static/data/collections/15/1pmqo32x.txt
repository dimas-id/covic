OBJECTIVE To review the experience of patients presenting with clinical manifestations of tropical sprue and assess their diagnosis and management, response to treatment and follow up. METHODS This single center retrospective descriptive study was done at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad from January 1994 to January 2003. All patients who presented with diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss and anemia and who proved to have partial villous atrophy on intestinal biopsy and had responded to treatment with antibiotic and folic acid,were included in this review. RESULTS A total of 42 patients were encountered during these years. There were 31 (74.0%) males and 11 (26%) females. The age ranged from 17-66 years. All patients presented with diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia and had megaloblastic anemia. In all patients, a distal duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy. All were treated with tetracycline 1 g per day and folic acid 5 mg per day and responded to treatment within 4 weeks. Total treatment lasted 3 months and resulted in complete resolution of symptoms and gain of weight. The follow up lasted for a mean of 5 years and no relapses were noted. CONCLUSION Tropical sprue presents with diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, and megaloblastic anemia. The partial villous atrophy has been a constant finding. The response to treatment to tetracycline and folic acid has been uniformly successful.

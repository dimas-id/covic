This study described the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and pointed out the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes. Retrospective data from 42 death cases due to SARS-CoV-2 infection at Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China was analyzed. Demographics, clinical detection, laboratory findings, and treatments of the deceased were collected and analyzed. The average time between onset of symptoms and admission to the hospitals was 11 Â± 5 days of hospitalization. Among the deceased, 60% were with co-morbidities. All of them were having fever and bilateral pneumonia on computed tomography, abnormal infection-related biomarkers, and renal impairment. Abnormal blood coagulation parameters that appeared in more than half of them, were consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation. All of the patients were treated in the ICU. Based on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infection carries a risk of mortality, we may infer a few older male patients with underlying comorbidities are likely to have the increased risk. Impaired consciousness level, markers of renal impairment and coagulation abnormalities may be poor prognostic factors.

Viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common causes of mild illness in immunocompetent children and adults, with occasional significant morbidity or mortality in the very young, very old or infirm. However, recipients of solid organ transplants (SOT) or haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are at markedly increased risk for significant morbidity or mortality from these infections. The infections are generally acquired by transmission of large respiratory droplets and can be nosocomial in origin with many documented outbreaks on specialised transplant units. Typically, the infections begin as upper RTIs, with cough or rhinorrhoea predominating. Many will resolve at this stage, but more immunocompromised patients, typically closer in time to their SOT or HSCT, may develop progressive infection to lower RTI or pneumonia. The most common RTI pathogens are influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses. Newer polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic strategies are more sensitive than previous assays, and allow rapid and accurate diagnoses of these infections. These newer assays may also detect emerging pathogens of significance, one of which is human metapneumovirus. While diagnostic techniques have advanced significantly in the past decade, well established and effective specific treatments for these infections remain elusive. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of the common viral RTIs in SOT or HSCT recipients are reviewed, and recommendations presented based on a thorough review of recent literature.

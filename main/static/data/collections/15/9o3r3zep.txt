Blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVAs) has been demonstrated to increase in healthy humans during a variety of conditions; however, whether or not this blood flow represents a source of venous admixture (Q̇ VA /Q̇T) that impairs pulmonary gas exchange efficiency (i.e. increases the alveolar-to-arterial PO2 difference (A-aDO2)) remains controversial and unknown. We hypothesized that blood flow through IPAVAs does provide a source of Q̇ VA /Q̇T. To test this, blood flow through IPAVAs was increased in healthy humans at rest breathing room air and 40% O2: (1) during intravenous adrenaline (epinephrine) infusion at 320 ng kg(-1) min(-1) (320 ADR), and (2) with vagal blockade (2 mg atropine), before and during intravenous adrenaline infusion at 80 ng kg(-1) min(-1) (ATR + 80 ADR). When breathing room air the A-aDO2 increased by 6 ± 2 mmHg during 320 ADR and by 5 ± 2 mmHg during ATR + 80 ADR, and the change in calculated Q̇ VA /Q̇T was +2% in both conditions. When breathing 40% O2, which minimizes contributions from diffusion limitation and alveolar ventilation-to-perfusion inequality, the A-aDO2 increased by 12 ± 7 mmHg during 320 ADR, and by 9 ± 6 mmHg during ATR + 80 ADR, and the change in calculated Q̇ VA /Q̇T was +2% in both conditions. During 320 ADR cardiac output (Q̇T) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) were significantly increased; however, during ATR + 80 ADR only Q̇T was significantly increased, yet blood flow through IPAVAs as detected with saline contrast echocardiography was not different between conditions. Accordingly, we suggest that blood flow through IPAVAs provides a source of intrapulmonary shunt, and is mediated primarily by increases in Q̇T rather than PASP.

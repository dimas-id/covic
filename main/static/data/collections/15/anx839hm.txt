INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is associated with a moderate risk of hemorrhagic complications (HC). There is a debate regarding the relationship between HC and high blood pressure in postoperative period. AIM The aim is to clarify whether the postoperative blood pressure is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Medical records of 522 patients were reviewed. A case-control study of postoperative blood pressure was undertaken in patients with bleeding after LSG and matched controls. Patients who required surgical revision, due to the hemorrhagic complications within 72 hours, were identified as the cases. Controls were matched (1:1) with cases by age (±1 year), gender (female versus male), staple line reinforcement (running suture versus haemostatic clips) and surgeon's experience (>50 or <50 LSG procedures per year). 12-hour postoperative blood pressure was recorded. RESULTS 17 patients after LSG with HC in postoperative period were matched with 17 controls. Patients who experienced hemorrhagic complications after LSG had non statistically significant decreased mean systolic blood pressure (mmHg) in 12 hours observation (130.7 ± 12.9 versus 139.1 ± 10.8); p = 0.15; mean difference - 11.6 (95% CI -29.5 - 6.1). Mean 12 hour diastolic pressure was also comparable. The detailed analysis of controls revealed a significantly higher systolic blood pressure measurements in 5th and 11th hour postoperatively, as well as higher diastolic blood pressure in 12th hour postoperatively. However, the differences were not clinically significant. CONCLUSION Compared with closely matched control subjects, patients with HC after LSG have decreased systolic blood pressure without clinical significance.

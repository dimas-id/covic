In this article, the H∞ scaled consensus control problem for multiagent systems in the presence of external disturbances and mixed time delays in both input and Lipschitz nonlinearity is investigated. First, a state observer is introduced for each agent based on the output information of the agent. Then, a scaled consensus protocol is proposed via a truncated predictor output-feedback method, which can deal with the input delay. The integral terms with the mixed time delays that are contained in the transformed systems are analyzed by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals method, and sufficient conditions are obtained to achieve scaled consensus with guaranteed H∞ performance. An iterative procedure is utilized to calculate the linear matrix inequality. By this, the feedback gain and observer gain are then designed. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

INTRODUCTION Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) often face the challenge of how to power their positive airway pressure (PAP) devices when alternating current power supplies are not available in remote areas with lack of electricity or frequent power outages. This article elucidates portable power supply options for PAP devices with the aim to increase alternative power source awareness among medical providers. METHODS A search of scientific databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library) was carried out on the topic of alternative portable power supply options for treatment of OSA. RESULTS Scientific databases listed above yielded only limited results. Most articles were found via Google search. These articles were reviewed for alternative power supply options for OSA patients when alternating current is not available. The power supply options in this article include lead-acid batteries (starter, marine and deep-cycle batteries), lithium ion batteries, solar kits, battery packs, backup power systems, portable generators, and travel-size PAP devices. CONCLUSIONS There are several options to power PAP devices with direct current when alternating current is not available. Knowledgeable primary care physicians especially in rural and remote areas can help OSA patients improve PAP compliance in order to mitigate morbidity and long-term complications of OSA.

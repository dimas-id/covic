A novel strain of coronavirus, namely, COVID-19 has been identified in Wuhan city of China in December 2019. There are no specific therapies available and investigations regarding the treatment of the COVID-19 are still lacking. This prompted us to perform a preliminary in silico study on the COVID-19 protease with anti-malarial compounds in the search of potential inhibitor. We have calculated log P and log S values in addition to molecular docking and PASS predictions. Among the seven studied compounds, mepacrine appears as the potential inhibitor of the COVID-19 followed by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and phomarin. Therefore, these anti-malarial drugs may be potential drug candidate for the treatment of this novel coronavirus. A detailed analysis on these inhibitors is currently in progress and clinical studies are invited to investigate their potential medicinal use for the COVID-19.

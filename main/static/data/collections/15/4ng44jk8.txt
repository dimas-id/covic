The Swedish strategy for dealing with covid-19 has been criticized for not accounting for difficulties of conducting voluntary social distancing in settings with household overcrowding, dependence on public transport and large proportion of service sector workers In such neighbourhoods there is typically a larger proportion of immigrants We compared all-cause-mortality data in Sweden by country of origin from 2020 and 2016-2019 and found large disparities The number of deaths among persons born in countries from which many refugees have migrated to Sweden in the last decades was 220% higher in March-May 2020 compared to the mean in 2016-2019 In contrast, there was no increased mortality among persons aged 40-64 years and a 19% increased number of deaths of those aged above 65 years born in Sweden, EU or North America during these three months These observations further illustrate the need for a dedicated and more diverse strategy in dealing with the covid-19 pandemic

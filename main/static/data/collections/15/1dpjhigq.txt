When I was interviewing for chair positions 3 years ago, a few chair colleagues across the country warned me this job was a lonely one. I understood as a chair you cannot maintain work friendships like those I once cherished, that people see and treat you differently because you are their boss, that due to the importance of privacy conversations are sometimes limited to maintain confidentiality, and that you are ultimately responsible for factors that may be beyond your control. My first two years as chair in a new organization, in a new city, were filled with extensive listening, learning, challenges, and accomplishments: starting a new academic department at a renowned institution, hiring 47 new faculty members and 37 administrative staff, adding a fourth clinical site, expanding the educational and research missions. Then, just a few weeks after what then felt like a monumental change, the implementation of a new electronic health record, COVID-19 emerged.

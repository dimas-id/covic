Viruses have evolved complex and dynamic interactions with their host cell. In recent years, we have gained insight into the expanding roles for cellular lipids in the viral life cycle. In particular, viruses target lipid signaling, synthesis, and metabolism to remodel their host cells into an environment that is optimal for their replication. This review highlights examples from different viruses that illustrate the importance of these diverse virus-lipid interactions.

Early after infection, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) alters the immune system by polyclonally activating B lymphocytes, which leads to IgG2a-restricted hypergammaglobulinaemia, and by suppressing the secretion of Th2 cytokines. Considering that these alterations may involve cells of the innate immune system and cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), we analysed the effect of LDV on natural killer (NK) cells. Within a few days of infection, a strong and transient NK cell activation, characterized by enhanced IFN-gamma message expression and cytolysis, was observed. LDV triggered a large increase in serum IFN-gamma levels. Because NK cells and IFN-gamma may participate in the defence against virus infection, we analysed their possible role in the control of LDV titres with a new agglutination assay. Our results indicate that neither the activation of NK cells nor the IFN-gamma secretion affect the early and rapid virus replication that follows LDV inoculation.

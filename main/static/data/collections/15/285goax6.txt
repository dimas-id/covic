Zoonotic microbes have historically been, and continue to emerge as, threats to human health. The recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in bird populations and the appearance of some human infections have increased the concern of a possible new influenza pandemic, which highlights the need for broad-spectrum detection methods for rapidly identifying the spread or outbreak of all variants of avian influenza virus. In this study, we demonstrate that high-density resequencing pathogen microarrays (RPM) can be such a tool. The results from 37 influenza virus isolates show that the RPM platform is an effective means for detecting and subtyping influenza virus, while simultaneously providing sequence information for strain resolution, pathogenicity, and drug resistance without additional analysis. This study establishes that the RPM platform is a broad-spectrum pathogen detection and surveillance tool for monitoring the circulation of prevalent influenza viruses in the poultry industry and in wild birds or incidental exposures and infections in humans.

We report on the results of a comprehensive search for Cepheid variable stars in the fields photometrically monitored by the OGLE Galaxy Variability Survey. We identify 742 Cepheids not included in the first release of the OGLE Collection of Galactic Cepheids and reclassify several dozen previously published variables. The upgraded collection comprises 1974 classical, 1625 type II, and 119 anomalous Cepheids located in the area of about 3000 square degrees covering the disk and bulge of the Milky Way. We present the most interesting objects in our sample: an isolated group of long-period double-mode classical Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental mode and first overtone, the first known Galactic double-mode Cepheid with the second and third overtone excited, double-mode type II Cepheids, candidates for single-mode first-overtone BL Her stars, and Cepheids showing simultaneous eclipsing variability. We also discuss type II and anomalous Cepheids that are potential members of globular clusters.

BACKGROUND N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) remains the standard embolic agent for spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) treatment. Treatment of SDAVF with ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx, ev3-Covidien, Irvine CA, USA) is currently not well established. Although several cases have reported the use of Onyx to embolize an intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula using a dual-lumen microballoon catheter, Onyx embolization of an SDAVF using a dual-lumen microballoon catheter has not been reported. CASE DESCRIPTION We treated a 57-year-old man with an SDAVF using a dual-lumen microballoon catheter and buddy wire technique to perform transarterial Onyx embolization via the left sixth intercostal artery. CONCLUSIONS Onyx embolization using a dual-lumen microballoon catheter was effective. Furthermore, the buddy wire technique was useful for providing rigid support of the microcatheter in a narrow and tortuous intercostal artery.

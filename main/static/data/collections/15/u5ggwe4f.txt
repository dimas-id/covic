The etiology of tooth resorption in the domestic cat remains unknown. The high prevalence and progressive nature of the disease complicates defining healthy control groups. In order to evaluate the possible influence of various life style changes on the prevalence of tooth resorption, healthy control groups are a prerequisite. This paper presents a prevalence study for tooth resorption in a free-ranging wild felidae population. Skulls from 46 free-ranging Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) were examined. The age of the animals had previously been estimated based on cementum annuli in the maxillary right canine tooth. The dental examination included both dental probing and radiographic imaging. Complicated fractures of the canine teeth were found in 9/46 (19.5%) skulls. In one fractured canine, apical root resorption and periapical lucency was detected. The root resorption was attributed to inflammatory resorption as a consequence of the initial dental trauma and necrotic pulp. No signs of tooth resorption were found in the remaining teeth. Supernumerary roots were detected in 18/46 skulls (39.1 %). Supernumerary "peg" teeth caudal to the mandibular first molar tooth were detected in 6/46 (13.0%) skulls. Although further studies on dental ultra-structure are needed, the Swedish Eurasian lynx may, in the future, be useful as a healthy comparative model for studies on the etiopathogenesis of tooth resorption in the domestic cat.

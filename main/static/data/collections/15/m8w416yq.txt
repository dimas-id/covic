The use of self-expandable stents for endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms has increased over time. Different types of stent malpositioning, such as stent migration, distortion, incomplete opening, and apposition, can occur as a complication of the stent deployment procedure. In this report, we present a successful retrieval of a low-profile stent after full deployment in a dissecting posterior-inferior cerebellar artery because of incomplete apposition and subsequent acute occlusion of the stent.

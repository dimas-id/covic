AIM Maintaining normothermia is a tenet of neonatal care. However, neonatal thermal care guidelines applicable to intra-hospital transport beyond the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and during surgery or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are lacking. The aim of this study is to determine the proportion of infants normothermic (36.5-37.5°C) on return to NICU after management during surgery and MRI, and during standard clinical care in both environments. METHODS Sixty-two newborns requiring either surgery in the operating theatre (OT) (n = 41) or an MRI scan (n = 21) at the Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne) NICU were prospectively studied. Core temperature, along with cardiorespiratory parameters, was continuously measured from 15 min prior to leaving the NICU until 60 min after returning. Passive and active warming (intra-operatively) was at clinician discretion. RESULTS The study reported 90% of infants were normothermic before leaving NICU: 86% (MRI) and 93% (OT). Only 52% of infants were normothermic on return to NICU (relative risk (RR) 1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.31; number needed to harm (NNH) 2.6). Between departure from the NICU and commencement of surgery, core temperature decreased by mean 0.81°C (95% CI 0.30-1.33; P = 0.0001, analysis of variance), with only 24% of infants normothermic when surgery began (P < 0.0001; RR 3.80 (95% CI 2.33-6.74); NNH 1.5). After an MRI, infants were a mean 0.41°C (95% CI 0.16-0.67) colder than immediately before entering the scanner (P = 0.001, analysis of variance), with only 43% being normothermic (P = 0.003; RR 2.11 (95% CI 1.35-3.74); NNH 2.1). CONCLUSION Unintentional hypothermia is a common occurrence during surgery in the OT and MRI in neonates, indicating that evidence-based warming strategies to prevent hypothermia should be developed.

Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have multiple antimicrobial immunity effects. One such class of peptides is temporins. Temporins are the smallest (AMPs) found in nature and are highly active against gram-positive bacteria. Nowadays, there was a rapid increase in the availability of the 3D structure of proteins in PDB (protein data bank). The conserved residues and 3D structural conformations of temporins (AMPs) were still unknown. The present study explores the sequence analysis, alpha-helical structural conformations of temporins. The sequence of temporins was deracinated from APD3 database, the three-dimensional structure was constructed by homology modeling studies. The sequence analysis results show that the conserved residues among the peptide sequences, the maximum of the sequences are 70% alike to each other. The secondary structure prediction results revealed that 99% of temporin (AMPs) exhibited in alpha-helical form. The 3D structure speculated using RAMPAGE exposes the alpha-helical conformation in all temporins (AMPs). The phylogenetic analysis reveals the evolutionary relationships of temporins (AMPs), which are branched into seven clusters. As a result, we identified a list of potential temporin AMPs which docked to the antiviral protein (MERS-CoV), it shows good protein-peptide binding. This computational approach may serve as a good model for the rationale design of temporin based antibiotics.

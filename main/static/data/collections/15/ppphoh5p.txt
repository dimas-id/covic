Children are susceptible to infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this time of uncertainty, this review attempts to compile information that may be helpful to pediatric neurologists. This review consolidates current data on the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2, called COVID-19, and information from past coronavirus epidemics, to discuss diseases of pediatric neurology including Guillain-Barre syndrome (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy); central demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; infantile spasms; febrile seizures; and maternal-fetal transmission of virus.

Stress management interventions can help to improve mental health for adults living with multiple sclerosis. However, uncontrolled study designs may overestimate intervention effects. A systematic search of the Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus databases identified eight randomized controlled trials evaluating cognitive behavioral approaches for a pooled sample of 568 adults with multiple sclerosis. Both group and individual-based stress management interventions appear to be effective in promoting self-management of stress. Further research is needed to confirm the optimal timing of stress management interventions across the MS spectrum and strategies to maintain intervention effects.

Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread from China all over the world, many COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported in long-term care facilities (LCTF). However, data on clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in such settings are scarce. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess clinical characteristics and baseline predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients hospitalized after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a LTCF. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean age was 80 years (SD, 12 years), and 24/50 (57.1%) patients were males. A total of 42/50 (84%) patients experienced symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. In Cox regression, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were: hypernatremia (HR 9.12), lymphocyte count <1000 cells/L (HR 7.45), cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (HR 6.41), and higher levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg/mL) (HR 1.005). Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Further studies are necessary to better understand and confirm our findings in the setting of a LTCF outbreak of COVID-19.

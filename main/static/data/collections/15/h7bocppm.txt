We present the case of a 60-year old man who complained of severe dysphagia caused by a double aortic arch (DAA) with a right-sided descending thoracic aorta. The left-sided aortic arch had a compressive segment located between the left subclavian artery and the descending thoracic aorta. Using left third thoracotomy, the segment, which caused compression of the oesophagus, was ligated and divided. After the operation, the patient was completely relieved of his symptoms. We concluded that the removal of the compressive portion of the left aortic arch and the ligation of the ligamentum arteriosum are the only treatment measures needed in such cases.

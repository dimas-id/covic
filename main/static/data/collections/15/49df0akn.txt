Although genomics techniques such as DNA microarrays have been widely used in virology, much more limited use has been made of proteomics. Although difficult, proteomics can greatly contribute to an understanding of virus-cell interactions, including the ternary structure of viral receptors at the cell surface, post-translational modifications and isoforms of critical viral and cellular proteins and even to the structure of viruses. Proteomics techniques also offer the potential for discovering markers for diagnostic and prognostic tests of viral infections in vivo. This review describes the use of several proteomic approaches for the analysis of HIV-cellular receptor interactions, the molecular mechanisms of transport of herpes simplex virus within neurons, and the structure of the tegument of herpes simplex virus.

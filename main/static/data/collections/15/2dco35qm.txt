Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a novel acute infectious disease that has rapidly reached staggering pandemic proportions. This review addresses gastroenterologists, hepatologists, liver transplant (LT) specialists, and health-care professionals working in the field of liver diseases and liver transplantation. It has been written based on a limited number of publications, recommendations of national and international liver and organ transplantation societies, and experiences of patients with COVID-19 around the world. The purpose of this review is to provide information addressing questions and concerns about COVID-19, to reveal the effects of the novel disease on patients with chronic liver disease and LT recipients, and to share information about ways in which this pandemic will affect clinical practices. We, the Turkish Association for the Study of the Liver (TASL), would like to remind you that this text is actually not a practical guide. It is imperative to act according to the standards set by health-care institutions and the Ministry of Health, Republic of Turkey.

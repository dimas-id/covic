Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) near/within eloquent areas are challenging to treat surgically. The insufficient lesion-to-eloquence distance (LED) is related to poor neurological outcomes. This paper reports the use of in situ embolization combined with surgical resection in a one-staged hybrid operation for eloquent area protection. Nine patients who underwent one-staged in situ embolization combined with surgical resection were selected from the database of a prospective clinical trial (NCT03774017). Nidus got partial in situ embolization in the parts located near/within the eloquence. The rest of nidus was removed via a microsurgical procedure in the same operation. The in situ embolization ensured a sufficient LED to prevent eloquent areas and tracts from being damaged in the subsequent resection. All of the patients achieved complete obliteration with no neurological deficits or complications. One-staged hybrid operation initiates closer cooperation between surgical and endovascular treatments and proposes an integrative therapeutic mode for AVMs. The in situ embolization combined with surgical resection is safe and effective for improving the functional outcome of AVMs with eloquence and tracts involved. The clinical trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03774017, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03774017).

The antibiotic 2'-deoxycoformycin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, has potential as a chemotherapeutic agent. Injection of 2'-deoxycoformycin i.v. (0.2 mg/kg) to mice bearing ascites L1210 leukemia cells completely inhibits adenosine deaminase in both erythrocytes and L1210 cells. The recovery of the enzymic activity is markedly different in the two tissues. The recovery is very slow in erythrocytes (13% in 48 hr), whereas 80% recovery occurs during the same time interval in L1210 cells. This marked difference in the recovery of the enzyme in different tissues may play a role in the pharmacological and chemotherapeutic behavior of this drug.

Abstract Objectives: Nasopharyngeal swabs of 50 asthmatic children in the symptom-free period were examined for the presence of adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. A control group of 20 healthy individuals was included in this study. Methods: A polymerase chain reaction was used to detect adenovirus DNA and rhinovirus and coronavirus complementary DNA. The fragments of amplified genetic material were visualized with the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: Adenovirus DNA was found in 78.4% of asthmatic children, rhinovirus RNA in 32.4% and coronavirus RNA in 2.7%. Adenovirus DNA was detected in one of the 20 nasopharyngeal swabs of healthy controls; the rest of the control samples were negative. Conclusions: The persistent presence of viruses in the upper respiratory tract of asthmatic children shows a possible connection between viral infections and asthma.

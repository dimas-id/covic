It has been reported that dermatology practices may be a vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and elective cases should be postponed during the pandemic period. In this context, studies on the change of patient profile in Dermatology outpatient clinic have been conducted. However, there was no study in the literature about dermatology consultations during the pandemic period. One hundred and forty-seven dermatology consultation cases in the era of COVID-19 pandemic between March 11, 2020 and May 4, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Twenty-four patients (16.3%) had suspicion and signs of COVID during consultation (fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc.). Nine (37.5%) of these patients also had accompanying COVID-19 skin lesions (two urticarial lesions, two livedo and necrosis, two maculopapular eruption, two vesicular rashes, one pseudo-chilblain). The number of cases that were suspected to have COVID-19 was statistically significantly higher in consultations requested by the emergency department and intensive care unit, while there were no suspected cases in outpatient clinic consultations (P = .001). Two (1.4%) of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR within 2 weeks. We acknowledge that daily practice changes frequently during this period, but still our study provides a perspective to other dermatology clinics in terms of the requested dermatology consultations during the pandemic.

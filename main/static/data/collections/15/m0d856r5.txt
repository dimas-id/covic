This study investigated the influence of dietary resveratrol (300 mg/kg) supplementation in sows on the antioxidative status, myofiber characteristic and meat quality of their progeny. Results showed that maternal dietary resveratrol supplementation increased (P < 0.05) the backfat thickness and tended (P = 0.055) to increase the intramuscular fat of finishing pigs. The drip loss and lactic acid level were reduced, and the pH24 h of longissimus thoracis was increased by maternal dietary resveratrol supplementation (P < 0.05). Maternal dietary resveratrol supplementation increased the mRNA and protein expression of MyHC I and decreased the mRNA and protein expression of MyHC IIb in the longissimus thoracis (P < 0.05). The malonaldehyde (MDA) level in longissimus thoracis was reduced and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and SOD2 mRNA expression were increased by maternal dietary resveratrol supplementation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary resveratrol supplementation in sows improves the meat quality of offspring by altering the myofiber characteristic and antioxidative status.

BACKGROUND Despite being a well-known but seldom encountered zoonotic pathogen, diagnosis of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is not necessarily easy. Infected patients occasionally present with various symptoms resembling Kawasaki disease; thus discriminating the two in the acute phase is challenging. In addition to bacterial culture and serology, novel detection methods based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are reported in the literature. However, the clinical utility of LAMP-based methods in comparison with the other methods is scarcely documented in the literature. AIM To clarify the clinical utility of a LAMP-based method in the diagnosis of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection. METHODOLOGY Inpatients admitted due to suspected Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection during April 2008 through March 2015 were enrolled. Results of the LAMP-based method as well as culture and serology were collected and compared. RESULTS Among 16 eligible cases, serology proved positive in 13 (81.3 %) cases, LAMP in eight (50 %) cases, and bacterial culture in four (25 %) cases. No significant difference among the three methods could be proved statistically. Although serology was the most sensitive method, it is known to miss cases such as young patients, whereas LAMP could complement all three cases missed by serology. Furthermore, LAMP can return the test result within a few hours from specimen receipt, whereas serology and bacterial culture requires days to weeks of time. CONCLUSION Although second to serology in sensitivity, the LAMP-based method proved its utility in making rapid diagnosis, and serving a complementary role to serology.

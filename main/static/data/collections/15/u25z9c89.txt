Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy has gained acceptance as a safe and oncologically sound alternative to the open procedure. Intercostal incisions alter chest wall mechanics and lead to postoperative pain. We postulated that performing the procedure without disruption of the intercostal spaces may lead to better outcomes because of the decreased effect on chest wall mechanics and postoperative pain. This initial experiment attempts to test the feasibility and possible changes in technique during transdiaphragmatic lobectomy and lymphadenectomy based on currently available instrumentation. Three access ports were placed beneath the costal margin of an anesthetized adult pig, and the thoracic cavity was accessed through the diaphragm. A transdiaphragmatic minimally invasive right lower lobectomy with complete lymph node dissection was performed. We report the first transdiaphragmatic minimally invasive right lower lobectomy and lymphadenectomy in a pig. The procedure is feasible using current commercially available standard instrumentation in a pig. Further, study is warranted to further refine the surgical technique.

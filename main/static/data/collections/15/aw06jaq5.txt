BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE To unveil the real effect of surgical drains on the outcomes of thyroidectomy for benign thyroid disorders. METHODS A prospective randomized study was conducted at Abha Private Hospital, Saudi Arabia on 108 patients suffered from benign thyroid disorders undergoing elective thyroidectomy from 1 August 2015 to 28 February 2017. Patients were allocated randomly into drainage group (A) and non-drainage group (B). The demographic data, operation (type and duration), postoperative complications, histopathological results and length of stay were assessed, documented and statistically verified to check its significance. RESULTS A total of 108 patients were enrolled in the study; 94 females and 14 males with mean age of 38.02 years, two patients developed hematoma (1.85%); one in each group and another two patients had seroma with no significant difference between both groups, the mean length of stay was significantly higher in group (A) (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION This prospective study verified that routine drainage adds no significant advantage in the prevention of post-thyroidectomy bleeding, but it prolongs hospitalization. This aids in changing the concept from the "wide" use of drains into the "wise" use in selected patients with risk factors of bleeding.

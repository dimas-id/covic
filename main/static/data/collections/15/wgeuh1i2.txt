Abstract Viruses depend on their host's cellular structure to survive. Most of them do not have tRNAs, their translation relies on hosts' tRNA pools. Over the course of evolution, viruses needed to optimally exploit cellular processes of their host. Thus, codon usage of a virus should coevolve with its host to efficiently and rapidly replicate. Some viruses can invade a broad spectrum of hosts (BSTVs), while others can invade a narrow spectrum only (NSTVs). Consequently, we test the hypothesis that similarity of codon usage preference and the degree of matching between BSTVs and their hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs, which only need to coevolve with few hosts. We compare the patterns of codon usage in 255 virus genomes to test this hypothesis. Our results show that NSTVs have a higher degree of matching to their hosts' tRNA pools than BSTVs. Further, analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) infers that codon usage bias of NSTVs is relatively stronger than that of BSTVs. Thus, codon usage of NSTVs tends to better match their host than that of BSTVs. This supports the hypothesis that viruses adapt to the expression system of their host(s).

Pathologic aerophagia is sometimes seen in patients with neurologic disorders. It rarely causes massive bowel distention, ileus, and volvulus. Here, we report the use of esophagogastric separation and abdominal esophagostomy via jejunal interposition to prevent bowel distention caused by severe aerophagia in 2 patients with neurologic disorders in whom the usual nonoperative methods of management failed. In both cases, swallowed air was evacuated via the jejunostomy, eliminating bowel distention. This operation may be useful in patients with neurologic disorders associated with severe aerophagia.

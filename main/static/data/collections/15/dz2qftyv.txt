In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we established COVID-KOP, a new knowledgebase integrating the existing ROBOKOP biomedical knowledge graph with information from recent biomedical literature on COVID-19 annotated in the CORD-19 collection. COVID-KOP can be used effectively to test new hypotheses concerning repurposing of known drugs and clinical drug candidates against COVID-19. COVID-KOP is freely accessible at https://covidkop.renci.org/. For code and instructions for the original ROBOKOP, see: https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/robokop.

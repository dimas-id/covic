COVID-19 is a coronavirus responsible for a global pandemic that started in China in December 2019 and has quickly spread to almost all countries. Approximately 2% of cases are diagnosed in children. There is increasing evidence for transmission by asymptomatic or presymptomatic adults and children. The clinical features do not differ from those of other respiratory viral infections, although rare cases manifest an unusual rash involving the digits. Disease is generally mild in children but deaths have been reported. Risk groups for severe disease in children are yet to be delineated. All treatments remain experimental.

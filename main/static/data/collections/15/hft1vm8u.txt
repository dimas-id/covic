BACKGROUND Obesity is the most frequent chronic metabolic disease globally. There is a direct correlation between increasing body mass index (BMI) and elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and triglycerides (Tg), and an inverse correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); all these lipid derangements are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to evaluate lipid profiles in morbidly obese patients before and after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) performed at a single-center during a 2-year follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective, observational and descriptive study was carried out, including morbidly obese patients with at least one lipid abnormality, who underwent laparoscopic OAGB. Lipid profiles were evaluated preoperatively and at different intervals during a 2-year follow-up. RESULTS A total of 150 patients were included (73 % females and 27 % males). Mean age was 45.83 ± 10.65 years, mean BMI was 42.82 kg/m2 ± 6.43, and mean weight was 116.23 kg ± 22.70; 2 years after surgery, the latter two decreased to 24.73 ± 4.43 (p < 0.001) and 67.34 ± 13.35 (p < 0.001), respectively, thus leading to a mean weight loss (WL) of 48.85 kg ± 15.64 and mean %excess WL of 71.87 ± 13.41. Tg, TC and LDL levels significantly decreased: 123.60 ± 56.34 versus 84.79 ± 33.67, 194.33 ± 43.90 versus 173.65 ± 34.84, and 124.47 ± 36.07 versus 97.36 ± 25.05, respectively (p < 0.001); HDL levels significantly increased: 43.61 ± 9.85 versus 61.56 ± 12.63 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION OAGB leads to substantial and durable WL in morbidly obese patients after a 2-year follow-up. Postoperative lipid profiles significantly improved; these changes translate into theoretical relevant cardiovascular risk benefits.

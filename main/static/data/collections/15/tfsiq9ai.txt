Objective@#To investigate the high resolution CT (HRCT) features of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in children .@*Methods@#A retrospective analysis was performed on the chest HRCT findings of 22 children diagnosed with 2019-nCov pneumonia by clinical and nucleic acid testing in Wuhan Children&apos;s Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 25, 2020 to February 5, 2020. There were 12 boys and 10 girls, aged from 2 months to 14 years old, with a median age of 4 years, and 14 patients were under 5 years old. The characteristics of lung lesions on HRCT imaging such as distribution, shape, density, etc. and whether there were hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement and pleural changes were observed by 2 radiologists.@* Results@#In all of the 22 patients, 3 patients (3/22) had normal chest CT, and 19 patients (19/22) had infiltrated lesions in lung. Among them, 7 patients had unilateral lung involvement, 12 patients had bilateral involvement. The HRCT manifestations were as follows. Six patients showed ground glass shadow, including 4 cases showed light ground glass shadow and 2 had typical crazy paving sign. Four patients showed lung consolidation, with localized strip shadow and patchy high-density shadow. Six patients showed patchy lesions with surrounding ground glass shadow, including 1 case with white lung in the right. The bronchopneumonia-like changes in 3 cases, showed scattered spot-like or patchy uneven high-density shadows. The lesions in the lower lobe were more serious than those in the upper lobe, and the lesions in the lateroposterior zone of the lung were more common than those in the apical and central area of the lung. No enlarged lymph nodes and pleural effusion were seen in all patients, and 1 case had thickened interlobar pleura.@*Conclusions@#The HRCT manifestations of NCP in children are diversified, comprehensive judgments need to be made in combination with epidemiological data, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests, but the chest HRCT can be used as an important basis for early clinical diagnosis and prevention and control interventions.

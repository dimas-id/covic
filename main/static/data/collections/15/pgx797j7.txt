Self-healing hydrogels have attracted great attentions in recent years because of their wide application in bioscience and bio-technology. In this study, P(DMAPMA-stat-DAA)were synthesized by RAFT polymerization and quaternized to import antimicrobial properties. Then quaternized P(DMAPMA-stat-DAA) were used to prepare hydrogel containing acylhydrazone groups with PEO diacylhydrazide as cross-linking agent. The acylhydrazone groups imparted a variety of properties including group responsiveness, and self-healing properties to the hydrogel. At the same time, the quaternary ammonium endowed the hydrogel with antimicrobial property. The mechanical property, self-healing properties and antimicrobial property of hydrogels were investigated intensively. Results showed hydrogels formed in neutral conditions and luminescent property was introduced with PEO23 DNH cross-linking. The hydrogels showed controlled pH sensitive DOXÂ·HC l and Ovalbumin (OVA) release profile. Also, the hydrogel showed antimicrobial property and may have important applications in the biomedical field in the near future. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: The global burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in terms of morbidity and mortality is immense. Novel treatments that can induce a protective immune response are urgently needed to effectively control the HBV epidemic and eventually eradicate chronic HBV infection. METHODS: We designed and evaluated an HBV therapeutic vaccine consisting of a novel Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist T7-EA, an Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein. We used RNA-seq, ELISA and hTLR7/8 reporting assays to characterize T7-EA in vitro and real-time PCR to evaluate the tissue-retention characteristics in vivo. To evaluate the adjuvant potential, we administrated T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with an Alum adjuvant and HBsAg in normal and HBV mice, then, we evaluated the HBsAg-specific immune responses by ELISA and Elispot assays. RESULTS: T7-EA acted as an hTLR7-specific agonist and induced a similar gene expression pattern as an unmodified TLR7 ligand when Raw 264.7 cells were exposed to T7-EA; however, T7-EA was more potent than the unmodified TLR7 ligand. In vivo studies showed that T7-EA had tissue-retaining activity with stimulating local cytokine and chemokine expression for up to 7 days. T7-EA could induce Th1-type immune responses, as evidenced by an increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer and a T-cell response in normal mice compared to mice received traditional Alum-adjuvant HBV vaccine. Importantly, T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistent HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in an HBV mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: T7-EA might be a candidate adjuvant in a prophylactic and therapeutic HBV vaccine.

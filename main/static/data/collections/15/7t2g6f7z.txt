PURPOSE To present midterm results from a randomized study comparing the safety and efficacy of percutaneous endovenous intervention (PEVI) + anticoagulation vs. anticoagulation alone in the reduction of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in acute symptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). METHODS The TORPEDO trial was a randomized study to demonstrate superiority of PEVI in the reduction of the VTE and PTS at 6 months; in that trial, 183 patients (103 men; mean age 61 ± 11 years) with symptomatic proximal DVT were randomized to receive PEVI + anticoagulation (n = 91) or anticoagulation alone (n = 92). PEVI consisted of one or more of a combination of thrombectomy, balloon venoplasty, stenting, and/or local low-dose thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS At 6 months, recurrent VTE developed in 2.3% of the PEVI + anticoagulation group vs. 14.8% in the anticoagulation only group (p = 0.003); PTS developed in 3.4% vs. 27.2% (p<0.001), respectively. At a mean follow-up of 30 ± 5 months (range 12-41), 88 patients in the PEVI + anticoagulation group and 81 patients in the anticoagulation only group reached target follow-up. Recurrent VTE developed in 4 (4.5%) of the 88 PEVI + anticoagulation patients vs. 13 (16%) of the 81 patients receiving anticoagulation only (p = 0.02). PTS developed in 6 (6.8%) of the PEVI + anticoagulation group vs. 24 (29.6%) of the anticoagulation only group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION In patients with proximal DVT, PEVI is superior to anticoagulation alone in the reduction of VTE and PTS. This benefit, which appears early in the course of treatment, extends to >2.5 years.

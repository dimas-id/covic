INTRODUCTION: Existing socioeconomic and racial disparities in healthcare access in New York City have likely impacted the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An ecological study was performed to determine the spatial distribution of COVID-19 testing by ZIP Code Tabulation Area and investigate if testing was associated with race or SES. METHODS: Data were obtained from the New York City Coronavirus data repository and the 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. A combined index of SES was created using principal component analysis, and incorporated household income, gross rent, poverty, education, working class status, unemployment, and occupants per room. Multivariable Poisson regressions were performed to predict the number of total tests and the ratio of positive tests to total tests performed, using the SES index, racial composition, and Hispanic composition as predictors. RESULTS: The number of total tests significantly increased with the increasing proportion of white residents (β=0.004, SE=0.001, p=0.0032), but not with increasing Hispanic composition or SES index score. The ratio of positive tests to total tests significantly decreased with the increasing proportion of white residents in the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (β= –0.003, SE=0.0006, p<0.001) and with increasing SES index score (β= –0.0016, SE=0.0007, p=0.0159). CONCLUSIONS: In New York City, COVID-19 testing has not been proportional to need; existing socioeconomic and racial disparities in healthcare access have likely impacted public health response. There is urgent need for widespread testing and public health outreach for the most vulnerable communities in New York City.

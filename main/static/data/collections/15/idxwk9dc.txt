BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal tumors that are located specifically in the gastrointestinal tract, with up to 60% of occurrences in the stomach, 30% in the small intestine, and 10% in the esophagus, colon, and rectum. The annual incidence of GISTs is about 15 cases per million, which in the United States equals 5000 cases per year. In most cases, these tumors are asymptomatic and are found incidentally on computed tomography scan or by endoscopy. Preoperative evaluation is based on location, size, and anatomic features and helps to confirm the diagnosis of the GIST and assess outcomes. Surgical intervention is the gold standard for treatment of nonmetastatic GISTs. CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of an 80-year-old man with a gastric mass on the posterior surface of the greater curvature of the stomach at the junction of the gastric antrum and the pylorus, found incidentally on a computed tomography scan. The patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy and a single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. After histologic evaluation, the resected lesion was determined to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. CONCLUSION A single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for the resection of GISTs is a feasible and appropriate method if the lesion is a safe distance from the pylorus and the gastroesophageal junction for gross negative margins to be obtained. Its advantages include decreased pain and a shorter hospital stay compared with other methods.

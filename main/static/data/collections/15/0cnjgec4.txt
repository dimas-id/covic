Abstract Infection of host cells by a variety of viruses results in programmed cell death or apoptosis. In many cases, early events in virus replication that occur prior to synthesis of viral proteins and replication of viral genomes directly or indirectly activate signaling pathways that culminate in cell death. Using examples of viruses for which prodeath signaling is better defined, this review will describe how cell entry steps including virus attachment to receptors, virus uncoating in endosomes, and events that occur following membrane penetration lead to apoptosis. The relevance and physiologic consequences of early induction of prodeath signaling to viral pathogenesis also will be discussed.

Multiple initiatives propose utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements for contact tracing and SARS-CoV-2 exposure notifications. This demo shows a research tool to analyze BLE advertisements; if universally enabled by the vendors, the uncovered features could improve exposure notifications for everyone. We reverse-engineer the firmware-internal implementation of BLE advertisements on Broadcom and Cypress chips and show how to extract further physical-layer information at the receiver. The analyzed firmware works on hundreds of millions of devices, such as all iPhones, the European Samsung Galaxy S series, and Raspberry Pis.

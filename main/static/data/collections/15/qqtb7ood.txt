We have previously detected an alkali-labile and developmentally regulated antigen in rat embryonic cerebral cortex, which may be 9-O-acetylsialylated GT3 ganglioside (Hirabayashi Y, Hirota M, Suzuki Y, Matsumoto M, Obata K, Ando S (1989) Neurosci Lett 106:193-98). In this study we established a mouse monoclonal antibody, 493D4, that recognizes 9-O-acetyl GT3 ganglioside, but not non-O-acetyl gangliosides. This antibody also reacted with 9-O-acetyl GD3 to a much lesser extent. By using this antibody, we found that O-acetyl GT3 as well as O-acetyl GD3 were expressed strongly in fetal murine cerebral cortex and decreased to an undetectable level after birth. With the assistance of TLC-immunostaining using 493D4 together with Q-Sepharose column chromatography, O-acetyl gangliosides of bovine brain were purified and the structural analysis showed the presence of O-acetyl GD3, O-acetyl LD1, O-acetyl GD2 and O-acetyl GD1b in the adult brain as extremely minor components. Interestingly, the antibody 493D4 could detect O-acetyl sialoglycoproteins in rat brain tissues. One of the major immunoreactive proteins was shown to be synaptophysin, an integral membrane protein specifically present in synaptic vesicles. This monoclonal antibody was therefore useful for sensitive detection of both O-acetylated gangliosides and glycoproteins with O-acetylated sialic acids.

This chapter furthers the question of creativity as introduced in my previous chapter. I argue that by-and-large creativity in art and its education is being rethought to meet the requirements of our current economic condition that supports designer capitalism. The creative industries have successfully generated a subject position that demands a coming together of art, technology, and knowledge to answer to the information age of the twenty-first century. Creativity in art education is following this trend. I end this essay with another view of creativity with the hope that it may be an alternative that some teachers are willing to follow.

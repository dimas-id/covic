BACKGROUND With the progress of surgical techniques and devices, laparoscopic hepatectomy (Lap-Hx) became a realizable option for patients with liver tumors. However, the feasibility of Lap-Hx for metastatic liver tumor of colorectal cancer also should be guaranteed oncologically. This study evaluated the short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx compared with open hepatectomy (Open-Hx) for patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) by matched-pair analysis. METHODS This study enrolled 21 patients who underwent Lap-Hx and compared them with 21 matched patients who underwent Open-Hx. The following parameters were matched between the two cohorts: tumor size, tumor location, and operative procedures. Both short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx were compared with those of Open-Hx. RESULTS No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of age, gender, tumor size, or operative procedures. With regard to short-term outcomes, the operative time for Lap-Hx (377 ± 29 min) was similar to that for Open-Hx (369 ± 31 min), whereas the blood loss for the patients who underwent a Lap-Hx (198 ± 39 ml) was significantly less than for those who underwent an Open-Hx (326 ± 50 ml). The incidence of postoperative complications among the patients who underwent Lap-Hx tended to be lower than for the patients who underwent Open-Hx, and intraabdominal abscess was observed only in the Open-Hx group. The hospital stay for Lap-Hx (average, 18.3 days) tended to be shorter than for Open-Hx (27 days). With respect to long-term outcomes, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS Lap-Hx is a safe and feasible option for selected patients with CLM. The short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx also are considered to be acceptable.

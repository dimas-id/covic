Every year there are > 33 million cases of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-related respiratory infection in children under the age of five, making RSV the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants. RSV is a global infection, but 99% of related mortality is in low/middle-income countries. Unbelievably, 62 years after its identification, there remains no effective treatment nor vaccine for this deadly virus, leaving infants, elderly and immunocompromised patients at high risk. The success of all pathogens depends on their ability to evade and modulate the host immune response. RSV has a complex and intricate relationship with our immune systems, but a clearer understanding of these interactions is essential in the development of effective medicines. Therefore, in a bid to update and focus our research community’s understanding of RSV’s interaction with immune defences, this review aims to discuss how our current knowledgebase could be used to combat this global viral threat.

The objective of this study was to evaluate physical, mechanical, and biological properties of the polydioxanone (PDO) monofilament meshes and polyglycolide (PGA) polyfilament meshes in comparison with Permacol® implants. In rat experimental model, a 1.5 × 2.0 cm defect in abdominal wall was reconstructed by using the Permacol surgical implant or knitted meshes produced from either PDO monofilament, or PGA multifilament. The implant sites were assessed for the tensile strength and the extents of material resorption, host inflammatory response and host tissue replacement on days 3, 10, 30, or 60 after the surgery. The PDO and PGA meshes were rapidly pervaded by the host connective tissue with elements of skeletal muscle histogenesis. The degree of adhesions was significantly higher in the Permacol group. All of the prostheses underwent resorption, which correlated with gradual decreases in the overall tensile strength of the site and the Col1a1 gene expression level. Elevated expression of Fgf2 gene maintained longer in the PDO group, and the Mmp9 gene expression level in this group was higher than in the other groups. Gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were higher in the Permacol group. The foreign body giant cell numbers were lower in the PDO and Permacol groups than in the PGA group. Minimal macrophage infiltration with predominance of M2 cells was observed in the PDO group. Overall, the PDO prosthesis turned out to be significantly better than the PGA or Permacol prostheses by a number of indicators of biocompatibility and efficacy. © 2018 The Authors Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

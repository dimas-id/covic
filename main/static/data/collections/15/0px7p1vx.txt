Direct visualization of the key features of coronavirus genomes can lead to a better understanding of this virus as well as a method to distinguish this type of virus from others. The DNA nucleotide footprint plotter is a tool that makes it possible for straightforward visualization of the characteristics of viral genomes. It can also distinguish different gene types and gene structures. The current project provides a novel tool for biological studies that can contribute to breakthroughs in coronavirus diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

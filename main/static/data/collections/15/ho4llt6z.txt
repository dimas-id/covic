While obesity and morbid obesity have reached epidemic proportions worldwide, bariatric surgeons continue to develop safer and more efficacious procedures to battle this lethal disease. Sleeve gastrectomy, a relative new surgical approach, was initially conceived as a restrictive component of the biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch in the era of open bariatric surgery. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery in the late 1980s, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been proposed as a step procedure in high-risk patients, followed by a second step Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch and, recently, as a standalone bariatric approach. This article reviews the literature and reports the results achieved with LSG performed either as the initial operation for high-risk, high body mass index patients followed by a definitive weight loss operation, or used as a final viable alternative to other well-established bariatric procedures. An extensive literature review was conducted and the information currently available surrounding LSG, such as history, indications and contraindications, mechanism of weight loss, technique and outcomes and controversial issues are discussed. LSG is an accepted procedure for the surgical management of morbid obesity. It is gaining popularity as a primary, staged and revisional operation for its proven safety and simplicity, as well as short-term and mid-term efficacy. Excess weight loss and remission of comorbidities have been reported to take place in a frequency comparable with other well-established procedures. Despite all of the above-mentioned factors, long-term results and larger series are pending.

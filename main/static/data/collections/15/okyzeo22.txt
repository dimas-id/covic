Human CD4 was expressed on a range of mammalian cell lines. CD4(+) non-primate cells, derived from rat, hamster, mink, cat, and rabbit, bind recombinant gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) but are resistant to HIV-1 infection. CD4 expression on various human, rhesus, and African green monkey cell lines confers differential susceptibilities for HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency (SIV) strains. For example, CD4(+)TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma cells are sensitive to HIV-1 and HIV-2 but resistant to SIV, whereas CD4+ U87 glioma cells are resistant to HIV-1 infection but sensitive to HIV-2 and SIV. HIV-1 infection was not dependent on human major histocompatibility class I expression. Studies of cell fusion and of infection by vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelopes showed that the differential cell tropisms of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV are determined at the cell surface.

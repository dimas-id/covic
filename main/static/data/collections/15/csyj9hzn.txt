Acute airway obstruction is one of the most common causes of acute respiratory failure in children. Left untreated, it can rapidly progress to cardiopulmonary arrest and death. There are several important anatomical differences between pediatric and adult patients that render children more susceptible to acute airway obstruction. In addition, there are several diseases that can cause life-threatening acute airway compromise. An understanding of the developmental anatomy and physiology, as well as the myriad diseases that can cause airway compromise in children is therefore essential for all healthcare personnel that provide care for critically ill children.

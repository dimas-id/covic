On 30th March 2020, a 57-year-old male patient presented to the Emergency Department with a 6-day history of cough, persistent fevers and worsening dyspnoea. His only known comorbidity was hypertension, managed with amlodipine and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. On admission, he was tachypnoeic and in severe hypoxic respiratory failure with dangerously low peripheral oxygen saturations (SpO2 ) 83% on 15L oxygen. Chest radiographic changes were consistent with COVID-19 infection and demonstrated bilateral changes with diffuse airspace shadowing with more confluence in the lower zones (Figure 1A).

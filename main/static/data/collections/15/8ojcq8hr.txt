Lack of safe and effective mucosal adjuvants has severely hampered the development of mucosal subunit vaccines. In this regard, we have previously shown that immunogenicity of vaccine antigens can be improved by targeting the antigens to the antigen-presenting cells. Specifically, groups of mice immunized intranasally with a fusion protein (Bivalent-FP) containing a fragment of pneumococcal-surface-protein-A (PspA) as antigen and a single-chain bivalent antibody raised against the anti-human Fc-gamma-receptor-I (hFcγRI) elicited protective immunity to pulmonary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. In order to further enhance the immunogenicity, an additional hFcγRI-binding moiety of the single chain antibody was incorporated. The modified vaccine (Trivalent-FP) induced significantly improved protection against lethal pulmonary S. pneumoniae challenge compared to Bivalent-FP. In addition, the modified vaccine exhibited over 85% protection with only two immunizations. Trivalent-FP also induced S. pneumoniae-specific systemic and mucosal antibodies. Moreover, Trivalent-FP also induced IL-17- and IL-22-producing CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, it was found that the hFcγRI facilitated uptake and presentation of Trivalent-FP. In addition, Trivalent-FP also induced IL-1α, MIP-1α, and TNF-α; modulated recruitment of dendritic cells and macrophages; and induced CD80/86 and MHC-II expression on antigen presenting cells.

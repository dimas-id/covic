The potentially lethal infection caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a global crisis. Following the initial viral infection is the host inflammatory response that frequently results in excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF&#945;), developing into a self-targeting, toxic "cytokine storm" causing critical pulmonary tissue damage. The need for a therapeutic that is available immediately is growing daily but the de novo development of a vaccine may take years. Therefore, repurposing of approved drugs offers a promising approach to address this urgent need. Inhaled furosemide, a small molecule capable of inhibiting IL-6 and TNF&#945;, may be an agent capable of treating the Coronavirus Disease 2019 cytokine storm in both resource-rich and developing countries. Furosemide is a "repurpose-able" small molecule therapeutics, that is safe, easily synthesized, handled, and stored, and is available in reasonable quantities worldwide.

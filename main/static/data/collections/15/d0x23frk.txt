PURPOSE We report a combined technique consisting of thrombectomy and thromboaspiration for the treatment of acute embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) at the origin. CASE A 90-year-old female with chronic atrial fibrillation had a sudden onset of abdominal pain and hematochezia due to acute embolic occlusion at the origin of the SMA. Computed tomographic findings showed reversible bowel wall ischemia. We performed mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire FR revascularization device, a self-expanding and fully retrievable stent-based thrombectomy system for acute intracranial large artery occlusion, combined with manual aspiration through a 6F guiding sheath placed at the SMA origin via a right brachial approach. Prompt and complete recanalization of the SMA was obtained without distal embolism, and intestinal necrosis was avoided. CONCLUSION Combined endovascular procedures of mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire FR with thromboaspiration may allow prompt recanalization, clot removal, and prevention of distal embolism and therefore would be a new therapy for acute embolic occlusion at the origin of the SMA.

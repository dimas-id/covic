The Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) GP64 protein mediates membrane fusion during entry. Fusion results from a low-pH-triggered conformational change in GP64 and subsequent interactions with the membrane bilayers. The low-pH sensor and trigger of the conformational change are not known, but histidine residues are implicated because the pK(a) of histidine is near the threshold for triggering fusion by GP64. We used alanine substitutions to examine the roles of all individual and selected clusters of GP64 histidine residues in triggering and mediating fusion by GP64. Three histidine residues (H152, H155, and H156), located in fusion loop 2, were identified as important for membrane fusion. These three histidine residues were important for efficient pore expansion but were not required for the pH-triggered conformational change. In contrast, a cluster of three histidine residues (H245, H304, and H430) located near the base of the central coiled coil was identified as a putative sensor for low pH. Three alanine substitutions in cluster H245/H304/H430 resulted in dramatically reduced membrane fusion and the apparent loss of the prefusion conformation at neutral pH. Thus, the H245/H304/H430 cluster of histidines may function or participate as a pH sensor by stabilizing the prefusion structure of GP64.

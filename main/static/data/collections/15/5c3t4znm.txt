Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019, it has stricken more than 1,000,000 persons worldwide, of whom over 50,000 have died (1). Having been infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), patients with COVID-19 mainly present with fever and respiratory symptoms (2). Isolated sudden onset anosmia has also frequently been reported (3). Less frequently, rhinorrhea, diarrhoea and dysgeusia may be associated. While only a few reports have evoked cutaneous manifestations (4), we read with interest an initial study on the topic entitled "Cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19: a first perspective " by Recalcati S. (5).

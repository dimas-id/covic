Abstract Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), which cause gastrointestinal and respiratory illness, have been isolated from a wide variety of mammalian species including bats, minks, pigs and humans. Here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel MRV type 3 (MRV3), named MRV-ZJ2013, from the diarrheic feces of piglets in Zhejiang province, China. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds. Neonatal piglets infected with MRV-ZJ2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces, but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. Fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets, each for one- or two-day post-infection. In contrast, piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea. These findings suggest that the virulence of MRV-ZJ2013, if any, was likely not significant compared to that of PEDV. A seroepidemiological survey of MRV by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence (77%) in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east China between 2015 and 2016, indicating that MRV3 is endemic in pig herds in China, and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens.

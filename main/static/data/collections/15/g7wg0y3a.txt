BACKGROUND AND AIMS Laparoscopic gastric resection is widely used for gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs). However, determining an appropriate resection line using only the laparoscopic approach is difficult. We developed a laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) technique by combining laparoscopic gastric resection with endoscopic submucosal dissection, and we have used this procedure to resect gastric SMTs. In this study, the procedure is presented and its safety and feasibility for resecting gastric SMTs are evaluated. METHODS This retrospective study included 100 patients who underwent LECS for SMTs at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Cancer Institute, between June 2006 and November 2014. The demographics, tumor histopathologic characteristics, and operative and follow-up data were reviewed. RESULTS Complete resection with negative surgical margins was achieved in all patients, and LECS was performed regardless of tumor location. The mean operation time was 174.3 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 16.3 mL. In addition, the mean time until the initiation of oral intake was 1.4 days, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 8.4 days. Moreover, no local or distant tumor recurrence was observed. The only severe adverse event was leakage, which was observed in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS LECS was performed with a reasonable operation time, low blood loss, and minimal adverse events. Therefore LECS is safe and feasible for resecting gastric SMTs.

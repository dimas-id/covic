BACKGROUND Wheezing, starting early in life, is a heterogeneous medical condition caused by airway obstruction due to different underlying mechanisms. Primary immunodeficiencies are also among the risk factors that cause wheezing and recurrent bronchiolitis. ADA deficiency is a primary immunodeficiency, also a rare metabolic disease associated with multisystemic clinical findings. OBJECTIVE This report will be helpful for adressing the importance of thinking primary immunodeficiency in case of wheezing and recurret bronchiolitis. METHODS The patient was diagnosed by using a targeted next generation sequencing PID panel. Lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow-cytometry. RESULTS Here we present an infant with ADA deficiency who admitted with wheezing and recurrent bronchiolitis as the first presentation. He was found to have wheezing, relative CD4+ T cell deficiency, and prolonged neutropenia. CONCLUSION Primary immunodeficiencies including ADA deficiency should be considered in infants with wheezing, recurrent bronchiolitis, lymphopenia and neutropenia.

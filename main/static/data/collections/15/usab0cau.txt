Abstract Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses by blocking their entry. In this study, we constructed a shuttle plasmid, harboring human IFITM3. Thereafter, recombinant adenovirus rAd5-IFITM3 was obtained by co-transfection of the linearized viral backbone vector pAd5 and the shuttle plasmid. The results showed that human IFITM3 did not affect the assembly and morphogenesis of progeny adenovirus. Human IFITM3 can be expressed in both A549 and MDCK cells in a time dependent manner. Furthermore, cells infected with rAd5-IFITM3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 for 24 h were challenged with avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 at an MOI of 1 for 6, 12 and 24 h. Rates of H5N1 infection in rAd5-IFITM3 cells were significantly decreased at 24 h post-infection (hpi), in a time dependent manner, compared with that of wild type wtAd5-infected cells. The expressions of viral genes were significantly inhibited at transcriptional and translational levels at 6 and 12 hpi. These results suggest that IFITM3 can suppress H5N1 replication in the early stage of the infection, which may be used as a promise agent against H5N1 infection in vivo.

Respiratory viral and atypical bacterial agents lead to infections in a large spectrum, from mild symptoms to respiratory failure. In this study, we aimed to detect mutiple viral and bacterial agents in the respiratory samples of inpatients by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Nasopharyngeal swab and broncho alveolar lavage samples' results from the inpatients with respiratory infection symptoms at the Uludag University Hospital between 01.12.2015 and 31.03.2018 were investigated. DNA/RNA was extracted with EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (Qiagen, Belgium) in EZ1 (Qiagen, Belgium). R-GENEÂ® Real-Time PCR (Biomerioux, France) kit was used to detect Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV, human Meta-pneumo virus (hMPV), Rhino/Enterovirus, Adenovirus (AdV), human Bocavirus (hBoV), Corona virus (CoV), Parainfluenza virus (PIV), Chlamydia pneumoniae/Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila in Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen, Belgium). Patients' ages were between 0-90 years. Patients' 177 (56.9%) were male and 134 (43.1%) were female. There was a total 311 samples and 214 (68.8%) were positive. We detected a total of 360 agents including 338 viruses and 22 bacteria. Most common agents were; Influenza A+B (n=65, 18,1%), hBoV (n=64, 17.8%), Rhino/Enterovirus (n=56, 15.6%) and RSV (n=47, 13.1%). Rapid diagnosis of viral infections by Real Time PCR is important for the specific treatment.

We studied the biological activity of Pis v 1 (2S albumin) and Pis v 2.0101 (11S globulin) against Coxsackie viruses (CV) B2, B3, B4 and B5 as well as their cytotoxicity against six cell lines. Results showed that the two allergens of pistachio significantly reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria as well as two fungi. Moreover, they exerted significant in vitro cytotoxic activities against Human ovarian carcinoma (A2780), human colon carcinoma (HTC), human glioblastoma (U-87-MG), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and human prostate cell lines (PC3 and DU-145). Our findings revealed that the highest antimicrobial effect of the allergens was found against M. loteus (MIC = 10 µg/mL). The lowest IC(50) value was found for Pis v 2.0101 allergen (11S globulin) against CV-B4 (30.20 ± 1.01 µg/mL). Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed IC(50) values ranging from 21.09 ± 0.55 to 34.52 ± 0.90 and 26.34 ± 0.88 to 38.63 ± 0.80 µg/mL for Pis v 2.0101 (11S globulin) and Pis v 1 (2S albumin), respectively. As these allergens presented considerable effects against biofilm-related infections, CV-B2-5, and several cell lines, they might be employed as alternative/complementary treatments after further preclinical and clinical studies.

BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising among patients under age 50. As such, we set out to determine the proportion of CRC-related hospital admissions and distribution of colon cancer by stage in different age groups. METHODS The NIS database for 2002-2012 was used to investigate trends of colorectal cancer resection by age, and the ACS NSQIP database for 2012-2013 was used to investigate contemporary stage at diagnosis for colon cancer in different age groups. RESULTS A total of 1,198,421 patients were admitted to a hospital with a diagnosis of CRC and captured by the NIS database. Although the number of hospitalized CRC patients decreased from 2002 to 2012, the observed decrease was predominant in patients older than 65 years (P < 0.01) and in colon cancer compared to rectal cancer patients (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients younger than 65 years increased from 32.8 % in 2002 to 41.1 % in 2012, and the proportion of patients under age 50 increased from 9 to 12 %. In the NSQIP database, the age <50 group also had a significantly higher proportion of advanced disease (stage III/IV) compared to patients age 50 and older (62.3 vs. 47.5 %, P < 0.01). In 2012, it was observed that most patients with rectal cancer were younger than 65 years (55.8 %). CONCLUSION There was a steady decrease in the number of hospitalized patients with colorectal cancer during the last decade, primarily attributable to a decrease in the older than 65 years age patients and colon cancer patients. The proportion of hospitalized patients age <50 is rising. In addition, patients younger than 50 years were more likely to have advanced disease compared to older patients.

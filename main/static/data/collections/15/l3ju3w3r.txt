Mönkemüller et al. brilliantly describe the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in the gastrointestinal tract. Their findings highlight the local and systemic inflammatory response generated by the coronavirus. After having the opportunity to observe three cases of severe colonic ischemia and elevation of D-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) due to SARS-CoV-2, we would like to highlight the thromboembolic complications in COVID-19, which are related to those reported by Mönkemüller and which have been mentioned by other authors.

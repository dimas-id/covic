BACKGROUND The type 1 interferons (INF-alpha and INF-beta) are potent antiviral agents. Albumin-INF-alpha and albumin-INF-beta are novel recombinant proteins consisting of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta genetically fused to human albumin. METHODS The in vitro antiviral activity of albumin-IFN-alpha was evaluated against representative bioterrorism viral agents and the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. Antiviral activity was assessed using inhibition of cytopathic effect and neutral red staining. RESULTS EC(50) values for albumin-IFN-alpha ranged from <0.1 ng/ml for Punta Toro virus to 65 ng/ml for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in the neutral red assay. Albumin-IFN-beta showed 75- and 360-fold greater in vitro activity than albumin-IFN-alpha against Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome, respectively. CONCLUSION Further evaluation of these long-acting albumin-IFN fusion proteins as prophylactic or therapeutic agents against these viral agents of bioterrorism in relevant primate models is warranted.

BACKGROUND Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakages represent a major complication of skull base surgery. Watertight dural suture is challenging, and different ways to reinforce it have been proposed. Since 6 months, we use locally harvested autologous pericranium graft for dural repair in retrosigmoid approach. METHODS Retrospectively, we analyzed 27 patients operated on with key-hole retrosigmoid approach from May 2014. In all, autologous pericranium was harvested and inserted as an underlay "hourglass-shaped" plug under the dura plane and stitched to dura. Surgical patch and sealant were used for augmentation. Complications considered were new neurological symptoms, surgical site infections, meningitis, CSF-leaks, and pseudomeningocele. RESULTS Indications included tumor (16 cases), microvascular decompression (10 cases), and hemorrhagic cerebellar arteriovenous malformation (1 case). Surgical site infections, meningitis, and CSF leaks have never been observed. One neurofibromatosis type 2 patient operated on for large acoustic neuroma developed an asymptomatic pseudomeningocele, disappeared on 3-month magnetic resonance imaging follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In our series, autologous pericranium inserted and stitched as an underlay hourglass-shaped plug, augmented with surgical patch pieces and dural sealant seemed to be safe and effective for dural repair in "key-hole" retrosigmoid approach. With this technique, we obtained low complication rate, similar to the best current results of available literature.

The spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to rapidly progressive, acute respiratory distress syndrome and death 1 .To the best of our knowledge, status epilepticus has never been described as initial presentation of COVID-19. We report a patient affected by COVID-19 whose primary presentation was a focal status epilepticus.

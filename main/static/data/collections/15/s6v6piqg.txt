The emerging coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly around the world. Responsible for severe pneumonitis (Covid-19), there are also doubts concerning a possible mother-to-fetal transmission of this virus. Current data are patchy and obtained from small groups of patients. They tend to support the idea that the mother-to-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very rare, but the period between infection and childbirth was often very short and may not allow sufficient replication to consider transplacental passage. Here, we reviewed the existing virological data and those remaining to explore. Thus, the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and the risk of transmission in utero is not yet fully understood and defined. Four months from the emergence of this virus, it is therefore reasonable to wait for the results of specific studies on larger cohorts which, to be conclusive, must meet the best scientific criteria.

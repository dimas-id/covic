Integrated organic growth must prioritise the interests of the African people by creating equal economic opportunities, generating social and cultural wealth and capital, to a broad spectrum of the population in each country. Human development seeks to enable people to lead full, productive and meaningful lives by raising their incomes and improving their standards of living, which include life expectancy, health, education, security and personal liberty and freedom of choice—unfortunately, Africa fares poorly in this regard if one considers the Human Development Index or the World Happiness Report. China is particularly active in interventions in Africa that aim to improve food security, social development, medical care and public health, poverty eradication, education, environmental protection, security, immigration, law enforcement and international cooperation. One example is China’s significant intervention during the Ebola outbreak crisis in West Africa which saved countless lives. Concerns do, however, remain regarding possible human rights abuses and lack of community engagement by Chinese investors in Africa.

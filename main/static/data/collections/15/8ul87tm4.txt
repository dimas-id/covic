We report the case of a 36-year-old health care worker who suffered a subacute infarct with a mild deviation of the midline, and a large vessel occlusion with a free-floating thrombus in the ascending aorta in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. With this case we want to increase the awareness about severe forms of systemic ischemia and stroke in patients with signs of COVID infection.

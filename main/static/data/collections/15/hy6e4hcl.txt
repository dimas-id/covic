Orbitocerebral impalement by inanimate objects is a relatively uncommon event. If orbitocerebral impalement is suspected, management entails prompt referral to a trauma facility with neurosurgical, neuroanesthesiological, craniomaxillofacial, and ophthalmological expertise. The aim of this report is to describe the unique mechanism and perioperative considerations of a remarkable, deep orbitocerebral impalement from a walker brake lever through the orbital roof after a fall from standing. We discuss clinical vignette, evaluation, anesthetic approach, and considerations and review the literature on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, surgical and anesthetic management, and prognosis of this traumatic mechanism. We also offer a management algorithm that aims to streamline management.

Virus‚Äêlike particles (VLPs), formed by the structural elements of viruses, have received considerable attention over the past two decades. The number of reports on newly obtained VLPs has grown proportionally with the systems developed for the expression of these particles. The chapter outlines the recent achievements in two important fields of research brought about by the availability of VLPs produced in a foreign host. These are: (1) The requirements for VLP assembly and (2) the use of VLPs as carriers for foreign epitopes. VLP technology is a rapidly advancing domain of molecular and structural biology. Extensive progress in VLP studies was achieved as the insect cell based protein production system was developed. This baculovirus expression system has many advantages for the synthesis of viral structural proteins resulting in the formation of VLPs. It allows production of large amounts of correctly folded proteins while also providing cell membranes that can serve as structural elements for enveloped viruses. These features give us the opportunity to gain insights into the interactions and requirements accompanying VLP formation that are similar to the assembly events occurring in mammalian cells. Other encouraging elements are the ability to easily scale up the system and the simplicity of purification of the assembled VLPs. The growing number of VLPs carrying foreign protein fragments on their surface and studies on the successful assembly of these chimeric molecules is a promising avenue towards the development of a new technology, in which the newly designed VLPs will be directed to particular mammalian cell types by exposing specific binding domains. The progress made in modeling the surface of VLPs makes them to date the best candidates for the design of delivery systems that can efficiently reach their targets.

We report the first successful short-term outcome of single-stage combined video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy and port access surgery in a patient with operable primary right lower lobe adenocarcinoma and a synchronous cardiac myxoma. The video-assisted thoracic surgery right lower lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection was performed first, followed by myxoma excision by port access surgery through the same working port incision. The histopathologic analysis confirmed a pT2a N0 M0 R0 (TNM 7th edition) primary poorly differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma and a completely excised cardiac myxoma. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 6 weeks confirmed an excellent surgical and oncologic outcome.

There now is a considerable body of evidence to support the view that an effective HIV/AIDS strategy integrates prevention, treatment and human rights. In this chapter, we emphasize the importance of each of these aspects and draw upon the conclusions reached in previous chapters to map out the future of HIV/AIDS. While medicine and science have a crucial role to play in addressing pandemics, whether slow-moving (like HIV/AIDS) or fast-moving (like influenza), the social, legal, political, financial and economic ramifications of pandemics can not be ignored. Well-considered social, legal, political and financial strategies are essential in order to address any pandemic effectively.

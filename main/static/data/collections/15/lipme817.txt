BACKGROUND: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) related to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an emergent syndrome affecting children globally in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The clinical presentation has similarities to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. As knowledge of the cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations has been emerging, little is known about the impact on the brain. METHOD: This case describes a 14-year-old boy who developed prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms including delirium followed by impairments in executive functioning in the context of MIS-C with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These symptoms improved in correlation with improvements in inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Neuropsychiatric manifestations including confusion, irritability, and headaches have been reported in pediatric patients with MIS-C. Potential mechanisms include direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2, secondary effects of systemic inflammation, and/or adverse side effects of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C is a novel and poorly understood syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 with effects on multiple organ systems including the central nervous system. As additional cases are reported and research expands, so too will our understanding of the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology would aid in determining targeted interventions.

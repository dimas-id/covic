Structureâ€“function studies have defined two classes of viral membrane-fusion proteins that have radically different architectures but adopt a similar overall 'hairpin' conformation to induce fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and therefore initiate infection. In both classes, the hairpin conformation is achieved after a conformational change is triggered by interaction with the target cell. This review will focus in particular on the properties of the more recently described class II proteins.

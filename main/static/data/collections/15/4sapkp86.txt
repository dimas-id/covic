OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the current literature and guidelines on management of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19 or 2019nCoV) with respect to the field of Otolaryngology. DESIGN: Contemporary literature review. METHODS: Systematic literature review of global medical literature databases and communications were queried to find all available literature recommendations, research, and guidelines applicable to otolaryngologists in the COVID‐19 pandemic. RESULTS: Guidance on personal protective equipment, office visits, and surgical scheduling, as well as recommendations for safe airway management and tracheotomy performance during the COVID‐19 pandemic were compiled and interpreted. CONCLUSIONS: Little guidance exists for otolaryngologists who are among the highest risk groups during the rapidly evolving COVID‐19 pandemic. This synthesis and compilation of global resources serve as a building block for further guidance during the epidemic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.

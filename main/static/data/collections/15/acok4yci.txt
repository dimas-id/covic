Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In addition to mechanisms such as atrial stretch and atrial remodeling, the activity of the autonomic nervous system has also been suggested to contribute to the progression from paroxysmal to persistent atrial fibrillation. Catheter-based renal denervation was introduced as a minimally invasive approach to reduce renal and whole body sympathetic activation with accompanying blood pressure reduction and left-ventricular morphological and functional improvement in drug-resistant hypertension. This review focuses on the potential effects of renal denervation on different arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the atrium and discusses potential anti-remodeling effects in atrial fibrillation patients with hypertension, heart failure and sleep apnea.

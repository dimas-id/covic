The coronavirus pandemic has prompted several governments to take the major step of asking everyone to stay home except for essential needs. This has brought down the ground vibration significantly, in various frequency bands, particularly at higher frequencies related to anthropogenic seismic noise. The power is reduced by ~ 5 dB at 10 Hz in Shillong, India, post-lockdown (after 25 March 2020) in India. This is lower than the levels that are observed over the weekends. On the day of Janata Curfew (22 March 2020), the reduction in power is ~ 10 dB at 10 Hz.

Abstract: Background: The SARS-Cov2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor for cell entry. It has been suggested that ACE-inhibitors, which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and which raise ACE2 levels, may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: We evaluated this hypothesis in an early cohort of 205 acute inpatients with COVID-19 at King's College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital, London, UK with the primary endpoint being death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 7-days of symptom onset. Findings: 53 patients out of 205 patients reached the primary endpoint. Contrary to the hypothesis, treatment with ACE-inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of rapidly deteriorating severe disease. There was a lower rate of death or transfer to a critical care unit within 7 days in patients on an ACE-inhibitor OR 0.29 (CI 0.10-0.75, p<0.01), adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure). Interpretation: Although a small sample size, we do not see evidence for ACE-inhibitors increasing the short-term severity of COVID-19 disease and patients on treatment with ACE-inhibitors should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness. A potential beneficial effect needs to be explored as more data becomes available.

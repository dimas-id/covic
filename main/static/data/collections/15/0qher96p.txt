The problem of finding a better immunization strategy for controlling the spreading of the epidemic with limited resources has attracted much attention because of its great theoretical significance and wide application. In this paper, we propose a successful immunization strategy only depending on local information. Our strategy initializes the scores of nodes with the values of their degree and recalculates the score of a certain immunized node based on its local information, and then replaces the certain immunized node with its nonimmunized higher-score neighbor. To test the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we conduct the experiments on several synthetic networks and real-world networks. The results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the existing well-known local strategies, even the degree centrality targeted strategy.

A recombinant adenovirus vaccine against the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was constructed, which contains fragments from the S, N, and Orf8 genes. Rhesus Macaques immunized with the recombinant adenovirus generated antigen-specific humoral and cellular response. Furthermore, the vaccine provided significant protection against subsequent live SARS-CoV challenge. In contrast, three out of four monkeys immunized with placebo suffered severe alveolar damage and pulmonary destruction.

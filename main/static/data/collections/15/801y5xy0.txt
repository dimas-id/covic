Derivatives of flavan have been synthesized as chemical intermediates, but the only reported biological action is the ability of certain alkyl and alkoxy derivatives to lower blood cholesterol concentrations(1). It was therefore surprising to discover that flavan itself (Table 1) is a highly effective inhibitor of the replication of certain serotypes of rhinovirus, and that a simple derivative, BW683C (4â€²,6-dichloroflavan), is the most potent antiviral compound yet reported. The present work examines the antiviral activity of flavan derivatives with a view to selecting the compound most suitable for trial in volunteers infected with a common cold virus.

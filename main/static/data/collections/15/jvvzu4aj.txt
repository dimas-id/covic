We began this book by reflecting on the theoretical hegemony of western scholarship, especially western social theory, and in the hope of making a small contribution to unsettling western knowledge claims and to internationalising feminist sociological scholarship. Our starting-point was a particular set of debates around the consequences of recent social change, of living in the era of late modernity, for personal life. We positioned ourselves among those, such as Lynn Jamieson.

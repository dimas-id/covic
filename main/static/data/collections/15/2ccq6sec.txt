BACKGROUND Single port cholecystectomy is increasingly performed. This procedure can be challenging, and we lack factors predicting the operative difficulty. AIMS To assess the role of surgeon experience and identify possible predictive factors of intraoperative difficulties. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-one selected patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2008 and August 2010. Six surgeons were involved (3 seniors, 3 juniors). Anthropometrics of the patients, types of ports, exposure methods and intraoperative data were recorded. Pain was assessed with the visual analogic scale at postoperative day 1 (POD 1 VAS). RESULTS Fifty-eight patients with symptomatic gallstones and three with acute cholecystitis underwent single port cholecystectomy. The mean BMI, weight and height were 25.7 kg/m(2) (SD 4.45), 71.8 kg (SD 14.83) and 166 cm SD 0.07, respectively. Mean operative time was 68.4 min (SD 26.98). Anthropometrics had no influence on operative time. Senior surgeons performed more rapidly, but the difference was not significant. The overall mean POD 1 VAS was 2.26, (SD 1.81). The mean hospital stay was 2.22 days, (SD 0.9). No complications occurred. An additional exposure method was necessary in 19 procedures. This cluster presented a significantly higher operating time (81.5 min, SD 31.69 vs. 62.7, SD 22.74; p = 0.01) and POD 1 VAS (1.92 vs. 3; p = 0.031). CONCLUSION Single trocar cholecystectomy can be implemented safely in teaching hospitals. Anthropometrics are not predictive of operative difficulties. The need for additional exposure systems affects the operative time and pain negatively, reflecting greater technical difficulties. Research to optimize instruments may help to solve these problems.

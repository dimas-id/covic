OBJECTIVE Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy causing limb weaknesses. The mortality is around 8%, with about 20% of patients remaining disabled. The purpose of this study is to examine the performance of Indian Medical Scientists in the area of GBS over a period of 40 years. India's contribution to GBS has been examined based on the global publication output and share, growth rate, citation impact, publication share in various field, highly cited papers and their impact, most productive authors and their citation impact and collaboration of research on GBS with the international community. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data for this study has been taken from Scopus, a multidisciplinary database using keywords GBS and Miller Fisher Syndrome. The contribution of India on GBS has been compared with different countries for its publication and citation count during a period of 40 years (1973-2012). RESULTS It is found that there were 10,633 publications available from global medical research covering the various aspects of GBS. India's share is 2.92% of global output and holds 10 th rank in overall publication output on GBS, whereas United States topped the rank with the highest number of publications. Sanjay Gandhi Post-graduate Institute of Medical Research, Lucknow is the most productive institutions while Tally AB from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore is the most productive author who has contributed the highest number of papers on GBS. CONCLUSION India is far behind in GBS research as compared to other countries like USA, as there might be a low case report of GBS in Indian population. Still the research focusing this disease is quite prominent and needs a careful medical attention through research capacity building in order to look for better treatment of the disease in Indian cases. This study shall be helpful in enhancing the awareness of the GBS by Indian scientists.

BACKGROUND We previously investigated antibody titers against four kinds of superantigens [streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA), streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B] in patients with Kawasaki syndrome (KS) younger than 6 months of age and reported a relationship between toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and KS patients. In this study we have investigated antibody titers in KS patients older than 6 months of age. METHODS Serum of 81 patients with KS older than 6 months of age, before intravenous gamma-globulin therapy, and 88 normal age-matched children were used in this study. The IgG antibody titers against four kinds of superantigens were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS The KS patients showed significantly elevated mean SPEA titer (P = 0.006) and significantly higher incidence of high SPEA (P = 0.0024) compared with the controls. The SPEA titer in KS patients showed a significant positive correlation with the number of days from onset of illness (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS The elevated antibody titer against superantigens of KS patients older than 6 months of age was different from that of KS patients younger than 6 months of age. Our results suggest that KS patients' exposure to SPEA occurred a few weeks before the onset of KS. SPEA may be one of the possible etiologic agents of KS among patients older than 6 months of age in Kagoshima, Japan.

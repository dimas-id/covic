Despite extensive vaccination, canine parvovirus (CPV) remains a leading infectious cause of canine mortality, especially among juveniles. This review provides an update on CPV vaccine types and vaccination protocols. The design of CPV prevention strategies and vaccination programs with a goal of herd immunity has been hampered by deficiencies of studies that model companion animal viral infections and inform an understanding of the basic reproduction number. However, the most important issue in eradication of CPV disease is represented by immunisation failures including: i) the presence of interfering titres of maternally-derived antibodies; ii) the presence of non-responders; and iii) possible reversion to virulence. In contrast, the role of the CPV variants in immunisation failures is widely debated. Taking into account the reduced circulation of canine distemper virus and canine adenovirus type 1 in countries where extensive vaccination is carried out, more effort should be made to aim for CPV eradication, including antibody testing to determine the optimal time for vaccinations of pups and adults and homogeneous vaccine coverage of dog population.

Infections remain a cause of significant morbidity and mortality following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The conditioning regimen (chemotherapy, radiation therapy), mucosal damage, type of transplant, immune suppressive therapy, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) all predispose the HSCT recipient to infection. Abnormal B- and T-lymphocyte function results in impaired humoral and cellular immunity, respectively. Neutrophil function is impaired by the use of corticosteroids and other medications. Hypogammaglobulinemia and functional asplenia are common. The occurrence of infections in an individual patient varies according to the phase of the transplant process and reflects the type(s) of immune defect(s), underlying disease, endogenous host flora, exposure history, and pre-treatment infections.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus infection that has spread worldwide in a short period and caused a pandemic. The goal of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the prevalence of most common symptoms and complications of COVID-19. Methods: All related studies assessing the clinical complications of COVID-19 have been identified through web search databases (PubMed and Scopus). Relevant data were extracted from these studies and analyzed by stata (ver 14) random-effects model. The heterogeneity of studies were assessed by I2 index. The publication bias was examined by Funnel plots and Eggers test. Results: 30 studies were in our meta-analysis including 6 389 infected patients. The prevalence of most common symptoms were: fever 84.30% (95% CI: 77.13-90.37; I2=97.74%), cough 63.01% (95% CI: 57.63-68.23; I2=93.73%), dyspnea 37.16% (95% CI: 27.31-47.57%; I2=98.32%), fatigue 34.22% (95% CI: 26.29-42.62; I2=97.29%) and diarrhea 11.47 %(95% CI: 6.96-16.87; I2=95.58%), respectively. The most prevalent complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 33.15% (95% CI: 23.35-43.73; I2=98.56%), acute cardiac injury 13.77% (95% CI: 9.66-18.45; I2=91.36%), arrhythmia 16.64% (95% CI: 9.34-25.5; I2=92.29%), heart failure 11.50% (95% CI: 3.45-22.83; I2=89.48%), and acute kidney injury (AKI) 8.40 %(95% CI: 5.15-12.31; I2=95.22%, respectively. According to our analysis, mortality rate of COVID-19 patients were 12.29% (95% CI: 6.20-19.99; I2=98.29%). Conclusion: We assessed the prevalence of the main clinical complications of COVID-19 and found that after respiratory complications, cardiac and renal complications are the most common clinical complications of COVID-19.

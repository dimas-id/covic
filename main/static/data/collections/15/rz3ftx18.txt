Neospora caninum has gained considerable attention through its role in the aetiology of bovine abortion. Due to its close phylogenetic relationship with Toxoplasma gondii, respective unequivocal differential diagnosis deserves special consideration. In order to evaluate the diagnostic performance of molecular and immunodiagnostic techniques and to provide insights into the epidemiological significance of bovine neosporosis in Switzerland, we conducted a study on 83 cases of bovine abortion: of these, 24 (29%) foetal brains were positive by Neospora-PCR, six of these foetuses were simultaneously seropositive in Neospora-IFAT and/or somatic antigen-ELISA. Conversely, four (5%) foetal brains were considered positive by Toxoplasma-PCR, two of which were also seropositive in the Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA and/or direct agglutination test. The seroprevalence in 1689 cattle sera obtained from 113 dairy farms was 11.5% (95% confidence interval: 9.2–13.8) by Neospora-somatic antigen-ELISA and 10.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–12.6) by Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA. From the same samples, 1.1%, less than statistically expected, were positive in both ELISA. Within selected groups of cow-calf farms, the seroprevalence determined using the Neospora-somatic antigen-ELISA was 14% (95% confidence interval: 5.0–23.0) for dams and 15% (95% confidence interval: 3.0–28.0) for offspring calves. Seroprevalences determined by Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA were 8% (95% confidence interval: 4.0–12.0) for dams and 3% (95% confidence interval: 0.3–6.0) for calves. None of the sera gave a positive reaction in both ELISA. Our data indicated that prenatal neosporosis appears as an important cause of bovine abortion in Switzerland.

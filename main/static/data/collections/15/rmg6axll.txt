BACKGROUND AND AIMS Ciclosporin A [CsA] and infliximab [IFX] are similarly effective in preventing short-term colectomy in ulcerative colitis [UC] patients, but long-term data are scarce. We aimed to compare short- and long-term efficacy of CsA and IFX by analysing colectomy rates and failure of remission-induction treatment as outcome parameters for treatment success. METHODS We retrospectively studied hospitalised UC patients who received CsA or IFX for moderate-to-severe UC, between January 2000 and April 2014. The primary endpoint was time to colectomy, and treatment failure [defined as colectomy or another remission-induction treatment with corticosteroids, CsA, or IFX] was used as secondary endpoint. Variables possibly affecting colectomy outcomes were analysed. RESULTS A total of 55 patients were studied for colectomy outcome and 58 patients for treatment failure. A significantly longer follow-up duration was available for CsA-treated patients [p < 0.001, both subcohorts]. Patients showed comparable patient- and disease-specific characteristics. Colectomy rates did not differ significantly at 3, 12, and 36 months: 36% versus 29%, 58% versus 48%, and 64% versus 67% for CsA- and IFX-treated patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed the lowest hazard ratio [HR] for colectomy in patients concomitantly using thiopurines: HR 0.28 (confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.64), p = 0.002. Treatment failure rates were not significantly different at 3, 12 and 36 months: 35% versus 48%, 51% versus 68%, and 62% versus 83% for CsA- and IFX-treated patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with CsA and IFX is similarly effective in preventing short- and long-term colectomy in hospitalised UC patients. Furthermore, failure rates of these remission-induction treatments were comparable.

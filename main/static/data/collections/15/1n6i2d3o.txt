OBJECTIVE Endovascular treatment is one of the most important treatments along with open craniotomy for cerebrovascular surgery. The successful treatment of endovascular disease relies on appropriate instruments and the surgeon's skill. Endovascular treatment needs to provide safe and stable access to the catheter cavity. Additionally, it is important to maintain a round shape without changing to an oval shape. The catheter for endovascular treatment has to be flexible and accommodate at least 0.027 inches of inner diameter. The 6-Fr Navienâ„¢ Intracranial Support Catheter (formerly the ReFlex Intracranial Catheter; Covidien Vascular Therapies, Mansfield, MA, USA) provides 0.072 inches of inner diameter. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed 61 cases for 56 cases of endovascular treatment with a Navien catheter. A triaxial system was used for all procedures with femoral arterial access. The Navien catheter was placed in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery or third segment of the vertebral artery. The patients had various shapes of intracranial arteries, including tortuous vessels. RESULTS The Navien catheter was used for 61 cases of endovascular treatment. We had 59 cases of coil embolization at unruptured and ruptured aneurysms and two cases of stent insertion into the middle cerebral artery. All the cases were successful without any catheter-related complications. CONCLUSION The Navien catheter is a recently developed catheter that has several strengths compared with previously developed catheters. It provides a more stable environment for endovascular treatment. It provides a cavity sufficient for endovascular treatment devices. Additionally, it is sufficiently flexible to approach tortuous vessels.

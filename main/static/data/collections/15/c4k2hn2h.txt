Duodenal injury in most cases, presents as a complex trauma of all adjacent organs which it is generally treated with a midline laparotomy though laparoscopic treatment in selected cases might be beneficial. We present a case of haemodynamically stable patient who suffered abdominal gunshot injury causing grade II trauma of the liver and penetrating wound of the first part of the duodenum and was treated laparoscopically. We believe that laparoscopic primary or assisted repair of injured duodenum is an appropriate surgical option in haemodynamically stable patients who sustain focal abdominal trauma.

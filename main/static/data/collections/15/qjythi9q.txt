PURPOSE We describe safety and efficacy aspects of mechanical thrombectomy with the novel stent-type clot retrieval device EmboTrap for revascularization of large-artery occlusions in acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 40 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-artery occlusion were treated in five European centers. Clinical and procedural data were collected; self-reported angiographic results and neurologic outcome (discharge and 90 days) were assessed in a standardized manner. RESULTS The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at admittance was 16; no patient was treated after 12 h. Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was received by 65 % of patients. The territorial distribution was as follows: 87.5 % in the anterior circulation: 62.5 % middle cerebral artery and 25 % internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus, comprising 20 % tandem occlusions; and 12.5 % in the posterior circulation, all of which were vertebrobasilar. Revascularization of TICI 2b-3 was achieved in 38 of 40 (95 %) treatments. Additional devices were utilized in 11 of 40 (28 %) cases after a mean of 2.6 passes with EmboTrap prior to switching. The mean number of EmboTrap passes needed was 1.8, with a mean procedural time to reperfusion of 54 min. One patient (2.5 %), who had not received IVT, experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage post-interventionally. Procedural complications were encountered in 2 of 40 cases (5 %); both patients exhibited ICA dissection that was treated conservatively without clinical sequelae. There were no device-related complications. Of 23 available patients, 8 (35 %) had a good outcome after 90 days. CONCLUSION The procedural results from these five centers suggest that EmboTrap is technically safe. Successful recanalization rates can be expected to be within the range of other stent retrievers.

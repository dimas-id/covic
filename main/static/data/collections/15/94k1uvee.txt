In this paper, we propose a novel method of generating high-order curvilinear triangular meshes using an advancing front approach. Our method relies on a direct approach to generate meshes on geometries with curved boundaries. Our advancing front method yields high-quality triangular elements in each iteration which omits the need for post-processing steps. We present several numerical examples of second-order curvilinear triangular meshes of patient-specific anatomical models generated using our technique on boundary meshes obtained from biomedical images.

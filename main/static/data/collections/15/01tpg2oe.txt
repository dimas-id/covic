In this article, the authors describe their current operative technique for open ventral hernia repair using component separation. Although methods of anterior component separation are described, in their current practice, the authors primarily use posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release to permit dissection beyond the retrorectus space. This method adheres to the literature-supported principles of a tension-free midline fascial closure with wide mesh overlap of mesh positioned in a sublay position. The authors' experience with this method supports a low recurrence rate and reduced wound morbidity.

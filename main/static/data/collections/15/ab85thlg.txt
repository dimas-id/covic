A 10‐year‐old girl, suspected 2 days prior to have streptococcal pharyngitis, presented with diffuse erythema, tense bullae, Nikolsky‐positive desquamation, as well as ulcerations of her oral and genital mucosa. She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or preceding and concurrent use of medications, including over‐the‐counter and herbal supplements. A comprehensive viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel, Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR and IgM, streptococcal molecular antigen test, urine culture, blood culture, and rheumatologic serologies were negative. Based on the patient's clinical presentation and biopsy results, she was diagnosed with idiopathic toxic epidermal necrolysis.

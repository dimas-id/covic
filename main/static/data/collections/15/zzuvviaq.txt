Many viruses, including bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenzavirus-3 (PI3), bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine reovirus, have been etiologically associated with respiratory disease in cattle. This review focuses on the pathogenesis of BHV-1 and BRSV, two very different agents that primarily cause disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract, respectively.

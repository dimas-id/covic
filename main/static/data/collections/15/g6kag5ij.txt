OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of viral RNA in human semen of severe-acute-respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recovered and positive patients and to evaluate its presence and relevance on semen parameters. DESIGN: Pilot cohort study SETTING: University hospital PATIENTS: 34 adult males were distributed into a) patients in convalescence (patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pharyngeal swab by RT-PCR and/or antibodies), b) negative control group (no antibodies) and c) patients with an acute infection (detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab). INTERVENTION: Semen and a blood sample were collected from each individual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analysis of semen quality according to the WHO standards. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the native semen sample and after density gradient preparation. Confirmation of Immunoglobulin (Ig)-A und Ig-G antibodies in the blood. RESULTS: 18 semen samples from recovered males were obtained 8 to 54 days after absence of symptoms, 14 samples from controls and 2 samples from patients with an active COVID-19 infection. No RNA was detected by RT-PCR in the semen including semen samples from two patients with an acute COVID-19 infection. Subjects with a moderate infection showed an impairment of sperm quality. CONCLUSION: A mild COVID-19 infection is not likely to affect testis and epididymis function, whereas semen parameters did seem impaired after a moderate infection . SARS-CoV-2 RNA could not be detected in semen of recovered and acute COVID-19 positive males. This suggests no viral transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproductive techniques (ART), however, further data need to be obtained.

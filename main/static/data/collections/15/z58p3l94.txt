A high prevalence of various infectious diseases is reported in diabetic patients, which may suggest impaired innate immunity against different pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This study investigated the effects of hyperglycemia, oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)), nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) on the modulation of antiviral (MDA-5, IRF-3 and phospho-IRF-3), inflammatory (NF-kappaB) and pro/anti-apoptotic molecules (Bax and Bcl-2) in BALB/c mice thymocytes. Each of the experimental conditions, except the weakest NO concentration, resulted in down-regulation of MDA-5, IRF-3 and phospho-IRF-3. In contrast, each of the experimental conditions elicited up-regulation of NF-kappaB, Bcl-2 and Bax. These results suggest that hyperglycemia, oxidative and nitrosative stress may contribute to the reduced immunity of the host by altering the MDA-5/IRF-3/phosphoIRF-3 axis, as well as contributing to the mechanisms of inflammatory reaction via increased NF-kappaB, and to augmented turnover rate of thymocyte cells via Bcl2/Bax up-regulation.

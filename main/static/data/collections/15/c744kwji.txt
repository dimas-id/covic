Olive pomace, the solid by-product from virgin olive oil extraction, constitutes a remarkable source of functional compounds and has been exploited by several authors to formulate high-added value foods and, consequently, to foster the sustainability of the olive-oil chain. In this framework, the aim of the present review was to summarize the results on the application of functional compounds from olive pomace in food products. Phenolics-rich extracts from olive pomace were added to vegetable oils, fish burgers, fermented milk and in the edible coating of fruit, in order to take advantage of their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, olive pomace was directly used in the formulation of pasta and baked goods, by exploiting polyunsaturated fatty acids, phenolic compounds and dietary fiber to obtain high-value added healthy foods and/or to extend their shelf-life. With the same scope, olive pomace was also added to animal feeds obtaining healthy-improved animal products. Furthermore, different authors used olive pomace to produce biodegradable materials and/or active packaging able to increase the content of bioactive compounds and the oxidative stability of foods. Overall, the results highlighted in most cases the effectiveness of the addition of olive pomace-derived functional compounds in improving the nutritional value, the quality and/or the shelf-life of foods. However, more challenging was found to be the direct addition of olive pomace, especially due to alterations of sensory and textural features of food. This article is protected by copyright.

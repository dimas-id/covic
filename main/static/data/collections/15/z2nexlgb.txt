BACKGROUND The impact of suture materials on the development of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy remains unclear. Thus, their choice among pancreatic surgeons is still mostly experience-based. Aim of the present study is to assess what is the best suture material to be used for pancreaticojejunostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The force needed to reach the breaking point of five widely used suture materials (polypropylene, polyester, polydioxanone, silk, and polyglactin 910) has been determined through a digital precision dynamometer at baseline and after 5 and 20 days of incubation in pancreatic juice, bile, or a mixture of both. RESULTS Regardless of the condition, polyglactin 910 has retained only 10% of its baseline force. Silk has maintained almost 90% of its initial force showing a very low baseline value of force. In pancreatic juice, polypropylene has lost less force compared to polyester (0.25 vs. 0.93 N; p = 0.03) and polydioxanone (0.25 vs. 3.67 N; p = 0.04). Polyester and polydioxanone have showed similar values of force. However, polydioxanone has lost a significant amount of force in pancreatic juice when compared to polyester (0.93 vs. 3.67 N; p = 0.03). Polyester has showed the highest value of force needed to reach the breaking point after 20 days of incubation in pancreatic juice. CONCLUSIONS After incubation in pancreaticobiliary secretions, polyglactin 910 loses almost all its force. Polypropylene preserves its characteristic, but polydioxanone and polyester show absolute higher breaking points, with polyester retaining the highest value of force needed to reach its breaking point after incubation in pancreatic juice.

Wistar rats [Cr1:(WI)BR] were inoculated intranasally with approximately 10(3) median mouse lethal infective doses of sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus. Animals were subsequently selected at random, removed to a separate isolation room, and reinfected with SDA virus at 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 months. Pre- and postinoculation serum samples were collected from all animals during the course of the study and evaluated for antibody titers to SDA virus. All experimental, control and sentinel animals, following inoculation with SDA virus, were necropsied and examined for lesions consistent with SDA. Salivary gland lesions were minimal to absent in rats reinfected with SDA virus for up to 12 to 15 months after the initial exposure and minimal to moderate in the respiratory tract at 12 or 15 months. SDA-associated lesions were extensive in age matched control animals examined at each time period of reinfection with SDA virus. Thus, prior exposure to SDA virus did protect against the development of typical salivary gland lesions for up to 15 months. Recovered animals were evaluated for their ability to transmit the virus following reinfection. Rats reinfected at 6 or 9 months were infectious to their naive cage mates. The results indicate that reinfection with homologous rat coronavirus can occur as early as 6 months after the initial infection, and such rats can transmit the infection to contact controls.

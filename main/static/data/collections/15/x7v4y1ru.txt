In the last few months, an unprecedented number of laboratory tests for COVID‐19 have been developed at a remarkable speed. With the rapid adoption of these tests into clinical practice, combined with the widespread publicity they received, questions arose related to the different types of tests, their utility, performance, and regulatory approval status. The aim of this publication is to provide a general landscape of laboratory testing for COVID‐19 and offer a historical and regulatory perspective associated with them. Specifically, we aim to elaborate on the regulatory complexities of diagnostic testing in the U.S. and its implications to the present outbreak, as well as provide a synopsis of laboratory tests that have been developed for COVID‐19. We will first address the detection of Sars‐Cov‐2 directly by either nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) or by the detection of the viral protein for active infections. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of serological tests that can aid not only in diagnosis but additionally help to identify prior infections and potential immunity.

BACKGROUND Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair is the most commonly used technique for the open treatment of inguinal hernia. Mesh fixation and the potential risk of associated pain are always a surgical concern. The aim of this study was to report the initial clinical experience using an innovative, partly resorbable mesh with self-gripping properties. METHODS Fifty-two patients (70 hernias) underwent open Lichtenstein hernia repair with Parietene Progrip (Sofradim Production, Tr√©voux, France-Group Covidien). Patient pain as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) was the primary study endpoint. Clinical evaluation, with careful attention to the identification of hernia recurrence, was performed at 1 month and 1 year. The evaluation of fixation precision, quality of fixation and ease of use was assessed by the primary surgeon. RESULTS The mean patient pain was 1.3 (+/-1.4) at discharge, 0.1 (+/-0.4) at 1 month and 0.0 (+/-0.1) (one patient with VAS 1/10) at 1 year, respectively. The mean operative time was 19 +/- 4 min. There was one minor cutaneous infection and no documented recurrence. The quality of the gripping effect was rated very good in 51 (98.1%) of the cases performed. CONCLUSION The use of a novel low-density, macroporous mesh with semi-resorbable self-fixing properties during tension-free repair may be a satisfactory solution to the clinical problems of pain and recurrence following inguinal herniorrhaphy.

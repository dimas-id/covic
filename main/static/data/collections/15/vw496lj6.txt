A portable method for the rapid detection of the disease biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP) with a hand-held pressuremeter was developed. The method allows an ultrasensitive quantitation of CRP within the entire clinical range. The pressure-based method could facilitate CRP measurements in point-of-care testing (POCT) scenarios, such as clinical offices, emergency departments, and community service centers.

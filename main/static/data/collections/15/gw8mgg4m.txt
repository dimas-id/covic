Viral filtration is a critical step in the purification of biologics and in the monitoring of microbiological water quality. Viral filters are also essential protection elements against airborne viral particles. The present review first focuses on cellulose-based filter media currently used for size-exclusion and/or adsorptive filtration of viruses from biopharmaceutical and environmental water samples. Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorptionâ€“elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review.

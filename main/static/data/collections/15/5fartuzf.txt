Locked nucleic acid (LNA) is a nucleic acid analogue containing one or more LNA nucleotide monomers with a bicyclic furanose unit locked in an RNA mimicking sugar conformation. This conformational restriction results in unprecedented hybridization affinity towards complementary single stranded RNA and thus, makes LNA uniquely suited for mimicking RNA structures and sequence specific targeting of RNA in vitro or in vivo. The focus of this paper is on LNA-antisense, LNA-modified siRNA (siLNA), and detection and analysis of microRNAs by LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes.

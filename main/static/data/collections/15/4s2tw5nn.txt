Our developed wire ultrasound surgical instrument comprises a bolt-clamped Langevin ultrasonic transducer (BLUT) fabricated by PMN-PZT single crystal material due to high mechanical quality factor and electromechanical coupling coefficient, a waveguide in the handheld instrument, and a generator instrument. To ensure high performance of wire ultrasound surgical instruments, the BLUT should vibrate at an accurate frequency because the BLUT's frequency influences hemostasis and the effects of incisions on blood vessels and tissues. Therefore, we implemented a BLUT with a waveguide in the handheld instrument using a developed assembly jig process with impedance and network analyzers that can accurately control the compression force using a digital torque wrench. A generator instrument having a main control circuit with a low error rate, that is, an output frequency error rate within ±0.5% and an output voltage error rate within ±1.6%, was developed to generate the accurate frequency of the BLUT in the handheld instrument. In addition, a matching circuit between the BLUT and generator instrument with a network analyzer was developed to transfer displacement vibration efficiently from the handheld instrument to the end of the waveguide. Using the matching circuit, the measured S-parameter value of the generator instrument using a network analyzer was -24.3 dB at the resonant frequency. Thus, our proposed scheme can improve the vibration amplitude and accuracy of frequency control of the wire ultrasound surgical instrument due to developed PMN-PZT material and assembly jig process.

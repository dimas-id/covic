The risks posed by bioterrorism and the proliferation of biological weapons capabilities have increased concern about how the rapid advances in genetic engineering and biotechnology could enable the production of biological weapons with unique and unpredictable characteristics. The nature of the biotechnology problem—indeed the nature of the biological research enterprise—is vastly different from that of theoretical and applied nuclear physics in the late 1930s. Evolving biotechnology presents an inextricably linked combination of opportunity and danger and that distinction turns on projected consequences and attributed intentions at the level of fundamental research. Matthew Meselson gave a stark warning of the potential dangers posed by the destructive applications of biotechnology at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2000.

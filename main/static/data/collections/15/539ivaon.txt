Abstract Despite the fact that macrophages link the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, it’s role in the early infection of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) is largely unknown. Recently, depletion of macrophages in vivo after vaccination has shown to drastically diminish the protection against FMDV challenge in mouse model. Even the ability of macrophages to reduce or resist FMDV infection is not known hitherto. Therefore, we examined the replication ability of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages and the responsiveness in terms of macrophage polarization and cytokine production. Negative strand specific RT-PCR indicated replication of FMDV RNA in macrophages. Absolute quantitation of FMDV transcripts, immunofluorescence studies and titre of the infectious progeny virus revealed that replication peaked at 12 hpi and significantly declined by 18 hpi indicating non-progressive replication in the infected macrophages. Further, significant up regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 8 –12 hpi and increase of M1 specific CD11c + cells by 42.6 % after infection showed that FMDV induce M1 polarization. A significant up regulation of TNFα and IL12 transcripts at 8 hpi supported that M1 macrophages were functional. Further, we studied the expression of Type I to III interferons (IFN) and other antiviral molecules. The results indicate a marked up regulation of Type I IFNα and β by 9.2 and 11.2 fold, respectively at 8 hpi. Of the four IFN stimulated genes (ISG), viperin showed a significant up regulation by 286-fold at 12 hpi in the mice macrophages. In conclusion, the results suggest that replication of FMDV in mice peritoneal macrophages is non-progressive with up regulation of Type I IFN and ISGs. Further, FMDV induces M1 polarization in murine peritoneal macrophages.

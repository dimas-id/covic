Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that exploit host cell machineries for replication. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of host cell nuclear proteins whose translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm is induced and utilized by viruses to support viral replication and infection. Utilization of nuclear proteins for viral replication and infection involves disruption of nuclear import, enhancement of nuclear export, removal of nuclear localization signal (NLS) from nuclear proteins and alteration of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to cooperatively support viral replication. Understanding of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport system, and associated mechanisms, utilized by viruses will advance therapeutic development of strategies to produce optimal antiviral agents effective in control of viral diseases.

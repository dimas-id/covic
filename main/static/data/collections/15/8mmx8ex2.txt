To study naive and memory CD8 T cell turnover, we performed BrdU incorporation experiments in adult thymectomized C57BL/6 mice and analyzed data in a mathematical framework. The following aspects were novel: 1) we examined the bone marrow, in addition to spleen and lymph nodes, and took into account the sum of cells contained in the three organs; 2) to describe both BrdU-labeling and -delabeling phase, we designed a general mathematical model, in which cell populations were distinguished based on the number of divisions; 3) to find parameters, we used the experimentally determined numbers of total and BrdU(+) cells and the BrdU-labeling coefficient. We treated mice with BrdU continuously via drinking water for up to 42 days, measured by flow cytometry BrdU incorporation at different times, and calculated the numbers of BrdU(+) naive (CD44(int/low)) and memory (CD44(high)) CD8 T cells. By fitting the model to data, we determined proliferation and death rates of both subsets. Rates were confirmed using independent sets of data, including the numbers of BrdU(+) cells at different times after BrdU withdrawal. We found that both doubling time and half-life of the memory population were approximately 9 wk, whereas for the naive subset the doubling time was almost 1 year and the half-life was roughly 7 wk. Our findings suggest that the higher turnover of memory CD8 T cells as compared with naive CD8 T cells is mostly attributable to a higher proliferation rate. Our results have implications for interpreting physiological and abnormal T cell kinetics in humans.

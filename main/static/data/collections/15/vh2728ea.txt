The aim of the study was to detect Listeria spp., particularly Listeria monocytogenes, in cattle and environment of pasture based dairy farms in Paysand√∫, Uruguay. A two-stage sampling was conducted, 10 farms were selected by probability proportional to size. A single visit was made to each farm. Samples from bovine faeces, feedstuffs, bulk tank milk, drinking water and soil from the entry and exit pens of the milking parlour were collected for bacteriological studies. PCR assays were used to confirm species and determine the serotype profile of L. monocytogenes isolates. AscI-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was done to genetically compare them. Listeria spp. were isolated from eight of ten dairy farms, whereas L. monocytogenes in three of them. Serotype distribution in L. monocytogenes was as follows: 1/2a, three isolates; 4b, one isolate. L. monocytogenes or L. innocua excreted from clinically healthy milking cows was detected via faeces. In feedstuffs, only one L. monocytogenes 1/2a isolate from a pasture was obtained. The strain was identical by PFGE to an isolate 1/2a obtained from a pool of milking cow feces that grazed on this farm. No isolation of Listeria spp. was retrieved from the bulk tank milk or drinking water from any of the farms. Listeria innocua was detected in 13 feedstuffs and seven samples of soil from the entry and exit pens of the milking parlour. This is a first local study that confirms the presence of Listeria spp. including L. monocytogenes in healthy cattle and environment of pasture-based dairy farms. These results suggest the potential role that healthy cattle and their sub-products would play as a source of these agents for humans and/or others animals. More detailed studies that include genetic comparison of human and animal isolates are required in order to clearly establish the epidemiological relationship.(AU)

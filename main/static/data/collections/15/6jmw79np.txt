We have discovered a novel chemical compound, (E)-3-(furan-2-yl)-N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl) acrylamide, that suppresses the enzymatic activities of SARS coronavirus helicase. To determine the inhibitory effect, ATP hydrolysis and double-stranded DNA unwinding assays were performed in the presence of various concentrations of the compound. Through these assays, we obtained IC50 values of 2.09 ± 0.30 µM (ATP hydrolysis) and 13.2 ± 0.9 µM (DNA unwinding), respectively. Moreover, we found that the compound did not have any significant cytotoxicity when 40 µM of it was used. Our results showed that the compound might be useful to be developed as an inhibitor against SARS coronavirus.

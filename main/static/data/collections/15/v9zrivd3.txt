The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic initially presented in the United States in the greater Seattle area, and has rapidly progressed across the nation in the past 2 months, with the United States having the highest number of cases in the world.

In addition, radiology workflows, volumes and access must be optimized in preparation for the expected COVID-19 patient surges.

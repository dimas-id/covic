This paper describes the formalisation of SGAC access control policies using Z3 and then we compare the performance with ProB and Alloy. SGAC is an attribute-based, fine-grain access control model that uses acyclic subject and resource graphs to provide rule inheritance and streamline policy specification. To ensure patient privacy and safety, four types of properties are checked: accessibility, availability, contextuality and rule effectiveness. Automatic translation of SGAC policies into each specification language has been defined. ProB offers the best verification performances, by two orders of magnitude. The performances of Alloy and Z3 are similar.

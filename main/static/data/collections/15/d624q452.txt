Long-term diabetes increases the likelihood of developing secondary damage to numerous systems, and these complications represent a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality.

In this Review, we focus on four common complications of diabetes, discuss the range of pathologies that are precipitated by hyperglycaemia and highlight emerging targets for therapeutic intervention.

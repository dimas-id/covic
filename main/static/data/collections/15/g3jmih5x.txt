There has been a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) since December 2019. In clinical practice, not only fever and respiratory tract symptoms but also multiple organ symptoms are observed in patients diagnosed with COVID‐19. Herein, we report a rare case of a patient diagnosed with COVID‐19 who manifested with concomitant neurological symptoms. The patient developed fever and respiratory symptoms at disease onset, followed by muscle soreness, and subsequently altered consciousness and psychiatric symptoms, with positive signs based on neurological examination. The patient tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) nucleic acid (throat swab). Further, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed typical COVID‐19 findings, and head CT did not reveal significant abnormalities. The patient recovered after treatment and was discharged. This rare case indicates that SARS‐CoV‐2 can invade the central nervous system, thus causing neurological symptoms and signs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

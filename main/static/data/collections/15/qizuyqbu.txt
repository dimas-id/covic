OBJECTIVE To report a case of pH1N1 viral infection presenting as heart failure requiring mechanical extracorporeal life support. DESIGN Case report. SETTING Pediatric intensive care unit at a regional children's hospital. PATIENT Obese 15-yr-old boy who presented with pH1N1-related cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure that required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. INTERVENTIONS Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, echocardiography, high-frequency oscillating ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Discovery of severe dilated cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS Patients with pH1N1 may present in profound heart failure in addition to respiratory failure. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may play an important role in managing these complex patients.

SARS CoV-2 has particularly been efficient in ensuring that many countries are brought to a standstill. With repercussions ranging from rampant mortality, fear, paranoia and economic recession, the virus has brought together countries in order to look at possible therapeutic countermeasures. With prophylactic interventions possibly months away from being particularly effective, a slew of measures and possibilities concerning the design of vaccines are being worked upon. We attempted a structure-based approach utilizing a combination of epitope prediction servers to develop a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine that involves the two major domains of the spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2 (S1 and S2) coupled with a substantially effective chimeric adjuvant to create stable vaccine constructs through MD simulations. The designed constructs were evaluated based on their docking with Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 4. Our findings provide an epitope-based peptide fragment; which can be a potential candidate for the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Recent experimental studies based on determining immunodominant regions across the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the presence of the predicted epitopes included in this study.

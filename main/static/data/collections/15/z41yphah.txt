Clinical signs of a winter dysentery-like syndrome in 6- to 9-month-old cattle in 3 feedlots included acute onset of diarrhea with high morbidity and low mortality, respiratory tract problems that included dyspnea, coughing, and nasal discharge, and high rectal temperatures. Bovine coronavirus was detected by use of an ELISA and immune electron microscopy in fecal and nasal swab samples and by immunohistochemical analysis of intestinal sections collected from calves during necropsy. Bovine coronavirus should be considered in the differential diagnoses for diseases that cause acute onset of bloody diarrhea in feedlot cattle.

Abstract The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the knowledge gained over the last few years on Feline Infectious Peritonitis in a synthetic way. Apart from the bibliographical study regarding the works of numerous authors, we state our results concerning the study of the experimental reproduction of the disease. From all the cat infectious diseases, Feline Infectious Peritonitis is the clinical entity the most recently evidenced. In this paper we shall state the elements now clearly established on this disease but numerous points are still to be made clear. Contagious disease of viral origin, it affects domestic and wild Felidae. Clinically, in its most typical form, it is characterised by the progressive development of an exudative sero-fibrinous peritonitis and a febrile and gradual weakness of the general condition. It slowly and regularly develops into death.

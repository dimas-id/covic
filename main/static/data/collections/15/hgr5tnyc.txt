OBJECTIVE To discuss the possible death risk factors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS Twenty-five patients suffered from SARS with ARDS in the intensive care unit were retrospectively analyzed from December 2002 to April 2003. Statistical analysis was made using SPSS 10.0 and forward stepwise (wald) logistic regression analysis were used to determine the interrelationships between multiple variables and death. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The following factors were associated with a significantly higher mortality rate in the SARS with ARDS patients, including age increase (OR=1.203, CI=1.036 to 1.396, P=0.016), long-time hypoxia(OR=1.067, CI=1.014 to 1.122, P=0.013), thrombocytopenia(OR=111.932, CI=6.096 to 2 055.252, P=0.001), hypernatremia (OR=26.667, CI=2.242 to 317.147, P=0.009), and elevation of serum creatinine levels (OR=111.932, CI=6.096 to 2 055.252, P=0.001). CONCLUSION More attention should be paid to deal with these risk factors and to prevent the development of serious complications associated with SARS.

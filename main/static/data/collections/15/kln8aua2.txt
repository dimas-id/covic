Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is the main reason for ICU admission in patients with haematological malignancies. High mortality rates of up to 50% are reported in this situation, and mortality is highest when mechanical ventilation is needed. Rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed in these vulnerable patients to ensure the prompt initiation of effective treatment. However, the broad array of possible cause of ARF raises diagnostic challenges. In this review, we discuss the DIRECT strategy, which identifies the most plausible diagnosis in each patient based on the type of immune deficiency and clinical presentation. We will focus on non-invasive laboratory tests developed in recent years, discussing their sensitivity and specificity. We also discuss the usefulness in cancer patients with specific organ dysfunctions of biomarkers introduced over the past few years.

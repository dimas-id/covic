INTRODUCTION Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) causes mortality up to 90%. METHODS A total of 99 patients with BAO received either endovascular (endovascular mechanical recanalization and/or intra-arterial with optional intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] as bridging concept) or conservative medical treatment (IVT and/or medical oral therapy). Outcome parameters were measured in accordance with the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. RESULTS In all, 78% underwent endovascular and 22% conservative medical treatment. The NIHSS at admission was 20 in both the groups. Postprocedurally, 36% (95% confidence interval: 26%-48%) of the endovascular group and 9% (21%-64%) of the conservative group reached TICI 3 (P = .017). In all, 30% of the endovascular group and 9% of the conservative group were documented with TICI 2b (P = .057). At 90 days follow-up, 45% (31%-60%) of the endovascular-treated patientsand no patient (0%-25%) of the conservative-treated group reached mRS â‰¤2 (P = .012). CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment of BAO provides a better chance to survive this severe condition with good clinical outcome.

Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona – Latin for ‘crown’), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido – Latin for ‘nest’) of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), first reported in 2012, is likely transmitted from camels to humans with potentially fatal consequences. To date, there are no approved vaccines or direct acting antiviral drugs to combat coronavirus infections in humans. The emergence or re-emergence of CoVs from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health.

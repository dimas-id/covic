On November 15, 2006, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) was notified of a case of salmonellosis (a nationally notifiable disease) in an employee of a facility that produced poultry vaccine. When a second case of salmonellosis in another employee at the same facility was reported on November 25, MDHHS began an outbreak investigation. Results of that investigation suggested that 21 employees of the facility became ill during a 1-month period from exposure to a strain of Salmonella serotype Enteritidis (SE) that was used in vaccine production. Infection was thought to have resulted from environmental contamination after the spill of a liquid containing a high concentration of SE. As a result, MDHHS recommended that the facility improve its infection-control procedures to better protect workers. This outbreak highlights occupational risks that can be associated with the manufacture of veterinary biologics involving human pathogens.

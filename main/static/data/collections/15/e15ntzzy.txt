Even though stroke presents as a variety of clinical syndromes, neuroimaging is the most important biomarker to help differentiate between stroke subtypes and assess treatment eligibility. Therapeutic advances have led to intravenous thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator and endovascular treatment for proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation being standard care for acute ischaemic stroke. Providing access to this care has implications for existing systems of care for stroke and their organisation and has reintroduced the possibility of adjuvant and neuroprotective treatment strategies in acute ischaemic stroke. The use of neuroimaging for patient selection and speed of diagnosis and delivery of treatment are the dominant themes of modern ischaemic stroke care.

Conventional hemostatic technologies utilized in thyroid surgery include clamp-and-tie, clips and monopolar and bipolar diathermy. Over the last decade, there has been a major shift towards utilizing newer hemostatic technologies, most notably the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing systems (EBVS) and the Harmonic Scalpel (Ethicon Endosurgery, OH, USA), for thyroid surgery. Since the first report of EBVS thyroidectomy in 2003, more than 50 studies have been published evaluating EBVS utilization for thyroid surgery. In addition to providing a historical perspective and exploring the principles of EBVS technology, this review aims to evaluate the current published data regarding EBVS utilization for thyroid surgery. In particular, a focus is given to LigaSure (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) technology because it has been studied most thoroughly in the literature. This review will also evaluate studies comparing the EBVS with Harmonic Scalpel technology for thyroid surgery.

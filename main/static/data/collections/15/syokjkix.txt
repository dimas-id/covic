BACKGROUND Extended thymectomy is indicated for children with myasthenia gravis (MG) when drug-resistance or dependence is seen. We have employed a technique for mediastinoscopic extended thymectomy (MET) on children with MG. METHOD A total of 14 children underwent MET at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center between 2005 and 2013. A mediastinal operation field was made by a V-shaped hook infrasternally to extirpate the thymus with adipose tissue around the thymus. RESULTS The operation time and the amount of blood loss were 182±44 minutes and 34±43 ml, respectively. Postoperative complications, in the form of transient paralysis of the right recurrent nerve, occurred in 2 patients. The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days. After MET, 6 patients achieved complete remission and 7 patients achieved steroid dose reduction, but no improvement was seen in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS This procedure offers the advantage of good surgical access for dissection around the bilateral phrenic nerves in extended total thymectomy, while achieving good cosmetic results.

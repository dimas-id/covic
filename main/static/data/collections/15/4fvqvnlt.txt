BACKGROUND Surgical procedures in pancreatic surgery are well established, but still involve time-consuming manual dissection. We compared the use of LigaSure with conventional dissection techniques in pancreatic surgery in a prospective randomised single-centre trial (registration number: NCT00850291). METHODS Patients with tumours of the pancreatic head that were assumed to be technically resectable were randomised to LigaSure or conventional surgery. The primary endpoint of this study was overall operation time. Secondary endpoints were preparation time until tumour resection, intraoperative blood loss, number of given units of packed red blood cells, costs of surgery, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality. RESULTS There was no difference in overall operation time between the two groups (P = 0.227). Median costs for pancreatic surgery were significantly less in the conventional group with €3,047 (range 2,004-5,543) vs. €3,527 (range 2,516-5,056, P = 0.009). Preparation time, intraoperative blood loss, number of units of packed red blood cells, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION Our data indicate that the LigaSure device is equivalent to conventional dissection modalities in pancreatic surgery.

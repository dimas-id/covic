Tracheostomy procedures have a high risk of aerosol generation. Airway providers have reflected on ways to mitigate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission risks when approaching a surgical airway. To standardize institutional safety measures with tracheostomy, we advocate using a dedicated tracheostomy time-out applicable to all patients including those suspected of having COVID-19. The aim of the tracheostomy time-out is to reduce preventable errors that may increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

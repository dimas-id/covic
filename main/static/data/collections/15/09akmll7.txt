Groin hernia repair by using the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair approach presents lower post-operative pain with a quicker return to normal patient activity compared to the open technique. Nevertheless, the long learning curve, general anaesthesia, and increased costs due to devices are the arguments against TAPP. Currently, the only mesh fixation techniques are those using glue or tacks. We report the audit of two years follow-up about our experience using a self-gripping lightweight mesh Parietex ProGrip™ (Covidien, Trevoux, France). The records of 39 patients for the first 50 procedures were reported. We registered wound infection, hematoma, seroma, neuralgia, numbness, and recurrence. In our opinion, TAPP procedure with ProGrip™ mesh is a feasible procedure without using fixation devices; costs, chronic pain and recovery are improved. Moreover, in the medium-term follow-up, we are able to reduce foreign body sensation and numbness.

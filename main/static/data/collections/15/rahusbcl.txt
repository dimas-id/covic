OBJECTIVE This article estimates the incidence and fatality of COVID-19 and identify potential risk factors to fatality in patients with active epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a cross-sectional observational study of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19. A control group was used to compare the cumulative incidence and case fatality rate (CFR). The main outcomes of the study were cumulative incidence, defined as number of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19 admitted in emergency department divided by the total number of patients with epilepsy at risk; and CFR based on the number of deaths during the enrolment period. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with active epilepsy. RESULTS Of the 1537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 21 (1.3%) had active epilepsy. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of COVID-19 in epilepsy patients was higher (1.2% [0.6-2.4]) compared to population without epilepsy (0.5% [0.5-0.5]). In RT-PCR positive patients there were no significant differences in CFR in patients with active epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy (33.3% vs. 8.3%; p =0.266). Of the 21 active epilepsy patients, 5 (23%) died. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with fatality in patients with active epilepsy was hypertension (OR [95%CI], 2.8 [1.3-21.6]). In other model age (OR [95%CI], 1.0 [1.0-1.1]) and epilepsy (OR [95%CI], 5.1 [1.3-24.0]) were associated with fatality during hospitalization. CONCLUSION COVID-19 cumulative incidence were higher in patients with active epilepsy. Epilepsy was associated with fatality during hospitalization. Hypertension was associated with fatality in patients with epilepsy.

Echinaforce速 is the standardised extract of Echinacea purpurea from Bioforce, Switzerland. Recent studies show immunomodulation and broad antiviral effects against respiratory tract viruses. Haemagglutinin and Neuraminidase are blocked. In contrast to Oseltamivir no resistance is caused by Echinaforce速. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over four months confirms that Echinaforce速 supports the immune resistance and acts directly against a series of viruses. Echinaforce速 is efficacious and safe in respiratory tract infections for long-term and short-term prevention as well as for acute treatment.

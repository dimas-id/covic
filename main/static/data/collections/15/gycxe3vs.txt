Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by infection with feline coronavirus (FCoV), a highly infectious virus transmitted mostly indirectly, by sharing litter trays with a FCoV excretor, or by fomites. The majority of FCoV-infected cats remain healthy, with up to 12% developing FIP. While any age or breed of cat can develop FIP, FIP disproportionately affects pedigree kittens: most studies found that around 70% of FIP cases occurred in pure-bred cats under 2 years of age. In this paper, some questions about FCoV and FIP that are likely to be asked of, and by, a veterinary nurse will be addressed.

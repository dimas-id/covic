PURPOSE Cicatricial entropion is typically an acquired condition that can affect the upper and lower eyelids. The purpose of this prospective study is to examine the effect of shared buccal mucosal grafts for simultaneous repair of severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion on eyelid position. METHODS Patients at the University of Texas-Southwestern Medical Center Aston Ophthalmology clinic were identified who were diagnosed with cicatricial entropion. Patients found to have severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion were included in the study if they had undergone or were scheduled to undergo simultaneous upper and lower eyelid repair through the use of a shared mucosal graft. Pre-operative exams which included pre-operative photos and description of eyelid position were performed. Shared mucosal graft surgery was performed. At post-operative week 1, the patients had splitting of their shared mucosal grafts. Post-operative photos as well as post-operative description of eyelid position were made at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS At 6 months after surgical repair of severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion by shared mucosal grafts, patients were found to have resolution of entropic eyelid position as well improvement in ocular surface irritation. No adverse events were found and no graft failures occurred. CONCLUSIONS The use of a shared mucosal graft for the repair of severe upper and lower eyelid entropion, when sufficient tarsal structural support is present, is effective for the correction of eyelid malpositions and ocular surface irritation.

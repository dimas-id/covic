The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is challenging in symptomatic COVID-19 patients since shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnoea, fever, oxygen desaturation and high D-dimer blood levels might be features of both diseases We present two COVID-19 patients in whom pulmonary embolism was suspected (and diagnosed) due to a discrepancy between an increase in D-dimer blood levels and a decrease in C-reactive protein blood levels over time We believe that an opposite change in the blood levels of both biomarkers over time may be used as a novel method to predict pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients LEARNING POINTS: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is challenging in COVID-19 patients since symptoms, signs and high D-dimer blood levels might be similar in both diseases An increase in D-dimer blood levels and a decrease in C-reactive protein blood levels over time may be used as a novel method to predict pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients

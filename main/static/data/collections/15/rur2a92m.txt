New developments in small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering studies of biological macromolecules in solution are presented. Small-angle scattering is rapidly becoming a streamline tool in structural molecular biology providing unique information about overall structure and conformational changes of native individual proteins, functional complexes, flexible macromolecules and assembly processes.

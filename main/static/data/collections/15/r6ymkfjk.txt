The positive-strand transcripts as well as negative-strand transcripts of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNA, when introduced into MHV-infected cells, resulted in DI RNA replication and accumulation. The leader sequence of the majority of DI RNAs that accumulated from the expression of negative-strand DI RNA transcripts with no extra non-MHV nucleotides at the 3' end switched to that of helper virus, whereas this leader sequence switching did not occur in most of the positive-strand DI RNAs that accumulated from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts with extra non-MHV nucleotides at the 3' end. These data demonstrated that the extra 4 nucleotides at the 3'-end of negative-strand DI RNA transcripts affected leader sequence switching on DI RNA, and indicated that the leader switching probably occurred during positive-strand DI RNA synthesis.

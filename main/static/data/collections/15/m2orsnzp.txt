Given the devastating consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on all of us, the question arises as to whether manipulating the cellular degradation (recycling, waste disposal) mechanism known as macroautophagy/autophagy (in particular, the selective degradation of virus particles, termed virophagy) might be a beneficial approach to fight the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Knowing that "autophagy can reprocess everything", it seems almost inevitable that, sooner rather than later, a further hypothesis-driven work will detail the role of virophagy as a fundamental "disposal strategy" against COVID-19, yielding most needed therapeutic interventions.

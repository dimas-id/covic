We herein present an innovative technique of laparoscopic posterior mesh rectopexy (LPMR) for full-thickness rectal prolapse and report the clinical outcomes in our institution. Ten consecutive patients who were treated with our latest LPMR technique using mesh with an anti-adhesion coating from June 2014 to May 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were women with a mean age of 63.6 years (range, 39 to 82 y). The median operative time and blood loss volume were 197.5 minutes (range, 156 to 285 min) and 0 mL (range, 0 to 152 mL), respectively. No perioperative complications occurred, including surgical site infection, pneumonia, urinary dysfunction, and intestinal obstruction. The median follow-up duration was 768 days (range, 396 to 1150 d). During the follow-up, the cumulative incidence of full-thickness rectal prolapse and any mesh-related complications was 0. It may be possible to eliminate retroperitoneal closure using a mesh with an anti-adhesion coating. Our LPMR technique appears safe and acceptable.

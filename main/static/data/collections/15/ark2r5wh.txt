Background: A recent study has discussed ways of China's success in overcoming COVID-19, presenting three concerns that occur in China that should also be addressed by each country, namely regarding emergency response measures; mobilize resources quickly; encourage people to have participated in the actions taken. Among the approaches taken by China, three ways consisting of lockdown; the willingness of people to be patient in obeying the actions taken; distancing; in our view, it is further urged to be the similar consensus adopted by each country as at least the three basic principles that required for in the strategy against the COVID-19 outbreak. Vietnam can be a representative example to discuss, understand and realize the importance of these three basic principles enough to say that it also supports them as the first country to date, to our knowledge, with all sufferers of COVID-19 successfully cured at one time, discussing what essentially has not been analyzed concerning the traditional epidemiological approach known to effectively control the transmission of an outbreak. Main text: Vietnam has responded timely by immediately announced the state of national health emergency and implemented a partial quarantine or lockdown policy with initially only a ban on coming from and going out to China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau and the people in Vietnam, unspeakably, are patient and spread out or distanced. These actions of the Vietnamese seem to have had arguably an impact on all COVID-19 sufferers successfully cured in one time and the absence of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection that lasted for some time. Conclusions: The recent study who thereafter concludes the need for global coordination in interventions and responses to the outbreak by reflecting lessons from China has demonstrated the implications supporting our view of the need for a consensus similarly by each authority regarding at least the three basic principles that required for to be performed in controlling the outbreak transmission, COVID-19, in the form of the lockdown, patience in facing outbreak situations, and distancing that all of those performed simultaneously.

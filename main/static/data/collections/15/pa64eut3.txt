In the current COVID-19 pandemic, tremendous pressure is been exerted on the existing health infrastructure of many developing nations. Limb salvage surgeries in bone and soft tissue sarcomas cannot be delayed beyond a certain time-period and constitute an orthopaedic emergency in certain situations. Evaluation of intra-operative surgical margins forms an important step especially in cases with planned close margins or intercalary resections. Techniques such as imprint cytology can be preferred over frozen sections for evaluation of the surgical margins especially in COVID-19 positive patients. The advantages it offers such as completion of the procedure within the operation room complex, no generation of aerosols, and almost equal sensitivity and specificity when compared with frozen section method do warrant a modification of current surgical practice in the current health crisis especially in resource-constrained nations. Awareness and better communication regarding the same from the pathologist to the surgical team will go a long way in conserving resources and avoid unnecessary exposure to potentially infected aerosols.

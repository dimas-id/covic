Abstract HIV-related diarrhoea is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV infection. Cytomegalovirus is a well-established cause of diarrhoea, but the role of other enteric viruses is less clear and will be discussed here. The clinical manifestations, disease mechanisms, diagnostic techniques and current treatments for the management of these infections are reviewed.

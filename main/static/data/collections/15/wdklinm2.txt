The ACE2 receptor plays a central role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 host cell entry and propagation. It has therefore been postulated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may upregulate ACE2 expression and thus increase susceptibility to infection. We suggest that alternative anti-hypertensive agents should be preferred among individuals who may be exposed to this increasingly common and potentially lethal virus.

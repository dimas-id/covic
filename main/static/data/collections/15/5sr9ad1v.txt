The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed many healthcare systems, including the NHS, under unprecedented pressure. Mortality appears to be highest among older people and those with comorbidities, who are also often the most at risk of undernutrition in society. Despite international efforts to identify a specific treatment, therapy remains supportive and is principally focused on optimising respiratory function. However, the timely identification and correction of undernutrition also have the potential to improve outcomes cost-effectively, and should not be forgotten. This piece outlines why nutritional status may be particularly compromised during this crisis, among both the population and hospital inpatients. Practical steps to improve nutritional status at a time when hospital services are particularly stretched are also considered. Finally, the case is made for behaviour change at all levels including government, the general population and healthcare professionals.

BACKGROUND: Peyer’s patches (PPs) can be considered as the immune site of the intestine. Within PPs, Dendritic cells (DCs) can uptake antigens from the gut lumen by extending dendrites into epithelium, and process it and then present to lymphocytes, which effectively antigen produces an immune response. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease. The interaction between inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) has been reported. However, little is known about the interaction between inactivated PEDV and DCs in porcine PPs. RESULTS: In this study, for the first time we investigated the role of DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration inactivated PEDV. Firstly, a method to isolate DCs from porcine PPs was established, in which the purity of SWC3a(+)/MHC-II(+) DCs was more than 90%. Our findings clearly indicate that DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration of inactivated PEDV not only stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, but also secreted cytokines (IL-1, IL-4). Furthermore, the number of DCs and IgA(+) cells in porcine intestinal mucosal significantly increased and the levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the serum and SIgA antibody in the feces increased after oral administration inactivated PEDV. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that oral administration of inactivated PEDV activate DCs in porcine Peyer’s patches and inactivated PEDV may be a useful and safe vaccine to trigger adaptive immunity.

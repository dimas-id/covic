Summary We describe a case of bronchiolitis associated with the newly detected human bocavirus (hBoV) in a child with a suspected Noonan syndrome. This is the first report of a bronchiolitis probably linked to hBoV that required intensive care while being accompanied by a congenital heart disease and a history of several episodes of severe respiratory symptoms.

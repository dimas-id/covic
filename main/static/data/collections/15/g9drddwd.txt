OBJECTIVE To evaluate the influence of the surveillance system and preventive measurements on the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a university in Guangdong Province. METHODS A university with more than thirty thousand undergraduates, staff and their relatives was retrospectively studied, from which information regarding the status of epidemic, organization of leadership, disease control strategies and measures were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The construction of the surveillance system in such a model as "individual-dormitory/home-class/unite-faculty and institute-university" largely contributed to the achievement of the goals of low incidence, no secondary, no epidemic, and no death. A series of control measures benefited the early diagnosis, effective isolation, prevention, and treatment of SARS control. CONCLUSION SARS could be effectively controlled in university only if strict surveillance system is built up, and all-round preventions, including early isolation of both confirmed or suspected cases and close contacted persons, are carried out.

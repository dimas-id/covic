INTRODUCTION Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in Poland, the worldwide pandemic has spread throughout the country, leading to many hospital admissions. There has been urgent need to determine clinical characteristics of Polish patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVES The aim of this retrospective study was to outline characteristics and short-term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively characterized 169 consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, with regard to their: clinical manifestations, radiological findings, treatment, complications and outcomes. RESULTS Of the 169 patients, more than half was aged 65 (n=88, 52,1%) or above, 51,5% were male and 78,3% had comorbidities. Majority of patients (n=106, 62.7%) were transferred from outbreak locations in medical facilities. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (42%), shortness of breath (35%) and fatigue (33%). 27 (15.4%) of patients required intensive care unit admission. Overall mortality was 26.3% (n=46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106, 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63, 12.69%, p<0.001). 17 out of 29 patients admitted to ICU died (mortality = 58,6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with ARDS (73.2% mortality rate in ARDS patients). Conclusion: Polish COVID-19 patients have the similar characteristics and risk factors for adverse outcomes as already observed in countries in which outbreaks occurred earlier. Significantly higher mortality in patients transferred from other centers warrants special attention and transfer policy should be verified.

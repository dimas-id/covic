BACKGROUND The correct size of cuffed endotracheal tube (CET) limits the risk of postintubation tracheal damage. The aim of this study was to compare the size of the CET used in children with the size predicted by the Khine formula [age (years)/4 + 3]. METHODS After ethical committee approval, 204 children aged 1 day-15 years were included prospectively in the study. The choice of the size of the CET was made at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. The main criterion of judgment was the comparison of the leak before and after inflating the cuff at a pressure of 20 cm.H(2)O. Demographic data, tracheal tube size used and that predicted by Khine's formulae and side-effects were recorded. RESULTS Overall, 21% of the CET were in accordance with the size predicted by the Khine formula. In the remaining patients, 72% were oversized and 7% undersized. In 12 cases, the size of CET chosen initially was modified: for a larger size in eight children and for a smaller size in four others. Six children (2.9%) presented with minor postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that Khine's formula for predicting the appropriate tracheal tube size underestimates optimal size by 0.5 mm. We therefore recommend the use of the following formula: internal diameter of the CET = [age/4 + 3.5] in children >1 year of age which may be applied without increased risk of complications. The rate of tracheal reintubation as well as the detected leaks supports these recommendations.

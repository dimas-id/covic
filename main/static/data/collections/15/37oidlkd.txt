Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) constitutes the first new infectious disease of the current millennium. It is caused by the novel SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS is related to a high morbidity and mortality and first appeared during an epidemic in 2002 - 2003. To date no specific therapy against the SARS-CoV is available. Due to the rapid spread of SARS during the epidemics in 2002 - 2003, randomised and controlled multicentre studies were not performed. Therefore, general guidelines have not been developed. Since the outbreak, scientists have been testing potential antiviral substances using in vitro and animal models. This study analyses the presently available in vitro and in vivo data on the pharmacotherapy of SARS.

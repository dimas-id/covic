A 51-year-old woman with COVID-19 infection developed coma and an impaired oculocephalic response to one side. MRI of the brain demonstrated acute multifocal demyelinating lesions, and CSF testing did not identify a direct cerebral infection. High-dose steroids followed by a course of IVIG was administered, and the patient regained consciousness over the course of several weeks. As more patients reach the weeks after initial infection with COVID-19, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis should be considered a potentially treatable cause of profound encephalopathy or multifocal neurological deficits.

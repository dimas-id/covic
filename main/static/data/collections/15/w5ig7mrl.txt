BACKGROUND. To impart principles of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) and infection prevention and control (IPC), we developed a curriculum tailored to the diverse aptitudes of learners at our medical center. METHODS. We integrated case-based modules, group learning activities, smartphone applications (apps), decision support tools, and prescription audit and feedback into curricula of the medical school, medicine residency program, infectious diseases (ID) fellowship program, and hospital medicine program operations. Interventions were implemented in 2012â€“2016 using a quasi-experimental before-and-after study design, and this was assessed using pre- and postintervention surveys or audit of antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS. Over 180 medical students participated in the AS and IPC seminars. After smartphone app introduction, 69% reported using the app as their preferred source of antibiotic information. Approximately 70% of students felt comfortable prescribing antibiotics for a known infection compared with 40% at baseline (P = .02), and approximately 83% were able to identify the appropriate personal protective equipment for specific scenarios. Approximately 99% agreed that they have a role in promoting patient safety and preventing healthcare-associated infections as medical students. At 20 months, appropriateness of trainee antibiotic prescriptions increased by 20% (P < .01). Almost all ID fellows indicated that the AS and IPC seminar was a vital training supplement. Uptake of internist antibiotic recommendations using AS decision support tools was approximately 70%. CONCLUSIONS. All 5 interventions addressed learning objectives and knowledge gaps and are applicable across a range of environments. Evaluating long-term impact of our curriculum is the focus of future study.

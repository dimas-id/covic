Technological advances in immunology, protein design, and genetic delivery have unlocked new possibilities for vaccine concepts and delivery technologies that were previously inaccessible. These next-generation vaccine design efforts are particularly promising in their potential to provide solutions to challenging targets for which conventional approaches have proven ineffectiveâ€”for example, a universal influenza vaccine. In this perspective, we discuss emerging approaches to vaccine design and engineering based on recent insights into immunology, structural biology, computational biology, and immunoengineering. We anticipate that these cutting-edge, interdisciplinary approaches will lead to breakthrough vaccine concepts for ever-evolving and (re)emerging influenza viruses, with important ramifications for global public health.

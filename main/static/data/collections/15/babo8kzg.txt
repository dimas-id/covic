Many academics and researchers have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by forming on-line national and international collaborative groups to rapidly investigate issues of prevention and treatment. This commentary describes the spontaneous formation of an international team of 115 researchers who summarized the literature on safe methods for decontaminating N95 filtering facepiece respirators in response to the supply crisis. The summary reports and fact sheets on the (www.n95decon.org) website have had more than 200 000 unique visits and the organization's webinars have reached health care professionals from more than 50 countries. The team is extending its mission to cover other personal protective equipment. The success of these collaborations may alter how scientific questions are tackled in the future.

The etiologic role of recently identified respiratory viruses for acute wheezing in children is not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of recently identified viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV‐NL63), and human coronavirus HKU1 (hCoV‐HKU1) in children with acute wheezing. Viral etiology was identified in 231 children hospitalized with acute wheezing, aged from 1 month to 5 years. Viral antigens for common respiratory viruses were detected by IFA or multiplex PCR. RT‐PCR was used to detect respiratory rhinoviruses, hCoV‐NL63, hCoV‐HKU1, and hMPV. PCR assays for hBoV DNA were performed using the primer sets for noncapsid protein (NP1) and nonstructural protein (NS1) genes. Viruses were found in 61.5% (142/231) of the study population and a single virus was detected in 45.5% (105/231) of the study population. Rhinovirus (33.3%), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV; 13.8%), and hBoV (13.8%) were the most frequently detected viruses. hMPV and hCoV‐NL63 were detected in 7.8% and 1.3% of wheezing children, respectively. HCoV‐HKU1 was not detected. In 16.0% of the study population, more than one virus was detected. In children with acute wheezing, rhinovirus, hRSV, and hBoV were most frequently detected. Further studies including healthy control subjects are needed to define the clinical significance of hBoV in acute wheezing. J. Med. Virol. 79: 1238–1243, 2007. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The airport is the frontier between the outside world and the State in which the airline passenger lands. It is also the final point at which a person can be checked before embarking on a flight. Moreover, the aerodrome is where cargo is loaded into an aircraft before takeoff. Therefore, security at the airport carries multiple dimensions, from border control to body scanning; from cargo security to security of the aircraft and its passengers.

BACKGROUND: Reducing medical errors and minimizing complications have become the focus of quality improvement in medicine. Failure-to-rescue (FTR) is defined as death after a surgical complication, which is an institution-level surgical safety and quality metric that is an important variable affecting mortality rates in hospitals. This study aims to examine whether complication and FTR are different across low- and high-mortality hospitals for trauma care. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at trauma care hospitals registered at Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) from 2004 to 2017. Trauma patients aged ≥ 15 years with injury severity score (ISS) of ≥ 3 and those who survived for > 48 h after hospital admission were included. The hospitals in JTDB were categorized into three groups by standardized mortality rate. We compared trauma complications, FTR, and in-hospital mortality by a standardized mortality rate (divided by the institute-level quartile). RESULTS: Among 184,214 patients that were enrolled, the rate of any complication was 12.7%. The overall mortality rate was 3.7%, and the mortality rate among trauma patients without complications was only 2.8% (non-precedented deaths). However, the mortality rate among trauma patients with any complications was 10.2% (FTR). Hospitals were categorized into high- (40 facilities with 44,773 patients), average- (72 facilities with 102,368 patients), and low- (39 facilities with 37,073 patients) mortality hospitals, using the hospital ranking of a standardized mortality rate. High-mortality hospitals showed lower ISS than low-mortality hospitals [10 (IQR, 9–18) vs. 11 (IQR, 9–20), P < 0.01]. Patients in high-mortality hospitals showed more complications (14.2% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.01), in-hospital mortality (5.1% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.01), FTR (13.6% vs. 7.4%, P < 0.01), and non-precedented deaths (3.6% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.01) than those in low-mortality hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports of elective surgery, complication rates and FTR are associated with in-hospital mortality rates at the center level in trauma care.

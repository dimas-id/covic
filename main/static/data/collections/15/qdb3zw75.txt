AIM: To study the clinical impact of multiple viral respiratory infections compared to single infections. METHODS: Demographic data from 37 multiple infection periods in children <5 years of age were compared to data from 193 episodes with single infections. Clinical data derived from patient records of the multiple infection episodes were further compared to data from 93 matched control episodes with single infections. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with multiple viral findings was 12.7 months, compared to 5.7 months for those with single findings (p < 0.01). Wheezing was the most common diagnosis in both groups, except among children who were only infected with the coronavirus. No differences were found regarding duration of hospitalisation, oxygen treatment or admittance to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Children with multiple viral findings in their respiratory secretions were older than those with a single detected virus. Otherwise, no major differences in comorbidity, presentation or clinical outcome were observed between the two groups.

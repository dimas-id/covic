Caliciviruses infect a wide range of mammalian hosts and include the genus Norovirus, the major cause of food-borne viral gastroenteritis in humans. Using publicly available sequence data and phylogenetic analysis tools, the origins and virus-host co-phylogeny of these viruses were investigated. Here, evidence is presented in support of host switching by caliciviruses, but showing that zoonotic transfer does not appear to have occurred in the history of these viruses. The age or demography of the caliciviruses cannot yet be estimated with any firm degree of support, but further studies of this family, as new dated sequences become available, could provide key information of importance to human health and in understanding the emergence of food-borne disease.

Abstract The state of alarm declared by the Spanish government as the main measure for preventing contagion has involved a change in the clinical management of chronic patients. Although new communication technologies offer us many ways to establish direct but remote contact, the peculiarities of the COPD patient often mean that their healthcare is reduced to telephone calls. The challenge of caring for COPD patients is made even more complex when it has to be delivered over the phone. The interview must be conducted without examining the patient, without performing additional tests, and without checking their inhalation technique. Therefore, healthcare providers who conduct these interviews must be trained to perform them properly in order to make the right decisions. This document is aimed at healthcare professionals who need to provide some form of telephone care to COPD patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and is based on the authors' experience in telephone interviews conducted during this period. It summarizes essential aspects of how this interview should be approached, how to conduct it, what factors should be kept in mind, how to organize the interview, and how to keep patients informed. It is very likely that from now on this type of interview will be common practice in the care of our patients, so we need to learn how to structure a new model of healthcare for many of the clinical visits that have until now been conducted face-to-face.

INTRODUCTION: On March 13, 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Shortly after that, it was reported that mortality rates in New York City (NYC), the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in African American and Hispanics. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as it relates to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation. METHODS: COVID-19 data was obtained from the official New York (NY) authorities in relation to total number of cases in the different boroughs of NYC. Age adjusted COVID-19 related mortality rates of the different ethnic groups were also obtained. This data was cross compared to historic community health data on obesity rates previously published and also obesity rates among the different ethnic groups in NYC. RESULTS: The two NYC boroughs that have the highest mortality rates are The Bronx (6%) and Brooklyn (5.4%). Both The Bronx and Brooklyn were also found to have the highest obesity rates 32% and 27% respectively. The two ethnic groups with the highest obesity rates (Hispanics and African Americans) were also found to have the highest age adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 compared to the other ethnic groups (22.8% and 19.8% respectively). CONCLUSION: Hispanics and African Americans in NYC seem to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because of the higher incidence of mortality rates. Obesity may have played a role in the high incidence of mortality in those ethnic groups.

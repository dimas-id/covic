Fourteen cases of feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-associated enteritis were immunohistologically examined for the expression of FeLV proteins gp70, p27, and p15E in the jejunum, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. Results were compared with those of FeLV-infected cats without intestinal alterations. Other viral infections and specific bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections were excluded by standard microbiologic methods, histopathology, immunohistology, and in situ hybridization. In FeLV-associated enteritis, FeLV gp70 and p15E were strongly expressed in intestinal crypt epithelial cells. In contrast, FeLV-positive cats without intestinal alterations showed only faint staining for gp70 and p15E and comparatively strong p27 expression in these cells. Findings suggest a direct relation between FeLV infection and alterations in intestinal crypt epithelial cells that may be attributed to the envelope proteins gp70 and p15E and/or their precursor protein. Distinct similarities to the intestinal changes in the experimentally induced FeLV-feline AIDS syndrome are obvious, suggesting that naturally occurring feline AIDS variants may be responsible for FeLV-associated enteritis.

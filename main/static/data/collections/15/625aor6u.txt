Five QX-like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains, isolated from different field outbreaks and two reference IBV strains of known serotypes (M41 and 793/B), were used in the present study to investigate and compare their pathogenicity for 1-day-old specific pathogen free chickens. The ability of the strains to inhibit trachea epithelium ciliary activity, to induce immune response, to replicate and to cause histopathological lesions in designated organs was followed by repeated samplings during a period of 42 days post infection. Clear differences in pathogenicity and in organ distribution of the three serotypes were found. Strain 793/B had the least capacity to invade the investigated organs, while it produced a good humoral response as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The QX-like strains generally replicated to higher titres, although differences were found among the five strains in their pathogenicity and affinity for different organs. The Chinese isolate of QX-like virus caused the most severe lesions and induced the highest antibody titres. Severe kidney damage and dilatation of the oviduct were the prominent lesions that could be related to the QX-like IBV strains, although neither marked virus replication nor histopathological lesions were detected in the oviduct.

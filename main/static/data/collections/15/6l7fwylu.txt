As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic spread across the globe, transplant programs suffered a setback. We report the first experience of COVID‐19 infection within 1 month of living donor kidney transplant (LDKT). We describe 2 LDKT recipients who were detected positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection at day 19 and day 7 post‐transplant. They had minimal symptoms at diagnosis and did not develop any respiratory complications or allograft dysfunction. Immunosuppression was de‐escalated; however, nasopharyngeal swab real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) remained positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 for a prolonged time. Younger age, absence of other comorbidities and lower dose of anti‐thymocyte globulin (ATG) used as induction possibly contributed to good outcome in our recent LDKT recipients compared with earlier published cases of recent deceased donor kidney transplant recipients with COVID‐19.

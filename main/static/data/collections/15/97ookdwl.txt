Renal colic is a prevalent emergency department presentation resulting from urolithiasis. Clinical decision rules for the diagnosis of urolithiasis were developed to help clinicians with better judgment. In this systematic review, we assessed the performance of prediction rules on urolithiasis diagnosis and prognosis. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies on the performance of a clinical decision tool for diagnosis or prognosis of urolithiasis. Performance and accuracy of the rules were the key outcomes of interest. Databases were searched from inception to March 2019. Of the 4980 articles reviewed, 28 studies were included in the present analysis. Twenty-one studies were on urolithiasis diagnosis (including eight studies on STONE rule), and 10 studies reported urolithiasis outcomes. Studies were at low to moderate risk of bias. The pooling of data on STONE showed that the prevalence of urolithiasis in low, moderate, and high risk groups were: 12% (95% confidence interval 9%-15%), 53% (95% confidence interval 43%-62%), and 83% (95% confidence interval 75%-91%), respectively. In the high risk score group, prevalence of clinically important alternative diagnosis was 1% (95% confidence interval 0%-2%) and 11% (95% confidence interval 8%-13%) of patients needed intervention. STONE scoring system is useful in estimating the prevalence of urolithiasis but high heterogeneity among the studies makes it unsuitable for application. Other decision tools were poorly studied and cannot be recommended for clinical use.

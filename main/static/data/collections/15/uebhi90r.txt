Thirty-four calf and five infant fecal specimens were tested for the neonatal calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) and for the reovirus-like infantile diarrhea agent; respectively. The procedures used were the fluorescent virus precipitin test and immune electron microscopy. Fourteen of the calf stools contained detectable NCDV, and four of the five infant stools contained the reovirus-like human agent. Infectious NCDV was detected in four of the 34 calf fecal specimens when Madin-Darby bovine kidney cell cultures that had been inoculated with supernatant fluids from stool suspensions were stained with fluorescent antibody. The 20 calf stools that did not have detectable virus were examined for the bovine corona diarrhea virus. Coronavirus was found in two of these specimens.

PURPOSE A panel of Japanese experts on tumor ablation therapy gathered to reach a general consensus on topics surrounding ablation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Questionnaires relating to ablation protocols for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation, as well as ancillary procedures required for safe and secure ablation therapy, were sent to seven institutions. Experts from these institutions discussed each topic based on the evidence and the questionnaire data, and a consensus was reached at an annual meeting of the Japan Image-guided Ablation Group in Maebashi, Japan, in October 2015. RESULTS A consensus was reached on each of six topics, including "management of antiplatelet and anticoagulation drug therapy"; "pain control in the perioperative period"; "arterial embolization combined with ablation therapy"; "protection of non-target organs"; "RFA and cryoablation protocols"; and "ablative margins." CONCLUSIONS The consensus achieved here will serve as the framework for tumor ablation therapies in Japan.

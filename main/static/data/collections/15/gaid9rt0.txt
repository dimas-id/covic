On a pig farm with about 2000 pigs, respiratory problems regularly developed in fattening pigs 3 to 4 weeks after the start of the fattening period. A postmortem examination was carried out on four pigs during the acute phase of their illness. The animals showed signs of viral pneumonia. In two animals porcine respiratory virus (PRCV) was discovered and in the other two animals porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The possible role of these two viruses in the aetiology of the health problems on this farm is discussed in the context of the results of a longitudinal serological study.

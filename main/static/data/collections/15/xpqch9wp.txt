BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has led to major changes in hospital systems across the world. In an effort to reduce viral transmission, conserve resources, and in accordance with institutional and state mandates, all elective procedures and surgeries were postponed during the initial outbreak. Guidelines for case selection are limited and management for pediatric catheterization laboratories during this crisis is unprecedented. OBJECTIVES: To report the protocols and case selection of a high-volume pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory in the epicenter of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: All pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures from March 16, 2020 through May 10, 2020 were reviewed. Changes to case selection and periprocedural workflow are described. Data were collected on COVID-19 testing status and primary procedure type, and all procedures were classified by urgency. RESULTS: There were 52 catheterizations performed on 50 patients. Endomyocardial biopsies were the most common procedure (n = 27; 52%). Interventional and diagnostic procedures represented 27% (n = 14) and 21% (n = 11) of cases, respectively. Two emergent procedures (3.8%) were performed on patients with positive COVID-19 testing. Most cases were performed on patients with negative COVID-19 testing (n = 33; 94%). CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic in a high-volume pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory can be safely and effectively managed by prioritizing emergent and urgent cases and modifying workflow operations. The experience of this center may assist other pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratories in adapting to similar practice changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

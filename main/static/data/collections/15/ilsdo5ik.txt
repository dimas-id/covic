Peripheral T cell lymphomas are heterogeneous diseases which remain treatment challenges. Recent advances in molecular and genomic profiling have provided unprecedented insight into disease pathogenesis driven by distinct cells of origins and molecular pathways. The discovery and clinical application of molecular biomarkers in PTCL subtypes has the potential to transform personalized care for patients with PTCL in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Targeting CD30+ PTCL with the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin in the relapsed setting and in combination with chemotherapy in the frontline setting has improved patient survivals. Epigenetic modifying agents, including HDAC inhibitors and hypomethylating agents, have demonstrated broad clinical efficacy and durability and are in clinical development for combination strategies for both relapsed and frontline settings. Wide-ranging novel agents targeting critical intracellular pathways and tumor microenvironment are in active exploration to define clinical activities. This review summarizes PTCL-specific biomarkers which are increasingly incorporated in clinical practice to guide precision diagnosis and personalized treatment.

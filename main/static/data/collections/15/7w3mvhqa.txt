The force of infection, or the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected, is an important public health measure for assessing the extent of outbreaks and the impact of control programs. Here we present methods for estimating force of infection from serological surveys of infections which produce lasting immunity, taking into account imperfections in the test used, and uncertainty in such imperfections. The methods cover both single serological surveys, in which age is a proxy for time at risk, and repeat surveys in the same people, in which the force of infection is estimated more directly. Fixed values can be used for the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, or existing methods for belief elicitation can be used to include uncertainty in these values. The latter may be applicable, for example, when the specificity of a test depends on co-circulating pathogens, which may not have been well characterized in the setting of interest. We illustrate the methods using data from two published serological studies of dengue.

BACKGROUND Flow-diverter stents are increasingly being used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Because of this increased usage, the occurrence of stent malpositioning, intra-arterial distortion, or migration will likely increase as well. METHODS We describe the conformational twisting and deformity of a pipeline embolic device (PED) stent (Covidien, EV3) within the carotid artery during stent placement, with the subsequent immediate removal of the stent by using an endovascular snare-loop to successfully remove the device. RESULTS The PED can be successfully removed using a snare-loop device when indicated. In this case, following removal of the initial PED, the aneurysms can be successfully treated with the placement of a second PED. CONCLUSION It is critical to have a contingency plan for the removal of malpositioned or otherwise deformed stents that could potentially represent significant sources of iatrogenic stroke.

AIM To describe the long-term experience of a simplified frozen elephant trunk technique (sFETT) used in complicated acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS Between January 2001 and December 2012, 34 patients (mean age 59.9 ± 11.0 years) with complicated AAAD (DeBakey I) underwent an emergency surgery including sFETT. sFETT consisted in gluing the dissected aortic arch wall layers with gelatine-resorcinol adhesive and video-assisted antegrade open arch aortic stent-graft deployment in the arch or proximal descending aorta. In addition to sFETT, the aortic root was addressed with standard techniques. A 30-day mortality was 14.7% (five patients) due to bleeding (1), multiple organ failure (2), and colon ischemia (2). Postoperative morbidity included neurological (2), renal (1) and cardio-pulmonary complications (4), as well as wound infection (1). Mean follow-up was 74.4 ± 45.0 months. Actual survival rates were 73.5% at 1 year, 70.2% at 5 years, and 58.5% at 13 years of follow-up. Six patients died during long-term follow-up from heart failure (1) and unknown reasons (5). Five patients required reoperation for aortic arch (3) or aorto-iliac (2) progression of aneurysm during the mid- and long-term follow-up. The remaining patients showed favorable evolution of the dissected aorta with false lumen occlusion in most cases and stable aortic diameters. CONCLUSIONS In AAAD patients, sFETT as used in our series is an easy and safe technique to repair the aortic arch. Long-term results after sFETT showed false lumen occlusion and stable aortic diameter in up to 13 years of follow-up.

Rabbits were immunized with inactivated influenza virus via the subarachnoidal (SA) or subcutaneous (SC) route, and the antibody titers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were assayed. There were no nervous signs or morphological lesions related to SA immunization. In the SC group, the antibody titer was elevated in serum, but not elevated in CSF. In the SA group, the antibody titer was significantly elevated in serum and even in CSF, and their antibody titers were much greater than in the SC group. The present results suggest that intrathecal immunization is more effective than SC immunization at inducing a protective immune response against the transneural spread of viruses.

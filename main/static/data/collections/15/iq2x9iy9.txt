In this paper we present an initial analysis of synchronous, collaborative programming in a robotics platform. Students worked in dyads and triads to complete a week-long curriculum targeting the learning of cybersecurity and computational thinking concepts, and their application using realistic robotics scenarios. We demonstrate how an analysis of individual student activity data within a group can be extrapolated to understand the groupâ€™s collaborative problem-solving. We compare our findings to past literature and discuss future implications of collaborative programming research.

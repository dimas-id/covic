OBJECTIVE To monitor the prevailing viral respiratory tract infections in cattle after transportation to feedlots. ANIMALS 100 cattle with signs of respiratory tract disease on arrival at 2 feedlots. PROCEDURES Nasal swab samples were obtained from each animal and were used for inoculation of defined cell culture systems that detected bovine viruses known to cause respiratory tract infections, as well as viruses previously not recognized as respiratory pathogens for cattle. RESULTS Bovine respiratory coronaviruses were isolated from 38 of the 100 cattle, including 6 of 50 cattle from California, 22 of 31 cattle from Oklahoma, 6 of 11 cattle from Texas, and 4 of 8 cattle of unknown origin. Parainfluenza 3 viruses also were isolated from 5 California cattle, but other bovine viruses were not detected. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS The high rate of coronavirus isolations from feedlot cattle with signs of respiratory tract disease implied wide distribution and high susceptibility among cattle to this infection, which had not been detected by use of viral isolation systems in previous etiologic evaluations of feedlot cattle affected with bovine respiratory disease complex.

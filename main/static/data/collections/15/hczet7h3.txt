Abstract Background Non-missile penetrating injuries to the craniocervical junction caused by a glass fragment are rare, and a standard management strategy has not been established. Case Description A 75-year-old Japanese man was brought into our emergency department after receiving a left retroauricular stab wound by broken glass fragments. After spinal immobilization, a computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed glass fragments penetrating at the right craniocervical junction to the inter-atlanto-occipital subarachnoid space. CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries (VAs) were not injured. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the glass fragments did not penetrate the cervical cord or medulla oblongata (MO). These glass fragments were removed via a midline incision from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 and with laminectomy without suboccipital craniectomy. Five of the glass fragments were found and removed in total. The dural defect was patched with a free fascia autograft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT angiography showed that both the vertebral arteries were intact as well as the complete removal of the glass fragments. Conclusions CT graphical diagnosis is useful for the management of penetrating craniocervical junction trauma, and it should be considered in the evaluation of patients who have suffered craniocervical penetrating injury even in the absence of major wounds or bleeding. Spinal immobilization of patients with craniocervical penetrating injuries is crucial to avoid not only secondary neurological damage but also secondary critical vascular damage. Incomplete or inadequate assessment of craniocervical stab wounds results in unexpected hazards that are preventable.

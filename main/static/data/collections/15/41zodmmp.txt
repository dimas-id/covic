OBJECTIVE To compare time efficiency and nociceptive input between digital strumming (DS) and sharp transection (ST) of the suspensory ligament during ovariohysterectomy (OVH). STUDY DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. ANIMALS 30 adult female dogs. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to ST or DS procedures. Measures of nociception were assessed through measurements of preoperative and intraoperative heart rate during manipulation of the suspensory ligament. Measures of pain were assessed through preoperative and postoperative pain scores by using the short form Glasgow Composite Pain Scale. Time efficiency was measured through total surgical time and the time to release each suspensory ligament. RESULTS After body weight was accounted for, the total surgical time was 1.1 minutes (P = .06) faster for ST than for DS, and each additional kilogram of body weight increased total surgical time by 0.1 minutes (P = .02). Digital strumming had 30.6-fold greater odds of taking greater than 1 minute compared with ST (P = .001). The heart rate from baseline to peak was 7.4 beats per minute lower in the ST group than in the DS group (P = .06). No complications were observed, and there was no difference in postoperative pain scores between treatments. CONCLUSION Sharp transection was faster and generated less intraoperative acceleration in heart rate but did not differ in postoperative outcomes compared with DS. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Sharp transection is a viable alternative to DS for breakdown of the suspensory ligament during canine OVH. Sharp transection may improve surgical efficiency, especially when performing large volumes in the spay/neuter setting and could influence veterinary student training.

COVID‐19 is a highly prothrombotic disease, frequently requiring anticoagulation for prevention or treatment of thrombosis and to enable organ support (Bikdeli, Madhavan et al. 2020). The reported incidence of thrombosis in patients with COVID‐19 varies considerably depending on anticoagulant regimen, severity of disease and additional risk factors such as central lines. The most commonly used in‐hospital anticoagulants, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), require antithrombin (AT) to exert their anticoagulant effect (Bussey and Francis 2004). Therefore, AT deficiency can result in failure achieve adequate anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH at usual doses.

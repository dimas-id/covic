Since the emergence of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, at the end of December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus also known as "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)," as of 7 April 2020, more than 1,214,466 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 200 countries and territories, resulting in more than 67,767 deaths. The disease was recognized by World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Published reports of adult patients with COVID-19 infection described symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, headache, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Children usually showed milder respiratory symptoms or were asymptomatic, while loss of taste or sensation of smell were seldom reported. In this paper, we report three cases of pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection who presented with anosmia and/or ageusia.

During the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus of swine origin caused human infection and acute respiratory illness in Mexico. After initially spreading in North America, the virus spread globally resulting in the first influenza pandemic since 1968. While the majority of illnesses caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were mild and self-limiting, severe complications, including fatalities, were also reported. In view of the increasing number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of the World Health Organization, the Regional Office convened a consultation meeting of experts involved in the clinical management of patients infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. The consultation resulted in developing an interim guidance and algorithm for clinical management of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in health-care settings. This paper describes the process, the technical basis and the components of this interim guidance.

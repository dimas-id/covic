On December 30, 2019, the first reports of a group of patients with unknown etiology pneumonia appeared in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China Taking into consideration the large amount of similar nucleotide sequences between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the past epidemic coronavirus, it will be appropriate to expect that such pathogens share the same cell line tropism and systemic pathology Although several studies have, so far, identified the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases, there is very little knowledge on the extrapulmonary affection of SARS-CoV-2 In this review, we summarize reports of the main affected organs besides the pulmonary system such as the liver and kidneys, as well as the cardiovascular and nervous system The mechanisms of lesion remain largely unclear The approach of this investigation is to suggest multisystemic work-up in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, aside from its respiratory management Correspondence to: María Fernanda Osorio Pesantes, MD, School of Medicine, Universidad Espíritu Santo-Ecuador, Av Samborondón S/N, Guayaquil 092301, Ecuador E-mail: maferosorio@uees edu ec The authors have no funding or conflicts of interest to disclose Author Statement: M F O and R G V participated in writing the original draft, and review and editing This article is made available via the PMC Open Access Subset for unrestricted re-use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source These permissions are granted for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or until permissions are revoked in writing Upon expiration of these permissions, PMC is granted a perpetual license to make this article available via PMC and Europe PMC, consistent with existing copyright protections Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc All rights reserved

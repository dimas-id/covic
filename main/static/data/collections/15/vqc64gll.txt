Abstract Recent evidence from publications describing the success of interventions to control hospital meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), often in the endemic setting, is reviewed. Overall, there is cautious ground for optimism that MRSA can be controlled in a cost-effective manner by employing a bundle approach, the mainstay of which is widespread admission screening to inform patient-specific control measures.

OBJECTIVES: Explore how to manage oral healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to solve oral healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital has taken effective measures: build a team of experts, which provide a 24-h hotline, online video consultation, and online training and push popular science articles on WeChat. For the treatment of emergency patients aside from routine epidemic prevention measures, some special measures for oral treatment need to be added. RESULTS: From January 23, 2020, to March 2, 2020, a total of 3035 patients received oral therapy during the COVID-19 epidemic in our hospital. To our knowledge, no oral health worker or patient has been infected with COVID-19 due to oral treatment, and no patients have complained about the suspension of treatment by complaints hotline. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a novel challenge for oral healthcare. Attention should be paid to oral healthcare during the outbreak of COVID-19. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These experiences of oral healthcare can be used as a reference by stomatological hospitals and oral clinics during public health emergencies.

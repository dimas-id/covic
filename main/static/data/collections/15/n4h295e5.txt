ABSTRACT: It has been suggested that the liver is not the main source of angiotensinogen during fetal life in rats, but that the kidney is an important site of fetal angiotensinogen synthesis. In an effort to determine if this phenomenon is specific to the rat or applicable to other species, we compared the ontogenic changes in hepatic and renal angiotensinogen mRNA expression in fetal (60, 90, 118, and 138 d of gestation, term being 145 d), newborn (7 d postnatal), and adult sheep. Total RNA was extracted, subjected to Northern blotting and hybridized using a full-length rat radiolabeled antisense RNA. Angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were detected in all fetal liver samples and appeared to increase 3-fold from 60 to 138 d gestation and then to decrease after birth. In contrast, angiotensiogen mRNA could not be detected in renal cortical tissue of 118 or 138 d fetuses, or newborn or adult sheep. We conclude that, unlike in the rat, liver angiotensinogen gene expression is detectable during the 2nd trimester of gestation in sheep and is developmentally regulated. Furthermore, in contrast to the fetal rat, angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were undetectable in fetal sheep kidney.

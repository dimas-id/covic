Abstract Sterilization and disinfection are the basic components of hospital infection control activities. Every day, a number of hospitals are performing various surgical procedures. Even more number of invasive procedures are being performed in different health care facilities. The medical device or the surgical instrument that comes in contact with the sterile tissue or the mucus membrane of the patient during the various processes is associated with increased risk of introduction of pathogens into the patient's body. Moreover, there is chance of transmission of infection from patient to patient; from patient or to health care personnel, and vice versa; or from the environment to the patient through the improper sterilized or disinfected devices. Hence, medical personnel, laboratory people and the health care providers should have better knowledge regarding these techniques to prevent the spread of these pathogens.

This retrospective chart review evaluated outcomes following laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphies with non-cross-linked intact porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix (PADM) by one surgeon in a community teaching facility hospital. Mesh was sutured and/or tacked in the preperitoneal space. Postoperative visits were scheduled at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, and then at 6-month intervals up to 2 years. PADM was placed in 14 male patients (mean age, 41.1 years). Seven patients had bilateral hernias. One patient required intraoperative conversion to open herniorrhaphy based on diagnostic laparoscopy findings. PADM sizes were 6 × 10 to 12 × 16 cm; mean operative time was 102 minutes. All patients were discharged on the day of surgery and resumed full activity. This treatment approach was effective, with no recurrence or complications during a median follow-up period of 18 months (range, 13-25 months).

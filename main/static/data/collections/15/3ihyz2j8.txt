An 85-year-old woman with history of melanoma is referred for a follow-up F-FDG PET/CT. F-FDG PET/CT scan showed bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities in upper and lower pulmonary lobes surrounded by consolidations of crescent shape with increased FDG uptake, findings compatible with organizing pneumonia. Following further inquiry, the patient reported low-grade fever, sore throat, and fatigue for the past 6 days. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the patient was tested for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which resulted positive.

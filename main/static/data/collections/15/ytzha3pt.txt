BACKGROUND Comparison studies of hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy have indicated that short-term outcomes are similar. Although a few of these studies have compared costs, none has reported on the costs of hand-assisted colectomy performed in the US. Our aim was to determine the short-term outcomes and direct costs associated with hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy performed in the US. STUDY DESIGN One hundred hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomies were matched to 100 laparoscopic-assisted colectomies performed concurrently. Matching criteria were age (+/- 10 years), gender, diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, earlier abdominal operation, colectomy type, and conversion. Operative time, morbidity, length of stay, reoperation, and readmission were assessed. Direct costs for the operating room, nursing care, intensive care, anesthesia, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, emergency services and consultations, and professional and ancillary services related to the initial hospitalization and readmissions were compared. RESULTS From June 2005 to August 2008, 176 hand-assisted and 845 laparoscopic-assisted segmental and total colectomies were performed. Of 100 matched hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted patients, there were no differences in body mass index (29 and 28, respectively), operating time (168 and 163 minutes, respectively), length of stay (4 days), readmission (6% and 11%, respectively), or reoperation rates (5% and 9%, respectively). Overall morbidity was 16% and 32% for hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, respectively (p = 0.009). Major morbidity, including abscess, hemorrhage, and anastomotic leak, were similar. Operating room costs were increased for hand-assisted colectomy (3,476 versus 3,167 US dollars); total costs were similar (8,521 versus 8,373 US dollars). CONCLUSIONS Short-term outcomes and total costs of hand-assisted and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy are similar.

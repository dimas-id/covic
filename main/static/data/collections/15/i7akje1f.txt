Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour usually has a benign course and is very rarely associated with the heart. It can have life-threatening consequences, depending on its position or the presence of aggressive and metastatic complications. A 3-month-old boy presented with pericardial tamponade and was diagnosed with intrapericardial inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour associated with Coronavirus OC43. A large tumour attached to the left ventricle was completely removed by surgical resection and he made a full recovery.

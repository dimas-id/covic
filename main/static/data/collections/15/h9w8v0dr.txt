This chapter examines the current literature regarding the use of telehealth, and its potential benefits and limitations for diagnosis, treatment, and coordination of care for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Barriers to access drive the need to have telehealth as a modality for delivering evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic processes, which can be impactful in improving developmental trajectories and functional outcomes. The chapter concludes with guidance for clinicians interested in leveraging telehealth, with directions elucidated to further advance the use of telehealth to support families with ASD. More recently, in light of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social distancing guidelines and restrictions, this chapter highlights changes in telehealth policy and the use of telehealth for diagnosis and treatment of ASD as well as thoughts about future directions.

Infections are the most common cause of acute illness in children. Most commonly these are respiratory infections which peak when the child starts to go to school or out-of-home day care. Although the majority of these diseases have benign course, they cause significant discomfort, anxiety, missed work, and stress to many families caring for children. Frequent office visits, and unnecessarily prescribed medications, and sometimes dubious home remedies can be reduced by following best evidence-based practice and having a good doctor-patient (and parent) relationship.

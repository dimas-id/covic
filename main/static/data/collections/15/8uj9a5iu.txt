BACKGROUND The aim of the present study was to classify the short-term outcomes of local correction of stoma prolapse with a stapler device. METHODS The medical records of 11 patients undergoing local correction of stoma prolapse using a stapler device were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS No mortality or morbidity was observed after the surgery. Median operative time was 35 min (range 15-75 min), and blood loss was minimal. Median duration of follow-up was 12 months (range 6-55 months). One of the 11 patients had a recurrent stoma prolapse. CONCLUSIONS This technique can be a feasible, safe and minimally invasive correction procedure for stoma prolapse.

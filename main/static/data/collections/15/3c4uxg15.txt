In the context of recently emerged pandemic of COVID-19, we have performed two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) modelling using SARS-CoV-3CLpro enzyme inhibitors for the development of a multiple linear regression (MLR) based model. We have used 2D descriptors with an aim to develop an easily interpretable, transferable and reproducible model which may be used for quick prediction of SAR-CoV-3CLpro inhibitory activity for query compounds in the screening process. Based on the insights obtained from the developed 2D-QSAR model, we have identified the structural features responsible for the enhancement of the inhibitory activity against 3CLpro enzyme. Moreover, we have performed the molecular docking analysis using the most and least active molecules from the dataset to understand the molecular interactions involved in binding, and the results were then correlated with the essential structural features obtained from the 2D-QSAR model. Additionally, we have performed in silico predictions of SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme inhibitory activity of a total of 50,437 compounds obtained from two anti-viral drug databases (CAS COVID-19 antiviral candidate compound database and another recently reported list of prioritized compounds from the ZINC15 database) using the developed model and provided prioritized compounds for experimental detection of their performance for SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme inhibition.

BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment of wake-up strokes (WUS) has been previously described, mostly with the use of pharmacological thrombolysis or first generation thrombectomy devices. OBJECTIVE To describe outcomes of WUS treated with modern endovascular therapy since the Food and Drug Administration approval of stent retrievers, and to identify predictors of good clinical outcome in this population of stroke patients. METHODS We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with WUS who underwent thrombectomy with stent retrievers Trevo (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) and Solitaire FR (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA), or primary aspiration thrombectomy. We correlated favorable clinical outcomes with demographic, clinical, and technical characteristics. RESULTS 52 patients were included in this study; 46 (88%) cases were treated with stent retrievers and 6 (12%) were treated with primary aspiration thrombectomy alone. Successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3) was achieved in 36 (69%) patients. Favorable clinical outcome at 3 months, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2, was achieved in 25 (48%) patients. Duration of intervention <30 min and its success, defined as TICI 2b/3 recanalization, were strong predictors of favorable clinical outcome at 90 days (p<0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that endovascular treatment of WUS with stent retrievers and aspiration thrombectomy is safe and effective.

BACKGROUND Thread lifting with absorbable sutures has recently gained prominence for rejuvenating ptotic and sagging soft tissues in aging face. A barbed, delayed absorbable polyglyconate monofilament shows significantly high tensile loads with superior flexibility and elasticity. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel thread lifting regimen with barbed polyglyconate suture for counteracting the descent and laxity of the aging face. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted for 25 Korean patients with mild to moderate facial skin laxity receiving thread lifting procedures using barbed polyglyconate suture. Dermatologists' objective assessments using a 5-point Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), 3D imaging system, and subjective satisfaction were recorded at baseline and 4 months after treatments. RESULTS In most patients (84%), GAIS scores were more than score 3 ("improved"), with 40% of score 4 ("much improved") and 24% of score 5 ("excellent") at the follow-up point. Subjective assessments paralleled these patterns. Three-dimensional analysis quantitatively showed volume migration of low face upward, clinically interpreted as facial lifting. No serious adverse effect was observed. CONCLUSION This novel thread lifting procedure using barbed polyglyconate suture is a safe and effective method for tightening and lifting for aging face with mild to moderate face sagging.

Social distancing is one of the non-pharmacological measures to contain the infection of COVID-19. At this point in time, no vaccine is available to prevent the infection, no effective drugs are available to prevent and treat the disease, and none of the communities have acquired herd immunity. Various models have shown positive impact of social distancing, provided its implementation on vast majority of the population over a long period of time. Its effect is manifold. Besides flattening the curve, it impacts the political, fiscal, social, economic aspects of the society, along with socially vulnerable and economically underprivileged population. It becomes obsolete after the population develops herd immunity subsequent to widespread infection in the community, or after effective mass immunisation or specific drugs for its control, cure and prevention are available widely.

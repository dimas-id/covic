Multiple pharmacological interventions tested over the last decades have failed to reduce ARDS mortality. This short note recounts past data indicating that (i) neutrophils home along an IL-8 gradient, (ii) in ARDS, massive neutrophil accumulation and degranulation in and along bronchoalveolar spaces contributes to damage and hypoxia, (iii) large increases in IL-8 are one of the chemotaxic signals drawing neutrophils to the ARDS lung, and (iv) old data from dermatology and glioblastoma research showed that the old drug against Hansen’s disease, dapsone, inhibits neutrophils’ chemotaxis to IL-8. Therefore dapsone might lower neutrophils’ contributions to ARDS lung pathology. Dapsone can create methemoglobinemia that although rarely problematic it would be particularly undesirable in ARDS. The common antacid drug cimetidine lowers risk of dapsone related methemoglobinemia and should be given concomitantly.

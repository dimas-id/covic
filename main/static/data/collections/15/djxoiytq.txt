Various mechanisms have been proposed for the initiation of autoimmune responses by autoreactive T‐cell clones. One of these, the molecular mimicry hypothesis, postulates that myelin‐reactive T‐cell clones are activated by foreign antigens. Until recently, sequence homology between self‐ and foreign antigens was considered necessary for cross‐recognition to occur in multiple sclerosis. This article reviews current progress in T‐cell receptor immunology that led to modify this view and proposes a role for degenerate T‐cell antigen recognition in the induction of autoimmunity.

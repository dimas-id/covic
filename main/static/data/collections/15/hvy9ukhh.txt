OBJECTIVE: We aim to systematically review the clinical characteristics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). METHODS: Seven datebases were searched to collect studies about the clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 from 1 January 2020 to 28 February 2020. Then, meta‐analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies involving 3 062 COVID‐19 patients were included. Meta‐analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (56.9%). The incidence rate of respiratory failure or ARDS was 19.5% and the fatality rate was 5.5%. Fever (80.4%), fatigue (46%), cough (63.1%) and expectoration (41.8%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms included muscle soreness (33%), anorexia (38.8%), chest tightness (35.7%), shortness of breath (35%), dyspnea (33.9%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.9%), headache (15.4%), pharyngalgia(13.1%), shivering (10.9%) and abdominal pain (4.4%). Patients with asymptomatic was 11.9%. Normal leukocytes counts (69.7%), lymphopenia (56.5%), elevated C‐reactive protein levels (73.6%), elevated ESR (65.6%) and oxygenation index decreased (63.6%) were observed in most patients. About 37.2% of patients with elevated D‐dimer, 25.9% of patients with leukopenia, along with abnormal levels of liver function (29%) and renal function (25.5%). Other findings included leukocytosis (12.6%) and elevated procalcitonin (17.5%). Only 25.8% of patients had lesions involving single lung and 75.7% of patients had lesions involving bilateral lungs. CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly experienced symptoms of COVID‐19 patients were fever, fatigue, cough and expectoration. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocytes counts, lymphopenia, elevated levels of C‐reactive protein and ESR. Bilateral lungs involvement was common. This article is protected by copyright.

Summary Objective Human bocavirus (HBoV), a novel virus, which based on molecular analysis has been associated with respiratory tract diseases in infants and children have recently been studied worldwide. To determine prevalence, clinical features and perform phylogenetic analysis in HBoV infected Thai pediatric patients. Methods HBoV was detected from 302 nasopharyngeal (NP) suctions of pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract illness and sequenced applying molecular techniques. Results The incidence of HBoV infection in pediatric patients amounted to 6.62% with 40% co-infected with other respiratory viruses. There were no clinical specific manifestations for HBoV; however, fever and productive cough were commonly found. Generalized rales and wheezing were detected in most of the patients as well as perihilar infiltrates. The alignment and phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 genes showed minor variations. Conclusion Our results indicated that HBoV can be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from infants and children with acute lower respiratory tract illness.

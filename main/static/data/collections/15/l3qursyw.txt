Abstract Biomembranes are traditionally viewed as flat phospholipid-bilayer sheets delineating the cell boundaries and dividing the cell into multiple subcellular organelles with specialized functions. However, biological membranes may also fold up into three-dimensional nanoperiodic arrangements, termed cubic membranes. This type of geometry is mathematically well described and extensively studied in lipidic cubic phase systems. This chapter will (1) summarize similarities and dissimilarities between cubic membranes and cubic phases; (2) provide an update on the experimental data describing the role of lipids, proteins and electrostatic charges on the biogenesis of cubic membranes; and (3) discuss their potential function in intracellular macromolecular transport and as optical filters, as well as potential practical applications such as gene delivery vehicles.

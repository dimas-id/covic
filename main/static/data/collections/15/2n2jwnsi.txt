Rapid industrial development, mega construction projects and increased immigration are some of the reasons that the State of Qatar has recently generated an unprecedented amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste in the country. The State is racing towards the Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup 2022, a fact that requires additional construction, for which it is expected to increase its rate of waste generation. Compared to other regions, there are relatively few studies in the literature that report on the C&D waste management issues of Qatar. The present work begins to address this gap by providing insights into the current state of C&D waste management practices in Qatar and by providing a mini-review on the benefits of using recycled aggregates which have only recently been allowed locally by Qatar Construction Standards. A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis has been implemented, using data and information from various sources including governmental reports, industries, local waste management companies, as well as reported interviews with relevant stakeholders. Finally, several strategies were proposed and developed that could potentially be implemented by stakeholders and decision-makers, so as to improve the current status by encouraging more sustainable and viable practices.

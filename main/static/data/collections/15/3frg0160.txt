BACKGROUND The Lichtenstein repair is a well standardized surgical technique that can mostly be performed in day-clinic under loco-regional anesthesia. The major concern is the chronic pain reported after mesh suture fixation. We studied the practical and clinical aspects of a Lichtenstein repair using the semi-resorbable self-fixating Parietex ProGrip mesh. METHODS Consecutive patients with inguinal hernia were operated according to the Lichtenstein technique using Parietex ProGrip. Complications were assessed. Pain and discomfort were evaluated at discharge, and at 1 and 4 weeks and minimum 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS 320 patients were included in the study. No intra-operative complications or difficulties occurred. Mean operating time was 36 minutes (range 20-65 minutes). 87.5% of the patients (280) were discharged at day of operation, 11.9% (38 patients) had an overnight stay and 0.6% (2 patients) stayed two nights. Mean number of days of analgesic use is 2.1. At the 1 week follow-up visit, minor pain or discomfort was reported by 45 patients (14%) and at 4 weeks 11 patients (3.4%) still had minor discomfort. At 6 months 1 patient suffered from persisting local numbness. Two recurrences were noted, both were re-operated. CONCLUSIONS This observational study confirms earlier findings with this semi-resorbable self-gripping mesh regarding operation time, complications and recurrence. The open Lichtenstein hernia repair with the semi-resorbable self-gripping Parietex Progrip mesh seems to offer a reliable alternative for the treatment of inguinal hernia with benefits on operating time as well as on postoperative pain.

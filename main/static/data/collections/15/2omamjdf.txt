Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a member of Coronaviridae family. Our previous research showed that TGEV infection could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and upregulate miR-222 level. Therefore, we presumed that miR-222 might be implicated in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction induced by TGEV infection. To verify the hypothesis, the effect of miR-222 on mitochondrial dysfunction was tested and we showed that miR-222 attenuated TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-222 in TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, a quantitative proteomic analysis of PK-15 cells that were transfected with miR-222 mimics and infected with TGEV was performed. In total, 4151 proteins were quantified and 100 differentially expressed proteins were obtained (57 upregulated, 43 downregulated), among which thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) were downregulated. THBS1 was identified as the target of miR-222. Knockdown of THBS1 and CD47 decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ level and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level. Reversely, overexpression of THBS1 and CD47 elevated mitochondrial Ca2+ level and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level. Together, our data establish a significant role of miR-222 in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction in response to TGEV infection.

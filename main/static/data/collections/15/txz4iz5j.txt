As angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) was identified as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, there have been many reports concerning its role in several tissues, including the kidney. However, the role of ACE2 during the development of diabetic nephropathy remains undetermined, as previous reports did not necessarily support a protective role against renal injury. Thus, we performed detailed observations of kidneys in ACE2-knockout (ACE2-KO) mice at early (4 weeks) and advanced (18 weeks) stages of diabetes. ACE2-KO and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic ACE2-KO mice showed earlier onset and more severe progression of albuminuria than those did wild-type mice. The elevation of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels at 18 weeks of diabetes was more prominent in ACE2-KO mice. Periodic acid-Schiff-stained cross-section of diabetic ACE2-KO mice showed a more severe time-dependent increase in glomerular/tubulointerstitial damage than did that of wild-type mice, confirmed by the immunostaining of alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV and F4-80 antigen. Glomeruli of diabetic ACE2-KO mice showed earlier and more severe decrease in the expression of nephrin, whose degradation is involved in the onset of albuminuria, and more potent increase of vascular endothelial growth factor expression. In addition, treatment with AT1 receptor blocker olmesartan significantly, but not totally, ameliorated the functional and morphological deterioration of diabetic nephropathy in ACE2-KO mice. These results suggest that ACE2 might continuously protect from both glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury during the development of diabetic nephropathy. The renal-protective effect of ACE2 might involve more than just suppressing angiotensin II-mediated AT1 receptor signaling.

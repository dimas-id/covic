Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic first originated in Wuhan the capital of Hubei province, China in December 2019 and then spread globally. It is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Until 1 April 2020, the number of cases worldwide was recorded to be 823,626 with 40,598 deaths. Most of the reported cases were adults with few cases described in children and neonates. Objectives We performed a systematic review to analyse the disease characterisation in paediatric age group including the possibility of vertical transmission to the neonates. Methods Articles published up to the 2nd April 2020 in PubMed and google Scholar were considered for this study. Findings The most frequently reported symptoms were cough 49% (95% CI: 42 – 55%) and fever 47% (95% CI: 41- 53%). Lymphopenia and increased Procalcitonin were recorded in (21%, 95% CI:12 – 30%) and (28%, 95% CI:18 – 37%) respectively. No sex difference for COVID-19 in paediatric age group (p = 0.7). Case fatality rate was 0%. Four out of 58 neonates (6.8%) born to COVID-19 confirmed mothers tested positive for the disease. Conclusion The disease trajectory in Paediatric patients has good prognosis compared to adults. Intensive care unit and death are rare. Vertical transmission and virus shedding in breast milk are yet to be established.

A 61-year-old man was admitted with acute Type A aortic dissection DeBakey Type I with clinical and radiographic signs of left iliac artery occlusion and leg ischemia. He underwent simultaneous ascending aortic repair and surgical femoro-femoral crossover bypass with immediate restoration of leg perfusion as assessed with peripheral near-infrared spectroscopy. The postoperative course was uneventful. Follow-up computed tomography demonstrated occlusion of the left external iliac artery and patent crossover bypass.

To our knowledge, we report the first case of percutaneous pulmonary thrombectomy and catheter directed thrombolysis for massive pulmonary embolism (PE) in a patient with presumed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Standard treatments of anticoagulation and systemic thrombolysis were unsuccessful and the patient continued to deteriorate. Percutaneous pulmonary thrombectomy and locally delivered thrombolysis was a life‐saving treatment; the patient continues to improve and is currently being nursed on a standard ward. This report highlights the diagnostic challenge of COVID‐19 due to the low sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal swab test and the importance of imaging in managing patients with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP). Additionally, it emphasises the need for interventional radiologists and haematologists to work alongside our critical care colleagues to deliver life‐saving treatment in this fight against COVID‐19.

Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) has numerous advantages over open donor nephrectomy. The cosmetic issues and pain that arise due to the 5 to 6-cm incisions on the abdominal wall in LDN have led to transvaginal laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (TVLDN). Between May and August 2012, we performed seven donor nephrectomies via a transvaginal approach. The mean age of the donors was 53.0 ± 9.52 years. The mean operative time was 97.29 ± 39.47 minutes and mean warm ischemia time, 220.71 ± 55.49 seconds. Donors were mobilized, began oral intake at 8 hours postoperative, and were all discharged within the first 24 hours. Except one dose of analgesic applied immediately after the operation, no additional medication was required. No infectious complications were encountered in any recipient. TVLDN may be a good alternative for female donors. Compared with LDN, TVLDN has benefits of less postoperative pain, faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and excellent cosmetic results.

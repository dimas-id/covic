INTRODUCTION The authors present a retrospective series of their clinical experience in the treatment of cavernous dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF) by direct transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus as an alternative to the endovascular approach. METHODS Between October 2012 and September 2014, eight patients harboring cavernous DAVF underwent percutaneous treatment by direct transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus at three institutions. All patients presented with ocular symptoms. Standard endovascular approaches, including transvenous and transarterial routes, were primarily attempted without success in all cases. Direct puncture was performed through two different approaches, namely inferolateral and superomedial. The entry point was the inferior and superior eyelid, respectively. Embolization was performed with coils or Onyx (Covidien, Irvine, CA). Immediate and late angiographies were used to evaluate the occlusion of the fistula. RESULTS Of the patients seven had complete occlusion of the cavernous DAVFs noted on the immediate and follow-up angiograms and one patient had residual filling but reduction of the shunt resulted in clinical improvement. None of the patients had worsening of neurological function. One case was complicated by inadvertent internal carotid puncture but without clinical manifestations. One patient experienced postoperative superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis. CONCLUSION In very specific cases, when endovascular access is not possible or fails to occlude cavernous DAVF, direct transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus was shown to be feasible, safe and very effective.

Although the interconnection of humans, animals, and ecosystems has been recognized historically, increasing specialization of professionals in the twentieth century led to decreased communication and collaboration among sectors. In early 2000, a One Health vision of global interconnectedness began gaining in popularity and a series of meetings were held extolling the One Health vision. However, by 2009, detractors were claiming that the One Health approach was indeed all vision and no action. In response to this, international organizations sponsored a carefully planned and structured meeting to construct a way forward that would lead to tangible outcomes. The Stone Mountain meeting, Operationalizing “One Health”: A Policy Perspective—Taking Stock and Shaping an Implementation Roadmap led to the formation of seven multi-national work groups with defined timelines and outputs. The process has garnered increasing participation and support, and the work groups are on track to demonstrate the value added of a One Health approach.

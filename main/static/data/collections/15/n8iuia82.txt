The popularization of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) brings an opportunity to use Question Answering Systems to consult these sources using natural language. We present CONQUEST, a framework that automates much of the process of building chatbots for the Template-Based Interactive Question Answering task on EKGs. The framework automatically handles the processes of construction of the Natural Language Processing engine, construction of the question classification mechanism, definition of the system interaction flow, construction of the EKG query mechanism, and finally, the construction of the user interaction interface. CONQUEST uses a machine learning-based mechanism to classify input questions to known templates extracted from EKGs, utilizing the clarification dialog to resolve inconclusive classifications and request mandatory missing parameters. CONQUEST also evolves with question clarification: these cases define question patterns used as new examples for training.

Abstract Transfusions are lifesaving but are not without some risks. During the middle of the last century, infectious complications were common from transfusions. By the mid 1980s the risk of transfusion transmission of infections became much lower. With the advent of emerging diseases, however, infectious risks became more prominent for a period of time. Now we live in a time where death from transfusion transmission is 10%â€“15% of all transfusion-associated deaths and is the lowest in history. As the risks are identified and new screens or processes are put in place, the associated transfusion transmission of infection will continue to have reducing risks and blood supply will continue to be safer still.

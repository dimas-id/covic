Objective: The following systematic review and meta-analysis compiles the current data regarding human controlled COVID-19 treatment trials. Methods: An electronic search of the literature compiled studies pertaining to human controlled treatment trials with COVID-19. Medications assessed included lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, and heparin. Statistical analyzes were performed for common viral clearance endpoints whenever possible. Results: Lopinavir/ritonavir showed no significant effect on viral clearance for COVID-19 cases (OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.50-1.83]). Hydroxychloroquine also showed no significant effect on COVID-19 viral clearance rates (OR 2.16 [95% CI 0.80-5.84]). Arbidol showed no seven-day (OR 1.63 [95% CI 0.76-3.50]) or 14-day viral (OR 5.37 [95% CI 0.35-83.30]) clearance difference compared to lopinavir/ritonavir. Review of literature showed no significant clinical improvement with lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, or remdesivir. Favipiravir showed quicker symptom improvement compared to lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol. Heparin showed improvement with severe COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Current medications do not show significant effect on COVID-19 viral clearance rates. Favipiravir shows favorable results compared to other tested medications. Heparin shows benefit for severe cases of COVID-19.

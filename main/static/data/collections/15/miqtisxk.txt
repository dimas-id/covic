Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recently declared a global pandemic. As of June 5, 2020, over 75,000 cases have been reported with nearly 2500 deaths in India alone. COVID-19 has severely impacted deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) programs throughout the world. Acceptance of deceased liver donors has decreased worldwide because of the unknown risks associated with COVID-19 transmission or postoperative infection in the immediate post-transplant period, along with the risks to the health care workers in a multidisciplinary setting. In India, DDLT has come to a standstill in the setting of a national lockdown. Many national guidelines have emerged on how to safely perform transplant as well on immunosuppressive regimens and care of patients posttransplant. Here, we take a look at the current situation and summarize the different guidelines and future perspectives of DDLT in India in the COVID-19 era.

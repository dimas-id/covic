For purposes of this review, we defined toileting disability as a result of practices, procedures, or conditions that result in an individual requiring assistance using the bathroom. This scoping review synthesizes existing knowledge of extrinsic and/or intrinsic factors that might lead to or be associated with toileting disability and identified knowledge gaps related to toileting disability in older adults residing in long-term care or assisted living facilities. A search of 9 electronic databases and the gray literature identified 3613 articles. After exclusions and screening of the full text of 71 articles, 7 remaining eligible articles mapped research activity and identified knowledge gaps in this area. Only 1 study used toileting disability as the primary outcome; it was present in 15% of older adults without dementia living in long term-care facilities (a subgroup that comprised 34% of all residents). The other 6 articles examined factors and treatment of overall activities of daily living (ADL) performance as their primary outcome; in these, toileting disability was added to other difficulties, yielding a summary ADL outcome score. No study reported the incidence, distribution, or factors that affect toileting disability in long-term care; findings of this scoping review suggest a rich research agenda for future investigation.

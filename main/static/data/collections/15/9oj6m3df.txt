Abstract Nucleos(t)ide analogues play pivotal roles as antiviral, cytotoxic or immunosuppressive agents. Here, we review recent reports of nucleoside analogues that exhibit broad-spectrum activity towards multiple life-threatening RNA and DNA viruses. We also present a discussion about nucleoside antimetabolites—approved antineoplastic agents—that have recently been shown to have antiviral and/or antibacterial activity. The approved drugs and drug combinations, as well as recently identified candidates for investigation and/or experimentation, are discussed. Several examples of repurposed drugs that have already been approved for use are presented. This strategy can be crucial for the first-line treatment of acute infections or coinfections and for the management of drug-resistant strains.

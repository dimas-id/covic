The pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus has caused the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, leading to disproportionate fatalities in the low-risk population despite the generally mild nature of the illness. Advances in science and technology have allowed very detailed study on the pathogenesis of this novel virus, and many have already been published in less than a year after the start of the pandemic. Information generated from cell lines, animal models, and clinical data analysis has provided us with greater understanding of the behavior of this virus and the associated host response. The new knowledge will allow us to formulate scientifically sound and evidence-based management plans.

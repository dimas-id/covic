Abstract Background Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are recognized as a cause of upper and lower acute respiratory infections (ARI). The circulating species and their clinical impact were not described in Argentina. Objectives To describe the molecular epidemiology of HRV in children and to determine the association of HRV species with outcome and severity. Study design: Hospitalized and outpatients children <6 years old with ARI without comorbidities (n =620) were enrolled (2008â€“2010). Demographic, clinical data and outcome were analyzed. HRV were identified by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis and demographic reconstruction for HRV were performed in selected samples. Results HRV were detected in 252/620 (40.6%) of children; 8.5% in viral coinfection. Bronchiolitis (55%) and pneumonia (13%) were the most frequent clinical diagnosis. Of 202 inpatients with HRV: 72% required oxygen supplementation, 11% intensive care unit and 3% mechanical ventilation. HRV were identified as a risk factor for hospitalization (OR: 2.47). All three HRV species were detected being HRV-A (55%) and HRV-C (43%) the most frequent; HRV-B was infrequent (2%). Of 44 sequenced HRV, 30 genotypes were detected. Seven of them were the most prevalent and circulated during limited periods of time. The demographic reconstruction revealed a constant population size and a high turnover rate of genotypes. Demographic and clinical outcome were similar for HRV-A and HRV-C infections. Conclusion This study highlights the clinical impact of HRV in children without comorbidities as a cause of lower ARI and hospitalization. The high frequency of HRV infections may be associated with the simultaneous circulation of genotypes and their high turnover rate.

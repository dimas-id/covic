The varying cutaneous and pathological manifestations of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) may have prognostic implications. Acral ischemic findings present with a hypercoagulable state in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Pathologically confirmed varicella-like exanthem and perniosis COVID-19 cases have correlated with paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic patients in previous reports. We present the second case of biopsy-proven COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains (pernio) in a paucisymptomatic patient with a brisk perieccrine lymphocytic response. Based on an antecedent pathological study, we know coronavirus particles have been seen in the eccrine gland associated with a brisk peri-inflammatory response. The prominent perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test). We continue to stress the importance of early diagnosis and quarantining to prevent spread to the older and immunocompromised patients.

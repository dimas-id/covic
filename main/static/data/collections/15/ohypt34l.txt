The computer-assisted, kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for coronavirus antibodies in cats was calibrated to the conventional indirect immunofluorescence assay by linear regression analysis and computerized interpolation (generation of "immunofluorescence assay-equivalent" titers). Procedures were developed for normalization and standardization of kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results through incorporation of five different control sera of predetermined ("expected") titer in daily runs. When used with such sera and with computer assistance, the kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay minimized both within-run and between-run variability while allowing also for efficient data reduction and statistical analysis and reporting of results.

Background: An association among the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers(ARBs) with the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the preprint databases MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies that assessed the association among inflammation level, application of ACEI/ARB, infection severity and death in patients with COVID-19. Odd risks(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were combined using random-effects or fixed models depending on heterogeneity. Results: Eleven studies were included with a total of 33,483 patients. Our review showed ACEI/ARB therapy might be associated with the reduced inflammatory factor (interleukin-6) and elevated level of immune cells(CD3, CD8). Meta-analysis showed no significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection(OR:0.95, 95%CI:0.89-1.05) in patients receiving ACEI/ARB therapy, and ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR:0.75, 95%CI: 0.59-0.96) and mortality (OR:0.52, 95%CI: 0.35-0.79). Subgroup analyses showed that, among the general population, application of ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with reduced risks of all-cause death(OR:0.31, 95%CI: 0.13-0.75), and the risk of severe COVID-19(OR:0.79, 95%CI: 0.60-1.05) infection and COVID-19 infection(OR:0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.08) were not increased. Among patients with hypertension, the use of an ACEI/ARB was associated with a lower severity of COVID-19(OR:0.73, 95%CI: 0.51-1.03) and lower mortality(OR:0.57, 95%CI: 0.37-0.87), without evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 infection(OR:1.00, 95%CI: 0.90-1.12). Conclusion: On the basis of the available evidence, this is the first meta-analysis showed that, in general population, the use of ACEI/ARB therapy was safe without an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and with a decreasing trend of severe COVID-19 infection and lower mortality. In patients with hypertension, the use of ACEI/ARB therapy should be encouraged, without increased risk of COVID-19 inflection, and better prognosis (a decreasing trends of severe COVID-19 and reduced all-cause death). Overall, ACEI/ARB therapy should be continued in patients who are at risk for, or have COVID-19, either in general population or hypertension patients. Our results need to be interpreted with caution considering the potential for residual confounders, and more well-designed studies that control the clinical confounders are necessary to confirm our findings.

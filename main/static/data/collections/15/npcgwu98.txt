We herein report a case of single-incision laparoscopic access (SILA) splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). A 24-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of ITP received corticosteroid therapy. However, as the side effects became serious, a splenectomy option was chosen. The SILA splenectomy using a transumbilical approach is cosmetically more attractive than a conventional laparoscopic approach, but it has an increased risk of major bleeding due to technical considerations. Therefore, we prioritized the patient's safety during the SILA splenectomy by choosing a left lower abdominal approach. The operating time was 123 min and blood loss was 1 ml. This was comparable to a conventional laparoscopic splenectomy. The present case appears to be the first SILA splenectomy reported in Japan. In our experience, a SILA splenectomy is feasible and safe, with favorable perioperative and shortterm patient outcomes. Further studies are necessary before the universal adoption of this new technique.

Abstract Given the highly contagious and acute nature of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), especially in piglets, there is an urgent need for the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic assays. The diagnostic potentials of specific porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) accessory and nonstructural proteins, if any, have not yet been investigated. In order to determine and compare which of the viral proteins may be useful as diagnostic antigens, whole virus (WV) particles and a panel of structural and nonstructural PEDV proteins [spike subunit 1 (S1), the C-terminal part of ORF3 (ORF3C), envelope (E), nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), Nsp2, Ac (acidic domain of Nsp3), and ADRP (ADP-ribose-1-monophosphatase domain of Nsp3), expressed individually in bacterial and/or mammalian cells] were tested for reactivity with sera from PEDV-infected pigs by ELISA and/or western blot analysis. According to western blots, serum antibody interactions with the S1 protein were relatively more sensitive and specific than ORF3C, E and Ac. Furthermore, a total of 851 serum samples from diarrheal pigs of different ages were analyzed by ELISA, with most showing immune-reactivity towards the WV, S1, ORF3C, and E proteins. The earliest IgG antibody response was observed in the one-week-old piglets, with similar antibody ontogeny and patterns of seroconversion for S1, ORF3C, E, and WV antigens. In addition, the pattern of neutralizing antibody was more similar to that of IgA in weaning piglets after PEDV infection. Collectively, these data provide more reliable information on the host immune response to different viral proteins, which will be useful for development of novel serological assays and for design of vaccines that better stimulate protective immunity.

Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, especially those on immunosuppressive therapies or with active disease. There are limited reports describing the clinical features of COVID-19 in an IBD population, and the impact of immunosuppression on the severity of the infection remains unclear. Case Report: A 33-year-old female patient with a long history of ulcerative colitis, poorly controlled, was admitted with COVID-19 a few days after being discharged from the hospital for treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis. High-risk factors for COVID-19 complications, i.e., high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisone) and severe active disease, were present at admission. Despite the development of extensive pulmonary involvement, the patient had a favorable outcome. Discussion: Management of IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging. Measures to minimize the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including strict social distancing and self-isolation, in the IBD population have been recommended, especially for high-risk patients. Although steroid tapering and persistence of biologics are advised by professional groups, the best treatment strategy for IBD patients presenting a flare during the outbreak has yet to be defined.

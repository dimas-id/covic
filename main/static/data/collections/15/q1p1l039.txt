Some of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with prolonged ventilation may require tracheostomy, which is an aerosol-generating procedure and poses a significant risk of viral transmission. We report our experience of the management of a patient with COVID-19 who underwent surgical tracheostomy and describe several essential infection control principles. In our patient, on the 14th day after intubation, an open tracheostomy was carried out because of the prolonged tracheal intubation and unsuccessful extubation attempts. Meticulous attention was paid during surgery to decrease the infection risk. Appropriate protection, infection control and teamwork are essential to perform open tracheostomy in COVID-19 positive patients safely with minimal risks to healthcare professionals.

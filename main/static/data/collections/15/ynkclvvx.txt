Type III interferons (IFNs) or IFN-位s regulate a similar set of genes as type I IFNs, but whereas type I IFNs act globally, IFN-位s primarily target mucosal epithelial cells and protect them against the frequent viral attacks that are typical for barrier tissues. IFN-位s thereby help to maintain healthy mucosal surfaces through immune protection, without the significant immune-related pathogenic risk associated with type I IFN responses. Type III IFNs also target the human liver, with dual effects: they induce an antiviral state in hepatocytes, but specific IFN-位4 action impairs the clearance of hepatitis C virus and could influence inflammatory responses. This constitutes a paradox that has yet to be resolved.

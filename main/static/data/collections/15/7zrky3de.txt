PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and the effect of CI-AKI on cardiovascular outcomes after hospital discharge in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS AND MATERIALS We retrospectively reviewed 194 STEMI consecutive patients who underwent primary PCI to evaluate the predictors for CI-AKI and 187 survivors to examine all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Outcomes were compared between patients with CI-AKI and those without CI-AKI, which was defined as an increase >50% or >0.5mg/dl in serum creatinine concentration within 48hours after primary PCI. RESULTS CI-AKI occurred in 23 patients (11.9%). Multivariate analysis identified pre-procedural renal insufficiency as a predictor of CI-AKI, and this predictor was independent from hemodynamic instability and excessive contrast volume. Receiver-operator characteristics analysis demonstrated that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of â‰¤43.6ml/min per 1.73m(2) had the potential for CI-AKI. Patients who developed CI-AKI had higher mortality and cardiovascular events than did those without CI-AKI (27.8% vs. 4.7%; log-rank P=.0003, 27.8% vs. 11.2%; log-rank P=.0181, respectively). Cox proportional hazards model analysis identified CI-AKI as the independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events [hazard ratio [HR]=5.36; P=.0076, HR=3.10; P=.0250, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS The risk of CI-AKI is increased in patients with pre-procedural renal insufficiency, and eGFR is clinically useful in the emergent setting for CI-AKI risk stratification before primary PCI.

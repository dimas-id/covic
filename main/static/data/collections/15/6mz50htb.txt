Objective To describe the protocols implemented to adapt the orthopedic team to the COVID-19 pandemic; a secondary objective is to assess the behavior of hospital and departmental variables when implementing such measures. Methods The present is a retrospective study describing three protocols: 1) reduction in the risk of infection for patients and healthcare workers; 2) adaptation of work, academic and scientific activities; and 3) adaptation of the orthopedic treatment during the pandemic. We analyzed hospital and departmental variables, including the number of patients seen in the emergency room and outpatient clinic, the number of hospitalized patients, suspected and confirmed cases in patients and orthopedic team members, changes in teaching activities from on-site attendance to videoconferencing, and number of surgeries. Period A, from March 3 to 16, was compared with period B, from March 17 to 30, 2020, which corresponded to the implementation of the protocols. Results There was a decrease in the number of outpatients and inpatients. One confirmed and two suspected cases were notified. Among the departmental members, there were 12 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. The weekly frequency of classes was maintained, while the clinical-scientific meetings decreased from ten to three. In addition, the number of surgeries was reduced. Conclusions The present study demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the rapid implementation of intervention protocols in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The protocols focused on reducing the risk of infection for patients and healthcare professionals, adapting work, academic and scientific activities, and modifying the orthopedic treatment. With the application of the protocols, the healthcare, academic and scientific activities remained functional, prioritizing measures to confront the COVID-19 pandemic.

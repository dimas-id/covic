BACKGROUND Data from a US multicenter longitudinal study of bariatric surgery were used to compare weight change (primary outcome) and comorbidities (secondary outcome) in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS This study includes participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and matched participants who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study. Adults undergoing initial bariatric surgical procedures between 2006 and 2009 were enrolled. Participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were high-risk or superobese and intended to have a second-stage procedure. Mixed models were used to evaluate percent weight change from baseline through 7 years, and diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension prevalence through 5 years. RESULTS Fifty-seven of 59 participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were matched one to one. Most were female (68%) and white (81%), and had a median age of 49 (37-56) years and median body mass index of 56.4 (35.5-76.8) kg/m2 presurgery. Weight loss was significantly less 1 to 7 years after sleeve gastrectomy versus matched Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (eg, year 7 mean weight loss was 23.6% vs 30.4%, respectively; P = .001). For both surgical groups, prevalence of diabetes, low high-density lipoprotein, and hypertension were significantly (P < .05) lower 5 years postsurgery versus baseline. CONCLUSION Higher-risk or super-obese participants after sleeve gastrectomy lost less weight than did matched Roux-en-Y gastric bypass counterparts throughout 7 years. Both groups exhibited improvements in comorbidities from presurgery through 5 years.

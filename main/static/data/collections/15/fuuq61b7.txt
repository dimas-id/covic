OBJECTIVE To address the roles and mechanisms of co-activation in two flexor/extensor pairs during elbow extension in children with cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS 13 Typically Developing (TD) and 13 children with unilateral spastic CP performed elbow extension/flexion at different speeds. Elbow angle and velocity were recorded using a 3D motion analysis system. The acceleration and deceleration phases of extension were analyzed. Co-activation of the brachioradialis/triceps and biceps/triceps pairs was computed for each phase from surface electromyographic signals. Statistical analysis involved linear mixed effects models and Spearman rank correlations. RESULTS During the acceleration phase, there was strong co-activation in both muscle pairs in the children with CP, which increased with speed. Co-activation was weak in the TD children and it was not speed-dependent. During the deceleration phase, co-activation was strong and increased with speed in both groups; co-activation of brachioradialis/triceps was stronger in children with CP, and was negatively correlated with extension range and positively correlated with flexor spasticity. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal patterns of co-activation in children with CP were found throughout the entire movement. Co-activation was specific to the movement phase and to each flexor muscle. SIGNIFICANCE Co-activation in children with CP is both physiological and pathological.

IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD The recent advances in visual representations of molecular properties in 3D space are summarized, and their applications in molecular modeling study and rational drug design are introduced. The visual representation methods provide us with detailed insights into protein-ligand interactions, and hence can play a major role in elucidating the structure or reactivity of a biomolecular system. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Three newly developed computation and visualization methods for studying the physical and chemical properties of molecules are introduced, including their electrostatic potential, lipophilicity potential and excess chemical potential. The newest application examples of visual representations in structure-based rational drug are presented. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN The 3D electrostatic potentials, calculated using the empirical method (EM-ESP), in which the classical Coulomb equation and traditional atomic partial changes are discarded, are highly consistent with the results by the higher level quantum chemical method. The 3D lipophilicity potentials, computed by the heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential method based on the principles of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, are more accurate and reliable than those by using the traditional empirical methods. The 3D excess chemical potentials, derived by the reference interaction site model-hypernetted chain theory, provide a new tool for computational chemistry and molecular modeling. TAKE HOME MESSAGE For structure-based drug design, the visual representations of molecular properties will play a significant role in practical applications. It is anticipated that the new advances in computational chemistry will stimulate the development of molecular modeling methods, further enriching the visual representation techniques for rational drug design, as well as other relevant fields in life science.

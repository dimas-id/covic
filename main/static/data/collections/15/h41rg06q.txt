This data sheet covers only the non‐European fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae [= Trypetidae]). It does not cover the many gall‐forming and other species that feed in the vegetative parts of plants. The fruit flies presenting a phytosanitary risk to EPPO countries fall into two principal groups: cool temperate species mostly capable of diapausing and usually univoltine, and warm temperate or tropical species mostly capable of continuous breeding apparently without diapause. This data sheet presents information on Rhagoletts pomonella and Dacus tryoni as representatives of the first and second groups respectively, together with references to other species where appropriate.

BACKGROUND To avoid bile leakage from the stump of a cystic duct that is closed at edematous and/or involved areas, the decision regarding the location of the resection line during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for benign lesions extending into the cystic duct is important and requires technical ingenuity. For these situations, we used fluorescent cholangiography. METHODS Our procedure for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy utilized the SILS-Port, and an additional pair of 5-mm forceps was inserted via an umbilical incision. As a fluorescence source, 1 mL of indocyanine green was intravenously injected after endotracheal intubation of patients in the operating room. A laparoscopic fluorescence imaging system developed by Karl Storz Endoskope was utilized for fluorescent cholangiography. RESULTS Fluorescent cholangiography could be used to identify the border of the lesion in the cystic duct. According to the fluorescent cholangiography results, a location for the resection line of the cystic duct could be identified; therefore, the planned resection was successful and produced a histologically negative margin. CONCLUSIONS Application of fluorescent cholangiography in the determination of the location of the resection line location during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for benign lesions of the cystic duct should be widely accepted.

A one-step and controllable strategy to prepare all-polymer hybrid electret fibers is reported based on the coupling of polystyrene and polyvinylidene fluoride in electric response. The complementary dielectric properties between PS and PVDF generate dual-system electret charges within PS/PVDF fibers, thereby improving the electret effect. The bi-component all-polymer electret fibers show enhanced electret property and structural continuity, contributing to a N95 protective respirator with high filtration efficiency (99.752%), low air resistance (72 Pa) and long service life. The fabrication of all-polymer electret fibers solves the challenge of nanoparticle toxicity for existing polymer/nanoparticle electret fibers.

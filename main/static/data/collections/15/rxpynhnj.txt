This chapter discusses the management of immunocompromised and infected animals. The microbiological quality of laboratory animals is a direct result of colony management practices and monitoring provides an after-the-fact assessment of the adequacy of those practices. Monitoring is, therefore, of greatest value in connection with the maintenance of animals in isolation systems where vigorous microbiological control is applied. In addition to constructive measures, an appropriate management system is necessary for the prevention of infections, as well as for their detection and control. It is a major task for the management of an animal facility to understand the way micro-organisms might be introduced or spread under the specific conditions given. The management of all animal facilities in an institution is best centralized. This warrants that all information dealing with the purchase of animals, the use of experimental materials and equipment and the performance of animal experiments flows through one office. This reduces the opportunity for the failures of communication. Centralized management can best establish comprehensive monitoring programs to evaluate important risk factors, such as animals and biological materials, before they are introduced into a facility.

BACKGROUND Gastrectomy or truncal vagotomy is known to increase the incidence of cholelithiasis. Many of these patients will become symptomatic, and the adhesions from their gastric resection may make laparoscopic cholecystectomy much more difficult. METHODS We prospectively assessed the data for the 15-year cumulative laparoscopic cholecystectomy experience of 1 surgeon at a university teaching hospital with respect to conversion and postoperative outcomes, with particular attention to patients having had previous gastric resections. RESULTS Patients with previous gastrectomies had similar operative times (mean 81.1, range 45-120 min), a higher conversion rate (64.2%) and a higher complication rate (35.7%) than those who had had other previous upper abdominal surgeries (mean 73.2, range 35-130 min, conversion 25% and complication 11.3%) and those without previous abdominal surgeries (mean 66.5, range 25-250 min, conversion 2.7% and complication 4.5%). CONCLUSION Preoperative knowledge of the increased conversion rate and increased morbidity will inform surgical planning for both the surgeon and the patient.

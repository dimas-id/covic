This paper addresses the challenge of automated remodularization of large systems as microservices. It focuses on the analysis of enterprise systems, which are widely used in corporate sectors and are notoriously large, monolithic and challenging to manually decouple because they manage asynchronous, user-driven business processes and business objects (BOs) having complex structural relationships. The technique presented leverages semantic knowledge of enterprise systems, i.e., BO structure, together with syntactic knowledge of the code, i.e., classes and interactions as part of static profiling and clustering. On a semantic level, BOs derived from databases form the basis for prospective clustering of classes as modules, while on a syntactic level, structural and interaction details of classes provide further insights for module dependencies and clustering, based on K-Means clustering and optimization. Our integrated techniques are validated using two open source enterprise customer relationship management systems, SugarCRM and ChurchCRM. The results demonstrate improved feasibility of remodularizing enterprise systems (inclusive of coded BOs and classes) as microservices. Furthermore, the recommended microservices, integrated with ‘backend’ enterprise systems, demonstrate improvements in key non-functional characteristics, namely high execution efficiency, scalability and availability.

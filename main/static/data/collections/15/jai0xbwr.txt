Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has placed societal and financial burden on the globe. Its rapid progressions from mild URI symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a matter of days is the underlying reason as to why the world is struggling to keep up with ventilator production. In this case report, we went about proning a corona virus positive patient for 6â€“8hrs as a potential early intervention to prevent progression to ARDS. Our patient was initially in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and placed on nasal cannula. He was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with no improvement of symptoms. However within the span of few hours of proning he experienced significant symptomatic relief with improvement of oxygenation. His oxygen saturation improved drastically and eventually was taken off of nasal cannula and discharged within span of one day of proning.

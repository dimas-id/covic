Abstract Viruses can infect all cell-based organisms, from bacteria to humans, animals, and plants. They are responsible for numerous cases of hospitalization, many deaths, and widespread crop destruction, which all result in an enormous medical, economical, and biological burden. Each of the currently used decontamination methods have important drawbacks. Cold plasma has entered this field as a novel, efficient, and clean solution for virus inactivation. Here, we present the recent developments in this promising field of cold-plasma-mediated virus inactivation, and describe the applications and mechanisms of the inactivation. This is a particularly relevant subject as viral pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, expose the need for alternative viral inactivation methods to replace, complement or upgrade existing ones.

“Alveolitis”, as opposed to “pneumonia”sensu striction, is a term used to denote diffuse inflammatory changes of the pulmonary parenchyma, excluding those that result from local bacterial, fungal or other extracellular microbial growth. The various types of alveolitis are classified according to their histological characteristics and range from “luminal phagocytic” or “mural lymphoplasmacellular” and “exudative” to “fibrosing” alveolitis. In this overview, various exogenous and endogenous causes of different types of alveolitis, and the cellular events in their pathogenesis are briefly discussed to illustrate the complex mechanisms involved. Particular emphasis is placed on the possible transition from diffuse exudative to fibrosing alveolitis. It appears that pulmonary fibrosis, which is usually patchy rather than truly diffuse, does not have a uniform pathogenesis. Besides the possibility of a certain degree of a diffuse fibrosis three major pathways are evident: (1) granulation tissue budding into alveolar lumina (luminal fibrosis) (2) exudate incorporation into alveolar walls (mural fibrosis) and — at least equally important-(3) so-called collapse (atelectatic) induration (obliterative-interseptal fibrosis), a process that has largely been neglected so far.

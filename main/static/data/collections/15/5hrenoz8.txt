We present a case of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after endoscopic endonasal resection of a large clival chordoma in an obese patient. The leak was at the lower reconstruction at the craniocervical junction and had failed repositioning. Using the V-Loc™ wound closure device (Covidien, New Haven, Connecticut) to suture the nasoseptal flap to the nasopharyngeal fascia, a water-tight seal was created and, along with a lumbar drain, the patient healed successfully.CSF leak after an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) to intradural pathologies remains one of the more common complications.1-4 Various closure techniques have been developed5-8 with success in mitigating this risk, but all have their limitations and rely on multiple layers including vascularized flaps like the nasoseptal flap.9-11 Endonasal suturing of graft materials offers the advantage of creating a water-tight seal. We present the use of the V-Loc™ wound closure device (Covidien) to successfully seal a postoperative CSF leak. The absorbable V-Loc™ wound closure device does not require the surgeon to tie knots, which is the most challenging step in a deep, 2-dimensional corridor. The suture is barbed and is anchored by threading the needle through a prefabricated loop at the end of the suture which locks in place. Each throw of the suture through tissue maintains the suture line as the barbs catch the tissue and prevent retraction. After successful closure, the needle can simply be cut off.The V-Loc™ wound closure device (Covidien) is a safe and effective adjunct to reconstruction after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery as it provides an option for graft/flap suturing.A written release from the patient whose name or likeness is submitted as part of this Work is on file.

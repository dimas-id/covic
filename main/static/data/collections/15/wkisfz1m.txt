Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is endemic in most pig producing countries worldwide and causes enormous economic losses to the pork industry. Infectious clones for PRRSV have been constructed, and so far at least 14 different infectious clones are available representing both genotypes I and II. Two strategies have been taken for progeny reconstitution: RNA transfection and DNA transfection. Mutations, insertions, deletions, and replacements of the viral genome have been employed to study the structure function relationship, foreign gene expression, functional complementation, and virulence determinants. Essential regions and non-essential regions for viral replication have been identified in both the coding regions and non-encoding regions. Foreign sequences have successfully been inserted into the nsp2 and N regions and in the space between ORF1b and ORF2a. Chimeras between member viruses in the family Arteriviridae have also been constructed and utilized to study cell tropism and functional complementation. This review discusses the advances and utilization of PRRSV reverse genetics and its potential for future research.

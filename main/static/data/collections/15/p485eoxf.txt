We performed a right atrial reduction plasty combined with the Cox-maze procedure in a patient with a giant right atrium and permanent atrial fibrillation. The reduction plasty involved excisions of the redundant atrial wall along two ablation lines of the maze procedure, and excision of the redundant thin septum primum. This procedure achieved a 60% dimension reduction and an 80% volume reduction. The reduced atrial size and sinus rhythm were maintained after 3.5 years.

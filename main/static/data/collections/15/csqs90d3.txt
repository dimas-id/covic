All laboratories have potential hazards, and the importance of understanding lab safety cannot be emphasized strongly enough. Scientists are expected to understand and be aware of the health and safety issues associated with their profession. Regardless of the standards for laboratory safety in their country of origin and regardless of their position, all researchers require a good understanding of safety features in English before they can begin working in an English-speaking laboratory. All research institutions in English-speaking countries require all new staff to go through a safety orientation or training course before they can begin work. Your employer or institution has a legal requirement to provide you with safety training before you begin work. Generally, a safety officer, a person who acts as the institutional or departmental administrator for safety-related matters, gives the course, and a written safety test must be completed by all new employees following training before work can commence in the laboratory. It is your legal duty to cooperate with your employer or institution’s efforts to improve safety in the workplace. Not respecting safety regulations and procedures while working in a laboratory does not only put your own health and others’ at risk, but it may also have an impact on the lab’s license and may lead to disciplinary action against you. Everyone must be aware and responsible so we can all enjoy our research while staying safe!

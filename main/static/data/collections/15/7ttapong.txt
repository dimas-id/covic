Data on the influence of sleep position on respiratory function and control in preterm infants are conflicting. Some investigators found a higher minute volume, reduced work of breathing and thoraco-abdominal asynchrony as well as improved oxygenation in the prone position (1-3). A Cochrane analysis, however, found insufficient evidence to determine effects of body positioning on apnoea, bradycardia and oxygen saturation in preterm infants (4).

This review paper focuses on detection and quantification techniques of indicator organisms that can be used for water quality assessment. The environmental pathogens that are critical to understand and better evaluate water quality are also discussed in this paper. Several recent studies using culture‐independent methods such as microbial source tracking, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, mitochondrial DNA, and next generation sequencing to assess various environmental samples and water bodies have been reviewed. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Various waterborne pathogens and cases of outbreak occurances due to presence of pathogens are studied in this review paper. Recent studies for detecting major indicator organisms to evaluate the presence of pathogens in water bodies are reviewed. Culture‐independent techniques as robust tools to detect and quantify waterborne pathogens are discussed in this review paper.

We present a case series of three patients with COVID-19 who developed arterial vascular complications, one who developed an acute CVA, one who developed popliteal artery occlusion and one who developed both during their hospital course. We present a case series of three patients admitted to Northwell Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York with COVID-19 as confirmed by PCR. The clinical disease course of COVID-19 has been well documented in China and Europe and most recently, the United States. Publications highlighting the non-respiratory complications of COVID-19 have been limited.[1, 2] Acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia in the ICU have been described as major complications of COVID-19.[3] A few publications have highlighted the incidence of venous thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.[4, 5].

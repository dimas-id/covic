PURPOSE: Post-operative cystoid macular oedema (CMO) can cause deterioration of vision following routine cataract surgery. The incidence of persistent CMO (pCMO; defined as CMO present after 3 months) following uncomplicated surgery is uncertain. We wished to identify the incidence, management and visual outcomes of such patients. METHODS: A Scottish Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (SOSU) questionnaire was sent monthly to every ophthalmic specialist in Scotland over an 18-month period from 1st January 2018 asking them to report all new patients with pCMO confirmed on OCT scanning following uncomplicated cataract surgery. A follow-up questionnaire was sent 9 months after initial presentation. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of pCMO were reported, giving an incidence of 2.2 cases of pCMO per 10,000 uncomplicated cataract surgeries. Mean age was 74.9 years (SD 10.2; range 44–86) with a male preponderance (72.7%). Two patients developed pCMO in each eye. Six cases (46.2%) had hypertension and one had diabetes. Three eyes required intracameral adjuncts (two iris hooks, one intracameral phenylephrine). Postoperative visual acuity (VA) at 3 months was logMAR 0.48 (0.2–0.8). Average mean central retinal thickness (CRT) at 3 months was 497microns (270–788). The most common initial treatment comprised topical steroids and topical NSAIDs (61.5%). Other management strategies included systemic steroids, intravitreal steroids and oral acetazolamide. At 1-year post-op, mean VA was logMAR 0.18 (0.1–0.3) with average mean CRT of 327microns (245–488). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a low incidence of pCMO following uncomplicated cataract surgery in Scotland (0.02%), with inconsistent and variable management regimes. A nationally agreed treatment protocol is required.

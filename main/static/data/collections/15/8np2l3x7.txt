Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide, and has been declared as an international public health concern. Patients with lung cancer are highly susceptible to infection compared to healthy individuals because of systemic immunosuppression induced by malignancy and anticancer therapy. Furthermore, patients with cancer demonstrate poorer outcomes following infection. Hence, patients with lung cancer should be considered a priority group for COVID-19 prevention. Furthermore, the routine treatment of patients with cancer has been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, and patients may not have been able to undergo timely and effective antitumor treatment, thereby indicating a poor prognosis. Here, we provide some suggestions for early identification of COVID-19 and differential diagnosis in patients with lung cancer who have fever and respiratory symptoms. Our medical team also provide clinical recommendations on lung cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic, for carrying out meticulous and individualized clinical management of lung cancer patients and maximum protection to effectively prevent COVID-19. KEY POINTS: Significant findings of the study This article provides suggestions for early identification of COVID-19 and differential diagnosis in patients with lung cancer with fever and respiratory symptoms. What this study adds This article makes clinical recommendations on lung cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

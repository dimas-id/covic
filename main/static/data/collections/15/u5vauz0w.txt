A 61-d-old fennec fox (Vulpes zerda), 11 d after receiving a multivalent, modified-live virus vaccine containing canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus 2 (CAdV-2), parainfluenza virus, parvovirus, and canine coronavirus, developed oculonasal discharge, and subsequently convulsions, and hemoptysis, and died. Microscopic changes in the cerebrum were evident, including neuronal degeneration and necrosis; intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies were observed in astrocytes. CDV was detected in the brain tissue by immunohistochemistry. Pulmonary lesions of multifocal necrotizing bronchopneumonia had Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions in the bronchial epithelial cells. Electron microscopy revealed crystalline arrays of adenovirus-like particles within the intranuclear inclusions. Additionally, the hemagglutinin gene of CDV and the CAdV-2 DNA polymerase gene were detected in the fennec fox; sequence analysis showed 100% identity with those of the vaccine strain viruses. To our knowledge, vaccine-induced CDV and CAdV-2 coinfections using molecular analysis have not been reported previously. Therefore, vaccine strains should be considered prior to CDV vaccination in nondomestic carnivores.

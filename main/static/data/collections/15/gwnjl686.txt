A critical but unanswered question is what defines each individual’s pre-morbid susceptibility to infection? w e propose that individuals must have an “immune haplotype” that shapes their response to infectious agents. Infection is a balance between the intrinsic virulence of the infectious agent and the host defenses. Recent viral outbreaks of SARS and influenza serve to illustrate this point as these viruses cause severe disease in certain individuals, yet there are others in whom the same infectious challenge results in minimal symptoms. On the other hand it might be that those self same people who are resistance to one particular viral infection might be susceptible to other infection challenges. Similar rules can apply to susceptibility to bacterial infections.

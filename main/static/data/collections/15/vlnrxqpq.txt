The gravitational wave detector of higher sensitivity and greater bandwidth is required for future gravitational wave astronomy and cosmology. Here we present a new type broadband high frequency laser interferometer gravitational wave detector utilizing polarization of light as signal carrier. Except for Fabry-Perot cavity arms we introduce dual power recycling to further amplify the gravitational wave signals. A novel method of weak measurement amplification is used to amplify signals for detection and to guarantee the long-term run of detector. Equipped with squeezed light, the proposed detector is shown sensitive enough within the window from 100Hz to several kHz, making it suitable for the study of high frequency gravitational wave sources. With zero-area Sagnac topology, the detector has the potential to realize quantum non-demolition measurement. The detector presented here is expected to provide an alternative way of exploring the possible ground-base gravitational wave detector for the need of future research.

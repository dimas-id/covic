A 1,7-bis(alkylamino)diazachrysene-based small molecule was previously identified as an inhibitor of the botulinum neurotoxin serotype A light chain metalloprotease. Subsequently, a variety of derivatives of this chemotype were synthesized to develop structure-activity relationships, and all are inhibitors of the BoNT/A LC. Three-dimensional analyses indicated that half of the originally discovered 1,7-DAAC structure superimposed well with 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline-based antimalarial agents. This observation led to the discovery that several of the 1,7-DAAC derivatives are potent in vitro inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum and, in general, are more efficacious against CQ-resistant strains than against CQ-susceptible strains. In addition, by inhibiting Î²-hematin formation, the most efficacious 1,7-DAAC-based antimalarials employ a mechanism of action analogous to that of 4,7-ACQ-based antimalarials and are well tolerated by normal cells. One candidate was also effective when administered orally in a rodent-based malaria model. Finally, the 1,7-DAAC-based derivatives were examined for Ebola filovirus inhibition in an assay employing Vero76 cells, and three provided promising antiviral activities and acceptably low toxicities.

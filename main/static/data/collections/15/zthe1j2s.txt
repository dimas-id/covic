Healthy animals are of paramount importance in obtaining meaningful, reliable scientific results. Viral infections of rodents often have a significant impact on various types of biomedical research. Laboratory animal specialists and researchers must be aware of the possible consequences associated with the use of infected animals. The objective of the paper is a discussion of the frequently encountered viral infections that can complicate or invalidate the interpretation of results by altering the host's response.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common pediatric disease, that involves up to the 25% of children worldwide. Environmental pollution, passive smoke, and many viruses are actively involved in the chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa. As described previously in the literature, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children is uncommon and often asymptomatic or mild.

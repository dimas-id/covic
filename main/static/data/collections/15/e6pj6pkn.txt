Abstract Recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi can function as a live vector to deliver foreign antigens to the mammalian immune system and induce both mucosal and systemic immunity. In this study, we generated a recombinant Salmonella Typhi strain pilS− pilT−Gag+(pVAX1-gp120) harboring the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gag gene integrated into the bacterial chromosome and gp120 gene carried by a plasmid. Mice inoculated with this recombinant bacterium through intranasal route produced high titers of IgG to gp120 in sera and IgA to gp120 in fecal washes. In addition, Gag-specific and gp120-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were observed in sorted spleen lymphocytes of immunized mice. These results demonstrated that this recombinant Salmonella Typhi strain elicits multiple immune responses against both Gag and gp120 antigens of HIV, and thus would be a potential vaccine candidate to the prevention of HIV/AIDS.

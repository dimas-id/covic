The world is confronting a dire situation due to the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) with the mortality rate passed over 470,000. Attaining efficient drugs evolve in parallel to the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The current drugs in the pipeline and some plausible drugs are overviewed in this paper. Although different types of antiviral targets are applicable for SARS-CoV-2 drug screenings, the more promising targets can be considered as 3C-like main protease (3CL protease) and RNA polymerase. The remdesivir could be considered the closest bifunctional drug to the provisional clinical administration for SARS-CoV-2. The known molecular targets of the SARS-CoV-2 include fourteen targets while four molecules of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cathepsin L, 3CL protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are suggested as more promising potential targets. Accordingly, dual-acting drugs as an encouraging solution in drug discovery are suggested. Emphasizing the potential route of SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus entry related factors like integrins, cathepsin and ACE2 seems valuable. The potential molecular targets of each phase of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle are discussed and highlighted in this paper. Much progress in understanding the SARS-CoV-2 and molecular details of its life cycle followed by the identification of new therapeutic targets are needed to lead us to an efficient approach in anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.

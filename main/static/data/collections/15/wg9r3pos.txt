Viruses cause a high percentage of community-acquired pneumonias. The advent of polymerase chain reaction and other molecular techniques has been associated with the detection of a higher prevalence of common respiratory viruses than previously suspected. Better diagnostics have shown new viral pathogens regularly in epidemics, immunocompromised patients, and occasionally children. Despite better diagnostics, treatment for all but influenza is still very limited.

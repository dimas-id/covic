Abstract Objectives Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause frequent hospital outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, with emergency departments as the initial site of the spread of this virus. Methods The risk of transmission of MERS-CoV infection to healthcare workers (HCWs) was assessed in an outbreak in Riyadh. All HCWs with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24h of exposure. Two negative results for MERS-CoV obtained 3days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to end the isolation of the HCWs and allow their return to duty. Results Overall 17 out of 879 HCWS with different levels of exposure tested positive for MERS-CoV. Of the 15 positive HCWS with adequate follow-up, 40% (6/15 HCWs) tested positive on the first sampling and 53% (8/15) tested positive on the second sampling. The time to negative results among the 15 positive HCWs ranged between 4 and 47days (average 14.5 days) and the infected HCWs needed on average two samples for clearance. All positive HCWs were either asymptomatic or had mild disease. Conclusions The data obtained in this study support the widespread testing of all close contacts of MERS-CoV cases, regardless of the significance of the contact or presence or absence of symptoms. In addition, urgent careful review of guidance regarding the return of asymptomatic MERS-CoV-positive HCWs under investigation to active duty is needed.

Rhinovirus infections are common in all age groups world-wide, and they occur throughout the year. In this study, we examined 2,689 nasopharyngeal swabs collected in Mongolia during 2008-2013. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were detected in 295 (11.0%) samples, and 85 (28.8%) patients were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. HRV was co-detected with bocavirus, human coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus in 21 (24.7%), 17 (20.0%), and 14 (16.5%), respectively. We tested 170 (57.6%) of the 295 HRV-positive samples: 117 HRV strains were typed by using the VP4/VP2 method and 53 by using 5' UTR method. We found HVR-A, HVR-C, and HVR-B infections in 80 (47.1%), 76 (44.7%), and 14 (8.2%) samples, respectively.

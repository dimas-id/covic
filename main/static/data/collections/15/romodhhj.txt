Carotid artery stenosis is relatively common and is a significant cause of ischemic stroke, but carotid revascularization can reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with significant symptomatic stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy has been and remains the gold standard treatment to reduce the risk of carotid artery stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) (or carotid artery stent implantation) is another method of carotid revascularization, which has developed rapidly over the last 30 years. To date, the frequency of use of CAS is increasing, and clinical outcomes are improving with technical advancements. However, the value of CAS remains unclear in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis. This review article discusses the basic concepts and procedural techniques involved in CAS.

We present a case of combined coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve (MV) repair using a robotic totally endoscopic right-sided approach. A 61-year-old man presented with fatigue due to significant mitral regurgitation and was found to have a tight stenosis in the mid left anterior descending artery. Using the da Vinci robotic system, the patient underwent a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery using the C-Port Flex A distal anastomotic device followed by a MV repair. Both procedures were performed endoscopically via right chest ports and right femorofemoral bypass successfully. The patient was discharged from the hospital 3 days postoperatively and returned to normal activity within 3 weeks after surgery. This case study shows the feasibility of using an endoscopic robotic approach in selected patients undergoing combined MV coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

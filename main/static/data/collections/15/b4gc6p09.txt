Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is a novel approach pioneered to tackle the challenges posed by difficult pelvic dissections in rectal cancer and the restrictions in angulation of currently available laparoscopic staplers. To date, four techniques can be employed in order to create the colorectal/coloanal anastomosis following TaTME. We present a technical note describing these techniques and discuss the risks and benefits of each.

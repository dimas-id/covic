N-Variant Execution (NVX) systems utilize artificial diversity techniques to enhance software security. The general idea is to run multiple different variants of the same program alongside each other while monitoring their diverging behavior on a malicious input. Existing NVX systems execute diversified program variants on a single host. This means the level of inter-variant diversity will be limited to what a single platform can offer, without costly emulation. This paper presents DMON , a novel distributed NVX design that executes native program variants across multiple heterogeneous hosts. Our approach greatly increases the level of diversity between the simultaneously running variants that can be supported, encompassing different ISAs and ABIs. Our evaluation shows that DMON can provide comparable performance to traditional, non-distributed NVX systems, while enhancing security.

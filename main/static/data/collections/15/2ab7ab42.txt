This study evaluated the substitution of soybean meal with non-protein nitrogen sources, in combination with ground or whole corn for feedlot cattle. Fifty-four Charolais x Nellore steers with 22 ± 0.23 months and 250 ± 15.80 kg were assigned to a 3 x 2 factorial completely randomized experimental design. The treatments consisted of different combinations of concentrate formulation: soybean meal with whole or ground corn, conventional urea with whole or ground corn, and protected urea with whole or ground corn. There was interaction between nitrogen source and collection date for serum albumin, with increasing elevation for soybean meal; while there was elevation from day 0 to day 84, stabilizing until the slaughter, for urea. Higher intakes of dry matter and crude protein, daily weight gain and rumination efficiency were observed for soybean meal. Steers that received protect urea spent more time to feed, in comparison to soybean meal. Longer idle time was verified for soybean meal; while conventional urea was superior to protected urea. Replacing soybean meal by sources of non-protein nitrogen limits the results of blood metabolites, performance and ingestive behavior.(AU)

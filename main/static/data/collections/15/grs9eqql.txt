Abstract Remote estimation of vital signs is an important and active area of research. The goal of this work was to analyze the feasibility of estimating respiration parameters from video sequences of faces recorded using a mobile thermal camera. Different estimators were analyzed and experimentally verified. It was demonstrated that the respiration rate, periodicity of respiration, and presence and length of apnea periods could be reliably estimated from signals recorded using a portable thermal camera. The size of the camera and efficiency of the methods allow the implementation of this method in smart glasses.

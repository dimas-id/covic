Abstract Purpose To describe the multiplicity of ocular manifestations of COVID-19 patients, we report a case of pseudomembranous and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis related with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a patient of intensive care unit (ICU). Observations A 63-year-old male was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), seven days after the beginning of an influenza-like symptoms, to manage an acute respiratory syndrome related with SARS-CoV-2. Chest scan showed interstitial pneumonia with “crazy paving” patterns. At day 19, ocular examination at the patient's bed described petechias and tarsal hemorrhages, mucous filaments and tarsal pseudomembranous. Conjunctival scrapings and swabs did not identify any bacteria or virus. To our knowledge, we described the first case of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis in a COVID-19 patient. Conclusion and importance Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is present in tears and conjunctival secretions, external ocular infections could be factors of infectious spreading. Physicians should be aware of late (>2 weeks) ocular complications in COVID-19 patients to prevent sequelae.

The specific characteristics of mammalian cells discussed in Chap. 2 require adapted solutions for bioreactor design and operation. Especially, cell damage by shear stress and aeration has to be considered. Therefore this chapter starts with a detailed discussion of shear stress effects on mammalian cells (anchorage-dependent and suspendable cells) in model systems and bioreactors, respectively, and consequences for reactor design. Appropriate oxygen supply is another critical issue, as adapted oxygen supply systems are required. Techniques for immobilization of cells, either grown on microcarriers in suspension culture or within macroporous carriers in fixed bed or fluidized bed reactors, are discussed as well. With respect to the operation of bioreactors, the characteristics of different culture modes (batch, fed-batch, chemostat, perfusion) are introduced and practical examples are given. Finally, concepts for monitoring of bioreactors, including offline and online methods as well as control loops (e.g. O(2), pH), are considered.

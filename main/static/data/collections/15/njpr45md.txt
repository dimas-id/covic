The best way to control the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is measuring the body temperature precisely, therefore, it is very important to develop a set of high-precision infrared thermodetector for Medicine. The ambient temperature signal and the object temperature signal were collected with two channel AD gates of thermopile infrared sensor unit. The values were calculated by using mulriple linear interpolation algorithm. The precision of the system can reach 0.1Â°C and the machine can work well in megathermal environment*.

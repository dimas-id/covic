ABSTRACT As the world slowly starts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems are now thinking about resuming elective cardiovascular procedures, including procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratories (cath lab). Rebooting cath labs will be an arduous process in part due to limited healthcare resources, new processes and fears stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a detailed phased-in approach that considers clinical, patient-centered, and operational strategies to safely and effectively reboot cath lab programs during these unprecedented times. This model balances delivery of essential cardiovascular care while reducing exposure and preserving resources. The guiding principles detailed in this manuscript can be used by cath lab programs when restarting elective interventional procedures.

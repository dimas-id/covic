PURPOSE Deep infiltrating endometriosis with colorectal involvement is a complex disorder, often requiring segmental bowel resection. Complete removal of all visible lesions is considered the adequate treatment of infiltrating endometriosis in order to reduce recurrence. In this article, we describe our experience with laparoscopic management of deep infiltrating endometriosis with involvement of the rectum. METHODS A retrospective analysis of data from patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis with rectal involvement who underwent a laparoscopic surgery in the years 2002-2009 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at our institution was done. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2009, a laparoscopic partial rectal resection was performed in 52 patients, and laparoscopic disk resection was performed in 4 cases with deep infiltrating endometriosis. The mean age of patients was 34.4 years (range, 22-62 years). Preoperative symptoms included dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. The laparoscopic procedure was converted to formal laparotomy in 3 patients (5.4%). The mean duration of surgery was 145 minutes. Postoperative complications included 3 cases of anastomotic leakage with rectovaginal fistula in two cases and intraabdominal bleeding in 1 case. The mean hospital stay was 7 days. Postoperatively, nine patients had a normal delivery, two of them after in vitro fertilization treatment. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic rectal resection for deep infiltrating endometriosis is a relatively safe procedure, when performed by a surgeon and a gynecologist with sufficient experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

Background Little is known about adenovirus infections in adult lung transplant recipients. Because the virus can establish latency, re-activation may be relatively common after transplantation. Methods We assessed adenovirus infection in 80 adult lung transplant recipients. Adenovirus polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR assay; limit of detection âˆ¼25 copies/ml plasma) was done on plasma samples collected at regular intervals until 1 year post-transplant. Results Adenovirus DNA was detected in 18 of 80 patients (22.5%) and in 19 of 595 (3.4%) plasma samples up to 12 months post-transplant. Median time to detection of viremia was 134 days post-transplant (range 1 to 370 days). Median viral load was 180 copies/ml plasma (range 50 to 360 copies/ml). Symptoms were evaluated at the time of adenovirus detection: 14 of 18 (78%) patients were asymptomatic; 4 of 18 (22%) patients had otherwise unexplained febrile/flu-like illness that resolved spontaneously. Adenovirus was not found to be a trigger for acute rejection. No detrimental effect on pulmonary function was seen immediately after adenovirus infection. Conclusions Adenovirus viremia is common in adult lung transplant recipients. In contrast to findings on adenoviral pneumonitis in lung transplant recipients, isolated episodes of low-level viremia are self-limited and do not trigger acute rejection or a decline in pulmonary function.

Sanquisorba officinalis has been used internally for the treatment of intestinal infections and duodenal ulcers, as well as hemorrhoids, phlebitis and varicose veins and female disorders, and topically to heal wounds, burns, and ulcers. In our study, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, as well as quantitative analysis of polyphenols (phenolic acids, flavonoids and total polyphenols) in methanol and aqueous extracts from S. officinalis herbs are presented. A correlation between the antioxidant activity and composition of tested extracts indicates that flavonoids are the major compounds causing scavenging of free radicals. Higher content of flavonoids was found in the methanol extract, while the content of total phenolics was higher in the aqueous extract. Both extracts from S. officinalis herbs showed antioxidant activity and high antimicrobial activity in a wide spectrum of test strains.

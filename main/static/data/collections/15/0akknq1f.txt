BACKGROUND The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. METHODS We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes. RESULTS Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%). Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings. Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have presentations that are similar to that of the general population. Our current treatment protocol appears to be associated with favorable outcomes, but longer follow-up of a larger cohort of patients is needed.

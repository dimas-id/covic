Abstract Disasters, including infectious disease outbreaks, are inevitable. Hospitals need to plan in advance to ensure that their systems can adapt to a rapidly changing environment if necessary. This review provides an overview of ten general principles that hospitals and healthcare systems should consider when developing disaster plans. The principles are consistent with an “all-hazards” approach to disaster mitigation. This approach is adapted to planning for a multiplicity of threats, but emphasizes highly relevant scenarios, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We also describe specific ways these principles helped prepare our hospital for this pandemic. Key points include acting quickly, identifying and engaging key stakeholders early, providing accurate information, prioritizing employee safety and mental health, promoting a fully integrated clinical response, developing surge plans, preparing for ethical dilemmas, and having a cogent exit strategy for post disaster recovery.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)--the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19)--has been detected in domestic dogs and cats, raising concerns of transmission from, to, or between these animals. There is currently no indication that feline- or canine-to-human transmission can occur, though there is rising evidence of the reverse. To explore the extent of animal-related transmission, we aggregated 17 case reports on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals as of 15 May 2020. All but two animals fully recovered and had only mild respiratory or digestive symptoms. Using data from probable cat-to-cat transmission in Wuhan, China, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 under this scenario at 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.13). This value is much lower than the R0 reported for humans and close to one, indicating that the sustained transmission between cats is unlikely to occur. Our results support the view that the pet owners and other persons with COVID-19 in close contact with animals should be cautious of the way they interact with them.

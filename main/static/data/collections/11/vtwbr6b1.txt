The treatment of intracranial aneurysms has undergone precipitous expansion since the first detachable coils were used less than two decades ago. With rapidly expanding technology comes the need to keep all involved parties informed. The objective of our review is to provide a comprehensive, succinct overview of novel paradigms and devices used to treat intracranial aneurysms. We have divided these new technologies into: (1) coils, (2) flow diverters, (3) adjunctive balloon devices, and (4) stents.

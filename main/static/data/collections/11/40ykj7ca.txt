Abstract Glycyrrhizin is one of the main bioactive components in liquorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch) which has recently been found to be highly active in inhibiting replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated virus. The separation and purification of glycyrrhizin from a methanol–water (70:30 (v/v)) extract of liquorice roots was achieved using high-speed counter-current chromatography. The separation was performed at a preparative scale in a one-step separation with a two-phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate–methanol–water (5:2:5 (v/v)). The lower phase was used as the mobile phase in the head-to-tail elution mode. The present method yielded 42.2mg glycyrrhizin at 96.8% purity from 130mg of the crude exact with 95.2% recovery as determined by HPLC analysis.

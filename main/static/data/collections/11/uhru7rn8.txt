Impact of mutations on the evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are needed for ongoing global efforts to track and trace the current pandemic, in order to enact effective prevention and treatment options. SARS-Co-V-2 viral genomes were detected and sequenced from 18 Romanian patients suffering from coronavirus disease-2019. Viral Spike S glycoprotein sequences were used to generate model structures and assess the role of mutations on protein stability. We integrated the phylogenetic tree within the available European SARS-Co-V-2 genomic sequences. We further provide an epidemiological overview of the pre-existing conditions that are lethal in relevant Romanian patients. Non-synonymous mutations in the viral Spike glycoprotein relating to infectivity are constructed in models of protein structures. Continuing search to limit and treat SARS-CoV-2 benefit from our contribution in delineating the viral Spike glycoprotein mutations, as well as from assessment of their role on protein stability or complex formation with human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Our results help implement and extend worldwide genomic surveillance of coronavirus disease-2019.

Abstract Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection has been found to account for an increasing proportion cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in recent epidemiology studies. CVB3 is a single stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus and the infection can cause prominent health threat to pre-school children. Here, by taking approaches of reverse genetics, we established a single-round infection system for CVB3. The pseudovirus was produced by sequential transfection of CVB3 capsid expresser plasmid and CVB3 replicon RNA bearing firefly luciferase as a reporter. The CVB3 pseudovirus system was used for quantifying neutralizing antibody (NtAb) levels of 720 human serum samples and showed superior specificity and sensitivity comparing traditional cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Furthermore, we compared the seroprevalence of CVB3 NtAbs in pre-school children and healthy adults, and found that only 11.94% of pre-school children were NtAbs positive which suggested that most children were naive to CVB3 infection; while there is much higher positive rate in adults (60%) indicating that most adults have experienced CVB3 infection during childhood. This rapid and quantitative assay greatly facilitates evaluating the level of NtAbs against CVB3 in populations and will help to advance CVB3 vaccine development.

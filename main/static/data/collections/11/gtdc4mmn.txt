Clinical assessment of an infant's heart rate (HR) in the delivery room (DR) has been reported to be inaccurate. We compared auscultation of the HR using a stethoscope with electrocardiography (ECG) and pulse oximetry (PO) for determining the HR in 92 low-risk newborn infants in the DR. Caregivers auscultated the HR while masked to the HR on the monitor. Auscultation underestimated ECG HR (mean difference (95% CI) by -9 (-15 to -2) beats per minute (bpm)) and PO HR (mean difference (95% CI) by -5 (-12 to 2) bpm). The median (IQR) time to HR by auscultation was 14 (10-18) s. As HR was determined quickly and with reasonable accuracy by auscultation in low-risk newborns, study in high-risk infants is warranted.

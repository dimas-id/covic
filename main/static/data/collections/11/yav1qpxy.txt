Objectives To review the clinicopathological findings in naturally‐occurring, histopathologically confirmed cases of feline infectious peritonitis in client‐owned cats in Sydney, Australia, with the purpose of identifying factors assisting in the diagnosis of this complex disease syndrome and to characterise the disease as it occurs in this region. Design Retrospective clinical study: the clinical records of all cats with histopathologically confirmed feline infectious peritonitis at the University Veterinary Centre Sydney and a private cat hospital in Sydney between 1990 and 2002 were reviewed for signalment, history, physical findings, diagnostic test results and the distribution of histological lesions throughout the body at necropsy. Results Forty‐two cats met the inclusion criteria. Significant features of this study that unique to the contemporary literature are i) the over‐representation of certain breeds (Burmese, Australian Mist, British Shorthaired, and Cornish Rex) and the under‐representation of other breeds (Domestic Shorthaired, Persian); ii) the overrepresentation of males; iii) the tendency for effusive disease in Australian Mist cats and non‐effusive disease in Burmese; iv) the even age distribution of disease seen in cats older than 2 years‐of‐age; and v) the presence of fulminant immune‐mediated haemolytic anaemia in two cats in this study. Conclusion The study highlights the diverse range of clinical manifestations and the complexities experienced by clinicians in diagnosing this fatal disease. Some aspects of the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of feline infectious peritonitis appear different to the disease encountered in Europe and North America, most notably the over‐representation of specific breeds and the presence of immune‐mediated haemolytic anaemia.

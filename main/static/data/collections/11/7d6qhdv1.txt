Abstract Given imperfect vaccination we extend the existing non-smooth models by considering susceptible and vaccinated individuals enhance the protection and control strategies once the number of infected individuals exceeds a certain level. On the basis of global dynamics of two subsystems, for the formulated Filippov system, we examine the sliding mode dynamics, the boundary equilibrium bifurcations, and the global dynamics. Our main results show that it is possible that the pseudo-equilibrium exists and is globally stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium, the disease-free equilibrium and the real equilibrium are tri-stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium and the real equilibrium are bi-stable, or the pseudo-equilibrium and disease-free equilibrium are bi-stable, which depend on the threshold value and other parameter values. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium or pseudo-equilibrium reveals that we may eradicate the disease or maintain the number of infected individuals at a previously given value. Further, the bi-stability and tri-stability imply that whether the number of infected individuals tends to zero or a previously given value or other positive values depends on the parameter values and the initial states of the system. This emphasizes the importance of threshold policy and challenges in the control of infectious diseases if without perfect vaccines.

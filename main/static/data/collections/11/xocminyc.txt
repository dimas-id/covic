PURPOSE Minimally invasive surgery has evolved into single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in the recent years. Few reports have addressed the practicality of SILS in children. Our current experience with regard to feasibility and effectiveness of SILS in children is presented. METHODS A retrospective review of the operative database for patients operated on using SILS in our department from March 2009 to July 2010 was performed. Data regarding the type of the procedure, age, sex, operative performance, hospital stay, and complications were collected. MAIN RESULTS Among 43 patients, cholecystectomy was performed in 11; appendectomy, in 10; unroofing for ovarian cysts, in 5; unroofing for splenic cysts, in 4; oophorectomy, in 6 (ovarian torsion, 2; teratoma, 4); ovary-preserving teratoma excision, in 1; splenectomy, in 1; gonadectomy, in 3; and varicocelectomy, in 2. There were no conversions to standard laparoscopic or open techniques. The only postoperative complication was a wound infection that occurred after an appendectomy. CONCLUSION Although currently more expensive, SILS can be performed in children in almost every pediatric surgical procedure that can be accomplished with conventional laparoscopic techniques. The most significant contribution of SILS procedure is cosmesis. Postoperative pain and length of hospital stay were not improved.

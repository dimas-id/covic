The YAKSHA project aims at reinforcing EU-ASEAN cooperation and building partnerships in cybersecurity domain by developing a solution tailored to specific national needs leveraging EU know-how and local knowledge. YAKSHA enhances cybersecurity readiness levels for its end-users, helps better prevent cyber-attacks, reduces cyber-risks and better governs the whole cybersecurity process. The EU-ASEAN cooperation also helps to mitigate some of the weaknesses identified in the cybersecurity ecosystem. In this paper, we consider the protocol deployment process for employing honeypot-as-a-service, with focus on the Internet of Things (IoT) use case.

Nowadays, high-throughput analysis of biological events is a great challenge which could take benefit of the recent development of microarray devices. The great potential of such technology is related to the availability of a chip bearing a large set of probes, stable and easy to obtain, and suitable for ligand-binding detection. Here, we describe a new method based on polypyrrole chemistry, allowing the covalent immobilization of peptides in a microarray format and on a gold surface compatible with the use of surface plasmon resonance. This technique is then illustrated by the detection and characterization of antibodies induced by hepatitis C virus and present in patients' serums.

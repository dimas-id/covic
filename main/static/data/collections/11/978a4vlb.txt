BACKGROUND The use of energy devices during laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer has increased as the frequency of laparoscopic surgery has increased. Our aim was to compare the perioperative surgical outcomes between using a bipolar device and an ultrasonic device during laparoscopic gastrectomy. METHODS Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database identified 186 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy performed by a single surgeon between November 2010 and August 2013. A bipolar device was used for 116 patients, and an ultrasonic device was used for 70 patients. Patient characteristics and perioperative surgical outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS Clinicopathologic characteristics were similar for both groups. The bipolar group had a significantly shorter operation time (154.9 vs. 167.8 min, p = 0.028) and higher rate of D2 lymph node dissection (29.3 vs. 15.7 %, p = 0.012). The bipolar device group experienced significantly less pain at 12 h [visual analog scale (VAS) pain score: 3.9 vs. 4.7, p = 0.027) and 18 h (VAS pain score: 3.5 vs. 4.1, p = 0.036) postoperatively. The bipolar group had earlier abdominal drain removal (p = 0.001) and a shorter hospital stay (p = 0.024). No significant differences in laboratory value changes, morbidity, or mortality were observed between the groups. CONCLUSION Compared with the ultrasonic device, the bipolar device provided advantages in operation time, degree of postoperative pain, time of drain removal, and length of hospital stay. The bipolar device may be a useful and efficient energy device for laparoscopic gastrectomy. However, larger studies to confirm the safety of bipolar device during laparoscopic gastrectomy are warranted.

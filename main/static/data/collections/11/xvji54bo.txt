Many viruses have been investigated for the development of genetic vaccines and the ideal ones must be endowed with many properties, such as the quality and the quantity of the immunological response induced against the encoded antigens, safety and production on a large scale basis. Viral based vaccines must also deal with the potential problem of the pre-existing antivector immunity. Several viral vaccine vectors have emerged to date, all of them having relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application. Recent successes reflect diverse improvements such as development of new adenovirus serotypes and prime-boost regimes. This chapter describes the features of four viral vector systems based on poxviruses, adenoviruses, alphaviruses and lentiviruses and recent results following their use with a particular emphasis on clinical research, highlighting the challenges and successes.

Contact tracing and quarantine are well established non-pharmaceutical epidemic control tools. The paper aims to clarify the impact of these measures in COVID-19 epidemic. A new deterministic model is introduced (SEIRQ: susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed, quarantined) with Q compartment capturing individuals and releasing them with delay. We obtain a simple rule defining the reproduction number $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of quarantine parameters, ratio of diagnosed cases and transmission parameters. The model is applied to the epidemic in Poland in March - April 2020, when social distancing measures were in place. We investigate 3 scenarios corresponding to different ratios of diagnosed cases. Our results show that depending on the scenario contact tracing could have prevented from 50\% to over 90\% of cases. The effects of quarantine are limited by fraction of undiagnosed cases. Taking into account the transmission intensity in Poland prior to introduction of social restrictions it is unlikely that the control of the epidemic could be achieved without any social distancing measures.

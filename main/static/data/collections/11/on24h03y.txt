We regard the set of papers in this issue (OIE Rev. sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz., 28 [2]) as a blueprint for an agenda to bridge the divides within the global scope of the veterinary profession, so that it will meet its responsibilities to the world as it develops in the coming decades. It defines the areas with which all veterinary students should be knowledgeable, provides emphasis on the need to expand the education of all veterinary students in terms of their global health responsibilities, and then provides insights into the educational approaches that can result in the inclusion of global health issues within the veterinary curriculum.

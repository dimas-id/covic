BACKGROUND The introduction of robotics in bariatric surgery is a novel development since the beginning of this century. The aim of this study is to compare surgical outcome of the robotic gastric bypass with the laparoscopic counterpart. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to compare the results of 100 fully robotic gastric bypasses (RGB) and 100 laparoscopic gastric bypasses (LGB) performed by a single surgeon. Surgical outcome was analysed by evaluating operation room time and surgical time, morbidity and mortality, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS In the RGB and LGB group, respectively, 92 and 80 % of operated patients were female (p = 0.024). Mean age was 39 (range 20-62, SD 10.21) and 42 years (range 18-65, SD 11.87), respectively (p = 0.158). Mean BMI was 40 (range 35-47, SD 2.66) and 42 (range 35-56, SD 4.75), respectively (p < 0.05). Mean surgical time was 67 (range 39-210, SD 22.46) and 31 min (range 18-62, SD 9.12), respectively (p < 0.05). Mean operation room time was 117 (range 80-257, SD 30.13) and 66 min (range 38-101, SD 12.68), respectively (p < 0.05). The surgery-related 30-day morbidity rate was 5 % in both groups. Major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo class 3-4) was 3 and 1 %, respectively (p = 0.62). There was no mortality. Median hospital stay was two postoperative days in both groups. A learning curve developed after 25 procedures. CONCLUSIONS The RGB is a feasible procedure. Although more time is needed, a standardized technique results in fair operation times in the hands of an experienced surgeon.

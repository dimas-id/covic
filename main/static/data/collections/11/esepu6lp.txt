BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) carries a high rate of failure and reoperation. Laparoscopic conversion of failed LAGB to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been shown to be safe and feasible, but long-term follow-up data is still limited. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RYGB after failed LAGB in our patient population. SETTING The setting was the University Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon. METHODS Using a prospectively collected database, we retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent LAGB revision to RYGB at our institution between 2006 and 2014. RESULTS A total of 58 patients underwent RYGB after failed LAGB in our institution between 2006 and 2014. Of those, 20 patients (34.5%) had concomitant band removal while the rest underwent a two-stage RYGB after a mean of 30 months after band removal. A follow-up was achieved in 84.5, 82, 83, 95, and 76% of patients at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after RYGB. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 62.8, 68.1, 64.2, 63.8, and 61.3% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 28.4, 30.7, 29.4, 28.9, and 28.6% at the corresponding time periods. The most common short-term complications were abscesses/leaks (5.2%) while the most common long-term complications were symptomatic gallstones necessitating laparoscopic cholecystectomy (5.2%), incisional hernias (5.2%), and small-bowel obstruction (3.4%). No surgery-related mortality was recorded. CONCLUSIONS RYGB is a safe procedure with favorable weight loss outcomes at 5 years and can be considered a good rescue procedure after failed LAGB.

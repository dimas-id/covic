X-ray imaging is an important method for the diagnosis of corona virus disease(COVID-19), but there is a risk of nosocomial infection during X-ray imaging diagnosis. By analyzing the process of X-ray imaging diagnosis and the possible infection factors in hospital, Jiangsu province took the lead in issuing the Guideline for the nosocomial infection prevention and control of X-ray imaging diagnosis of COVID-19. This guideline clarifies the basic requirements for controlling infections during X-ray imaging diagnosis, the specific measures for staff protection, disinfection of personnel and places, and the protection and disinfection of subjects, which is instructive for field work. It is worth noting that while focusing on controlling infections, the principle of optimal protection for medical exposure cannot be ignored.

OBJECTIVE To perform variation and phylogenetics analysis on the SARS-CoV genome sequence (PUMC01) isolated in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHODS The cDNA library of SARS-CoV (PUMC01 isolate) was constructed by means of random-priming strategy. Random selected plasmid was sequenced and the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-PUMC01 was assembled by conventional methods (The Genebank Accession No. of SARS-CoV-PUMC01 is AY350750). The variation and phylogenetics analysis were performed by comparing the PUMC01 sequence with other SARS-CoV isolates. RESULTS Ten variation sites were found by comparing PUMC01 isolate with Tor2 and Urbani isolates. In phylogenetic analysis of 18 SARS-CoV isolates, two classes were observed and there is different differential time between these two classes and the different isolates in each class. CONCLUSIONS The evidence of phylogenetic analysis of different SARS-CoV isolates from different region is instructive for understanding the clinical relations between the different isolates and the transmission chain of SARS-CoV.

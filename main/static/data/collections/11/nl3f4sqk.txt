Recently, several emerging papers have focused on the association of the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels with the risk of mortality in infected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the conclusions are inconsistent. In order to obtain a definitive conclusion on the association between the levels of CK-MB and the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients, a quantitative meta-analysis was conducted on the basis of published data. Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science and PubMed databases were extensively searched. Five studies performed in China were finally included in this meta-analysis. The overall results showed that higher levels of CK-MB were significantly associated with an increased risk of the mortality in COVID-19 infected patients (SMD 0.99; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.42; P < 0.001). In conclusion, the elevated CK-MB levels were a crucial characteristic of the mortality of COVID-19 patients.

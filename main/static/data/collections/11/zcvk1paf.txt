CORTISOL secretion by the cortex of e adrenal glands (Fig. 32.1) increases in response to any stress in the body, whether physical (such as illness, trauma, surgery or temperature extremes) or psychological. However, this hormone is more than a simple marker of stress levelsâ€”it is necessary for the correct functioning of almost every part of the body. Excesses or deficiencies of this crucial hormone also lead to various physical symptoms and disease states [1]. Although cortisol is not essential for life per se, it helps an organism to cope more efficiently with its environment with particular metabolic actions on glucose production and protein and fat catabolism. Nevertheless, loss or profound diminishment of cortisol secretion leads to a state of abnormal metabolism and an inability to deal with stressors, which, if untreated, may be fatal [1, 2].

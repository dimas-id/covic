Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is typically used for treating intraluminal rectal tumors. Other applications have recently been described. We here present the use of TAMIS as a tool to treat a chronic anastomotic fistula after restorative rectal resection. A new insufflation device expected to solve the problem of maintaining a stable pneumorectum is described.

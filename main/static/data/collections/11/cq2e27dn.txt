We report a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by fatal co-infection with a multi-triazole resistant Aspergillus fumigatus and highlight the importance of recognising the significance of Aspergillus sp. isolation from respiratory samples. Early diagnosis and detection of triazole resistance are essential for appropriate antifungal therapy to improve outcome in patients with coronavirus associated invasive aspergillosis.

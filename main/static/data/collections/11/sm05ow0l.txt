(SJL/J × PL/J)F(1) mice immunized with myelin basic protein (MBP) develop an autoimmune demyelinating disease termed relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (rEAE). The acute stage of disease is mediated by CD4(+) T cells specific for MBP amino acids 1–9. To determine the immunologic bases for disease relapse, host sensitization to additional autoantigens of the central nervous system was measured. Results indicate that most animals develop T cell reactivity to endogenous myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) during rEAE. However, PLP-specific immunity does not appear to accound for expression of relapse episodes of demyelination. relapse episodes of demyelination.

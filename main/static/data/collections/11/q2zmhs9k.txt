Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a causative agent of pig diarrhea, requires a protease(s) for multicycle replication in cultured cells. However, the potential role of proteases in the infection process remains unclear. In order to explore this, we used two different approaches: we infected either Vero cells in the presence of trypsin or Vero cells that constitutively express the membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 (Vero/TMPRSS2 cells). We found that PEDV infection was enhanced, and viruses were efficiently released into the culture fluid, from Vero cells infected in the presence of protease, while in cells without protease, the virus grew, but its release into the culture fluid was strongly hampered. Cell-to-cell fusion of PEDV-infected cells and cleavage of the spike (S) protein were observed in cells with protease. When infected Vero cells were cultured for 3 days in the absence of trypsin but were then treated transiently with trypsin, infectious viruses were immediately released from infected cells. In addition, treatment of infected Vero/TMPRSS2 cells with the protease inhibitor leupeptin strongly blocked the release of virus into the culture fluid. Under electron microscopy, PEDV-infected Vero cells, as well as PEDV-infected Vero/TMPRSS2 cells treated with leupeptin, retained huge clusters of virions on their surfaces, while such clusters were rarely seen in the presence of trypsin and the absence of leupeptin in Vero and Vero/TMPRSS2 cells, respectively. Thus, the present study indicates that proteases play an important role in the release of PEDV virions clustered on cells after replication occurs. This unique observation in coronavirus infection suggests that the actions of proteases are reminiscent of that of the influenza virus neuraminidase protein.

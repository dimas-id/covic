Abstract In February, a new avian H5N1/03 virus took two persons' lives in Hong Kong. After this incidence, a newly emerged disease has been identified, associated with pneumonia in infected patients. Here we report that a newly discovered coronoavirus (Cov) is responsible for this disease. In addition, the basic features, diagnosis and possible animal sources of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cov are also discussed.

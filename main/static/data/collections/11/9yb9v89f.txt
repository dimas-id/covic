Membrane peptidases are a multi-functional group of ectoenzymes that have been implicated in the control of growth and differentiation of many cellular systems. Here, using aminopeptidase N/CD13 as an example, Dagmar Riemann and colleagues discuss the role of cell–cell contact in peptidase regulation and the influence of peptidases on cellular functions.

Systematic measurements of the magnetic moment in dependence on temperature and magnetic field of hexagonal 6H-BaTiO3+ 0.04 BaO + x/2 Fe2O3(0.005 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.05) ceramics were performed to study the influence of Fe ions on the magnetic properties. While the samples show Curie-Weiss paramagnetism for Fe concentrations &#8804; 1.0 mol%, antiferromagnetic interactions become manifest for 2.0 and 5.0 mol% iron. With increasing Fe content the antiferromagnetic interaction, which is assumed to be caused by a superexchange mechanism Fe3+Ti(1)- O2-O(2)- Fe3+Ti(2), becomes stronger. At external magnetic fields smaller than 1 T a further, ferromagnetic interaction between Fe3+ions is detected below 200 K. The interactions between Fe3+ions in the samples with 2.0 and 5.0 mol% iron are also manifest in the EPR spectra by numerous lines with low intensity. Q-band EPR investigations of 5.0 mol% Fe doped single crystals confirm the existence of only one type of Fe3+- VOassociates in the samples.

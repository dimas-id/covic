Coronavirus disease 2019 commonly designated as COVID-19 has been declared by World health Organisation (WHO) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. ‘Lock down’ is found to be the only effective method to control this outbreak and due to the contagious nature of this disease most of the hospitals have stopped elective interventions. Cancer is a second leading cause of death globally and the bystander victims in this scenario are the patients with suspected and proven cancer. Head and neck cancer has a survival rate of 40% to 50% after definitive therapy and the delay in treatment for even 1-2 months may lead to inoperability and poorer outcomes. On contacting the colleagues in different countries, it was found that different strategies have been adapted to prioritize cancer patients. Hence, such type of measures appropriately amended can be implemented as soon as possible to avoid harm to cancer patients.

Abstract This chapter describes the potential public health impact of emerging and reemerging disease. Factors contributing to the emergence of diseases include increasing international travel and commerce, changes in human demographics and behavior, advances in technology and industry, microbial adaptation and the breakdown of public health systems. Of emerging diseases, 60% are zoonotic, making the human–animal biome interaction critical. Preparedness for an emerging disease relies on strong biosurveillance systems for early detection. Control measures to prevent transmission must be implemented early. These include: rapid epidemiologic surveillance and investigations to characterize the disease; transmission prevention through containment and control measures; development and deployment of medical countermeasures; and emergency public information and warning. Recovery after the outbreak of an emerging disease can result in a “new normal” with persistent endemic infection in the community.

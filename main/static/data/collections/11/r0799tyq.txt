Neurotropic strains of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) cause a range of diseases in infected mice ranging from mild encephalitis with clearance of the virus followed by demyelination to rapidly fatal encephalitis. This chapter discusses the structure, life cycle, transmission, and pathology of neurotropic coronaviruses, as well as the immune response to coronavirus infection. Mice infected with neurotropic strains of MHV have provided useful systems in which to study processes of virus- and immune-mediated demyelination and virus clearance and/or persistence in the CNS, and the mechanisms of virus evasion of the immune system.

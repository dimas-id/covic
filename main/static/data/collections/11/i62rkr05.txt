Background Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is prevalent around the world. We aimed to describe epidemiological features and clinical course in a large urban center to inform prevention and treatment of imported epidemics. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data collected at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, between January 20 and February 29, 2020. Results Among 325 cases admitted, median age was 51 years and 47.4% (154/325) had visited Wuhan within 2 weeks of illness onset. Most cases (57.2%) occurred in 67 clusters; 40% were situated within 53 family clusters. 83.7% developed fever during the disease course. Median times from onset to negative detection of nucleic acid by nasopharyngeal swab, first medical care and hospitalization were 8, 1 and 4 days. Longer duration of viral shedding in blood and feces was detected among patients with mild disease using glucocorticoid. Comorbidities were present in 28.9% of cases. At admission, 69.8% presented with lymphopenia and 38.8% had elevated D-dimers. Pneumonia was identified in 97.5% (314/322) of cases by chest CT scan; 42.9% had bilateral lung involvement. Severe-critical patients were 8% with a median time from onset to critical disease of 10.5 days. Half required oxygen therapy and 7.1% high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO); median time from onset to oxygen therapy and HFNO was 7 and 9 days. The case fatality rate was 0.92% with median time from onset to death of 16 days. Conclusion COVID-19 cases in Shanghai were imported, presenting as viral pneumonia with half of cases needing oxygen therapy. Rapid identification, and effective control measures helped to contain the outbreak and prevent community transmission.

OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of the COVID-19 is a severe global crisis and resulted in public health problems in many aspects. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged ≥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5(th) to 14(th) March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Totally, near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3 ± 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0 ± 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6 ± 1.2h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years old, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study can be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during such public health emergency.

There has been an impressive development of nursing knowledge around the ethics, principles, frameworks, models and practices of person-centred care over the last 15 years, with colleagues from the Nordic countries making significant contributions to global knowledge across the discipline of nursing and beyond. A disciplinary challenge remains to map the variability in person-centred care with an aim to empirically clarify the invariant in person-centred care. Based on current research and practice, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, this article argues that the relational aspect of person-centred care is such an invariant, building on the socially constructive notion of ‘personhood’ being a standing or status that is bestowed on one human being by another in the context of relationship and social being. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several of the key determinants of person-centred care are under threat due to health service responses and/or infection control measures, such as keeping older adults safe, imposing relationship restrictions, social distancing and isolation (or the lack thereof). Clinical examples from an Australian health service are used to show how recognizing the relational invariant of person-centred aged care facilitated supporting lives lived whilst also protecting lives saved. The relational invariant to person-centred care is who we are, constructed or deconstructed by and with others; something that may have become more visible through the relational restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. Protecting relationality in life and care and advocating for both safe and person-centred care for those who need it most is now more important than ever.

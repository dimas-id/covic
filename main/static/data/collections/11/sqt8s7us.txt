Purpose The Medina Embolic Device (MED) is a new intrasaccular device with promising early results. Previously we documented our initial experience of this device both alone and in combination with other devices including flow diverter stents (FDS). We sought to determine the effect of the MED + FDS strategy for the treatment of selected aneurysms. Materials and Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data to identify all patients with aneurysms treated using both the MED and intraluminal FDS. We present our technical success rate, early and mid-term angiographic follow-up, and clinical outcome data. Results We identified 25 non-consecutive patients. The treatment was staged in 9 patients and in a single session 16 patients. The average age was 61±12.8 years (range 40-82). The average fundus height was 11±3.6 mm and average fundus width was 10.1±3.4 mm. In the staged cohort (n=9) at delayed angiography (mean 10 mths) 8 aneurysms (89%) showed complete exclusion (mRRC 1) and in one patient there was a parent vessel occlusion. In the simultaneous cohort delayed angiography (n=10, mean 8.1 months) demonstrated complete occlusion (mRRC 1) in 6 aneurysms (60%), 3 neck remnants (mRRC 2) (30%) and 1 patient (10%) showed persistent aneurysmal filling (mRRC 3a). There were 5 complications with permanent morbidity (mRS >2) in two patients. There were no mortalities. Conclusion The MED can be successfully used in combination with intraluminal FDS and in selected aneurysms this may represent an alternative to FDS and adjunctive coiling.

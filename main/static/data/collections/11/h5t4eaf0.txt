PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pediatric acute liver failure is a rare, complex, rapidly progressing, and life-threatening illness. Majority of pediatric acute liver failures have unknown etiology. This review intends to discuss the current literature on the challenging aspects of management of acute liver failure. RECENT FINDINGS: Collaborative multidisciplinary approach for management of patients with pediatric acute liver failure with upfront involvement of transplant hepatologist and critical care specialists can improve outcomes of this fatal disease. Extensive but systematic diagnostic evaluation can help to identify etiology and guide management. Early referral to a transplant center with prompt liver transplant, if indicated, can lead to improved survival in these patients. SUMMARY: Prompt identification and aggressive management of pediatric acute liver failure and related comorbidities can lead to increased transplant-free survival and improved post-transplant outcomes, thus decreasing mortality and morbidity associated with this potential fatal condition.

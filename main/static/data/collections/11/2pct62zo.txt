Abstract Viral infections are a common cause of critical illness, particularly of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems. Most are managed by supportive care alone. Early identification is critical to proper care to facilitate antimicrobial de-escalation. A small subset of viruses has directed treatment, and critical care providers should be knowledgeable about the diagnosis and treatment of influenza, herpes simplex meningoencephalitis, and viral hepatitis. Antivirals can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with each of these illnesses.

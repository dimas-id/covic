BACKGROUND Minimally invasive surgery for select gastrointestinal disease has gained worldwide acceptance. However, laparoscopic total gastrectomy for cancer remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine an initial experience with laparoscopic total gastrectomy. METHODS Medical records of 16 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy between September 2007 and December 2009 were reviewed in a retrospective manner. Esophagojejunostomy was completed using a transorally delivered anvil, with double-stapled esophageal anastomosis. RESULTS There were no conversions to open procedures. Two patients (12.5%) required extended resections with en bloc distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, one of whom also underwent transverse colectomy. The median lymph node count for patients who underwent D2 lymphadenectomy (n = 12) for gastric adenocarcinoma was 31. There were no perioperative deaths and the median length of stay was 8 days. There were no anastomotic leaks, but three patients developed anastomotic strictures amenable to dilatation. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive total gastrectomy can be performed safely and with adequate lymphadenectomy. The procedure provides an excellent short-term outcome with potential for improved patient outcome.

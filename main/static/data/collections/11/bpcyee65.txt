Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people. The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.

We analysed SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in 42 social and working contacts of a super-spreader from the Heinsberg area in Germany. Consistent with a high-prevalence setting 26 individuals had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies determined by in-house neutralisation testing. These results were compared with four commercial assays, suggesting limited sensitivity of the assays in such a high-prevalence setting. Although SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid restricted tests showed a better sensitivity, spike based assays had a stronger correlation with neutralisation capacity.

BACKGROUND BK virus nephropathy is one of the most common viral infections that affect up to 10% of renal transplant recipients (RTRs), causing allograft dysfunction and graft loss. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) gene polymorphisms have been associated with parvovirus B19, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1/AIDS infection, cytomegalovirus viremia, and disease. IFN-γ is known to have potent inhibitory effects on BK virus gene expression, both at the level of transcription and translation. METHODS It was investigated whether IFN-γ polymorphisms are associated with BKV infection. Genotyping of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the IFN-γ gene were performed on DNA collected from a total of 251 RTRs (71 RTRs with BKV infection and 180 without BKV infection). RESULTS Analysis of the results showed that IFN-γ (rs12369470) CC genotype was significantly associated with susceptibility to BKV infection (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.29-6.44, P=0.007) while the IFN-γ +874 (rs2435061) TT and (rs2406918) CC genotypes appear to be markers for protection against BKV infection (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.1-0.83, P=0.01 for rs245061; OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.4-0.94, P=0.02 for rs24069718). A haplotype analysis using the combination of rs2435061-rs2406918-rs2870953 showed that the A-G-T haplotype was associated with a significantly reduced risk for BKV infection (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25-0.73, P=0.001). CONCLUSION Polymorphisms in the IFN-γ gene may confer certain protection or predisposition for BKV infection.

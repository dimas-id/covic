Abstract A series of 4-aminoquinoline derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of 4-chloro-7-substituted-quinolines with the corresponding mono/dialkyl amines. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by NMR and FAB-MS spectral and elemental analyses. Subsequently, the compounds were examined for their cytotoxic effects on two different human breast tumor cell lines: MCF7 and MDA-MB468. Although all compounds examined were quite effective on both cell lines, the compound Nâ€²-(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine emerged as the most active compound of the series. It was particularly potent against MDA-MB 468 cells when compared to chloroquine and amodiaquine. The compound butyl-(7-fluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-amine showed more potent effects on MCF-7 cells when compared to chloroquine. Therefore, 4-aminoquinoline can serve as the prototype molecule for further development of a new class of anticancer agents.

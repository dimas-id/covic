Abstract An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa), using as antigen canine coronavirus-infected CrFK cell supernatant, was developed to detect antibodies against canine coronavirus (CCoV). Out of a total of 109 dog serum samples, 80 which were positive by routine virus neutralisation test were also Elisa positive. Seventeen samples which were negative by the virus neutralisation test, were positive by Elisa and by the confirmatory Western blotting test. The Elisa was substantially more sensitive than the virus neutralisation test in detecting antibodies to CCoV and may be used as an alternative technique to virus neutralisation.

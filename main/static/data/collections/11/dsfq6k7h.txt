Our objective was to describe respiratory disease hospitalizations among children in a community of Seoul, Republic of Korea. Discharge data (January 1995-December 2005) from Guro Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea) were collected from the hospital medical records office. Respiratory virus test results (March 2004-December 2005) and hospitalization charges to the National Health Insurance Corporation (January 2002-December 2005) were provided by hospital laboratory and administrative departments. Variations in hospitalizations, test results and total hospitalization-associated medical charges were described by age, clinical complaint, discharge month and length of stay. Over the 11-y period, 4247 paediatric hospitalizations for lower respiratory disease occurred. Semi-annual epidemics were identified in October-December and April-May. Among a subset (n=400) of patients, 48% had respiratory syncytial virus, 16% parainfluenza virus, 19% influenza viruses and 17% adenovirus infection. On admission, children had respiratory problems (53%), fever (39%), or other systemic problems (8%). The median charge of a lower respiratory disease hospitalization was highest in January ($1334) and lowest in October ($1076). Median hospitalization charges were highest among children 8-15 years of age compared with younger children </=2 years and those 3-7 years of age. Respiratory disease hospitalizations among children demonstrated annual variations reflecting patterns of children with laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections. In the Republic of Korea, prospective studies that use standardized laboratory testing for respiratory pathogens in children will help to estimate the total burden of viral lower respiratory tract disease.

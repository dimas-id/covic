In the vestibular peripheral organs, type I and type II hair cells (HCs) transmit incoming signals via glutamatergic quantal transmission onto afferent nerve fibers. Additionally, type I HCs transmit via 'non-quantal' transmission to calyx afferent fibers, by accumulation of glutamate and potassium in the synaptic cleft. Vestibular efferent inputs originating in the brainstem contact type II HCs and vestibular afferents. Here, synaptic inputs to type II HCs were characterized by using electrical and optogenetic stimulation of efferent fibers combined with in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recording from type II HCs in the rodent vestibular crista. Properties of efferent synaptic currents in type II HCs were similar to those found in cochlear HCs and mediated by activation of &#945;9-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. While efferents showed a low probability of release at low frequencies of stimulation, repetitive stimulation resulted in facilitation and increased probability of release. Notably, the membrane potential of type II HCs during optogenetic stimulation of efferents showed a strong hyperpolarization in response to single pulses and was further enhanced by repetitive stimulation. Such efferent-mediated inhibition of type II HCs can provide a mechanism to adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs to vestibular nerve fibers, with a shift of the response to be more like that of calyx-only afferents with faster non-quantal responses.

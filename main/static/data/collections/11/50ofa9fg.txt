BACKGROUND Whether total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP) is associated with worse outcomes compared to transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP) for the treatment of recurrent inguinal hernia continues to be a matter of debate. The objective of this large cohort study is to compare complications, conversion rates and postoperative length of hospital stay between patients undergoing TEP or TAPP for unilateral recurrent inguinal hernia repair. METHOD Based on prospective data of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery, all patients who underwent elective TEP or TAPP for unilateral recurrent inguinal hernia between 1995 and 2006 were included. The following outcomes were compared: conversion rates, intraoperative complications, surgical postoperative complications and duration of operation. RESULTS Data on 1309 patients undergoing TEP (n = 1022) and TAPP (n = 287) for recurrent inguinal hernia were prospectively collected. Average age, BMI and ASA score were similar in both groups. Patients undergoing TEP had a significantly increased rate of intraoperative complications (TEP 6.3 % vs. TAPP 2.8 %, p = 0.0225). Duration of operation was longer for patients undergoing TEP (TEP 80.3 vs. TAPP 73.0 min, p < 0.0023) while postoperative length of hospital stay was longer for patients undergoing TAPP (TEP 2.6 vs. TAPP 3.1 day, p = 0.0145). Surgical postoperative complications (TEP 3.52 % vs. TAPP 2.09 %, p = 0.2239), general postoperative complications (TEP 1.47 % vs. TAPP 0.7 %, p = 0.3081) and conversion rates (TEP 2.15 % vs. TAPP 1.39 %, p = 0.4155) were not significantly different. CONCLUSION This study is the first population-based analysis comparing outcomes of patients with recurrent inguinal hernia undergoing TEP versus TAPP in a prospective cohort of over 1300 patients. Intraoperative complications were significantly higher in patients undergoing TEP. The TEP technique was associated with longer operating times, but a shorter postoperative length of hospital stay. Nonetheless, the absolute outcome differences are small and thus, on a population-based level, both techniques appear to be safe and effective for patients undergoing endoscopic repair for unilateral recurrent inguinal hernia.

Marine-derived bacteria are a prolific source of a wide range of structurally diverse natural products. This review, dedicated to Professor William Fenical, begins by showcasing many seminal discoveries made at the University of California San Diego from marine-derived actinomycetes. Discussed early on is the 20-year journey of discovery and advancement of the seminal actinomycetes natural product salinosporamide A into Phase III anticancer clinical trials. There are many fascinating parallels discussed that were gleaned from the comparative literature of marine sponge, tunicate, and bacteria-derived natural products. Identifying bacterial biosynthetic machinery housed in sponge and tunicate holobionts through both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches is another important and expanding subject that is analyzed. Work reviewed herein also evaluates the hypotheses that many marine invertebrate-derived natural products are biosynthesised by associated or symbiotic bacteria. The insights and outcomes from metagenomic sequencing and synthetic biology to expand molecule discovery continue to provide exciting outcomes and they are predicted to be the source of the next generation of novel marine natural product chemical scaffolds.

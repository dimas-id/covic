Mycorrhizal fungi are critical components of terrestrial habitats and agroecosystems. Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte (MucFRE) fungi were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with the rare plant Lycopodiella inundata (‘marsh clubmoss’), one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1,297 individual L. inundata roots collected during spring and autumn 2019 from 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of MucFRE-like hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. MucFRE-like hyphae were the dominant mycorrhizal fungi observed in all of the examined heathlands. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonised in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, and correlated with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about mycorrhizal status - typically drawn from single time point collections - should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are directly relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation nutrient enhancement treatments, microbial diversity and functional studies of host plants and symbionts.

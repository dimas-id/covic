Background: Ambient PM1(particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤1 μm) is an important contribution of PM2.5mass. However, little is known worldwide regarding the PM1-associated health effects due to a wide lack of ground-based PM1measurements from air monitoring stations. Methods: We collected daily records of hospital admission for respiratory diseases and station-based measurements of air pollution and weather conditions in Shenzhen, China, 2015–2016. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposures to PM1and PM2.5. Results: PM1and PM2.5showed significant adverse effects on respiratory disease hospitalizations, while no evident associations with PM1–2.5were identified. Admission risks for total respiratory diseases were 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.14) and 1.06 (1.02 to 1.10), corresponding to per 10 μg/m3rise in exposure to PM1and PM2.5at lag 0–2 days, respectively. Both PM1and PM2.5were strongly associated with increased admission for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, but exhibited no effects on asthma and upper respiratory tract infection. Largely comparable risk estimates were observed between male and female patients. Groups aged 0–14 years and 45–74 years were significantly affected by PM1- and PM2.5-associated risks. PM-hospitalization associations exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with significantly larger risks in cold season than those in warm season among some subgroups. Conclusions: Our study suggested that PM1rather than PM1–2.5contributed to PM2.5-induced risks of hospitalization for respiratory diseases and effects of PM1and PM2.5mainly occurred in cold season.

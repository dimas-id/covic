Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by local inflammation and an intense systemic inflammatory reaction. Glucocorticoid administration has been suggested due to their anti-inflammatory properties. However, results from the initial studies of glucocorticoids in ARDS, which evaluated high-dose and short-term treatments, were negative. More recent studies have evaluated the effect of lower doses of glucocorticoids administered over longer periods, but the results thus far have been inconclusive.

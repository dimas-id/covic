Abstract We introduce a new approach to investigate the dual nucleotides compositions of 11 Gram-positive and 12 Gram-negative eubacteria recently studied by Sorimachi and Okayasu. The approach firstly obtains a 16-dimension vector set of dual nucleotides by PN-curve from the complete genome of organism. Each vector of the set corresponds to a single gene of genome. Then we reduce the 16-dimension vector set to 2-dimension by principal components analysis (PCA). The reduction avoids possible loss of information averaging all 16-dimension vectors. Then we suggest a 2D graphical representation based on the 2-dimension vector to investigate the classification patters among different organisms.

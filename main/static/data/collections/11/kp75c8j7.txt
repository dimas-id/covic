The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should immediately update current policies to include reimbursement for Medicare patients receiving intravenous antibiotics at home. The majority of these patients are over the age of 65 and at increased risk for severe illness due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Requiring them to travel to an infusion center, stay in a skilled nursing facility or remain in the hospital longer than necessary to receive treatment results in avoidable risk of exposure amidst a pandemic. Current policy has significant implications for increased cost and harm to both these patients and the US healthcare system.

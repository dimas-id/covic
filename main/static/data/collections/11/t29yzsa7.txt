OBJECTIVES Segmentectomy is the treatment of choice for small-sized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, it is difficult to decide the surgical procedure because accurate evaluation of hilar lymph node metastasis remains unclear. We here report the outcome of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) segmentectomy with and without the assessment of sentinel nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-three patients with stage IA NSCLC underwent VATS segmentectomy between January 2003 and December 2010. Twenty patients underwent indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and 63 did not. Intraoperative real-time quantitative RT-PCR to determine the expression of CK-19 was used for evaluation of metastasis. Perioperative outcome, local recurrence rates and survival were compared in both groups. RESULTS Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with segmentectomy in the SNB group. The false negative rate was 0%. By RT-PCR for CK-19 expression, only one of these patients showed positive sentinel nodes, which indicated isolated tumor cells; however, segmentectomy was not converted to lobectomy. Seven of 63 patients with VATS segementectomy without SNB and none of the SNB group relapsed. In the relapsed patients without SNB, 4 (6.3%) were local recurrences and 3 (4.7%) were distant metastases. Recurrence-free survival rates in both groups were not significantly different because of the short follow-up period of the SNB group. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that VATS segmentectomy with SNB was useful for deciding intraoperatively to perform segmentectomy with an accurate lymph node status.

In the last decade, percutaneous treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) tumors has become more established in routine clinical care while also undergoing a number of advancements. Ablative techniques to palliate painful skeletal metastases have gained wide acceptance, while goals for ablation have evolved to include local control of oligometastases and desmoid tumors. Bone consolidation or augmentation is now frequently used in conjunction with or instead of ablation of skeletal tumors to stabilize pathologic fractures or prevent further morbidity that could result from fractures caused by tumor progression. These procedures have traditionally been performed with cement injection, although additional percutaneous consolidation or stabilization devices have been developed. Techniques to monitor the ablation zone and adjacent structures intraprocedurally are now applied to increase the number of tumors amenable to treatment. These include methods to depict, displace, or monitor critical structures adjacent to targeted MSK tumors. Finally, the role of ablation in the comprehensive care of patients with MSK tumors continues to change with the evolving triage of patients between radiation therapy, surgical resection and stabilization, and percutaneous ablative and consolidative management.

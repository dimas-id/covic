In recent years, microarray analysis has become a key experimental tool, enabling the analysis of genome‐wide patterns of gene expression. This review approaches the microarray revolution with a focus upon four topics: 1) the early development of this technology and its application to cancer diagnostics; 2) a primer of microarray research, designed to guide the beginner; 3) a highlight of the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT), a worldwide consortium of faculty who are integrating microarrays into the undergraduate teaching laboratory; and 4) the use of microarrays in the biotechnology industry with a look forward to future applications. A central theme within this review is the profound relevance of new, bioinformatics‐based, technologies to undergraduate students within the biosciences.

SUMMARY: Negative staining electron microscopy was used to identify viruses in 166 normal and 62 diarrhoeal faecal samples from 208 cats admitted to an animal shelter during a 16‐month period (March 1984 to June 1985). On the basis of size and shape 7 distinct viral types were detected: 24 nm parvovirus‐like particles, 30 nm astrovirus, 30 nm picornavirus‐like particles, reovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus and a 75 nm “togavirus‐like” particle. The incidence of these particles in the 208 cats was 11%, 7%, 6%, 0.4%, 5%, 1% and 1% respectively. Virus isolation studies using 40 of the faecal samples succeeded in isolating reovirus 1 in 2 cases. Immune electron microscope studies demonstrated the presence of antibody in a human serum to cat astrovirus, but failed to clarify the identity of the parvovirus‐like particles and picornavirus‐like particles, other than showing that some of the parvovirus‐like particles were not related to feline panleukopenia virus. It was found that parvovirus‐like particles, astrovirus, picornavirus‐like particles, reovirus and rotavirus could be excreted by cats with normal faeces as well as cats with diarrhoeal faeces. Parvovirus‐like particles, astrovirus, picornavirus‐like particles and rotavirus could be excreted in high concentration in normal faeces. There was no simple relationship between age and diarrhoea in the population of cats studied. Age was not a critical factor in the excretion of parvovirus‐like particles, astrovirus, picornavirus‐like particles and rotavirus. The incidence of diarrhoea was not clearly associated with the seasons.

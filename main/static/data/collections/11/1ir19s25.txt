Novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is emerging as a pandemic situation and declared as a global health emergency by WHO. Due to lack of specific medicine and vaccine, viral infection has gained a frightening rate and created a devastating state across the globe. Here the authors have attempted to design epitope based potential peptide as a vaccine candidate using immunoinformatics approach. As of evidence from literatures, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a key protein to initiate the viral infection within a host cell thus used here as a reasonable vaccine target. We have predicted a 9-mer peptide as representative of both B-cell and T-cell epitopic region along with suitable properties such as antigenic and non-allergenic. To its support, strong molecular interaction of the predicted peptide was also observed with MHC molecules and Toll Like receptors. The present study may helpful to step forward in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19.

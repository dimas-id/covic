BACKGROUND: In human medicine, extremely high CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations > 100 mg/l are indicators of bacterial infection and the need of antibiotic treatment. Similar decision limits for septic pneumonia are recommended for dogs but have not yet been evaluated for other organ systems. The aim of the retrospective study was to investigate the prevalence and evaluate dogs with CRP concentrations > 100 mg/l regarding the underlying etiology, the affected organ system and the prognostic significance. RESULTS: Prevalence of CRP > 100 mg/l was investigated in dogs presented between 2014 and 2015 and was 12%. For evaluation of etiology and organ systems, dogs with CRP > 100 mg/l presented between 2014 and 2016 were enrolled. Dogs were classified into 4 main disease categories, i.e. inflammatory, neoplastic, tissue damage or “diverse”. Diseases were assigned to the affected organ system. If an organ classification was not possible, dogs were classified as “multiple”. 147 dogs with CRP 101–368 mg/l were included and classified into disease categories: 86/147 (59%) with inflammatory etiology (among these, 23/86 non-infectious, 44/86 infectious (33/44 bacterial), 19/86 inflammation non-classifiable), 31/147 (21%) tissue damage, 17/147 (12%) neoplastic (all malignant) and 13/147 (9%) diverse diseases. The affected organ systems included 57/147 (39%) multiple, 30/147 (20%) trauma, 21/147 (14%) gastrointestinal tract, 10/147 (7%) musculoskeletal system, 8/147 (5%) respiratory tract, 7/147 (5%) urinary/reproductive tract, 6/147 (4%) skin/subcutis/ear, 6/147 (4%) central/peripheral nervous system and 2/147 (1%) heart. The disease group (p = 0.081) or organ system (p = 0.17) did not have an impact on CRP. Based on CRP, a detection of bacterial infection was not possible. The prognostic significance was investigated by determining the 3-months survival and hospitalization rate in a subgroup with known outcome. The 3-months survival rate was 46/73 (63%) while the majority 66/73 (90%) of patients was hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: CRP concentrations > 100 mg/l are occasionally seen in a clinic population. They indicate a severe systemic disease of various etiologies with guarded prognosis. Extremely high CRP concentrations do not allow a conclusion of the underlying etiology or an identification of bacterial inflammation.

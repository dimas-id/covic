Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most common symptoms reported by covid-19 patients in the Arabic language and order the symptoms appearance based on the collected data. Methods: We search the Arabic content of Twitter for personal reports of covid-19 symptoms from March 1st to May 27th, 2020. We identify 463 Arabic users who tweeted testing positive for covid-19 and extract the symptoms they publicly associate with covid-19. Furthermore, we ask them directly through personal messages to opt in and rank the appearance of the first three symptoms they experienced right before (or after) diagnosed with covid-19. Finally, we track their Twitter timeline to identify additional symptoms that were mentioned within +-5 days from the day of tweeting having covid-19. In summary, a list of 270 covid-19 reports were collected and symptoms were (at least partially) ranked from early to late. Results: The collected reports contained roughly 900 symptoms originated from 74% (n=201) male and 26% (n=69) female Twitter users. The majority (82%) of the tracked users were living in Saudi Arabia (46%) and Kuwait (36%). Furthermore, 13% (n=36) of the collected reports were asymptomatic. Out of the users with symptoms (n=234), 66% (n=180) provided a chronological order of appearance for at least three symptoms. Fever 59% (n=139), Headache 43% (n=101), and Anosmia 39% (n=91) were found to be the top three symptoms mentioned by the reports. They count also for the top-3 common first symptoms in a way that 28% (n=65) said their covid journey started with a Fever, 15% (n=34) with a Headache and 12% (n=28) with Anosmia. Out of the Saudi symptomatic reported cases (n=110), the most common three symptoms were Fever 59% (n=65), Anosmia 42% (n=46), and Headache 38% (n=42).

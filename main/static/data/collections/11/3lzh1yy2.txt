Abstract Background The human WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) has been recently described as a novel virus in respiratory tract samples. Objective To investigate the viral load of WUPyV in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), stool, and serum samples of pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract diseases. Study design We established a real-time PCR for WUPyV DNA and tested NPA obtained between 2002 and 2007 from pediatric in-patients with acute respiratory tract diseases. In addition, 14 stool and 14 serum samples of children with WUPyV DNA positive NPA were analysed. Results WUPyV DNA was found in 5.2% of 1232 NPA. The median viral load in the NPA was 950copies/ml (maximum 3.4E10copies/ml). The WUPyV load in NPA was neither associated with the coinfection status nor with the clinical diagnoses. WUPyV DNA was found in 3 of 14 serum samples and in 2 of 14 stool samples. The WUPyV load in NPA tended to be higher in viremic children. Conclusion WUPyV DNA was found in NPA, serum, and stool of hospitalised children with acute respiratory tract diseases. Further studies are necessary to determine whether WUPyV is a human pathogen.

Infection of the lung parenchyma, or pneumonia, accounts for over four million deaths per year worldwide (Ferkol and Schraufnagel, Ann Am Thorac Soc 11:404–406, 2014). The condition is common, but also over-diagnosed, in part due to relatively poor laboratory and radiographic diagnostics. Indeed, we continue to rely on antiquated tools such as sputum culture and chest X-ray – the former of which lacks speed and sensitivity, and the latter specificity (Albaum et al. Chest 110:343–50, 1996). The resulting presumptive diagnoses of pneumonia lead to excessive use of empiric broad spectrum antibiotics; indeed, by some estimates, 30–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for lower respiratory tract infection are inappropriate (Kraus, PLoS One 12(3): e0174584, 2017). This approach begets microbial resistance, exposes patients to medication side effects, and puts patients at risk of potentially life-threatening complications including Clostridium difficile colitis. To improve diagnostic certainty in patients with suspected pneumonia, we must begin to consider and implement emerging technologies for efficient and accurate characterization of host responses to infection and identification of pathogens. In this chapter, we will discuss precision diagnostics already in common practice and those poised to be, and how these tools may ultimately enable personalization in the diagnosis of pneumonia.

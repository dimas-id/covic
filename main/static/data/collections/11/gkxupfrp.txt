Potentiation of hormone actions can occur by different mechanisms, including inhibition of degrading enzymes, interaction with the hormone receptor leading to stabilization of bioactive conformation or leading to receptor homo‐ and hetero‐oligomerization, receptor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation or can occur by directly influencing the signal transduction and ion channels. In this review the potentiation of bradykinin actions in different systems by certain compounds will be reviewed. Despite many long years of experimental research and investigation the mechanisms of potentiating action remain not fully understood. One of the most contradictory findings are the distinct differences between the inhibition of the angiotensin I‐converting enzyme and the potentiation of the bradykinin induced smooth muscle reaction. Contradictory findings and hypothesized mechanisms in the literature are discussed in this review and in some cases compared to own results. Investigation of potentiating actions was extended from hypotension, smooth muscle reaction and cellular actions to activation of immunocompetent cells. In our opinion the potentiation of bradykinin action can occur by different mechanisms, depending on the system and the applied potentiating factor used.

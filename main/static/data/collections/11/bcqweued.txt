PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has reached a pandemic status. Although SARSCoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated. We would suggest that health professionals investigate cardiac function as part of the routine care.

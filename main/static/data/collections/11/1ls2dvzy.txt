Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is associated with a wide range of systemic manifestations. Several observations support a role for vascular endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis including an increased incidence of thrombotic events and coagulopathy and the presence of vascular risk factors as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. It has recently been reported that endothelitis is associated with viral inclusion bodies suggesting a direct role for SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis. The ACE2 receptor has been shown to mediate SARS-CoV-2 uptake and it has been proposed that CD147 (BSG) can function as an alternative cell surface receptor. To define the endothelial cell populations that are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 as well as other genes implicated in the cellular entry of SARS-Cov-2 in the vascular endothelium through the analysis of single cell sequencing data derived from multiple human tissues (skin, liver, kidney, lung and intestine). We found that CD147 (BSG) but not ACE2 is detectable in vascular endothelial cells within single cell sequencing datasets derived from multiple tissues in healthy individuals. This implies that either ACE2 is not expressed in healthy tissue but is instead induced in response to SARS-Cov2 or that SARS-Cov2 enters endothelial cells via an alternative receptor such as CD147.

An effective host response against viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is the principal factor dictating the outcome of infection. It is the responsibility of the immune response to contain and control viral replication. Paradoxically, it is the immune response that may also contribute to the development of neuropathology. We have used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a positive-strand RNA virus, infection of the CNS to understand the dynamic interaction between viral replication, protection, and pathology with an emphasis on understanding how chemokines participate in these interrelated processes. Herein, we demonstrate the complexity of the chemokine response to MHV infection of the CNS and the delicate balance that exists between host defense and development of disease.

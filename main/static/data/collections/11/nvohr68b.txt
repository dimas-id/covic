With the current COVID-19 outbreak, it has become essential to develop efficient methods for the treatment and detection of this virus. Among the new approaches that could be tested, that relying on nanotechnology finds one of its main grounds in the similarity between nanoparticle (NP) and coronavirus (COV) sizes, which promotes NP-COV interactions. Since COVID-19 is very recent, most studies in this field have focused on other types of coronavirus than COVID-19, such as those involved in MERS or SARS diseases. Although their number is limited, they have led to promising results on various COV using a wide range of different types of nanosystems, e.g., nanoparticles, quantum dos, or nanoassemblies of polymers/proteins. Additional efforts deserve to be spent in this field to consolidate these findings. Here, I first summarize the different nanotechnology-based methods used for COV detection, i.e., optical, electrical, or PCR ones, whose sensitivity was improved by the presence of nanoparticles. Furthermore, I present vaccination methods, which comprise nanoparticles used either as adjuvants or as active principles. They often yield a better-controlled immune response, possibly due to an improved antigen presentation/processing than in non-nanoformulated vaccines. Certain antiviral approaches also took advantage of nanoparticle uses, leading to specific mechanisms such as the blocking of virus replication at the cellular level or the reduction of a COV induced apoptotic cellular death.

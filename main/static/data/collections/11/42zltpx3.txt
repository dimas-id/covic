Abstract Objective This study was designed to assess the impact of public health policy in Australia in response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the delivery of neurosurgical services. Being essential services, we postulated that there would not be a decrease in elective and emergency neurosurgical presentations and surgeries. Methods This is a prospective, observational, epidemiological study in strict adherence to the STROBE guidelines. It is a cross-sectional, multicentric study involving five tertiary neurosurgical centres to capture all public neurosurgical admissions in Queensland during the last three months (Feb-April, 2020) of significant public health policy changes to combat COVID-19. Results An analysis of the 1,298 admissions for the Queensland population of 5.07 million Australians demonstrated a decrease in the number of elective and emergency admissions. The decline in elective admissions, particularly degenerative spine, benign neoplasms and vascular pathologies, was a direct response of government strategy to curb activity to urgent surgical interventions only. Moreover, a trend towards decline in emergency admissions was also noted, partly explained by fewer trauma, but partly attributed to a decline in vascular pathologies including subarachnoid haemorrhage. Conclusions In comparison to Europe and North America, this study demonstrates the impact of proactive public health measures in Australia that successfully flattened the COVID-19 curve, whilst facilitating ongoing care of the acutely unwell neurosurgical patients.

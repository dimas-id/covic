The imperative of well-being and improved quality of life in smart cities context can only be attained if the smart services, so central to the concept of smart cities, correspond with the needs, expectations and skills of cities’ inhabitants. Considering that social media generate and/or open real-time entry points to vast amounts of data pertinent to well-being and quality of life, such as citizens’ expectations, opinions, as well as to recent developments related to regulatory frameworks, debates, political decisions and policymaking, the big question is how to exploit the potential inherent in social media and use it to enhance the value added smart cities generate. Social mining is traditionally understood as the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting actionable patterns and trends from raw social media data. In the context of smart cities, this special issue focuses on how social media data, also potentially combined with other data, can be used to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services, and thereby contribute more efficiently to citizens’ well-being and quality of life.

OBJECTIVE To describe the placement technique, complications, and outcomes associated with use of the PleuralPort device for management of pleural effusion in dogs and cats. STUDY DESIGN Case Series. ANIMALS Six dogs and 4 cats. METHODS Medical records of all animals with pleural effusion managed with the PleuralPort device were reviewed. Data regarding signalment, fluid analysis, placement technique, duration of function, duration of implantation, complications, and outcome were collected. Owners and referring veterinarians were contacted for follow-up information. RESULTS Nine animals had chylous effusion and 1 dog had pleural carcinomatosis. Eleven ports were placed with 1 cat receiving bilateral ports. Four animals developed complications. One cat developed pneumothorax immediately after implantation and was euthanatized. In 2 dogs and 1 cat, the ports obstructed. The 6 remaining animals had functioning ports at time of death or resolution of effusion and no longer required use of the port. No significant port migration, irritation, or infection of the device was reported. Excluding the cat with pneumothorax, median duration of port function was 20 days (range 1-391), and median duration of port implantation was 391 days (range 6-723). CONCLUSIONS The PleuralPort device is a feasible option for the management of pleural effusion in dogs and cats.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Acute aortic syndromes, which include aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating aortic ulcer, represent the most morbid presentations of aortic disease and can be difficult to diagnose. Recent advances in imaging have allowed for more rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes and the options for management are expanding. This case report and review presents the case of a 43-year-old man with acute type B aortic dissection who underwent two endovascular procedures for malperfusion syndrome. The review focuses on the presentation, diagnosis, medical management, and procedural options for acute dissection of the descending aorta.

This is an opinion piece on the role of POCUS in COVID‐19, with a focus on lung ultrasound. It is not an instructional essay. Crisis management in medicine has often been likened to crisis management in the aviation industry. The important difference between pilots and clinicians being that the clinician's life was not in imminent danger, should one fail. The clinician did not have the same emotional urgency as the pilot. The COVID‐19 pandemic has changed this, clinicians are now faced with the need to make urgent decisions whilst exposed to some personal risk. Whether to embrace POCUS and lung ultrasound during this pandemic is an important decision. Whilst there are clear advantages, poorly considered overzealous uptake it is not without hazard, opportunity cost and potential risk to patient and clinician.

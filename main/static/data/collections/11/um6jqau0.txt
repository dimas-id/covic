Since the discovery of the Coronavirus (nCOV-19), it has become a global pandemic. At the same time, it has been a great challenge to hospitals or healthcare staff to manage the flow of the high number of cases. Especially in remote areas, it is becoming more difficult to consult a medical specialist when the immediate hit of the epidemic has occurred. Thus, it becomes obvious that if effectively designed and deployed chatbot can help patients living in remote areas by promoting preventive measures, virus updates, and reducing psychological damage caused by isolation and fear. This study presents the design of a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot for the purpose of diagnostic evaluation and recommending immediate measures when patients are exposed to nCOV-19. In addition, presenting a virtual assistant can also measure the infection severity and connects with registered doctors when symptoms become serious.

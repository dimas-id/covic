Covid-19 pandemic has increased significantly to mortality in many countries with the number of infected cases increasing exponentially worldwide. One of the main determining factors of the poor prognosis in these patients is the development of coagulopathy. Moreover, it is well known that ART procedures confer a risk of thromboembolic complications. In this commentary we analize specific coexisting aspects between the thrombotic risk described during virus infection and that one reported in the context of assisted reproduction treatments. Based on known pathophysiological aspects of both virus infection and those identified during ovarian stimulation (OS), we found common elements that deserve to be taken into account. In the present context, any risk of hyperstimulation should be avoided. GnRh agonist triggering should be mandatory in high responders patients and/or with COVID infection. In both cases, the cycle should be segmented. We propose prophylactic with low molecular weigth heparin (LMWH) not only in those cases in which the oocyte recovery has been performed, but also in those in which the cancellation has been decided. In addition, the endometrial preparation to the frozen-thawed embryo transfers (FETs) should be using the transdermal route in order to minimize the higher thrombotic risk of the oral route.

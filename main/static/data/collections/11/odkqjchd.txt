There is a long history of the use of antibodies in the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases, because these molecules play a critical role in directing the effector mechanisms of the immune system against the pathogens they recognise. However, the widespread application of this therapy has been hampered by allergic reactions, production costs and the availability of alternative drugs such as antibiotics. Some of these obstacles can now be overcome with advances in biotechnology, which has enabled the development of antibody-based drugs for use first in treating cancer, and recently, for treating infectious diseases. The efficacy of such antibodies has been demonstrated in various in vitro studies, animal models and clinical trials for a variety of both viral and bacterial pathogens. Antibodies appear to hold great promise as a new class of drugs against infectious diseases.

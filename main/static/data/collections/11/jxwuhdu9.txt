BACKGROUND Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an important complication of stroke, but the evidence to support commonly used prophylactic strategies is conflicting. OBJECTIVES To describe the incidence, extent, associated clinical features and evolution of DVT after stroke. PATIENTS/METHODS The CLOTS trials 1 and 2 together randomized 5632 immobile stroke patients in 135 hospitals in nine countries. We screened patients for asymptomatic DVT with compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) at about 7-10 days and again at about 25-30 days after enrollment. RESULTS Six hundred and forty-one (11.4%) of 5632 patients had DVT detected on the first CDU scan at a median of 8 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7-10 days) after enrollment, and an additional 176 (3.1%) had a DVT on the second CDU scan at a median of 28 days (IQR 26-30 days). Of the 817 with DVTs, 289 (35%) were symptomatic and 39 (5%) had pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by imaging. Six hundred and seventy-six (83%) were unilateral, 141 (17%) were bilateral, 322 (39%) were limited to calf veins, 172 (21%) were popliteal, and 323 (40%) were femoral. Among the 542 patients with DVT and a weak leg, the DVT affected the weaker leg in 396 (73%), the stronger leg in 59 (11%), and was bilateral in 87 (16%). Among the 318 patients with a DVT detected on the first CDU scan who had a second scan, the DVT regressed in 148 (47%), stayed the same in 140 (44%), and progressed in only 30 (9%). CONCLUSIONS Although most DVTs develop within the first week, some develop later, and some early DVTs progress. Any prophylaxis needs to be started early but ideally continued for at least 4 weeks.

PURPOSE Quadrantectomy with multiple-incision laparoscopic axillary clearance for the treatment of early breast cancer is already well established. With the aim of reducing the axillary scar, we shared our 5 cases to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of quadrantectomy with laparoscopic axillary clearance through a single incision. PATIENTS AND METHODS From May 2010 to January 2013, single-incision quadrantectomy and laparoscopic axillary clearance were performed on 5 patients with early breast cancer by using conventional laparoscopic instruments. Surgical techniques and short-term outcomes were summarized and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS All the operations were successful with operative duration of 85-120 minutes, intraoperative blood loss of 20-50 mL, and hospital stay of 4-6 days. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded. The incision wound healed uneventfully, with no scar in the axillary fossa. CONCLUSIONS The combination of single-incision quadrantectomy and laparoscopic axillary clearance in the treatment of early breast cancer appears to be a technically safe and feasible alternative to the standard laparoscopic procedure and can be performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments.

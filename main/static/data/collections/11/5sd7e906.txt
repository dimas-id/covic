The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a major impact on birth care and lactation. The lack of knowledge regarding the transmission mechanisms and the potential risks for the mother and the newborn, even when the vertical transmission of the virus has not been demonstrated, has led to the abandonment of practices such as skin-to-skin and the early initiation of breastfeeding (BF), which offer great benefits for maternal and child health. Taking into account the available scientific evidence and the protective effect of BF, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other organisms recommend, in cases of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection of the mother, maintaining mother-child contact and BF, adopting preventive measure procedures to minimize the risk of contagion. These measures include hand hygiene, before and after contact with the newborn and the use of a mask. If a temporary separation of mother and child is required, it is recommended to feed the newborn with expressed breast milk. The presence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in the milk of infected women, so BF could reduce the clinical impact of the disease in the infant, if it becomes infected.

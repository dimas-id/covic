Introduction The pipeline embolization device (PED) is increasingly used in the endovascular management of cerebral aneurysms. Longitudinal data regarding safety and benefit of the PED in anterior communicating (ACOM) artery aneurysms are limited and particularly lacking in residual ACOM artery aneurysms. We report the use of the PED in 3 patients with ACOM artery aneurysms who were previously coiled. Methods Three patients with ACOM artery aneurysms, all previously treated with coiling and with recurrence of the aneurysm neck, were treated with the PED. All obtained follow-up diagnostic cerebral angiograms at either 3 or 6 months. Results Mean age of patients was 59 years. All patients received cerebral angiograms at a minimum of 3 months after treatment with the PED. Follow-up angiography was performed up to a mean of 10 months at which time point all cases demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion, without any stenosis in the parent artery. Conclusion The PED can be safely used for the treatment of ACOM artery aneurysms. Complete aneurysm obliteration can be achieved in cases refractory to endovascular coiling. These findings warrant replication in a larger data set.

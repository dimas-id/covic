AIMS: On the 10th of March, Greece imposed the closure of schools and universities and a full lockdown a few days later in order to counter the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Our aim was to monitor the effect of the coronavirus lockdown in diabetes management in children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) wearing insulin pump equipped with continuous glucose monitoring system. METHODS: In 34 children with T1DM on Medtronic 640G insulin pump equipped with the Enlite Sensor uploaded CareLink data were categorized in 2 three-week periods before and after the 10th of March. RESULTS: Mean time in range (TIR) did not significantly differ between the two periods. However, a significantly higher Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicating an increased glucose variability in the pre-lockdown period was observed (39.52% versus 37.40%, p=0.011). Blood glucose readings were significantly fewer during the lockdown period (7.91 versus 7.41, p=0.001). No significant difference was recorded regarding the total daily dose of insulin and the reported carbohydrates consumed. However, the meal schedule has changed dramatically as the percentage of breakfast consumed before 10.00 a.m. has fallen from 80.67 % to 41.46 % (p<0.001) during the lockdown. Correspondingly, the percentage of dinner consumption before 10.00 p.m. significantly fell during the lockdown period (60.22 % versus 53.78 %, p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control during the coronavirus lockdown can be adequately achieved and be comparable to the pre-lockdown period in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus wearing insulin pump equipped with sensor.

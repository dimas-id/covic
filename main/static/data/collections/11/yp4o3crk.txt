More than 20 million people died during the pandemic 'flu season 1918/1919, the largest influenza pandemic of the 20th century. Since then, influenza A virus infections have been known as a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in the whole world population. Although specific and effective antiviral therapeutics (neuraminidase inhibitors) are available, vaccinating against influenza is the first preventative measure. In Germany, influenza immunization has been yearly recommended by the current vaccination committee of the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO). Vaccinations have a special indication in elderly persons >60 years, patients with chronic diseases and persons with higher risk of influenza infections. In general, inactivated vaccines are well tolerated by recipients. The cost effectiveness of influenza vaccination has been well established. Although the benefit of annual influenza vaccination especially for the elderly and risk groups is beyond doubt, a low acceptance of vaccine recommendations has been noticed in Germany to date.

A 73-year-old Caucasian woman presented with hematemesis. She had been diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis several years previously but her disease was well compensated. She was seen at a local hospital and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that demonstrated no signs of esophageal varices but a large mass in the fundus and some nodular changes in the stomach. The concern was for a gastric malignancy. She is transfused and sent to you for further investigation.

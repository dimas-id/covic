OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression of the 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L in different human organ/tissue derived microvascular endothelial cells. METHODS Endothelial cells from the microvessels in human brain, lung, hepatic sennoside, fat adipose tissue, adrenal gland, esophagus, lymph nodes, and bone were culture. RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to detect the expression of ACE2 and CD209L receptors. RESULTS Both SARS-CoV receptors of ACE2 and CD209L were expressed in the 8 organ/tissue-derived endothelial cells. The expression of ACE2 receptor was the highest in the human lung microvascular endothelial cells, and lowest in the lymphatic endothelial cells. The expression of CD209L was relatively higher in the human lymphatic endothelial cells. CONCLUSION The organ derived microvascular endothelial cells are the important target of SARS-CoV. The pathological injury of lung and lymph system induced by SARS-CoV may be mediated respectively by different receptors of SARS-CoV.

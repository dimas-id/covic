To date, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is potentially found in wild birds of different species. This work reports the survey of coronaviruses in wild birds from Madagascar based on the targeting of a conserved genome sequence among different groups of CoVs. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of gammacoronaviruses in different species of Gruiformes, Passeriformes, Ciconiiformes, Anseriformes, and Charadriiformes. Furthermore, some sequences were related to various IBV strains. Aquatic and migratory birds may play an important role in the maintenance and spread of coronaviruses in nature, highlighting their possible contribution in the emergence of new coronavirus diseases in wild and domestic birds.

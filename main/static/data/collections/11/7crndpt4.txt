Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway remodeling, and excessive constriction of the airway. Detailed investigation exploring inflammation and the role of immune cells has revealed a variety of possible mechanisms by which chronic inflammation drives asthma development. However, the underlying mechanisms of asthma pathogenesis still remain poorly understood. New evidence now suggests that mechanical stimuli that arise during bronchoconstriction may play a critical role in asthma development. In this article, we review the mechanical effect of bronchoconstriction and how these mechanical stresses contribute to airway remodeling independent of inflammation.

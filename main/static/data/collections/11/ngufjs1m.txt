Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is an infectious pathogen spreading in a wide range of vertebrate species. Pigs are amplifying hosts of JEV and thought to be maintained in nature predominantly by avian-mosquito cycles. In the innate immune system, interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) is a small transmembrane protein family and has been identified as the first line of defense against a broad range of RNA virus invasion. In this paper, we found that swine IFITM (sIFITM) could restrict the replication of both JEV vaccine strain and wild strain NJ-2008. The cysteine S-palmitoylation modification of sIFITM plays important roles in their anti-JEV effects and intracellular distributions. Our findings show the anti-JEV activities of swine interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins and broaden the antiviral spectrum of IFITM protein family. The preliminary exploration of S-palmitoylation modification of sIFITM may contribute to understanding of the antiviral molecular mechanism of sIFITM.

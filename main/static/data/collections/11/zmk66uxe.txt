Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and iliac veins, known as iliocaval thrombosis, is a common cause of significant morbidity. Patients with chronic iliocaval obstruction often present with life-limiting occlusive symptoms secondary to recurrent lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, swelling, pain, venous stasis ulcers, or phlegmasia. Endovascular iliocaval reconstruction is a technically successful procedure that results in favorable clinical outcomes and stent patency rates with few complications and is often able to relieve debilitating symptoms in affected patients. This review presents an approach to endovascular iliocaval stent reconstruction in patients suffering from chronic iliocaval thrombosis, including background, patient selection, timing of intervention, procedural steps, technical considerations, patient follow-up, and a brief review of outcomes. Schematic illustrations and clinical cases outlining iliocaval stent reconstruction and crossing chronic venous occlusions have been provided.

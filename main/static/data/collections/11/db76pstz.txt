The subject of carriage of dangerous goods by air is addressed in Annex 18 to the Chicago Convention. The material in this Annex was developed by the Air Navigation Commission in response to a need expressed by Contracting States for an internationally agreed set of provisions governing the safe transport of dangerous goods by air. In order to assist in achieving compatibility with the regulations covering the transport of dangerous goods by other modes of transport, the provisions of this Annex are based on the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and the Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials of the International Atomic Energy Agency. More than half of the cargo carried by all modes of transport in the world is dangerous cargoâ€”explosive, corrosive, flammable, toxic and even radioactive. These dangerous goods are essential for a wide variety of global industrial, commercial, medical and research requirements and processes. Because of the advantages of air transport, a great deal of this dangerous cargo is carried by aircraft.

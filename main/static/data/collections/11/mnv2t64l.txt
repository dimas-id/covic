The complete genome of sapelovirus A, formerly known as porcine sapelovirus (PSV), from a diarrheic pig was sequenced for the first time in the United States (designated PSV USA/IA33375/2015). It shares 87.8% to 83.9% nucleotide identities with other reported PSV strains globally and is most closely related to Asia PSV strains.

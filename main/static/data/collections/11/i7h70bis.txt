Governments across the world have enforced emergency measures in response to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (henceforth ‘the coronavirus’) pandemic. Indeed, the UK government has enacted emergency legislation in its response by passing the Coronavirus Act 2020. Amongst other things, this act extends existing statutory powers to impose deprivations of liberty for public health purposes. The extension of such powers naturally raises concerns about whether their use will be compatible with human rights law. In particular, it is unclear whether their use will fall within the public heath exception to the Article 5 right to liberty and security of the person in the European Convention of Human Rights, enshrined in the UK law by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998. In this paper, I use the Coronavirus Act introduced in the UK as a case study of how emergency legislation enacted in a pandemic may conflict with human rights law enshrined elsewhere in domestic law. Having outlined key features of existing statutory powers in the UK, and how they are extended under the Coronavirus Act, I briefly consider how the European Court of Human Rights has interpreted the public health exception to Article 5 rights. This analysis suggests two grounds on which deprivations of liberty performed in accordance with the emergency legislation introduced in the UK might be vulnerable to claims of Article 5 rights violations. First, the absence of specified time limits on certain deprivations of liberty means that they may fail the requirement of legal certainty championed by the European Court in its interpretation of the public health exception. Second, the Coronavirus Act’s extension of powers to individual’s lacking public health expertise may undermine the extent to which the act will ensure that deprivations of liberty are both necessary and proportionate.

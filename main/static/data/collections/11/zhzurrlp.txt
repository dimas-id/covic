Minute virus of mice (MVM) resembles rat virus and has the capacity for autonomous replication. The discovery of a new serotype, with some properties distinct from MVM, highlights the importance of employing both genetic and serotype-specific tests for the identification of murine parvoviruses (MPVs). The detection of multiple MPVs isolates indicated a need for standardized nomenclature. As with other autonomous parvoviruses, MPVs require cellular factors expressed during cell division and differentiation for productive replication. These factors are thought to account for their predilection for mitotically active cells. The simple structure of rodent parvoviruses has stimulated development of valuable reagents to detect infection. These include generic and serotype-specific antigens for use in serological tests, antibodies to viral proteins for use in immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction primers for detection of viral DNA in infected tissues and feces, and strand-specific molecular probes that help distinguish sites of active viral replication. Because MVM does not persist in immunocompetent mice, control and elimination should employ quarantine for at least 1 month, combined with thorough disinfection of the environment. Quarantine also assumes that MPV infection is ruled out. Prevention is based on sound serological monitoring of mice and surveillance of biologicals destined for inoculation of mice.

At this time, COVID-2019 is spreading its foot in the form of a huge epidemic for the world. This epidemic is spreading its foot very fast in India too. One of the World Health Organization states that COVID-2019 is a serious disease that spreads from one person to another at very fast speed through contact routes and respiratory drops. On this day, India and the world should rise to an effective step to analyze this disease and eliminate the effects of this epidemic. In this paper presented, the growing database of COVID-2019 has been analyzed from March 1, 2020, to April 11, 2020, and the next one is predicted for the number of patients suffering from the rising COVID-2019. Different regression analysis models have been utilized for data analysis of COVID-2019 of India based on data stored by Kaggle in between 1 March 2020 to 11 April 2020. In this study, we have been utilized six regression analysis based models namely quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, sixth degree, and exponential polynomial respectively for the COVID-2019 dataset. We have calculated the root mean square of these six regression analysis models. In these six models, the root mean square error of sixth degree polynomial is very less in compared other like quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, and exponential polynomial. Therefore the sixth degree polynomial regression model is very good models for forecasting the next 6 days for COVID-2019 data analysis in India. In this study, we have found that the sixth degree polynomial regression models will help Indian doctors and the Government in preparing their plans in the next 7 days. Based on further regression analysis study, this model can be tuned for forecasting over long term intervals.

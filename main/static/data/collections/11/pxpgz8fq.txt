Several meta-analyses and multicenter trials have shown that chronic limb ischemia did not occur for up to 5 years in 50%-70% of patients who underwent saphenous vein grafts, with limb salvage and perioperative mortality rates of >80% and 3%, respectively. However, open surgical bypass can have limitations, including postoperative morbidity/wound complications of 10%-20% and prolonged length of hospital stay and outpatient care. Several studies have analyzed clinical outcomes for patients with critical limb ischemia treated with endovascular therapies, but they have been mainly retrospective with significant heterogeneity or were single center. Only few randomized trials have compared surgical vs. endovascular therapy. These included the Bypass vs. Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial, with no differences found in amputation-free or overall survival rates at 1 year; however, late outcomes favored the surgical group. The Bypass or Angioplasty in Severe Intermittent Claudication (BASIC) trial concluded that the 1-year patency rates were 82% and 43% for bypass and angioplasty, respectively. The BEST Endovascular vs. Best Surgical Therapy in Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial is currently enrolling patients. This review analyzed studies comparing open vs. endovascular therapy in patients with femoropopliteal disease.

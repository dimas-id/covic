Pigs infected by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are affected by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. The severity of clinical signs depends on the virus strain. Two genetically different PEDV strains are known to infect pigs, the PEDV S-InDel strains which circulate on all continents and the highly virulent PEDV S-non-InDel strains found in Asia and in America. We have previously demonstrated the presence of PEDV RNA in semen from boars experimentally infected with an S-non-InDel PEDV strain. If naturally infected boars may shed PEDV in semen, this would have important consequences for the breeding sector. Thus we sought to determine whether PEDV has been circulating in populations of breeding boars from French artificial insemination (AI) centers. The current study reports on a serological survey conducted on one hundred and twenty boars from six AI centers, representing 18.6% of the total population of breeding boars in French AI centers in 2015. All of them were found negative for PEDV antibodies, showing no evidence of PEDV circulation in French AI centers at that time.

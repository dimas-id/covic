The novel 1-acyl-4-cycloalkyl/arylsemicarbazides (5a–y) and 1-acyl-5-benzyloxy/hydroxycarbamoylcarbazides (8a–f) derived from the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, fenoprofen and reduced ketoprofen were prepared, fully chemically characterized and evaluated for their cytostatic, antiviral and antioxidant activities. Compounds 5 and 8 consist of a region rich in electronegative atoms (five to nine nitrogen and oxygen atoms) framed by aryl or cycloalkyl residues on one or both terminal ends. The synthetic pathways applied for the preparation of the title compounds involved a benzotriazole as a synthetic auxiliary in several steps. Three of the tested compounds, namely 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5l), 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(3-benzylphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5s), and 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5f) showed pronounced antiproliferative activity in vitro against six cancer cell lines (IC(50) = 3–23 μM). The same compounds highly inhibited soybean lipoxygenase (IC(50) = 60 and 51.5 μM) and lipid peroxidation as well (99, 88 and 74%, respectively). 4-Benzyloxy-1-[2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5t) and 5-benzyloxycarbamoyl-1-[2-(3-benzylphenyl)propanoyl]carbazide (8c) exerted complete lipid peroxidation inhibition. Semicarbazides 5w–y and carbazides 8d–f bearing a hydroxamic acid/hydroxyurea moiety showed a modest antiradical activity in DPPH test, while the best radical scavenger was 1-(1-benzotriazolecarbonyl)-4-benzyloxysemicarbazide (7). None of the compounds were inhibitory to a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses in the cell culture at subtoxic concentrations.

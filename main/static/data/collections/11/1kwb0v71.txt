CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells play a key role in the maintenance of our immunity against viruses. Recent technological developments, such as the use of MHC-peptide tetrameric complexes, have permitted significant improvements in the study of these cells. It is now possible to assess precisely frequencies as well as phenotypic and functional features of virus specific T-cells from the onset of many viral infections onwards. Different virus specific T-cell populations exhibit distinct functional characteristics and can be positioned at different stages of a process of post-thymic development, which we are drawing near to understanding the significance. Still, further work is needed before consensus is reached as regards what defines and how to induce the optimal virus specific T-cell response which will confer long lasting immunological protection in humans.

Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is essential to control the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a rapid and accurate one-step multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay, along with a computational tool to systematically analyse the data. Our assay could detect to a limit of 15 copies of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptsâ€”based on experiments performed by spiking total human RNA with in vitro synthesized viral transcripts. The assay was evaluated by performing 184 validations for the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid gene and human RNase P as an internal control reference gene with dilutions ranging from 1-100 ng for human RNA on a cohort of 26 clinical samples. 5 of 26 patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 21 tested negative, consistent with the standards. The accuracy of the assay was found to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific based on the 26 clinical samples that need to be further verified using a large number of clinical samples. In summary, we present a rapid, easy to implement real-time PCR based assay with automated analysis using a novel COVID qPCR Analyzer tool with graphical user interface (GUI) to analyze the raw qRT-PCR data in an unbiased manner at a cost of under $3 per reaction and turnaround time of less than 2h, to enable in-house SARS-CoV-2 testing across laboratories.

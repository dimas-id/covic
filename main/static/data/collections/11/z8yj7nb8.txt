With the rapidly changing landscape of the Covid-19 outbreak, how to best address the needs and continue to protect the health and well-being of people with disabilities (PwDs) is a global public health priority. In this commentary we identify three public health areas of ongoing need and offer possible strategies to address each. These areas include: the types of data that would help clarify risks for PwDs and help assure their safety long term; the prevention, treatment and mitigation measures for PwDs that are needed through the duration of the outbreak; and the issues of equity in access to and quality of medical care for PwDs. Because of the rapid nature of the public health response, it is critical to reassess and readjust our approach to best address the needs of PwDs in the months and years to come and to incorporate these new practices into future emergency preparedness responses.

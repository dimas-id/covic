BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a common bariatric procedure associated with a high rate of weight loss failure and/or complications in the long term. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the conversion of failed LAGB into laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is not associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications and leads to weight loss results that are comparable to those obtained with a primary LSG. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the results of a prospective series of 1360 LSG regarding patient demographics, the indication for revision morbidity, the percentage of excess weight loss, and the rate of postoperative complications. RESULTS The primary LSG group contained 1060 patients and the LAGB to LSG group contained 300 patients. The rate of postoperative complications was 4.5% in the primary LSG group and 2% in the LAGB to LSG group. Two patients died in the LSG group (1 pulmonary embolus, 1 myocardial infarction). There was no significant difference with respect to the rate of leak, which was 1% in the LAGB to LSG group and 1.6% in the primary LSG group. There was a greater weight loss after primary LSG, mean % excess weight loss of 75.9%±21.4 at a mean interval of 29±19.8 months, versus 62.6%±22.2 at a mean interval of 35±24 months after LAGB to LSG (P = .008). There were 72.1% and 59.2% of patients available for follow-up after primary LSG at 24 and 60 months respectively, versus 69.3% and 55.4% after LAGB to LSG. CONCLUSION This study indicates that the risk of leak after LSG was not increased after conversion failed LAGB into LSG when performed as a 2-step procedure.

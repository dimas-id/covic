PURPOSE OF REVIEW Most research on toxic exposures in vulnerable populations focuses on air pollution. Synthetic chemical production, however, is a multi-billion-dollar industry that lacks appropriate international regulation to protect those exposed to toxic chemicals. This paper aims to describe the country-level import and export of key groups of synthetic chemicals using data from the United Nations Comtrade Database and provide a narrative review of the evidence from January 2018 to August 2019 on exposure to, health effects of, and interventions to reduce synthetic chemicals in vulnerable populations around the world. RECENT FINDINGS Generally, a small number of high-income countries export the majority of synthetic chemicals, while most low-income countries import more chemicals than they export, which may contribute to higher levels of synthetic chemicals in those settings. However, few studies have quantified exposures to synthetic chemicals in low- and middle-income countries, the health effects of such exposures, or interventions to mitigate exposures. Synthetic chemicals continue to enter markets despite our limited knowledge of their effects on human health, particularly in the most vulnerable populations. We need more research to understand the health impacts of these pervasive exposures.

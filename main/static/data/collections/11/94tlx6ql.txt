A new study of dominant negative functions in cells infected by a positive-strand RNA virus detects an array of locus- and allele-specific effects. Exploiting subunit defects in multi-component complex assemblies provides a new approach to identifying targets for antiviral therapies that may inhibit the emergence of drug-resistant RNA virus populations.

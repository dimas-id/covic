The primary purpose of this study was to critically review published data related to the sources and mechanisms of aerosolization of microorganisms, their fragments and metabolites in a variety of occupational environments. The processes and mechanisms considered in the review include bursting bubbles; liquid dispersion as the result of irrigation, separation, high pressure cleaning and technological water recycling; manual and automated handling of contaminated material in agriculture, waste processing and industrial processes; as well as high temperature industrial processes. The review identifies the gaps in the existing knowledge regarding the sources of bioaerosol, aerosolization mechanisms, bioaerosol distribution and potential risks for the workers and residents. The study also reviews the existing laboratory methods of bioaerosol generation with particular focus on the advantages and shortcomings of each method.

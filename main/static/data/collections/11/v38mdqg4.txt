INTRODUCTION: In late December 2019, reports emerged from Wuhan, China of a novel corovonavirus SARS-CoV-2, which caused severe acute respiratory distress syndrome referred to as COVID-19. As the virus spread, reports of severe perioperative complications, including fatalities, began to emerge in the literature. We present a case of a previously healthy patient who developed classic symptoms of appendicitis. The patient was also found to be positive for COVID-19. Given the risks to both the patient and surgical team, we elected to pursue a non-operative management strategy for this patient with appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 13 year old female with COVID-19 presented with a day of right lower quadrant abdominal pain. A computerized tomography (CT) scan diagnosed uncomplicated appendicitis. The patient was successfully treated non-operatively with antibiotics and discharged home. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this case illustrates the first report of a pediatric patient with concomitant appendicitis and COVID-19 infection. We have been able to utilize a non-operative management strategy to effectively treat the patient's acute appendicitis, while protecting her from the risks of undergoing a general anesthetic as well as the operative team. We hope this report can provide others with a potential management strategy for similar patients.

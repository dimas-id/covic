OBJECTIVE This paper discusses issues arising from the rapid implementation of metropolitan telepsychiatry in private practice during the Covid-19 public health emergency. CONCLUSIONS The relatively rapid uptake of private practice metropolitan telepsychiatry may further increase flexibility of the options for appointments through ongoing broad telepsychiatry access after the Covid-19 crisis. Telepsychiatry can be used to facilitate the temporary provision of psychiatric care, and has benefits and risks, but is not a longer-term replacement for the interpersonal richness of face-to-face consultations.

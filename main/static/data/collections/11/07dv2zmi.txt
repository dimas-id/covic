Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, some patients are not surgical candidates because of medical problems. Therefore, alternative therapies are considered in these medically inoperable patients. Radiofrequency ablation has been used clinically for more than 12 years, with many studies reporting its safety and efficacy. Because there are no large prospective clinical trials comparing the efficacy and long-term survival of the different treatment modalities, the choice of therapy is often based on a combination of tumor location, available technology and expertise, and patient preference. Here we review the principles, procedure, follow up, and clinical outcomes published to date on radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

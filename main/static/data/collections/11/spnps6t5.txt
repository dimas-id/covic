In this paper, we focus on the autocorrelation of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) process on networks. The [Formula: see text]-intertwined mean-field approximation (NIMFA) is applied to calculate the autocorrelation properties of the exact SIS process. We derive the autocorrelation of the infection state of each node and the fraction of infected nodes both in the steady and transient states as functions of the infection probabilities of nodes. Moreover, we show that the autocorrelation can be used to estimate the infection and curing rates of the SIS process. The theoretical results are compared with the simulation of the exact SIS process. Our work fully utilizes the potential of the mean-field method and shows that NIMFA can indeed capture the autocorrelation properties of the exact SIS process.

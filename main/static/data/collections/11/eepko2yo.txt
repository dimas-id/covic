BALB/cByJ mice have a deficiency of short‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) and are a useful model for studying the inborn errors of fatty acid metabolism which affect humans. Patients with some of these disorders present with hypoglycemia, hyperamonemia, and microvesicular fatty change of hepatocytes. In the present study we examined pathogen‐free, SCAD deficient BALB/cByJ mice and control BALB/cBy mice for biochemical and tissue changes following fasting or salicylate challenge. We observed mitochondrial swelling and microvesicular fatty changes in hepatocytes in mutant mice, especially severe following a fast. However, fasting did not alter their blood ammonia and there was no apparent clinical disease. Similarly, salicylates did not produce disease in the BALB/cByJ mice. We did detect in mice an alternative pathway for salicylate metabolism, by‐passing glycine conjugation which is the principal metabolic pathway in humans. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

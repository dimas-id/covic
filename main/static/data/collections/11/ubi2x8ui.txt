Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a severe and potentially life-threatening disease manifestation. Besides autoimmune diseases such as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) syndrome pulmonary viral infections are also known to be culprits of DAH. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic confronts healthcare providers all around the world with an unprecedented number of viral lung infections with a great variance in symptoms and severity. Hemoptysis being the key symptome of DAH has so far been reported to be rare. We present two cases of immunocompromised patients with rapidly developing hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of DAH in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

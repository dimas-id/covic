PURPOSE: To examine the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic bronchial rupture in children at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. METHODS: The diagnosis and treatment of eight cases of traumatic bronchial rupture were analyzed retrospectively from January 2014 to December 2019 in our hospital. RESULTS: Diagnosis of the eight patients was clear after a chest CT with three-dimensional reconstruction techniques and fiberoptic bronchoscopy; six of the patients had a delay in diagnosis of at least 2 weeks. Among the patients, six had left bronchus rupture, and the other two had right bronchus rupture. All eight patients received surgery; seven patients received a bronchial end-to-end valgus anastomosis, and one received right middle lobe lobectomy. There were no deaths in this group, and all patients were cured and discharged. Follow-up was conducted for 3 months to 2 years; the patients who received surgery showed mild bronchostenosis within 2 weeks after the trauma, and the other six patients showed moderate bronchostenosis upon CT examination. CONCLUSION: Being alert to bronchial rupture after trauma in children is helpful for diagnosis. Chest CT with three-dimensional reconstruction techniques and fiberoptic bronchoscopy are the most valuable diagnostic methods. The patients can show excellent results if the operation for a continuous valgus anastomosis of the posterior wall and interrupted end-to-end valgus anastomosis of the anterior wall on the ruptured side is performed in the early stage of traumatic bronchial rupture.

A Luminex xTAG-based assay for plant-infecting tospoviruses was developed. The test enables the detection of tospoviruses in general and the differentiation of the four important member species of this genus: Tomato spotted wilt virus, Impatiens necrotic spot virus, the proposed ‘Capsicum chlorosis virus’ and Watermelon silver mottle virus. The generic tospovirus primers used in this method are also applicable for detection of tospoviruses by basic RT-PCR. We also describe an economic alternative method for the distinction of the four tospoviruses mentioned and of additional member viruses, based on a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The sophisticated Luminex xTAG technology allows the simultaneous detection of various targets. This study is part of a project that aims to develop a method for the simultaneous detection of various plant pathogens (viral, bacterial and fungal) in plant material.

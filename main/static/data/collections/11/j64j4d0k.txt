Abstract Faecal specimens from 520 patients with non-bacterial, gastroenteritis were examined by electron microscopy using four methods. These were (1) a direct dip method, (2) low-speed centrifugation, (3) ultracentrifugation and (4) a calcium phosphate method. The calcium phosphate method combined with low-speed centrifugation (750 × g, 2,100 × g) was considered overall best. The calcium phosphate method makes it possible to handle a large number of faecal specimens by saving considerable time and labour.

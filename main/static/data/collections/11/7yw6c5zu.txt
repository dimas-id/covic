Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that affects poultry production worldwide. The absence of vaccine cross-protection and the frequent emergence of new variant strains complicate control of IBV. Here we designed a study to measure the evolution dynamics of IBV strains in China. One hundered and seven complete sequences and 1022 S1-region sequences of Chinese IBVs isolated between 1994 and 2014 were analysed by using MEGA 5.0 software and the Bayesian analysis sampling trees (BEAST) method, and selection pressure on different proteins was assessed. The phylogenetic dissimilarity of different gene trees in the data set indicated possible recombination. Fourteen isolates were identified as recombinants, possibly generated from vaccines of the Massachusetts serotype in recombination with circulating viruses. The earliest IBV in China was found to have existed in the early 1900s, and continues to evolve at a rate of approximately 10(âˆ’) (5) substitutions per site per year. We found that purifying selection was the main evolutionary pressure in the protein-coding regions, while the S1 gene bears the greatest positive selection pressure. The proportion of QX-like genotype strains increased over time. These results indicate that the genotypes of Chinese IBVs have undergone a remarkable transition during the past 20 years.

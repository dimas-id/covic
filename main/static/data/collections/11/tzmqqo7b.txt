The murine coronavirus surface glycoprotein gene was expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria, and the expressed protein was used to generate S protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Three of the MAbs, 11F, 30B, and 10G, were able to neutralize virus infectivity, and two of them, 11F and 10G, were able to block virus-induced, cell-to-cell fusion. The binding sites of the 11F, 30B, and 10G MAbs were determined by Western immunoblotting and epitope mapping. The 11F and 30B MAbs bound to sites located, respectively, between amino acids 33 to 40 and 395 to 406 in the amino-terminal (S1) subunit of the S protein, and the 10G MAb bound to a site located between amino acids 1123 and 1137 in the carboxy-terminal (S2) subunit. These data define more precisely the interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits of the murine coronavirus S protein and provide further insights into its structure and function.

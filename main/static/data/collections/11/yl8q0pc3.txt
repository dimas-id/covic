Distal embolization is a common occurrence with peripheral arterial interventions and is more frequent with the use of atherectomy devices. We report the first case of JetStream atherectomy (Boston Scientific, Maple Grove, MN) with the use of the novel WIRION embolic protection system filter. The procedure was performed successfully with no distal embolizations beyond the filter and with no complications in the delivery or retrieval of the filter. The pros and cons of the off label use of this filter with JetStream atherectomy are discussed.

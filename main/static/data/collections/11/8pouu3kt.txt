The binding of human coronavirus OC43 to human rhabdomyosarcoma cells which are highly susceptible to infection was studied by a solid phase virus binding assay and a receptor blockade assay. It was observed that whole virions and S(spike) bound to a 90 kD glycoprotein of RD cells even after treatment of the substrate with neuraminidase or 0.1 M NaOH. A second receptor of 45 kD also bound virus and was identified as HLA class I antigen. Antibody to both receptors reduced the virus yield in a receptor blockade assay. Sera from four patients with multiple sclerosis contained receptor blocking activity which correlated with antibodies to HLA. No receptor blocking antibodies to the 90 kD RD cell protein were found in human sera.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition that often requires prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is a common procedure with some risks, on the other hand with potential advantages over orotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. This study investigated the association of tracheostomy with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptoms of psychiatric disorders and return-to-work of ARDS survivors. METHODS: Data were collected in the context of the prospective observational German-wide DACAPO study. Clinical and demographic patient data and treatment characteristics were obtained from the participating intensive care units (ICU). HRQoL and return-to-work were assessed using patient-reported questionnaires 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. HRQoL was measured with the Physical and Mental Component Scale of the Short-Form 12 Questionnaire (PCS-12, MCS-12). The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome-14. Physician-diagnosed anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder were recorded by patient self-report in the follow-up questionnaires. The associations of tracheostomy with HRQoL, psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work after 12 months were investigated by means of multivariable linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Primary 877 ARDS patients (mean ± standard deviation: 54 ± 16 years, 68% male) survived and were discharged from ICU. Out of these patients, 478 (54.5%) were tracheotomised during ICU treatment. After 12 months, patient-reported outcomes could be analysed of 388 (44.2%) respondents, 205 with tracheostomy and 183 without. One year after ICU discharge, tracheostomy showed no significant association with physical or mental health-related quality of life (PCS-12: − 0.73 [− 3.96, 2.51]; MCS-12: − 0.71 [− 4.92, 3.49]), symptoms of psychiatric disorders (depression: 0.10 [− 1.43, 1.64]; PTSD: 3.31 [− 1.81, 8.43]; anxiety: 1.26 [0.41, 3.86]; obsessive–compulsive disorder: 0.59 [0.05, 6.68]) or return-to-work (0.71 [0.31, 1.64]) in the multivariable analysis (OR [95%-CI]). CONCLUSIONS: Up to 1 year after ICU discharge, neither HRQoL nor symptoms of psychiatric disorders nor return-to-work was affected by tracheostomy.

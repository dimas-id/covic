This chapter provides an overview of the global epidemiology of rabies, focusing on major changes over the past half-century and highlighting recent discoveries. This chapter also describes the natural and iatrogenic routes of transmission, as well as the risk and necessary actions for the prevention of rabies following an exposure. It reviews the methods for rabies diagnosis and the biologics for prevention, in addition to differences in rabies prophylaxis recommendations among advisory committees. The chapter also considers epidemiology and trends in global human rabies and the dynamics of the corresponding mammalian reservoir hosts for each area. Furthermore, it considers the phylogenetics of rabies virus, other lyssaviruses, and specific rabies virus variants in the context of regional rabies and the potential for novel emergences. Special attention is paid to developed countries, where existing surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure have provided detailed insights into the nature changing patterns in rabies epidemiology-patterns expected to be increasingly relevant to other less-developed nations based on current trends. Special attention is afforded to canine rabies, as dogs remain responsible for over 99% of all human exposures to the virus, including the methods and problems associated with intentional and unintentional movement of dogs at national and international levels. Finally, the chapter discusses the economic burden of rabies in terms of human and infrastructure support.

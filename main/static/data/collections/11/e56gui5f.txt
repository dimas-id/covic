Osteomas are the most common benign sinonasal lesion with the frontal sinus the most common location. On sinus MRI, dried secretions show as hyperintense on T1, hypointense on T2, and polyps show hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2. Rhinoscleroma is caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis with histopathology showing Mikulicz cells (macrophages containing pathogen) and Russell bodies (plasma cells).

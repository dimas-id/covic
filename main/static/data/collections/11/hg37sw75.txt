Retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE cells) are key players in the first-line defense against invading organisms such as viruses and bacteria. The interaction between RPE cells and viral or bacterial components is very important for clearance of these organisms. Toll-like receptors are a family of recognition receptors involved in innate immunity. Each TLR acts as a primary sensor of conserved microbial components and drives the induction of specific biological responses. TLR 3 is involved in the recognition of viral components, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and poly(I:C), while TLR 9 recognizes viral or bacterial DNA without methylation at CpG motifs. In the present study, we investigated the expression and function of TLR 3 and 9 in RPE cells. PCR analysis revealed expression of genes for TLR 3 and 9 in RPE cells. Expression of TLR 3 and 9 protein was detected in RPE cells by flow cytometry. TLR 3 and 9 showed strong intracellular expression. To detect angiogenetic factors produced by RPE cells, culture supernatant was examined with the Human Angiogenesis Antibody Array, which can simultaneously detect 20 different angiogenetic factors including cytokines, chemokines, soluble cytokine receptors, and growth factors. RPE cells showed high production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemotactic protein-I (MCP-I). Furthermore, stimulation of RPE cells with the dsRNA analogue poly(I:C) enhanced the secretion of IL-8 and MCP-I, as well as enhancing the expression of junctional adhesion molecule-I (Jam-I) and intracellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I), and promoted the adhesion of monocyte to these cells. In contrast, stimulation with the CpG-DNA motif only enhanced the secretion of IL-8. However, CpG-DNA motif enhanced phagocytosis in RPE cells. These results may indicate that TLR 3 and 9 play a distinct role in the inflammatory response that clears viruses from the retina.

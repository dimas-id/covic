The development of quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods is going very fast for the last decades. OSAR approach already plays an important role in lead structure optimization, and nowadays, with development of big data approaches and computer power, it can even handle a huge amount of data associated with combinatorial chemistry. One of the recent developments is a three-dimensional QSAR, i.e., 3D QSAR. For the last two decades, 3D-OSAR has already been successfully applied to many datasets, especially of enzyme and receptor ligands. Moreover, quite often 3D QSAR investigations are going together with protein–ligand docking studies and this combination works synergistically. In this review, we outline recent advances in development and applications of 3D QSAR and protein–ligand docking approaches, as well as combined approaches for conventional organic compounds and for nanostructured materials, such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes.

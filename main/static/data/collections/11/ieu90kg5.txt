Most patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) develop antibodies against the SARS coronavirus and survive the infection. This suggests that active or passive immunisation might be an effective option in preventing or treating SARS. Therefore, the development of SARS vaccination strategies belongs to the most important targets of SARS research. The present study analyses data-bases for the current knowledge on vaccination strategies. Both, passive and active immunisation protocols are presently being developed. Passive immunisation with sera from surviving patients leads to partial success. Whereas the passive immunisation exhibits a promising therapeutic tool, only active immunisation can successfully prevent infection. A number of approaches has been used on the basis of inactivated SARS coronaviruses, recombinant subunits, recombinant DNA, and viral vectors. However, all recently developed candidates need to be evaluated critically before clinical use. The so-called "antibody-dependent enhancement" can improve viral uptake into host cells resulting in increased viral load and exacerbation of disease.

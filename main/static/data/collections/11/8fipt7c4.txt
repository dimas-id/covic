Query Performance Prediction (QPP) is concerned with estimating the effectiveness of a query within the context of a retrieval model. It allows for operations such as query routing and segmentation, leading to improved retrieval performance. Pre-retrieval QPP methods are oblivious to the performance of the retrieval model as they predict query difficulty prior to observing the set of documents retrieved for the query. Since neural embedding-based models are showing wider adoption in the Information Retrieval (IR) community, we propose a set of pre-retrieval QPP metrics based on the properties of pre-trained neural embeddings and show that such metrics are more effective for query performance prediction compared to the widely known QPP metrics such as SCQ, PMI and SCS. We report our findings based on Robust04, ClueWeb09 and Gov2 corpora and their associated TREC topics.

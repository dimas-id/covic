In critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, the cardiorespiratory system may collapse by the following mechanisms: (1) cytokine storm, haemophagocytosis - septic shock, (2) uncontrollable hypoxaemia, (3) specific organ failure or multiple organ failure. In this summary, we review the currently available therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of the above conditions. Removal of cytokines by CytoSorb haemoperfusion has been used more and more frequently and with encouraging success in recent years to treat septic shock. In the case of hypoxaemia, which can no longer be treated with conventional mechanical ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), inhaled epoprostenol and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) are considered. A common component of mostly late-stage organ failure is acute renal failure, which requires the initiation of one of the available continuous renal replacement therapies.

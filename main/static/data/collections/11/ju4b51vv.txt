The development of technologies that combine the advantages of nanomedicine with natural medicine represents a versatile approach to improve the safety and efficacy of drugs. Glycyrrhizinic acid (GA) is a natural compound that has a wide range of biological activities for the treatment of diseases. To establish a safe nanotransport system for this drug, two different nanoparticles with glycyrrhizinic acid, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN–GA) and polymeric nanoparticles (PNP(S)–GA) were elaborated to obtain nanostructure sizes between 200 and 300 nm. The nanoparticles were evaluated at concentrations of 1.25–100 μl/ml using the MARC-145 cell line to determine the effects on cell morphology, cellular structure (actin filaments) and cell viability (mitochondrial and lysosomal) at 24 and 72 h post-exposure. The safety range of the nanoparticles was 50 µl/ml, to determine that PNPs–GA had an optimal safety profile and no cytotoxic effects, as there was no evidence of changes in morphology, internal cellular structures (stress fibers and the cell cortex formed by actin filaments) or viability under the experimental concentrations and conditions employed.

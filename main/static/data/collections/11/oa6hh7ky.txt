Abstract A crucial interplay between protein conformations and lipid membrane energetics emerges as the guiding principle for the regulation and mechanism of membrane fusion in biological systems. As some of the basics of fusion become clear, a myriad of compelling questions come to the fore. Is the interior of the fusion pore protein or lipid? Why is synaptic release so fast? Why is PIP2 needed for exocytosis? How does fusion peptide insertion lead to fusion of viruses to cell membranes? What role does the TMD play? How can studies on membrane fission contribute to our understanding of membrane fusion? What exactly are SNARE proteins doing?

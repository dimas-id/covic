The novel coronavirus (CoV) disease termed COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) is causing a massive pandemic worldwide, threatening public health systems across the globe. During this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, nucleic acid detection has played an important role in early diagnosis. Here we report a SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol using a CRISPR-based CRISPR diagnostic platform - CDetection (Cas12b-mediated DNA detection). By combining sample treatment protocols and nucleic acid amplification methods with CDetection, we have established an integrated viral nucleic acid detection platform - CASdetec (CRISPR-assisted detection). The detection limit of CASdetec for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is 1 Ã— 104 copies/mL, with no cross reactivity observed. Our assay design and optimization process can provide guidance for future CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection assay development and optimization.

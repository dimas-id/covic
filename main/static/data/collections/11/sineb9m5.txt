BACKGROUND In one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), the measurement of the afferent limb starting at the angle of Treitz may result in insufficient absorptive surface of the intestine of the remaining efferent limb. To address this concern, we recently modified the technique of OAGB by constructing the gastrointestinal anastomosis at a fixed distance from the ileocecal valve (i.e., 300 cm). We adopted the new concept and named it the single anastomosis gastro-ileal bypass (SAGI). METHODS Seven consecutive patients with morbid obesity underwent the SAGI procedure. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications and there were no deaths. The mean excess weight (EW) loss was 55.1 % at 3 months and 82.1 % at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS The SAGI procedure may constitute a safer alternative to the conventional OAGB.

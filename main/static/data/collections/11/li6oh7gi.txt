The antigenic relationship between a recently isolated porcine respiratory coronavirus (TLM 83) and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus of swine was studied by neutralization, immunoblotting and radioimmunoassay (RIA) using TGE virus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal antibodies specific for both viruses. A complete two-way neutralization activity between the two viruses was found. Immunoblotting revealed cross-reactions between TLM 83 and TGE virus antigens at the level of the envelope protein (E1), the nucleoprotein (N) and the peplomer protein (E2). By virus neutralization assays and RIA with TGE virus-specific MAbs, the presence of similar epitopes in the E1 and N proteins and in the neutralization-mediating antigenic site of the E2 protein were demonstrated. E2 protein-specific MAbs, without neutralizing activity and reacting with antigenic sites B, C and D (previously defined), failed to recognize TLM 83. These results indicated a close antigenic relationship and structural similarity between TLM 83 and TGE viruses and also suggested potential ways of differentiating between the two viruses.

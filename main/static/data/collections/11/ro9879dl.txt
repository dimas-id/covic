Abstract The neurotropic mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), in particular strain JHM (JHMV or MHV-4), cause experimental central nervous system demyelination that pathologically resembles multiple sclerosis, an important human demyelinating disease. The mechanism of JHMV-induced demyelination remains unclear, though its tropism for oligodendrocytes had led to the belief that JHMV causes demyelination by direct lysis of these myelin-producing cells. However, several studies have also implicated the involvement of immune responses in the demyelinating process. In this communication, we present evidence that generalized immunosuppression with gamma irradiation prevents JHMV-induced demyelination, a finding that was not limited to a particular strain of JHMV or to one strain of mouse. In addition, significant paralytic-demyelinating disease was restored to infected, irradiated mice after the adoptive transfer of nylon wool nonadherent splenic cells and appeared to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These observations indicate that the principal mechanisms of JHMV-induced demyelination are most likely immunopathological.

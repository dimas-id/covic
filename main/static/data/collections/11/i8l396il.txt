Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important human pathogen that, along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is a major cause of respiratory tract infections in young infants. Development of an effective vaccine against Pneumoviruses has proven to be particularly difficult; despite over 50 years of research in this field, no vaccine against HMPV or RSV is currently available. Recombinant chimeric viruses expressing antigens of other viruses can be generated by reverse genetics and used for simultaneous immunization against more than one pathogen. This approach can result in the development of promising vaccine candidates against HMPV, and several studies have indeed validated viral vectors expressing HMPV antigens. In this review, we summarize current efforts in generating recombinant chimeric vaccines against HMPV, and we discuss their potential optimization based on the correspondence with RSV studies.

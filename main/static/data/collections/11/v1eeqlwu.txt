UNLABELLED Case presented at "Stump the Professors" 44th American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists Global Congress on Minimally Invasive Gynecology, NV, USA, 15-19 November 2015 BACKGROUND: Spontaneous torsion of the fallopian tubes is a rare condition, usually seen in acute settings or as incidental findings during laparoscopy. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE A 34-year-old nulligravid woman with inability to conceive for 7 months presented to our center. Her hysterosalpingography revealed a blind-ending right fallopian tube, and a blocked and dilated left fallopian tube. Laparoscopy showed a long, auto-amputated right fallopian tube, disconnected from the fimbriae and a long, dilated left fallopian tube, with several twists around its axis. Bilateral salpingectomy was performed. The patient subsequently underwent IVF, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy. CONCLUSION Spontaneous torsion of the fallopian tubes can manifest as primary infertility without any antecedent symptoms, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral tubal obstruction.

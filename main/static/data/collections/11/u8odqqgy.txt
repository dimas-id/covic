Abstract Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalyzes more than half of all phosphoserine/threonine dephosphorylation reactions in mammalian cells. In vivo PP1 does not exist as a free catalytic subunit but is always associated with at least one regulatory PP1-interacting protein (PIP) to generate a large set of distinct holoenzymes. Each PP1 complex controls the dephosphorylation of only a small subset of PP1 substrates. We screened the literature for genetically engineered mouse models and identified models for all PP1 isoforms and 104 PIPs. PP1 itself and at least 49 PIPs were connected to human disease-associated phenotypes. Additionally, phenotypes related to 17 PIPs were clearly linked to altered PP1 function, while such information was lacking for 32 other PIPs. We propose structural reverse genetics, which combines structural characterization of proteins with mouse genetics, to identify new PP1-related therapeutic targets. The available mouse models confirm the pleiotropic action of PP1 in health and diseases.

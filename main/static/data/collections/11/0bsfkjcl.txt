OBJECTIVES To describe the introduction of robotic sacrocolpopexy (RSC) in a urogynecology fellowship program, including operative times and patient outcomes. METHODS Data were retrospectively extracted from all women who underwent RSC between May 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011 by a single urogynecologist with fellow and resident assistance. Patient demographics, operative times, intraoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and postoperative course were analyzed. Cases were grouped chronologically in blocks of 10 for analysis. Trend analysis of operative time was done with linear and negative binomial regression. Fisher's exact test was used to compare complications among blocks. RESULTS Fifty-two patients (mean age 58.5±8.4 years) underwent RSC. The majority (75%) had stage III prolapse. Forty-one patients (79%) had concomitant procedures, including supracervical hysterectomy (44%), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (9.6%), midurethral sling (9.6%), and lysis of adhesions (40.4%). There was no trend toward decreased operative time with increased surgical experience (linear regression P=.453, negative binomial regression P=.998). Mean operative time was 301.1±53.1 minutes (range 205-440). Overall complication rate was not associated with number of robotic cases performed (P=.771). Nine cases (17.3%) were converted to laparotomy. Five of these occurred in the first 15 cases. There were 2 bladder injuries (3.8%) and no bowel injuries. CONCLUSIONS Although a learning curve was not demonstrated, the adoption of RSC into a urogynecology fellowship program yields similar rates of bladder/bowel injuries, postoperative complications, and operative times when compared with other published studies.

BACKGROUND To report a modified surgical technique for intrascleral intraocular lens (IOL) fixation with fewer anterior segment manipulations in eyes lacking sufficient capsular support. METHODS Eyes from 14 patients who underwent 27-gauge needle-guided intrascleral IOL fixation with built-in 8-0 absorbable sutures were studied. The 8-0 absorbable sutures were inserted into 27-gauge round needles and used to create sclerotomies at the 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions under the scleral flap. The sutures were used to tie knots at the end of each haptic and guide haptic externalization through the sclerotomy. After externalization, a sufficient flange was created at the end of each haptic and fixed under the scleral flaps. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), IOL tilt and decentration, previous surgery history, and complications were determined. RESULTS Fourteen cases were analyzed. The majority of eyes exhibited an improvement in the BCVA after surgery. When comparing the last follow-up to preoperative visual acuity, the mean change in BCVA was + 26.32 letters (p = 0.011). Postoperative complications included postoperative hypotony in 3 eyes, ocular hypertension in 2 eyes. No cases of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME), vitreous hemorrhage (VH), IOL dislocation, or endophthalmitis were observed. CONCLUSIONS The 27-gauge needle-guided intrascleral IOL fixation technique with built-in 8-0 absorbable sutures is easy to perform with fewer anterior chamber manipulations and achieves both anatomical and optical stability.

Objective@#To explore the possibility of using Lopinave/Litonawe (LPV/r) as treatment for novel coronavirus 2019-nCov pneumonia by systematically review earlier coronavirus studies.@*Methods@#Systematically retrieve relevant clinical studies from Chinese and English databases such as CNKI,VIP, Wangfang Data,CBM,PubMed, Web of Science,EMBASE. In addition, information from Chinese bio-medical journals, WHO, US CDC, Chinese CDC websites and the references from published relevant articles were retrieved. The inclusion period is from January 2003 to January 24, 2020. The criteria for inclusion are: (1) studies that aim to compare LPV/r and placebo/standard for SARS, MERS; (2) studies that include at least one clinical outcome; (3) studies with diagnosis criteria meeting WHO requirement on SARS or MERS; (4) data from multiple reports but originated from one study, where we extract information from all reports; (5) guidelines, includes: national or academic guidelines/experts &apos;consensus. The exclude criteria are: 1) only have abstracts but no full information; 2) in vitro studies. Two reviewers independently review articles and extract data on study design, patients, diagnosis criteria, regimen, and clinical outcomes (mortality, morbidity, quality of life, steroids dosage, chest image and adverse responses).@*Results@#Two hundred and thirty potential article were found by screening, and narrow down to forty-four articles for evaluation and finally four studies were included. The results of included studies indicate the early use of LPV/r regimen can reduce the mortality of SARS and MERS, and reduce steroids dosing.@*Conclusions@#ILPV/r can be used as a component of experimental regimen for treat 2019-nCoV pneumonia. It strongly suggests that initiating real world studies to explore the true clinical effects of LPV/r on 2019-nCoV patients.

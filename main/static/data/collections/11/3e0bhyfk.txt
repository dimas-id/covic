BACKGROUND: Several countries have imposed a mandatory 14-day period of quarantine on individuals arriving from countries considered high-risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection However, it is not clear how long asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be an asymptomatic carrier CASE PRESENTATION: We experienced a case of an asymptomatic female patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 with abnormal chest computed tomography findings She did not develop a fever during hospitalized isolation She remained reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-positive for 24 days CONCLUSION: An asymptomatic patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-positive for 24 days, although she was quarantined in an isolation hospital This finding suggests that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with abnormal chest computed tomography findings can be an asymptomatic carrier for more than 3 weeks

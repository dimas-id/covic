Witnessing its first case in late January 2020 India has seen a sharp rise in the number of positive cases of COVID-19. 34 States/UT (s) of the country have been found to be affected by the pandemic to date. We in this work, study the progress of COVID-19 pandemic in India. We aim to create transmission network visualization (s) of COVID-19 in India and perform analysis upon them. Using the transmission networks obtained we attempt to find the possible Super Spreader Individual (s) and Super Spreader Events (SSE) responsible for the outbreak in their respective regions. We discuss the potentials of network analysis in mitigating the further spread of the disease. This is one of the initial studies of the outbreak in India and the first attempt to study the pandemic in the country from a transmission network perspective.

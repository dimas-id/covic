Corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) has swept across our country and local governments have successively initiated first level response to public health emergencies. The outbreak of COVID-19 poses a huge challenge to the implementation of various clinical researches including oral diseases. In view of the specialty of oral diseases, it is particularly necessary to protect the health and rights of the participators and related practitioners, and to standardize the implementation of clinical trials. Based on the normative standards issued by the National Health Commission of China, consensus on clinical trial management formulated by the organization of clinical research, and regulations for the diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases during public health emergencies by Chinese Stomatological Association, we drafted the guideline for clinical research of oral diseases, with a view to provide reference for the clinical studies of oral diseases under the first level response to major public health emergencies.

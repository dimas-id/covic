Host cells possess the metabolic assets required for viral infection. Recent studies indicate that control of the host’s metabolic resources is a core host-pathogen interaction. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to usurp the host’s metabolic resources, funneling them towards the production of virion components as well as the organization of specialized compartments for replication, maturation, and dissemination. Consequently, hosts have developed a variety of metabolic countermeasures to sense and resist these viral changes. The complex interplay between virus and host over metabolic control has only just begun to be deconvoluted. However, it is clear that virally induced metabolic reprogramming can substantially impact infectious outcomes, highlighting the promise of targeting these processes for antiviral therapeutic development.

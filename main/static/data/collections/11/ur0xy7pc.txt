We thank Dr Al-Najar and colleagues for their letter(1). Our Research Letter(2) from work completed early April 2020 is intended to rapidly communicate our finding of 93% 28-day survival (95% CI, 92-95%) for a normal D-dimer on admission and 98% survival (95% CI, 96-99%) for a normal D-dimer two days later. Because we reported on 749 patients, those estimates had high precision. We chose death as a hard relevant outcome, rather than severity. 100% of patients had gold-standard PCR RNA positivity.

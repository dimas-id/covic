Massive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were conducted across a distributed computing network to study the folding, unfolding, misfolding and conformational plasticity of the high-efficiency frameshifting double mutant of the 26 nt potato leaf roll virus RNA pseudoknot. Our robust sampling, which included over 40 starting structures spanning the spectrum from the extended unfolded state to the native fold, yielded nearly 120 μs of cumulative sampling time. Conformational microstate transitions on the 1.0 ns to 10.0 μs timescales were observed, with post-equilibration sampling providing detailed representations of the conformational free energy landscape and the complex folding mechanism inherent to the pseudoknot motif. Herein, we identify and characterize two alternative native structures, three intermediate states, and numerous misfolded states, the latter of which have not previously been characterized via atomistic simulation techniques. While in line with previous thermodynamics-based models of a general RNA folding mechanism, our observations indicate that stem-strand-sequence-separation may serve as an alternative predictor of the order of stem formation during pseudoknot folding. Our results contradict a model of frameshifting based on structural rigidity and resistance to mechanical unfolding, and instead strongly support more recent studies in which conformational plasticity is identified as a determining factor in frameshifting efficiency.

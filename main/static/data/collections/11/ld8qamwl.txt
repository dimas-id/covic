The emergence of COVID-19 resulted in a sudden, unprecedented change in context that impacted the way behavior analysts live and work worldwide. Any rapidly shifting context requires behavioral flexibility, in addition to the acquisition of new skills and access to resources that foster resilience in the face of practical challenges and uncertainty about the future. Behavior analysts (particularly novice practitioners) may already be vulnerable to burnout (Plantiveau, Dounavi, & Viru√©s-Ortega, 2018) and in need of greater support to adopt protective self-care practices. Such practices will enable them to continue providing effective services to distressed families, while navigating their own challenges. This article seeks to offer behavior analysts some tools and practices drawn from the work of contextual behavior scientists that can promote well-being and resilience. This includes strategies for clarifying and committing to an overarching value of self-care, acting congruently with personal and professional values across many domains of living, and practicing self-compassion in the process.

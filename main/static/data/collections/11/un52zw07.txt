OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical manifestations of acute respiratory system infectious diseases and specific tests for causative agents in pediatric patients. METHODS: The authors evaluated children aged 0–16 y with clinical symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections who were administered rapid strep A test and/or throat culture test and/or respiratory viral panel test, from February 2012 through January 2013 at pediatric department of Acıbadem Maslak Hospital, Turkey. RESULTS: A total of 1654 patients were evaluated; 45.9 % were girls, 54.1 % were boys. Absence of cough and presence of headache were higher in the patients >6 y of age (p 0.0001, p 0.002 respectively). Positive respiratory viral panel test was higher in the patients <2 y of age (p 0.002). Both positive rapid strep A test and positive throat culture test were higher in the patients >6 y of age (p 0.0001). Positivity of rapid strep A or throat culture test were not observed in children <2 y of age. CONCLUSIONS: A clinician should mostly consider viral infections in the etiology of acute respiratory infections in children under 2 y of age and there is no need to rush for the use antibiotherapy. Bacterial etiology should be frequently considered after 6 y of age and rapid use of antibiotheraphy is essential to avoid the complications.

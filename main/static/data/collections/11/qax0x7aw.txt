Effective obturation of the bilateral maxillectomy defect is a difficult task for the maxillofacial prosthodontist. Multidisciplinary treatment planning is essential to achieve adequate retention and function for the prosthesis. This clinical report describes an original technique of engaging the inner aspect of the nasal aperture to augment anterior retention of a hollow obturator in a bilateral subtotal maxillectomy defect. This method is simple to execute, and may be used chairside for a surgical, interim, and/or definitive obturator.

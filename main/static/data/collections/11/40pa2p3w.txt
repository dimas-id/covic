Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a disease targeted for elimination of transmission (EOT) by 2030, however the likelihood of achieving it is unknown. We utilised modelling to study the impact of currently-available intervention methods on transmission across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - which accounts for [~] 70% of global burden - and highlight regions requiring intensified interventions. A model previously fitted to case data in DRC was used to predict cases and new infections under four future strategies in 168 health zones. The strategies comprise of medical interventions - active and passive screening (AS and PS) - and some include large-scale vector control (VC). In each health zone, we estimate the median year of EOT and the probability of EOT by 2030 under each and compute the least ambitious strategy predicted to achieve EOT by 2030. The model predicts 42 health zones are very likely to achieve EOT (> 90% probability) using medical-only strategies continued at mean coverage levels; this increases to 52 when AS coverage is increased to maximum previous coverage. In all VC strategies, health zones are predicted to meet EOT by 2030, although there are several where increasing low AS coverage could achieve this. This analysis provides a priority list for consideration for supplementary VC implementation (Bagata, Bandundu, Bolobo, Kikongo, Kwamouth and Masi Manimba in former Bandundu province) in conjunction with the recent AS coverage.

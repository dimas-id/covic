INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a recognised manifestation of immune-mediated neuropathies, but its causes and implications are unclear. This study aimed to explore the correlates of fatigue amongst a number of clinical parameters in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), in order to better understand potential contributing factors and resulting consequences. METHODS: Twenty-six clinically stable CIDP patients underwent assessments of motor and sensory function, disability, quality of life and depression and anxiety. Experienced fatigue was assessed using the Rasch-built fatigue severity scale and Checklist of Individual Strength. RESULTS: The two utilized fatigue scales showed significant inter-correlation. Only depression scores and grip strength predicted experienced fatigue levels in multivariate regression analyses. Fatigue scores inversely correlated with strength, sensory, disability and quality of life scores. DISCUSSION: Experienced fatigue is likely multifactorial in CIDP, with both physical and neuropsychiatric components. Fatigue is associated with lower functional and quality-of-life outcomes in CIDP.

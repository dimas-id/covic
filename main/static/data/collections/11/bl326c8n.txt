Abstract: As infectious diseases circle the globe, medical costs skyrocket and the waste stream continues to grow, it is imperative to look for medical textiles with improved protective performance, low costs, and minimized environmental impacts. Medical textiles include surgical gowns, gloves, drapes, facemasks, dresses, and linens, which could be disposable or reusable based on uses. The selection of reusable and disposable textiles is determined by many factors, such as cost, protective and comfort properties of the textiles, government regulations, and possibly social and psychological perceptions of both types of textile. This chapter intends to provide a broad view on both disposable and reusable textiles, as well as suggestions on improved protection against transmission of infectious diseases by textile materials.

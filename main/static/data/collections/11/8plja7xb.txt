OBJECTIVE In this study we aimed to compare renal functions in patients who underwent robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) with on-clamp and zero- ischemia techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2009 and 2015, 12 off-clamp and 22 on-clamp RPN procedures were performed on a total of 34 patients in two centers. The main outcome parameters examined were serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during preoperative, immediate postoperative periods, and at postoperative 3rd months. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between on-clamp and zero- ischemia groups regarding age, ASA score, BMI, PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores, operation time and tumor size (p>0.05). Significant differences were found in the duration of hospital stay (3.8±0.9 days vs. 3.0±0.9 days) and amount of blood loss (85.9±49.6 mL vs. 183.3±176.2 mL) between the on-clamp and zero-ischemia groups (p<0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between preoperative and immediate post-operative periods, in terms of eGFR and serum creatinine levels in both groups. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between preoperative and postoperative 3rd month periods, in the on-clamp group in terms of eGFR and serum creatinine levels. In the zero-ischemia group, the decrease in eGFR and serum creatinine levels at postoperative 3rd month relative to the preoperative period was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Off-clamp RPN technique is superior, in short-term outcomes involving renal functions, compared to on clamp approach. However, long- term data regarding the renal functions should be evaluated to arrive at a definitive decision.

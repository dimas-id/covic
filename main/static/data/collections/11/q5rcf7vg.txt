Abstract The nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most abundant protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). It has been shown to be multiphosphorylated. However, the phosphorylation sites are still unknown. In this study, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCâ€“MS/MS) to analyze the phosphorylation sites of N protein expressed in Sf9 cells. The results showed that N protein contains two phosphorylation sites. Since N protein can regulate IL-10, which may facilitate PRRSV replication, we constructed four plasmids (pCA-XH-GD, pCA-A105, pCA-A120 and pCA-A105-120) and transfected them into Pig alveolar macrophages (PAMs,3D4/2). The qPCR results showed that mutations at residues 105 and 120 were associated with down-regulation of the IL-10 mRNA level, potentially decreasing the viral growth ability. Then, we mutated the phosphorylation sites (S105A and S120A) and rescued three mutated viruses, namely, A105, A120 and A105-120. Compared with wild-type virus titers, the titers of the mutated viruses at 48 hpi were significantly decreased. The Nsp(non-structural protein) 9 qPCR results were consistent with the multistep growth kinetics results. The infected PAMs (primary PAMs) results were similar with Marc-145.The findings indicated that the mutations impaired the viral replication ability. The confocal microscopy results suggested that mutations to residues 105 and 120 did not affect N protein distribution. Whether the mutations affected other functions of N protein and what the underlying mechanisms are need further investigation. In conclusion, our results show that residues 105 and 120 are phosphorylation sites and are important for N protein function and for viral replication ability.

BACKGROUND: There have been outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in long term care facilities and recent reports of disproportionate death rates among the vulnerable population. The goal of this study was to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the non-institutionalized disabled population in the United States using data from the most affected states as of April 9th, 2020. METHODS: This was an ecological study of county-level factors associated with the infection and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the non-institutionalized disabled population. We analyzed data from 369 counties from the most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts) in the United States using data available by April 9th, 2020. The variables include changes in mobility reported by Google, race/ethnicity, median income, education level, health insurance, and disability information from the United States Census Bureau. Bivariate regression analysis adjusted for state and median income was used to analyze the association between death rate and infection rate. RESULTS: The independent sample t-test of two groups (group 1: Death rate≥ 3.4% [median] and group 2: Death rate < 3.4%) indicates that counties with a higher total population, a lower percentage of Black males and females, higher median income, higher education, and lower percentage of disabled population have a lower rate (< 3.4%) of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality (all p-values<4.3E-02). The results of the bivariate regression when controlled for median income and state show counties with a higher White disabled population (est: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.01–0.37; p-value:3.7E-02), and higher population with independent living difficulty (est: 0.15, 95% CI: −0.01–0.30; p-value: 6.0E-02) have a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality. Also, the regression analysis indicates that counties with higher White disabled population (est: −0.22, 95% CI: −0.43−(−0.02); p-value: 3.3E-02), higher population with hearing disability (est: −0.26, 95% CI: −0.42–(−0.11); p-value:1.2E-03), and higher population with disability in the 18–34 years age group (est: −0.25, 95% CI: −0.41–(−0.09); p-value:2.4E-03) show a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that while counties with a higher percentage of non-institutionalized disabled population, especially White disabled population, show a lower infection rate, they have a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality.

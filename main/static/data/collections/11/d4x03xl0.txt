Trauma is one of the leading worldwide causes of death at present and fatal trauma cases are the fourth highest cause of death in youths. As a consequence of improved emergency medical treatment, early death rates (48 h post injury) have been significantly reduced. However, death rates resulting from trauma-related complications have not diminished. The most common and dangerous complication that can develop post surgery/trauma is infection caused by opportunistic pathogens, which pose a significant challenge to the healing process ([1]). In addition to interference with the healing process and direct damage to infected tissues caused by the infecting organism, systemic complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute renal failure (ARF) can develop. These complications significantly exacerbate a patientâ€™s already deteriorating health and increase recovery times that correlate directly with increased mortality. Therefore, these infections are a major threat to trauma patients, early detection and control of respective infectious agents is essential in decreasing the rates of post trauma-associated morbidity and mortality.

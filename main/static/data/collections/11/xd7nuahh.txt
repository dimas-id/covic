Abstract Objective To analyze the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic renal failure complicated with novel coronavirus pneumonia, and to evaluate the effect of blood purification technology on the treatment and prognosis of such patients Methods Two COVID-19 cases undergoing hemodialysis with chronic renal failure were retrospectively analysed in our hospital. Results Two COVID-19 patients were admitted to hospital due to cough, with or without fever. Laboratory tests showed decreased lymphocyte count, elevated PCT, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-Î±, IL-2R, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, NT-proBNP, creatinine, and urea nitrogen. Chest CT scan showed multiple blurred plaques and patchy shadows in both patients. Two patients received continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) every other day for 4-6 hours everytime, in addition to the standard treatment. After CVVHDF, not only cytokines were reduced, but also liver function and cardiac function significantly improved. Both patients did not develop severe pneumonia. They were discharged on March 1, 2020 when meeting the discharge criteria. Conclusion Two COVID-19 patients on maintenance hemodialysis discharged after a month of hospitalization. The removal of cytokines through blood purification technology may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of acute respiratory failure that develops following several clinical disorders, including pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration and major trauma. Despite numerous clinical trials, there is still no effective pharmacotherapy available for ARDS patients. However, recent research on extracellular vesicles provides new insights into pathogenesis, prognosis, and potential therapeutic options for ARDS. Extracellular vesicles are membrane-bound anuclear structures which constitute a recently recognized and important intercellular communication mechanism, allowing targeted transfer of diverse biologic cargo between different cell types. There is new evidence that extracellular vesicles play an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and also potentially a protective role. In this chapter, we highlight recent translational and clinical studies that have advanced our understanding of the critical role extracellular vesicles play in both inducing and attenuating inflammatory lung injury in ARDS. This review also considers the wide range of potential clinical applications for extracellular vesicles, ranging from use as biomarkers of lung injury to therapeutic agents for ARDS. Extracellular vesicles represent a new frontier for research in ARDS.

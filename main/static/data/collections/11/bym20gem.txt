In the last few years autonomous vehicles have been on the rise. This increase in popularity lead by new technology advancements and availability to the regular consumer has put them in a position where safety must now be a top priority. With the objective of increasing the reliability and safety of these vehicles, fault detection and treatment modules for autonomous vehicles were developed for an existing multi-agent platform that coordinates them to perform high-level missions. Additionally, a fault injection tool was also developed to facilitate the study of said modules alongside a fault categorization system to help the treatment module select the best course of action. The results obtained show the potential of the developed work, with it being able to detect all the injected faults during the tests in a small enough time frame to be able to adequately treat these faults.

Many groups of plus-stranded RNA viruses produce additional, subgenomic mRNAs to regulate the expression of part of their genome. Arteriviruses and coronaviruses (order Nidovirales) are unique among plus-stranded RNA viruses for using a mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce a nested set of 5'- and 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs, which serve to express the viral structural protein genes. The discontinuous step presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis and joins noncontiguous sequences copied from the 3'- and 5'-proximal domains of the genomic template. Nidovirus genome amplification ("replication") and subgenomic mRNA synthesis ("transcription") are driven by 13 to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp's), generated by autocatalytic processing of two large "replicase" polyproteins. Previously, using a replicon system, the N-terminal nsp1 replicase subunit of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) was found to be dispensable for replication but crucial for transcription. Using reverse genetics, we have now addressed the role of nsp1 against the background of the complete EAV life cycle. Mutagenesis revealed that nsp1 is in fact a multifunctional regulatory protein. Its papain-like autoprotease domain releases nsp1 from the replicase polyproteins, a cleavage essential for viral RNA synthesis. Several mutations in the putative N-terminal zinc finger domain of nsp1 selectively abolished transcription, while replication was either not affected or even increased. Other nsp1 mutations did not significantly affect either replication or transcription but still dramatically reduced the production of infectious progeny. Thus, nsp1 is involved in at least three consecutive key processes in the EAV life cycle: replicase polyprotein processing, transcription, and virion biogenesis.

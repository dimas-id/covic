BACKGROUND Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) is a precursor lesion of pseudomyxoma peritonei, which, if treated suboptimally, may later disseminate throughout the abdominal cavity. We previously demonstrated the role of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to reduce the dissemination risk. Here we describe the feasibility and safety of minimal access cytoreductive surgery (MACRS) and HIPEC as an alternative to the open approach. METHODS We evaluated patients with LAMNs at risk of dissemination (known as LAMN II) who were referred to a national treatment centre between 2010 and 2012 and comparison is made between this group and patients undergoing open CRS and HIPEC for the same pathology over the same time period. RESULTS Of the 39 patients with LAMN II, 10 patients were treated by MACRS and HIPEC and 7 were treated by an open approach. Among the MACRS procedures, there were no conversions to open surgery; median procedure length, median length of stay, and complication rates were similar between groups and there were no 30-day deaths. After 3- and 11-months median follow-up respectively, no patients have evidence of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS The present series demonstrates that MACRS and HIPEC is a feasible and safe alternative to the open procedure with the advantage of smaller abdominal wounds and comparable morbidity and inpatient stay. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the impact on disease progression.

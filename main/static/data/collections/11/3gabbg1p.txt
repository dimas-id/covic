BACKGROUND Percutaneous endoscopic colostomy (PEC) is a technique derived from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. When conservative treatment of chronic obstipation fails, colon irrigation via PEC seems less invasive than surgical interventions. However, previous studies have noted high complication rates of PEC, mostly related to infections. Our aim was to report our experiences with PEC in patients with chronic refractory constipation. METHODS Retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent PEC for refractory constipation in our secondary referral hospital between 2009 and 2016. KEY RESULTS Twelve patients received a PEC for chronic, refractory constipation. Short-term efficacy for relief of constipation symptoms was good in 8 patients and moderate in 4 patients. Two patients had the PEC removed because of spontaneous improvement of constipation. Three patients, who initially noticed a positive effect, preferred an ileostomy over PEC after 1-5 years. One PEC was removed because of an abscess. Long-term efficacy is 50%: 6 patients still use their PEC after 3.3 years of follow-up. No mortality occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND INTERFERENCES PEC offers a technically easily feasible and safe treatment option for patients with chronic constipation not responding to conventional therapy. Long-term efficacy of PEC in our patients is 50%.

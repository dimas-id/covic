Antitumor necrosis factor Î± agents have dramatically changed the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, a significant proportion of patients does not respond or lose response over time. Hence, there is an urgent need for new molecules, with different mechanisms of action, and with a targeted and more effective approach. These new drugs include either small molecules or biological agents. We describe the three most promising classes of molecules in the field of IBD: anti-adhesion, anti-interleukin 12/23 and anti-Janus Kinases therapies.

A new dual current-mode controller produces a fast, accurate constant-power high-frequency ac output, with maximum current and voltage limits for an electrosurgical generator. The regulation of ac output power is achieved with near-deadbeat control, without measurement or feedback of the output voltage or current. Compared to existing technology, the prototype generator reduces unintended tissue damage by significantly improving regulation of output power, while reducing complexity and parts count.

The Covid-19 pandemic poses a grave health management challenge globally of unprecedented nature. Management of idiopathic Central Nervous system inflammatory disorders (iCNSID) such as Multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis optica and its spectrum disorders and related conditions during this pandemic needs to be addressed with affirmative and sustainable strategies in order to prevent disease related risks, medication related complications and possible COVID-19 disease associated effects. Global international iCNSIDs agencies and recent publications are attempting to address this but such guidance is not available in South East Asia. Here we outline prospectively qualitatively and quantitatively novel strategies at a tertiary center in Malaysia catering for neuroimmunological disorders despite modest resources during this pandemic. In this retrospective study with longitudinal follow-up, we describe stratification of patients for face to face versus virtual visits in the absence of formal teleneurology, stratification of patients for treatment according to disease activity, rescheduling, deferring initiation or extending treatment intervals of certain disease modifying therapies(DMT's) or immunosuppressants(IS), especially those producing lymphocyte depletion in MS and the continuation of IS in patients with NMO/NMOSD. Furthermore, we highlight the use off-label treatments such as Intravenous immunoglobulins/rituximab,bridging interferons/Teriflunomide temporarily replacing more potent DMT choices,supply challenges of IS/DMT'sand tailoring blood watches and neuroimaging surveillance based on the current health needs to stave off the pandemic and prevent at risk patients with iCNSID/health care workers from possibly being exposed to the COVID-19.

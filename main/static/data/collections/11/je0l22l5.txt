The recent global severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is changing the world we live in. As we learn about the virus and the pandemic, it is becoming evident that it is an age-associated problem that affects the human population. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. These are large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses. Our knowledge of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is extremely recent but is growing daily. There are currently no antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention. The long term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain but extrapolations can be made about the potential effects of the virus on cellular lifespan as well as on organismal healthspan. Here, we posit that severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 infection may, in the long-term, lead to accelerated aging phenotypes in survivors, not only in affected tissues but also in other organs, including the brain. Since some of the effects could manifest months or years after infection, it will be necessary to follow carefully people affected by coronavirus disease 2019. Keeping accurate registries may enable us to, in the future, establish connections with aging-associated disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

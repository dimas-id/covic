We describe a patient presenting with chest discomfort, anterolateral ST elevation, and developing acute cardiogenic shock secondary to SARS-COV-2infection-patient zero presenting to our institution's cardiac catheterization laboratory. The emergent presentation with limited clinical information led to exposure of personnel. The diagnosis was complicated by two negative tests for SARS-COV-2, and high-clinical suspicion from the patient's occupational history led to additional testing in order to confirm the diagnosis.

RATIONALE: Fast and easily transferable chromatography-mass spectrometry assays were required to detect and quantify the amount of Bitrex&#8482; and sodium saccharin in homemade facemask fit testing solutions. METHODS: Bitrex&#8482; solutions were analysed using reversed phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with positive ion electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS). Separation was achieved using a mobile phase gradient with an Acquity BEH C18 packed column. Sodium saccharin solutions were analysed using ultrahigh-performance supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with negative ion electrospray ionisation (UHPSFC/MS). Separation was achieved using isocratic elution with an Acquity UPC2 Torus Diol packed column and a methanol (25 mM ammonium acetate) co-solvent. RESULTS: The calibration curves obtained using the ratio of the active compound an internal standard generated linear regression values (R2 ) > 0.99. Samples analysed prior to and after an autoclave sterilisation process and bottling give repeatable measurements within 10% of the expected concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The two assays afford a fast robust and quantitative analytical method for the detection of the active components used to test the efficacy of the homemade facemask testing solutions.

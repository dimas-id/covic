Minimally invasive surgery is clearly dominating the modern surgical era across multiple surgical subspecialties and thoracic surgery is no exception. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is a well-established method of performing various interventions, and it continues to gain momentum. Though small differences in VATS methods exist, it is commonly accepted as a non-rib-spreading approach into the thoracic cavity via 2-4 incisions and allows for a wide range of anatomical and nonanatomical pulmonary resections. As more experience is gained with VATS, more complex surgeries take place and greater refinement of the technique occurs. A newer single-incision or uniportal VATS has been described to minimize surgical trauma, to decrease the number and size of thoracic incisions, to reduce the number of complications, and to enable faster recovery. It allows performing a full spectrum of thoracic operations through a single incision adhering to surgical and oncological principles without compromise.

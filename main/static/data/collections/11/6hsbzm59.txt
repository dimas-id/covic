While confirmed cases of infections of the deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have exceeded 4.7 million globally, scientists are pushing forward with efforts to develop vaccines and treatments in an attempt to slow the pandemic and lessen the disease’s damage. Although no proven effective therapies to treat COVID-19 patients or for managing their complications currently exist, the rapidly expanding knowledge regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 and its interplay with hosts provide a significant number of potential drug targets, and the potential to repurpose drugs already tested in other diseases. Herein we report the biological rationale of immuno-activating drugs and a brief summary of literature data on the potential therapeutic value of immune checkpoint inhibitors that have been recently tested beyond cancer treatment for their potential to restore cellular immuno-competence.

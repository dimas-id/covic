Highly sensitive, label-free biodetection methods have applications in both the fundamental research and healthcare diagnostics arenas. Therefore, the development of new transduction methods and the improvement of the existing methods will significantly impact these areas. A brief overview of the different types of biosensors and the critical parameters governing their performance will be given. Additionally, a more in-depth discussion of optical devices, surface functionalization methods to increase device specificity, and fluidic techniques to improve sample delivery will be reviewed.

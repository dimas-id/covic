Abstract This paper presents an approach for inserted end/face mill force and stability predictions using a reverse engineering approach. Structured light scanning is implemented to identify the spatial coordinates of the points that define the multiple insert cutting edges. These points are analyzed to extract the cutting edge radius and angle values, which are then incorporated in a time domain simulation that predicts cutting force and tool/workpiece deflection for user-selected operating parameters. Good agreement between predicted and measured cutting forces is first demonstrated. The process stability is then predicted using the validated force model and measured structural dynamics. Observations about the stability dependence on insert geometry are finally presented for a selected end mill.

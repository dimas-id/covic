Abstract Helicobacter pylori colonizes human stomach mucosa and its infection causes gastrointestinal diseases with variable severity. Bacterial infection stimulates autophagy, which is a part of innate immunity used to eliminate intracellular pathogens. Several intracellular bacteria have evolved multipronged strategies to circumvent this conserved system and thereby enhance their chance of intracellular survival. Nonetheless, studies on H. pylori have produced inconsistent results, showing either elevated or reduced clearance efficiency of intracellular bacteria through autophagy. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the mechanisms involved in autophagy induced by H. pylori and the fate of intracellular bacteria.

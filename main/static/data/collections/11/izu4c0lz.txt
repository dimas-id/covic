Medical radiation exposure is a significant concern for interventional cardiologists (IC). This study was aimed at estimating the radiation exposure of IC operators and assistants in real clinical practice. The radiation exposure of the operator and assistant was evaluated by conducting two types of procedures via coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on 1090 patients in 11-cardiovascular centers in Korea. Radiation exposure was measured using an electronic personal dosimeter (EPD). EPD were attached at 3 points on each participant: on the apron on the left anterior chest (A1), under the apron on the sternum (A2), and on the thyroid shield (T). Average radiation exposure (ARE) of operators at A1, A2, and T was 19.219 uSv, 4.398 uSv, and 16.949 uSv during CAG and 68.618 uSv, 15.213 uSv, and 51.197 uSv during PCI, respectively. ARE of assistants at A1, A2, and T was 4.941 uSv, 0.860 uSv, and 5.232 uSv during CAG and 20.517 uSv, 4.455 uSv, and 16.109 uSv during PCI, respectively. AED of operator was 3.4 times greater during PCI than during CAG.

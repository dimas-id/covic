Mass casualty respiratory failure will lead to many challenges, not the least of which is safe and secure management of the victims' airways. These patients will be sicker than those typically managed in the operating room and will require more emergency management of their airways. Mass casualty incidents involving biological or chemical agents will pose the additional risk of exposure to pathogen. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Toronto, airway manipulation was clearly identified as the procedure most associated with risk to health care workers. Planning for scenarios such as these will require consideration of personal protection for health care workers to minimize these risks. Understanding the risks involved and the airway techniques required for each possible scenario will be key to planning and preparation.

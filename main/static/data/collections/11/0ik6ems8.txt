Abstract The present study describes the development and validation of a one-step, single-tube, and real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) detecting Porcine Sapelovirus. RT-LAMP characterized by one strand displacement reaction with the specific stem-loop structure and Bst DNA polymerase could be finished in 60min under isothermal condition at 63°C. RT-LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity with 101 copies/μL than RT-PCR for the detection of Sapelovirus. The specificity of RT-LAMP assay was validated by the absence of any cross-reaction with other closely related virus in Picornaviridae group and other common virus causing porcine diarrhea. 7 positive Sapelovirus infection out of 63 fecal samples were identified using RT-LAMP, while 5 positive samples were determined by a conventional RT-PCR. A cost-effective method for Saplovirus detection with high sensitivity and specificity was developed and evaluated.

Skins symptoms during COVID‐19 have been recently described but their relation to SARS‐CoV‐2 is unclear while results for real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) testing were variable. Recalcati et al. reported 14 cases of patients with skin symptoms consistent with previous described COVID‐19 lesions but all the patients were tested negative. They asked for a serology to validate the hypothesis that these lesions are related to COVID‐19.

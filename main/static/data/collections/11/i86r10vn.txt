Real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the mainstay of Covid-19 diagnosis. False-negative RT-PCR results may hamper clinical management of patients and hinder the adoption of epidemiological measures to control the pandemic. The current study was aimed at assessing whether amplification of {beta}-glucoronidase (GUSB) gene would help estimate the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative results in upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens. URT specimens that tested negative by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR displayed higher GUSB RT-PCR cycle thresholds (CT) (P=0.070) than those testing positive (median, 30.7; range, 27.0-40.0, and median 29.7; range 25.5-36.8, respectively), this reflecting poorer cellularity. Receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis indicated that a CT threshold of 31.2 discriminated best between positive and negative SARS CoV-2 RT-PCRs (area under a curve, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P=0.08). This cut-off yielded a true negative ratio of 89% and accuracy of 70%. The data suggested that amplification of the GUSB gene by RT-PCR may help to appraise the accuracy of negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in patients in whom Covid-19 is eventually diagnosed.

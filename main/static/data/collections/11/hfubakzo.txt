The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been appreciated as a major regulator of blood pressure, but has more recently been recognized as a mechanism for modulating inflammation as well. While there has been concern in COVID-19 patients over the use of drugs that target this system, the RAS has not been explored fully as a druggable target. The abbreviated description of the RAS suggests that its dysregulation may be at the center of COVID-19.

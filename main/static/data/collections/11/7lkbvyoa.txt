AIM: To assess the impact of COVID-19-related lockdown in India on alcohol-dependent persons. METHOD: We examined the change in the incidence of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome presenting to hospitals in the city of Bangalore. RESULTS: A changepoint analysis of the time series data (between 01.01.20 to 11.04.20) showed an increase in the average number of cases from 4 to 8 per day (likelihood ratio test: &#967;2 = 72, df = 2, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: An unintended consequence of the lockdown was serious illness in some patients with alcohol use disorders.

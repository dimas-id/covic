Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an economically important pathogen that causes severe enteritis, vomiting, dehydration, and a high mortality rate, especially among suckling piglets. Here, we report the complete genome sequence (28,036 nucleotides [nt]) of a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain isolated in a novel outbreak in Shandong, China.

Background Recent pandemic of the Noval Coronal Virus (COVID 19) has claimed more than 200000 lives and about 3.8 million infected worldwide. Countries are being gradually exposed to its devastating threat without being properly prepared and with inadequate response. COVID 19 first two cases were reported in Pakistan on February 26, 2020. We present a model depicting progression of epidemiology curve for Pakistan with and without interventions in view of its health system response capacity in near future. Methodology We used a modified compartmental epidemiological SEIR model to describe the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan including the possibility of asymptomatic infection and presymptomatic transmission. The behavior of the dynamic model is determined by a set of clinical parameters and transmission rate. Results We estimated that in the absence of a set of proven interventions, the total susceptible population would be 43.24 million, exposed individuals would be almost 32 million, asymptomatic cases would be 13.13 million, mildly infected 30.64 million, severely infected slightly more than 6 million and critical cases would be around 967,000 in number. By that time, almost 760,000 fatalities of infected critical would have taken place. Comparing with the healthcare capacity of Pakistan, if we could flatten the curve to a level below the dashed grey line, the healthcare system will be capable of managing the cases with ideal healthcare facilities, where the grey line representing the healthcare capacity of Pakistan. With the intervention in place, the number of symptomatic infected individuals is expected to be almost 20 million. Conclusion We consider the impact of intervention and control measures on the spread of COVID-19 with 30% reduction in transmission from mild cases in case a set of interventions are judiciously in place to mitigate its impact.

The number of robotic surgical procedures for thoracic disease is increasing. The automatic linear stapler has become a necessary device in endoscopic surgery. A 67-year-old man with a history of smoking was referred to our hospital for an abnormal finding on chest x-ray. Computer tomography of the chest revealed a ground glass nodule in the right middle lobe. We performed right middle wedge resection through the assistant port using a long-shaft stapler (LSS). Because the nodule was diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma on the intraoperative frozen section, the patient underwent robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) right middle lobectomy using the da VinciÂ® Xi system. The pulmonary arteries, veins, right middle bronchus and minor fissure were divided using the LSS through the utility thoracotomy or assistant port. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. This case suggests that the LSS can be used in RATS lung resection for cancer.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to develop an in-house multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR), which can recognize HPIV1-4 in clinical samples. BACKGROUND Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) is one of the major causes of viral respiratory infections and can affect people at any age, especially infants and young children. METHODS Four sets of specific primers targeting conserved areas of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes of HPIV1-4, were designed and tested with type-related plasmid controls. Specificity and sensitivity of mPCR were tested. One-step mRT-PCR was set up using a viral panel containing 10 respiratory viruses, including HPIVs. One hundred nasopharyngeal samples of respiratory infection patients were tested using the set One-step mRT-PCR. RESULTS The specificity of set mPCR for HPIV1-4 using plasmid positive controls was proved and reaction sensitivity was measured. The specificity of set mRT-PCR was confirmed and 4 and 5 out of 100 clinical samples were HPIV1 and HPIV2 positive, respectively. CONCLUSION The developed one-step mRT-PCR in this study is an effective and specific assay for clinical diagnosis of HPIV1 to 4 (Tab. 1, Fig. 6, Ref. 28).

Abstract Animal models of malaria, mainly mice, have made a large contribution to our knowledge of hostâ€“pathogen interactions and immune responses, and to drug and vaccine design. Non-human primate (NHP) models for malaria are admittedly under-used, although they are probably closer models than mice for human malaria; in particular, NHP models allow the use of human pathogens (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi). NHPs, whether natural hosts or experimentally challenged with a simian Plasmodium, can also serve as robust pre-clinical models. Some simian parasites are closely related to a human counterpart, with which they may share a common ancestor, and display similar major features with the human infection and pathology. NHP models allow longitudinal studies, from the early events following sporozoite inoculation to the later events, including analysis of organs and tissues, particularly liver, spleen, brain and bone marrow. NHP models have one other significant advantage over mouse models: NHPs are our closest relatives and thus their biology is very similar to ours. Recently developed in vivo imaging tools have provided insight into malaria parasite infection and disease in mouse models. One advantage of these tools is that they limit the need for invasive procedures, such as tissue biopsies. Many such technologies are now available for NHP studies and provide new opportunities for elucidating host/parasite interactions. The aim of this review is to bring the malaria community up to date on what is currently possible and what soon will be, in terms of in vivo imaging in NHP models of malaria, to consider the pros and the cons of the various techniques, and to identify challenges.

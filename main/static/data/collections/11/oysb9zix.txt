Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Physicians in China reported what is believed to be the first adult case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with acute Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), followed by five adult Italian patients and another case in the United States of America. In the current report we present one of the first descriptions of an association of GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection within a child. In our facility, and eleven year old boy presented with typical features of GBS and after five days a morbilliform skin rash over the palms of both hands. Three weeks before the start of the neurological symptoms, the boy had experienced an episode of mild febrile illness with mild respiratory manifestations and a persisting cough. The diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by oropharyngeal swab on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The disease course of our patient strongly suggests a possible relationship between the development of GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The case is discussed in view of the previous case reports with the association of GBS and Covid-19.

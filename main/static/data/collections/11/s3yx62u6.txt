Unnecessary vaccination must be discouraged. Hypersensitivity reactions to vaccine components are real and must be guarded against. Residual virulence, although a concern tends to be more a hypothetical than a real problem. Progressive improvements in animal vaccines have significantly reduced the chances of adverse effects occurring, although some issues persist. One such example is injection-site sarcomas in cats. Another issue is the influence of animal size on the prevalence of adverse events in dogs.

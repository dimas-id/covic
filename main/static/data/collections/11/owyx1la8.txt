BACKGROUND The most commonly performed bariatric procedures are laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). There are major differences between LSG and LRYGB during postoperative period. Optimization of the postoperative care may be achieved by using enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, which allows earlier functional recovery. PURPOSE The aim was to assess differences in the course of postoperative care conducted in accordance with ERAS protocol among patients after LSG and LRYGB. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data concerning patients treated for morbid obesity were prospectively gathered in one academic center. Patients were divided into two groups: LSG (n = 364, 63.41%) and LRYGB (n = 210, 36.59%). Multiple factors were used as endpoints to determine the influence of the type of bariatric procedure on postoperative course. RESULTS The rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting and incidence of intravenous fluid administration during the operation was higher in LSG group. LRYGB patients were able to tolerate higher oral fluid intake volumes during the first and the second postoperative day. Mean diuresis during the second and the third postoperative day was significantly higher in LRYGB group. Administration of diuretics and painkillers was comparable between groups, while the risk of fever after the operation was higher in LRYGB group. Mean length of stay was higher in LSG group (LRYGB vs. LSG, 3.46 days ± 1.58 vs. 3.64 days ± 4.41, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS In our opinion, postoperative treatment after LSG requires more supervision and longer time until functional recovery is achieved.

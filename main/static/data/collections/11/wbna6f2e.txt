PURPOSE Nonspecific esophageal motility disorder (NEMD) is a vague category that includes patients with poorly defined contraction abnormalities observed during esophageal manometry. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach using long myotomy and fundopexy for NEMD. METHODS The VATS approach using myotomy and fundopexy was performed for 4 patients of NEMD between 2005 and 2008. A total of 4 patients with NEMD that underwent treatment at our institution were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The patients included 2 males and 2 females with a median age of 48 years (range 21-74 years). The median duration of NEMD symptoms was 58 months (range 4-108 months). Dysphagia was a primary symptom in all patients. Chest pain was a primary symptom in 3 of 4 patients (75 %). Treatment with medication was attempted before the operation. The median operative time was 344.5 min (range 210-476 min). The median time before starting oral feeding was 2.5 days (range 2-22 days). All patients achieved a significant improvement of their previous condition. CONCLUSIONS The VATS approach using myotomy and fundopexy for NEMD is a good treatment in cases resistant to medication and balloon dilation.

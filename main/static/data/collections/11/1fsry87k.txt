Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy has developed into a viable option for the treatment of benign and malignant colorectal diseases with the innovation of new access devices, instrumentation, and surgical techniques. Although cosmesis has been highly touted as the most apparent advantage of the approach, the single-incision platform also affords the potential for enhanced recovery, early hospital discharge, and reduction in postoperative wound complications. Despite increasing evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic colectomy, wide-ranging adaptation has been tempered in part as a result of the technical demands of the approach. We aim to describe our surgical pearls for overcoming various pitfalls and technical challenges experienced during single-incision laparoscopic colectomy to facilitate successful application of this technique.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between body temperature and obesity. We aimed to assess the associations between body temperature and several adiposity and metabolic markers according to gender and menopausal status in a large population-based sample. METHODS The data collected between 2009 and 2012 from 4224 participants (mean age 57.3 ± 10.4 years, 2225 women) of the CoLaus study (Lausanne, Switzerland). Body temperature was measured at the tympanic membrane. RESULTS Mean body temperature was 36.1 ± 0.4, 36.4 ± 0.4 and 36.3 ± 0.4 °C in men, premenopausal, and postmenopausal women, respectively (p < 0.001). In men and postmenopausal women, body temperature was positively and significantly (p < 0.05) associated with body mass index (Spearman correlation coefficients 0.157 and 0.083, respectively), waist (r = 0.163 and r = 0.104), waist to hip ratio (r = 0.187 and r = 0.132), body area (r = 0.094 and r = 0.085), resting heart rate (r = 0.227 and r = 182), glucose (r = 0.104 and r = 0.088) and insulin (r = 0.148 and r = 0.117). Except for body area and BMI in postmenopausal women, all associations remained significant after multivariable adjustment. In premenopausal women, body temperature was positively associated with resting heart rate (r = 0.140) and insulin (r = 0.170), and no significant associations were found after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSION Body temperature is strongly associated with obesity markers in men and postmenopausal women. The absence of association in premenopausal women might be due to the influence of the menstrual cycle.

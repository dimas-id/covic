An emergence of a novel coronavirus, causative agent of COVID19, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred due to cross-species transmission. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses able to infect a great number of hosts. Entrance of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the surface (S) protein interaction with host ACE2 protein and cleavage by TMPRSS2. ACE2 could be a species-specific barrier that interferes with bat-to-human coronavirus cross-species transmission. Molecular analysis supported bats as natural hosts for SARS-CoV and involved them in MERS-CoV origin. The genomic similarity between bat RaTG13 CoV strain and SARS-CoV-2 implicates bats in the origin of the new outbreak. Additionally, there is a hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission based on contact with Malayan pangolins by humans in Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China. To investigate bats and pangolin as hosts in SARS-CoV-2 cross-species transmission, we perform an evolutionary analysis combining viral and host phylogenies and divergence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 amino acid sequences between CoV hosts. Phylogeny showed SARS-like-CoV-2 strains that infected pangolin and bats are close to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast to TMPRSS2, pangolin ACE2 amino acid sequence has low evolutionary divergence compared with humans and is more divergent from bats. Comparing SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 origins, pangolin has yet lower ACE2 evolutionary divergence with humans than civetâ€”the main intermediary host of SARS-CoV. Thus, pangolin has become an opportune host to intermediates bat-to-human SARS-CoV-2 jump and entry.

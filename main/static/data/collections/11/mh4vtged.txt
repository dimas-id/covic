Oral cavity cancer is one of the most common preventable cancers in the world. The burden of the disease is high in South Asia. Therefore, public health strategies such as creating awareness and disease screening should be advocated for its prevention and early detection. Mouth self-examination serves both the purposes. It is easy to perform, non-invasive, and low-cost methods. It not only helps in the early detection of suspicious oral lesions but also helps people to quit their high-risk behaviors such as consumption of tobacco and alcohol.

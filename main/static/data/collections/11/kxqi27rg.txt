Otolaryngology residency training programs are facing a novel challenge due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The widespread impact and chronicity of this pandemic makes it unique from any crisis faced by our training programs to date. This international medical crisis has the potential to significantly alter the course of training for our current resident cohort. The decrease in clinical opportunities due to the limitations on elective surgical cases and office visits as well as potential resident redeployment could lead to a decline in overall experience as well as key indicator cases. It is important that we closely monitor the impact of this pandemic on resident education and ensure the implementation of alternative learning strategies while maintaining an emphasis on safety and well-being.

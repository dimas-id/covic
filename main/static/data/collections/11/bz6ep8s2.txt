BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endosaccular flow disruption is a recognized treatment options for treating both unruptured and ruptured aneurysms. The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 ± 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 ± 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 ± 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 ± 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up. CONCLUSION The Contour is a promising new aneurysm occlusion device. Further studies with longer term follow-up are required to determine the efficacy of this novel device.

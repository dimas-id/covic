The molecular technique of RNA fingerprinting was used to characterize the genomes of 5 isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV): 2 viral pairs from the same animal, BVD-ILN/BVD-ILC and BVD-TGAN/BVD-TGAC, and the cytopathic viral prototype, BVD-NADL. Oligonucleotide patterns from the viruses were compared, and unique and overlapping oligonucleotides were identified. A comparison of the fingerprints indicated that the genome of each virus was distinguishable by the T1 RNase oligonucleotide fingerprinting technique. The greatest similarity observed was between oligonucleotides from BVD-ILC and BVD-ILN. Eighteen large oligonucleotides were conserved in all 5 BVDV isolates studied. We found that within a pair of BVDV, the cytopathic fingerprint was different from the noncytopathic fingerprint, indicating that cytopathic and noncytopathic BVDV may be distinct viruses.

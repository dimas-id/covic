ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is responsible of significant economic losses for poultry industry around the world, through evolution of its pathogenicity, inadequacy of vaccines, and virus evasion. Such evasion is related to the unstable nature of its RNA, in particular the S glycoprotein encoding gene, which raises great challenges with regard to the control of the disease, along with the lack of proof reading mechanisms of the RNA polymerase. The emergence of new variants might be a reason for the endemic outbreaks that are being reported in Tunisia, in addition to poor vaccination techniques and ineffective prophylactic programs. In the present study, partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 glycoprotein gene and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of 2 Tunisian isolates, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16, identified in 2016, were determined. Specific mutations were found in S1 gene as well as in 3′UTR region. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 nucleotide sequences showed that both isolates are closely related to the Algerian strains, and formed a common cluster within the genotype I. In addition, these isolates were non-recombinant ones, confirming that they are unique variants. Based on their S1 gene sequences, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16 strains were distant from the H120 vaccine strain, commercially used in Tunisia along with the variant vaccine 793B type (4/91). A comparison between nucleotide sequences of their 3′UTR region and S1 gene showed a difference in IBV classification. The obtained results have confirmed that the IBVsequence continues to drift and brings valuable information in relation with its evolution, vaccine development and better control of the disease.

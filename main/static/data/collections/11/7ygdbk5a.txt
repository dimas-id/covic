Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), which is transmitted by Bemisia tabaci in a persistent-circulative manner, threatens tomato production worldwide. Little is known about the complicated interaction during this process at the molecular level. In this study, viral AAPs at 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 48 h were investigated using a comparative transcriptome analysis to uncover the transcriptional responses of whiteflies to virus infection. Our results have shown that 755, 587, 1140 and 1347 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the comparisons of the data of 0 h vs. 2 h, 0 h vs. 6 h, 0 h vs. 12 h and 0 h vs. 48 h, respectively. KEGG analysis showed that DEGs associated with metabolisms and signal transduction were down-regulated in virus-infected whiteflies. Additionally, 16 up-regulated putative transporter genes and 10 down-regulated genes associated with IL-17 signaling pathway were identified by time-associated gene cluster analysis. These data boost our comprehensions on whitefly-TYLCV interactions associated with different viral AAPs.

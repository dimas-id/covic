AIM We assessed feasibility of the transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) procedure and quality of life postoperatively. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 28 patients with rectal lesions were treated using TAMIS at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust. Outcome measures included feasibility of excision, negative margin (R0) resection rate, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality, and postoperative quality of life associated with anal incontinence. Results; TAMIS was feasible in 90% of cases. R0 resection was 82%. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.5 days. Six (21%) patients experienced acute urinary retention postoperatively. One (4%) patient was re-admitted with rectal bleeding. One patient experienced a perforation. Mortality was 0%. Postoperative quality of life indicated low severity of symptoms of anal incontinence. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that TAMIS is a feasible option in the treatment of rectal tumours and does not impair quality of life postoperatively.

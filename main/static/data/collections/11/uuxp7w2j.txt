BACKGROUND The World Health Organization has identified the rapidly growing prevalence of obesity as one of today's serious health problems. Various surgical interventions categorized collectively as bariatric surgery now play an ever-increasing important role as the only known effective treatment for severe obesity. Laparoscopic gastric bypass is currently the most frequent bariatric surgical procedure performed. However, the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) is rapidly gaining in popularity as a minimally invasive surgical option with anticipated similarly efficacious outcomes. Gastric band erosion following LAGB is an uncommon yet potentially serious complication unique to this form of weight loss surgery. METHODS Case report and literature review. RESULTS We report a case of a pyogenic liver abscess related to a LAGB procedure. Apropos to this case, we review the presumed pathophysiologic mechanism of this particular infectious process, and discuss this and other complications associated with LAGB operations. CONCLUSIONS As LAGB bariatric procedures become more popular, clinicians need to be aware of uncommon, but potentially serious complications unique to this form of weight loss surgery.

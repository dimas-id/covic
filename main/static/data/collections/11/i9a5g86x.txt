BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence about characteristics that may increase the risk of Covid-19 mortality, but they are highly correlated. METHODS: An ecological analysis was used to estimate associations between these variables and age-standardised Covid-19 mortality rates at the local authority level. RESULTS: Ethnicity, population density and overweight/obesity were all found to have strong independent associations with Covid-19 mortality, at the local authority level. DISCUSSION: This analysis provides some preliminary evidence about which variables are independently associated with Covid-19 mortality and suggests that others (deprivation and pollution) are not directly linked. It highlights the importance of multivariate analyses to understand the factors that increase vulnerability to Covid-19.

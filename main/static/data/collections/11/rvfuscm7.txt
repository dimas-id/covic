INTRODUCTION TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is vital for the induction of antiviral innate immune responses. Both RNA and DNA viral infection induces TBK1 activation, triggers phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and subsequent expression of type I interferons (IFNs; IFN-α/β). Type I IFNs can induce the expression of numerous antiviral genes called interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to build a remarkable antiviral state and limit viral replication. Thus, optimal TBK1 activity is crucial for IRF3-induced type I IFNs expression and ISGs-mediated viral elimination. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the diverse roles of TBK1 in antiviral innate immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of TBK1 activity and the implication in antiviral development. Expert opinion: TBK1 is a key kinase against antiviral infection via inducing type I IFNs expression. Multiple types of post-translational modifications of TBK1 tightly regulate TBK1 activity and subsequent TBK1-dependent antiviral responses. The identified regulators of TBK1 unveil regulatory mechanisms of host antiviral innate immunity and immuno-escape mechanism of virus provide strategies to control viral diseases by modulating TBK1 activity.

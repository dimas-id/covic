Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging enteropathogenic swine coronavirus causing acute diarrhea and vomiting in pigs. The apoptosis of ST cells induced by PDCoV infection was studied in this research. In ST cells, caspase activity assay showed that the activity of caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9 increased significantly with the infection of PDCoV, but not observed in UV irradiated PDCoV-infected cells, indicating that PDCoV infection activated both endogenous and exogenous apoptotic pathways in ST cells, and the induction of apoptosis depended on viral replication. To further investigate the endogenous apoptosis induced by PDCoV, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factors in cytoplasm and mitochondria were detected. Compared with normal cells, the amount of cytochrome C released from mitochondria to cytoplasm increased significantly in PDCoV-infected cells, and the release increased with the prolongation of infection, while the apoptosis-inducing factor was always localized to mitochondria, suggesting that PDCoV induced apoptosis was initiated through caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by promoting cytochrome C in the mitochondrial membrane gap into the cytosol. In conclusion, this study reveals the mechanism of PDCoV inducing apoptosis.

In this survey of infectious diseases consultants, 90% reported that their health care facilities have plans in place to address severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Some plan elements exceed current recommendations, whereas others are less stringent. Resource issues associated with airborne isolation and respirators were reported. Sixty-one percent of the respondents expressed some concern about their facility's preparation and capacity for managing patients with SARS. Recent draft guidance on SARS preparedness from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may help address some of these issues.

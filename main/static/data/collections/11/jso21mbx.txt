Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a globally emerging and re‐emerging enteric coronavirus in pigs causing serious economic threats to the world swine industry. Since the re‐emergence of massive PEDV outbreaks in South Korea in 2013−2014, domestic pig farms have continued to experience PED epidemics or endemics. This study represents the molecular characterization of PEDV isolates identified in diarrhoeic animals collected across the country in 2017. Initial sequencing analysis of the full‐length S genes revealed that 70% of the 2017 isolates (7/10) belong to the G2b subgroup, while the remaining isolates were classified as G1b. The data indicated that both variant G1b and global epidemic G2b strains were responsible for current PED outbreaks in South Korea. The 2017 G1b and G2b isolates shared 98.7%–99.4% and 98.1%–99.2% amino acid sequence identity at the S gene level and 99.3% and 99.0%–99.6% nucleotide sequence homology at the genome level compared to the corresponding Korean prototype G1b and G2b strains, respectively. In an interesting manner, one G2b‐like KNU‐1705 strain was found to possess a large 39‐nucleotide deletion in the ORF1a region theoretically encoding nonstructural protein 3. Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire genome and spike protein sequences indicated that the 2017 isolates were most closely related to other global G1b or G2b strains but formed different branches within the same genogroup. These results indicate that PEDVs undergo continuous evolution in the field. In addition, one 2017 PEDV strain, KOR/KNU‐1705/2017, was successfully isolated and propagated in Vero cells. The antisera raised against the Korean prototype 2014 G2b strain efficiently neutralized KNU‐1705 virus infection, suggesting antigenic homology between the 2014 and 2017 PEDV strains. Our data advance the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and antigenicity of PEDV circulating in South Korea.

Abstract A yearly revaccination of adult pets against distemper, the adenoviral and parvoviral diseases is scientifically unwarranted, professionally obsolete and ethically questionable; other vaccinal antigens, however, may need yearly or even more frequent injections. Base immunisation is redefined: it is complete only after the multivalent booster in the second year of life. A yearly revaccination interview, not necessarily an injection, should become the new standard. This interview is a professional service that must be taught, expertly performed and invoiced. Adult animals should be “vaccinated to measure”, taking age, breed, lifestyle, the epidemiologic situation, etc. into account. Post-vaccination serology should become a guide in revaccination decisions. For a solid herd immunity, more animals of the population must be vaccinated. The profession should issue regular updates of the ‘code of vaccination practice’. To counteract vaccination antagonism, a concerted action of academia, the veterinary profession and industry is required.

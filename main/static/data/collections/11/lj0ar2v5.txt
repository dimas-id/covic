Multiple pathogens have been detected in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) brains. A bioinformatics approach was used to assess relationships between pathogens and AD genes (GWAS), the AD hippocampal transcriptome and plaque or tangle proteins. Host/pathogen interactomes (C.albicans, C.Neoformans, Bornavirus, B.Burgdorferri, cytomegalovirus, Ebola virus, HSV-1, HERV-W, HIV-1, Epstein-Barr, hepatitis C, influenza, C.Pneumoniae, P.Gingivalis, H.Pylori, T.Gondii, T.Cruzi) significantly overlap with misregulated AD hippocampal genes, with plaque and tangle proteins and, except Bornavirus, Ebola and HERV-W, with AD genes. Upregulated AD hippocampal genes match those upregulated by multiple bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa in immunocompetent blood cells. AD genes are enriched in bone marrow and immune locations and in GWAS datasets reflecting pathogen diversity, suggesting selection for pathogen resistance. The age of AD patients implies resistance to infections afflicting the younger. APOE4 protects against malaria and hepatitis C, and immune/inflammatory gain of function applies to APOE4, CR1, TREM2 and presenilin variants. 30/78 AD genes are expressed in the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is disrupted by AD risk factors (ageing, alcohol, aluminium, concussion, cerebral hypoperfusion, diabetes, homocysteine, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, obesity, pesticides, pollution, physical inactivity, sleep disruption and smoking). The BBB and AD benefit from statins, NSAIDs, oestrogen, melatonin and the Mediterranean diet. Polymicrobial involvement is supported by the upregulation of pathogen sensors/defenders (bacterial, fungal, viral) in the AD brain, blood or CSF. Cerebral pathogen invasion permitted by BBB inadequacy, activating a hyper-efficient immune/inflammatory system, betaamyloid and other antimicrobial defence may be responsible for AD which may respond to antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral therapy.

SUMMARY 1. Resource utilization was quantified for six mayfly (Ephemeroptera) and one caddis (Trichoptera) species comprising a lotic scraper/collector‚Äêgatherer guild across three niche dimensions (temporal, trophic and spatial). Based on trophic differences and inferred microspatial utilization, the members of this guild separated into two groups: (1) cryptic detritivores and (2) exposed algivores. 2. Each species demonstrated a slow seasonal univoltine life cycle except for Epeorus longimanus (Eaton) and Baetis iricaudatus (Dodds) which were fast seasonal univoltine and multivoltine, respectively. 3. Temporal sequencing of periods of peak resource utilization were not demonstrated by the members of this guild. A null analysis indicated that periods of peak resource utilization were aggregated.

Microbial cleaning takes advantage of naturally occurring microbes to remove a wide variety of contaminants from various surfaces. The method is based on the affinity of microbes for hydrocarbons which are digested, producing harmless carbon dioxide, water and soluble fatty acids. The microbes are nonpathogenic and are safe to handle and dispose. The process is environmentally friendly and is less expensive than solvent cleaning, but it is not applicable to high precision cleaning applications. Typical applications include parts washing; oil and grease removal from concrete and other floor surfaces, and from drains and grease traps; cleaning and disinfection in healthcare facilities; cleaning of historical artworks and structures; and household and institutional cleaning applications.

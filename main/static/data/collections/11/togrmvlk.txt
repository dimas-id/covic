The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced numerous challenges for Health Care Professionals including exposing Emergency Department (ED) staff to the SARS-CoV-2 virus during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Recent guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) prioritize early intubation with viral filter placement to minimize hospital staff exposure. We propose a novel technique for rapid outdoor non-compression intubation (RONCI) of cardiac arrest patients while en route from the ambulance bay to the resuscitation bay to further decrease the risk of viral aerosolization.

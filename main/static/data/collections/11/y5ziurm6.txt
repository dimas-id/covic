BACKGROUND AND AIMS Liver involvement is common in COVID-19. Elevated aspartate and alanine amino transaminase (AST/ALT) and borderline increase in serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are the commonest findings. Patients with associated co morbid conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, malignancy, hypertension and old age are prone to develop severe disease. Limited data is available in patients with COVID-19 and metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).The aim of this review is to analyse the effect of MAFLD on severity of COVID-19. METHODS We systematically searched the PubMed database till May 20, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on COVID-19 and fatty liver/MAFLD/NAFLD. RESULTS Limited studies done had shown four to six fold high risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with MAFLD. Patients with MAFLD and associated obesity, severe fibrosis and age <60 yrs are more prone to develop severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION MAFLD is associated with 4-6 fold increase in severity of COVID-19 compared to non MAFLD patients. Physician and hepatologist should follow these patients cautiously and preventive measures to be taken strictly in these high risk patients.

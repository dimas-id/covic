PURPOSE To describe the effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) on renal arteries immediately after the procedure and at follow-up. CASE REPORT A 52-year-old woman with severe resistant hypertension underwent RDN. A transient spasm occurred in the left renal artery immediately after radiofrequency energy delivery, with subsequent complete resolution without any additional therapy. At 6-month follow-up, the blood pressure increased, and imaging revealed a tight stenosis in the left renal artery, which was successfully treated with a stent. In the next days, there was an immediate significant blood pressure reduction. CONCLUSION Renal denervation can be complicated by local tissue injury at the ablation sites that could be a possible trigger of late arterial disease.

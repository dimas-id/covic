Abstract Single point incremental forming (SPIF) is a sheet material forming process recognized for its potential performance in low to medium volume production due to precluding the need for high-investment stamping dies. This process forms blanks instead through the use of local deformations, traditionally imposed utilizing a hemispherically-shaped tool. The dieless nature of this process makes it ideal at low volumes; however, several drawbacks of the process currently inhibit its widespread use in industry, including difficult-to-predict springback and poor surface finish. Another perceived drawback of SPIF is overall low formability. Conventional toolpaths form the blank through a series of successive passes in which the tool is generally constrained to the XY plane. Here a novel toolpath is proposed and tested experimentally and through simulation to determine its viability of improving formability. The toolpath investigated travels radially through the center of the workpiece, rather than along its periphery, in order to generate a more uniform thickness profile. A formability improvement of 21% was found utilizing this strategy.

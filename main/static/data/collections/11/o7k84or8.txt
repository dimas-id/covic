Rotaviruses are the main agents responsible for diarrhea in different animal species and for infantile gastroenteritis. These viruses have been isolated from various avian species and have often been associated with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome. Nevertheless, the knowledge of rotavirus infection in turkeys is scarce. Six group A rotavirus strains obtained from pooled enteric contents of diarrheic turkeys were isolated in MA-104 cell culture and typed as G(6)P(1), a typical bovine rotavirus genotype. Additionally, the electropherotypes showed a migration pattern identical to the Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, and the complete NSP4 gene phylogeny showed that all six strains segregated in the genotype E2. Taken together, these results point toward a cattle-to-turkey rotavirus transmission. As a conclusion, bovine-origin rotavirus can be found in turkeys, and this transmission route must now be considered for the improvement of the health status in turkey farms.

COVID-19 is a pandemic disease which predominantly affects the respiratory system, however it also causes multi-organ dysfunction in a subset of patients. There is a growing evidence that it increases the propensity of strokes in younger patients. Besides producing a prothrombotic state, arterial dissection could be one of its many manifestations, increasing the risks of stroke. Herein, we report the first case of spontaneous bilateral vertebral artery dissection in a patient with COVID-19. 39-year female presented with spontaneous bilateral vertebral artery dissections without any instigating traumatic events and no history of connective tissue disorders. Whether this patient's vertebral artery dissections were triggered by exaggerated inflammatory response or arteriopathy secondary to COVID-19 remains speculative. Nonetheless, arterial dissection could be one of it's complications. It is important for the physicians to be aware of different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 as we manage these patients with no historical experience, to provide adequate care.

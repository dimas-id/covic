We need current information to support effective practice. This information can be accessed relatively quickly and inexpensively, using nothing more than a computer and an Internet connection. This demands skills in searching and accessing that information. In many hospitals, computers with an Internet connection are readily available in the clinical wards, allowing those with skills in retrieving medical information to find that information near the bedside where it is needed. This report describes techniques to access information on the Internet from various sources. This information exists at high levels, such as PubMed, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and the Cochrane Library. However, there is also much information available on the Internet that has not been validated or subjected to peer review. Thus, it is important not only to find information but also to separate useful from useless information.

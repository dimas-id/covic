The small conducting airways consist of the membranous bronchioles and the respiratory bronchioles. Bronchiolitis is a generic term for inflammatory and fibrotic injuries of these small airways. The histology of normal bronchioles is discussed in detail in Chapter 2. A brief review is warranted here before discussing the histopathologic patterns associated with small airway injury.

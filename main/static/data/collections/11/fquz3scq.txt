Lung inflammation features in asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis (CF) and others. Whilst in asthma anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids are generally effective, certain individuals are steroid resistant and in COPD, ARDS and CF, as well as disease exacerbations caused by infection, there seems little benefit. We summarise recent advances in p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) biology and document beneficial and possibly detrimental effects in respect of lung inflammation.

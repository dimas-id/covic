The 3â€²-portion of the genome of a U.S. isolate of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus, ATCC VR-2332, was cloned and sequenced. The resultant 3358 nucleotides contain 6 open reading frames (ORFs) with homologies to ORFs 2 through 7 of the European strain of the PRRS virus and other members of the free-standing genus of arteriviruses. Both VR-2332 and the European isolate (called the Lelystad virus) have been identified as infectious agents responsible for the swine disease called PRRS. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that there are degrees of amino acid identity to the Lelystad virus open reading frames ranging from 55% in ORF 5 to 79% in ORF 6. Hydropathy profiles indicate that the ORFs of VR-2332 and Lelystad virus correspond structurally despite significant sequence differences. These results are consistent with the biological similarities but distinct serological properties of North American and European isolates of the virus.

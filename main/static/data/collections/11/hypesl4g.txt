PURPOSE To examine the long-term outcomes of bare metal stent placement for exclusion of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. METHODS From 2006 to 2011, 7 consecutive symptomatic patients (4 men; mean age 52 years) with surgically inaccessible extracranial ICA aneurysms were treated with a bare stent at a single center. Patients received clopidogrel for 3 months after the procedure and aspirin for life. Clinical follow-up with duplex ultrasound and/or computed tomographic angiography was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful; no neurological complications occurred. After 6 months, there was complete thrombosis of the aneurysm in all except one case. In this asymptomatic patient, the residual active flow was successfully obliterated by additional coil embolization. Over a mean follow-up of 57 Â± 22 months, all patients were alive and free of local or central neurological symptoms. All stents were patent, and thrombosis of the aneurysms was complete. CONCLUSION In this small series, treatment of extracranial ICA aneurysms with a bare stent seems technically feasible and safe. All treated extracranial ICA aneurysms were excluded by primary intervention or secondary coil embolization.

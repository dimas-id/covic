INTRODUCTION Acute patellar tendon rupture is easy to diagnose but is still often overlooked. The aim of this study was to assess early and late results of surgical treatment of acute patellar tendon rupture. Our hypothesis was that functional outcome is satisfactory. METHODS A retrospective study included 38 knees in 37 patients (4 female, 33 male). Mean age was 42.6 ± 9.9 years (range, 23-81 years). Lesions comprised 15 tendon body ruptures, 20 avulsions from the tip of the patella and 3 avulsions from the anterior tibial tuberosity. Tendon repair was protected in more than 95% of cases by a reinforcement frame: hamstring (21 cases), synthetic ligament (12 cases) or metallic wire (3 cases). Results were evaluated in 2 steps: on patient files at a mean follow-up of 7.1 months (range, 3-24 months) to assess complications and early functional and radiological results; and by phone at a mean follow-up of 9.3 years (range, 19-229 months) in order to assess long-term functional outcome on Lysholm score and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Thirty-one knees were assessed at a mean 7.1 months. Mean knee flexion was 128.5° ± 7.5° (range, 85°-150°), extension -1° (range, -15° to 0°) and Caton-Deschamps index 0.96 (range, 0.57-1.29). Twenty-three knees were further assessed at a mean 9.3 years. Mean Lysholm score was 93.7 points (range, 61-100). Ninety-six percent of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the result. All had returned to their previous job, and 20 had returned to sports activities, including 8 at pretrauma level. CONCLUSION Patellar tendon rupture has good prognosis if diagnosis and surgical treatment is early.

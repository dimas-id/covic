INTRODUCTION We previously demonstrated the advantages of a short-type flexible endoscope as a working scope in laparoscopic surgery through single-incision procedures in animal experiments. In this report, we examined the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery through a single incision using a flexible endoscope in a clinical setting. Specifically, we performed cholecystectomy using single-incision multiport laparoendoscopic (SIMPLE) surgery. METHODS Thirteen patients with cholecystolithiasis or gallbladder polyp underwent SIMPLE cholecystectomy using a newly developed short-type flexible endoscope with a working length of 60 cm. Twenty-seven patients underwent standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a 5-mm rigid laparoscope. We retrospectively compared the surgical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS SIMPLE cholecystectomy using the short-type flexible endoscope was successfully carried out. No gallbladder perforation occurred, but perforation occurred in four cases in the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Although no other surgical outcomes differed between the two groups, the flexible endoscope had several advantages over the standard laparoscope. The scope provided a flexible view of the operating field. The gallbladder dissection using the cutting device via the scope was easier and safer than that in standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The water-jet, suctioning, and self-cleaning lens functions of the scope served the surgery well. CONCLUSIONS SIMPLE cholecystectomy using a short-type flexible endoscope has surgical outcomes equivalent to those of standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but this endoscope with multiple functions may make the surgical procedures less stressful and safer.

A general procedure for the preparation of 1,2,3-triazole analogs of nucleosides from diethyl 2-azidoethoxymethyl- and 2-azidoethoxyethylphosphonates was elaborated. The application of microwave irradiation shortened the reaction time to 10 min in comparison to ca. 48 h when 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions were performed under standard conditions. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for inhibitory activity against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds were antivirally active at subtoxic concentrations. Compound 17k exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on the proliferation of human T-lymphocyte cells (IC50=64 ÂµM for CEM).

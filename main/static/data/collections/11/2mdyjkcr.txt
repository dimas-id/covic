Neutralization antibodies and vaccines for treating COVID-19 are desperately needed. For precise development of antibodies and vaccines, the key is to understand which part of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is highly immunogenic on a systematic way. We generate a linear epitope landscape of Spike protein by analyzing serum IgG response of 1,051 COVID-19 patients with a peptide microarray. We reveal two regions that rich of linear epitopes, i.e., CTD and a region close to the S2' cleavage site and fusion peptide. Unexpectedly, we find RBD is lack of linear epitope. Besides 3 moderate immunogenic peptides from RBD, 16 highly immunogenic peptides from other regions of Spike protein are determined. These peptides could serve as the base for precise development of antibodies and vaccines for COVID-19 on a systematic level.

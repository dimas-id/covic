In recent years, radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been increasingly used for treating hepatic hemangiomas attributing to its unique advantages, such as minimal invasiveness, definite efficacy, high safety, fast recovery, and wide applicability. However, complications related to RF ablation had been frequently reported, especially while being used for treating huge hemangioma (â‰¥10 cm). Cautious measures had been taken to prevent the incidence of ablation-induced complications, but still unexpected complications occurred. Herein we reported a case of severe myocardial dysfunction along with systemic inflammatory response syndrome occurring immediately post RF ablation of a 10.7 cm hemangioma. This serious complication was effectively managed by supportive care with the full recovery in a short period of time.

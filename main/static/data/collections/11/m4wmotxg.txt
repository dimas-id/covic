Physically intimate, real-time monitoring of human biomarkers is becoming increasingly important to modern medicine and patient wellness. Such monitoring is possible due to advances in soft and flexible materials, devices and bioelectronics systems. Compared to other flexible platforms, multi-filament textile fibers or threads offer superior flexibility, material diversity, and simple ambient processing to realize a wide range of flexible devices such as sensors, electronics, and microfluidics. In this paper, we realize unique flexible transistors on threads and interconnect them to realize logic gates and small-scale integrated circuits. Compared to prior textile-based transistors, the proposed thread-based transistors (TBTs) are realized with a readily shaped, colloidally dispersed gel consisting of silica nanoparticles and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI TFSI) ionic liquid for all-around electrolyte gating of a carbon nanotube (CNT) semiconducting network assembled on the thread. We interconnect TBTs with thread-based electrochemical sensors (TBEs) to realize an all-thread based multiplexed diagnostic device. All-thread based platforms are thin, super flexible and conformal, allowing them to be worn directly on the skin without any polymeric substrate, or sutured transdermally using a needle.

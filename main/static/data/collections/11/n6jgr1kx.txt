According to what was published by the WHO (World Health Organization), a first case of acute respiratory infection, of unknown origin, appeared in the province of HUBEI, CHINA, in the city of WUHAN, (December 2019). After having ruled out other etiological agents, the isolation of a new coronavirus (7-01-2020) was achieved, which was called new coronavirus (nCOV, COVID-19), currently named SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses, being important pathogens, can infect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and nervous systems of humans and birds, livestock, bats, mice, and other wild animals. Since the outbreaks of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2002 and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012, the transmission of these viruses between humans and animals has been demonstrated.

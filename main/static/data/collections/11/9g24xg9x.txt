High Ct-values falling in the grey zone are frequently encountered in SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and have brought urgent challenges in diagnosis of samples with low viral load. Based on the single-stranded DNA reporter trans-cleavage activity by Cas12a upon target DNA recognition, we create a Specific Enhancer for detection of PCR-amplified Nucleic Acids (SENA) to confirm SARS-CoV-2 detection through specifically targeting its rRT-PCR amplicons. SENA is highly sensitive, with its limit of detection being at least 2 copies/reaction lower than that of the corresponding rRT-PCR, and highly specific, which identifies both false-negative and false-positive cases in clinic applications. SENA provides effective confirmation for nucleic acid amplification-based molecular diagnosis, and may immediately eliminate the uncertainty problems of rRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 clinic detection.

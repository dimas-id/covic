PURPOSE Intra-corporeal esophagojejunostomy (EJ) using a linear stapler creates a stapler entry hole that requires secure closure during the totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) procedure for gastric cancer. Since a standard method has not been established yet, the feasibility of using V-loc 180 (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) suture material was evaluated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS During January 2012 to March 2015, 25 patients who underwent linear stapling EJ and V-loc 180 closure of remaining enterotomy were included in this study. Basic clinico-pathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and short-term complications were analyzed. RESULTS The mean patient age was 60.4 ± 8.5 years. Nineteen males and six females were included in this study. The mean body mass index was 25.3 ± 2.3 kg/m2. There were 22 stage-I, 2 stage-II, and 1 stage-III gastric cancer patients. The mean operation time was 240.5 ± 44.6 min, and the time for anastomosis was 38.8 ± 11.2 min. The procedures were successfully performed in all cases without any intra-operative complications. There was one case of EJ leakage that occurred at the corner of EJ staple line and not at the enterotomy closure site. CONCLUSIONS The closure of the remaining enterotomy site using V-loc 180 suture following linear stapler EJ is technically feasible and safe during the TLTG procedure. However, further experience and results from other surgeons are necessary to generalize this procedure.

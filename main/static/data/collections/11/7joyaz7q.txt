Background The outbreak of SARS CoV-2 has caused ever-increasing attention and public panic all over the world. Currently, there is no specific treatment against the SARS CoV-2. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. Previous studies found that indomethacin has the ability to inhibit the replication of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV. Methods SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus-infected African green monkey kidney VERO E6 cells treated with different concentrations of indomethacin or aspirin at 48 hours post infection (p.i). The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity. Anti-coronavirus efficacy in vivo was confirmed by evaluating the time of recovery in canine coronavirus (CCV) infected dogs treated orally with 1mg/kg body weight indomethacin. Results We found that indomethacin has a directly and potently antiviral activity against the SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus (reduce relative light unit to zero). In CCV-infected dogs, recovery occurred significantly sooner with symptomatic treatment + oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments than with symptomatic treatment + ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments (P =0.0031), but was not significantly different from that with symptomatic treatment + anti-canine coronavirus serum + canine hemoglobin + canine blood immunoglobulin + interferon treatments (P =0.7784). Conclusion The results identify indomethacin as a potent inhibitor of SARS CoV-2.

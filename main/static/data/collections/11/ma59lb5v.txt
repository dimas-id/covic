According to the polyvagal theory, quarantine and social distancing following COVID-19 pandemic may dampen nucleus ambiguuus (NA) activity in the brainstem and hinder homeostatic cardiorespiratory functioning, emotional self-regulation and health. In addition, enduring quarantine may foster heightened implicit vigilance for social threat, emotional dysregulation, poor sleep and immune response, potentially increasing the chance of infections. Promoting activities aimed at increasing NA functioning, like self-compassion, may support emotional self-regulation, adequate immune response and health.

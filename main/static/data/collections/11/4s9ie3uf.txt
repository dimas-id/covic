Interventional pulmonology (IP) remains a rapidly expanding and evolving subspecialty focused on the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases of the thorax. As the field continues to push the leading edge of medical technology, new procedures allow for novel minimally invasive approaches to old diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and metastatic or primary lung malignancy. In addition to technologic advances, IP has matured into a defined subspecialty, requiring formal training necessary to perform the advanced procedures. This need for advanced training has led to the need for standardization of training and the institution of a subspecialty board examination. In this review, we will discuss the dynamic field of IP as well as novel technologies being investigated or employed in the treatment of thoracic disease.

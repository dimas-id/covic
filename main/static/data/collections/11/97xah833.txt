Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of hematological malignancies with considerably variable prognoses and curable only with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Few studies comparing MDS HCT outcomes between sibling and umbilical cord blood (UCB) donors exist. Using the University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) database, we retrospectively analyzed HCT outcomes among 89 MDS patients undergoing either sibling or double UCB HCT in 2000â€“2013. We observed similar survival, relapse and non-relapse mortality between sibling and UCB donor sources. Relapse was increased in those with monosomal karyotype (P=0.04) and with reduced intensity conditioning (P<0.01). In summary, our data highlight similar MDS HCT outcomes regardless of donor source and support the use of UCB as an alternative donor when a sibling is unavailable.

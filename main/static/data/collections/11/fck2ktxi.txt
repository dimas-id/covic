Methyl-2-arylidene hydrazine-carbodithioate has not been of particular interest to researchers even though its metal complexes are extensively reported on due to their biological activity. This study examined the cytostatic and antiviral activity of twelve methyl-2-arylidene hydrazinecarbodithioates reported by many researchers as intermediates for the synthesis of thiosemicarbazides and the preparation of their metal complexes. Compounds IIc, IIi, and IIl with tridentate ligand features were found to have the lowest IC(50) value (6.5 μM, ≈ 1 μM, and 0.8 μM, respectively) against HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. They were also most inhibitory to human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast proliferation (5.3 μM, 17 μM, and 2.6 μM). Compound IIc and IIl show antiviral activity against wild-type herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and acyclovirresistant HSV; however, these activities were observed at concentrations at which the compounds also markedly inhibit HL60 and HEL cell proliferation.

Abstract: Chloroquines are the long-established prescription drug, which are often used clinically to treat malaria and connective tissue diseases. Since December 2019, corona virus disease 2019 ï¼COVID-19ï¼ outbreaks caused by 2019 novel coronavirus ï¼2019-nCoVï¼ has occurred in China and many countries around the world. Due to the lack of drugs against COVID-19, the disease spreads rapidly and the mortality rate is relatively high. Therefore, specific drugs against 2019-nCoV need to be quickly screened. The antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate which has already been approved is confirmed to have an anti-2019-nCoV effect and has been included in diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. However, awareness of the risk of chloroquine phosphate causing acute poisoning or even death should be strengthened. The current dosage recommended in clinical treatment is larger than that in previous treatment of malaria and the period of treatment is longer. Many provinces have required close clinical monitoring of adverse reactions. This paper reviews the pharmacological effects, poisoning and toxicological mechanisms, in vivo metabolism and distribution, and forensic issues of chloroquine drugs, in order to provide help to forensic practice and clinical work.

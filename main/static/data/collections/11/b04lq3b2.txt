Hospital emergency department preparedness for mass-casualty incidents involving nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) threats relies on close cooperation between hospital and pre-hospital emergency staff. It is essential that the hospital is immediately secured from unauthorized intrusion in order to avoid contamination of the hospital area and staff. The strategy of the pre-hospital emergency staff to avoid the unnecessary spread of contaminated material involves thorough decontamination of exposed persons near the site of the incident and coordinated transport to the primary care hospitals after decontamination. However, uncoordinated access of contaminated victims requires emergency decontamination by hospital staff. Thus, hospital staff must be prepared to provide in-hospital decontamination. Coordinated admission of contaminated patients into the NBC primary care hospital relies on a thorough decontamination by pre-hospital emergency staff at a decontamination site installed outside the hospital. Screening of patients is performed by hospital staff with special expertise in emergency medicine. Following admission, each patient is assigned to a team of specialists. Pre-hospital patient documentation is switched to inhospital documentation after admission using machine-readable electronic admission numbers.

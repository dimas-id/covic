Abstract Ten young dogs were experimentally infected twice with different isolates of bovine rotavirus and 2 uninfected dogs were kept in contact with them. None of the animals developed diarrhoea, but all of them excreted rotavirus in their faeces over a period of up to 10 days after each inoculation, as shown by counterimmunoelectro-osmophoresis and virus isolation. Dogs may thus play a role in the epizootiology of rotavirus diarrhoea in calves. Seroconversion occurred in 6 of the 10 infected dogs but in neither of the 2 contact controls.

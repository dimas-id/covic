With the domestic and international spread of the COVID-19, much attention has been given to estimating pandemic risk. We propose the use of a novel application of a well-established scientific approach, network analysis, to provide a direct visualisation (the infographics in Figures 1 and 2) of the COVID-19 pandemic risk. By showing visually the degree of connectedness between different regions based on reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, we demonstrate that network analysis provides a relatively simple yet powerful way to estimate the pandemic risk.

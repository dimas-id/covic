PURPOSE Single-port laparoscopic surgery as an alternative to traditional laparoscopic technique is anticipated to be beneficial in the early postoperative course. We describe restorative restproctectomy as single-port surgery through the ostomy site in a three-stage procedure for refractory ulcerative colitis 12 weeks after laparoscopic subtotal colectomy. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After release of the terminal ileostomy, creating the ileal J pouch extra-abdominally, a single-port device was placed. Through this, the rectal stump was mobilized and extracorporeally closed. The ileal pouch anal anastomosis was created using circular double-stapling technique. The single-port device was removed, and the loop ileostomy was placed at the same site. RESULTS We employed this technique in a 54 year-old patient who had suffered from ulcerative colitis. No postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS Restorative restproctectomy as single-port surgery through the ostomy site is safe and feasible. No additional incision is necessary. The trauma of conventional laparoscopic access can be further reduced.

BACKGROUND: Literature indicates that cardiovascular disease (CVD, including stroke), older age, and availability of healthcare resources impact COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). The cumulative effect of COVID-19 CFR in global CVD populations and the extrapolated impact on access to healthcare services in the CVD population in Canada are not fully known. This study explored the relationships of factors that may impact COVID-19 CFR and estimated the potential indirect impact of COVID-19 on Canadian healthcare resources. METHODS: Country-level epidemiological data were analyzed to study the correlation, main effect, and interaction between COVID-19 CFR and: a) proportion of the population with CVD, b) proportion of the population ≥ 65 years, and c) availability of essential health services as defined by the World Health Organization Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index. For indirect implications on healthcare resources, estimates of the volume of postponed coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and valve surgeries in Ontario were calculated. RESULTS: Positive correlations were found between COVID-19 CFR and a) proportion of the population with CVD (ρ=0.40, p=0.001), b) proportion of the population ≥ 65 years (ρ=0.43, p=0.0005) and c) UHC index (ρ=0.27, p=0.03). For every 1% increase in proportion of the population ≥ 65 years or proportion of the population with CVD, COVID-19 CFR was 9% and 19% higher, respectively. Approximately 1,252 procedures would be postponed monthly in Ontario due to current public health measures. CONCLUSIONS: Countries with more prevalent CVD reported higher COVID-19 CFR. Strain on healthcare resources is likely in Canada.

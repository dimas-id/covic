Importin-&#945; adaptor proteins orchestrate dynamic nuclear transport processes involved in cellular homeostasis. Here, we show that importin-&#945;3, one of the main NF-&#954;B transporters, is the most abundantly expressed classical nuclear transport factor in the mammalian respiratory tract. Importin-&#945;3 promoter activity is regulated by TNF-&#945;-induced NF-&#954;B in a concentration-dependent manner. High-level TNF-&#945;-inducing highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (HPAIVs) isolated from fatal human cases harboring human-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627K, 701N) significantly downregulate importin-&#945;3 mRNA expression in primary lung cells. Importin-&#945;3 depletion is restored upon back-mutating the HPAIV polymerase into an avian-type signature (PB2 627E, 701D) that can no longer induce high TNF-&#945; levels. Importin-&#945;3-deficient mice show reduced NF-&#954;B-activated antiviral gene expression and increased influenza lethality. Thus, importin-&#945;3 plays a key role in antiviral immunity against influenza. Lifting the bottleneck in importin-&#945;3 availability in the lung might provide a new strategy to combat respiratory virus infections.

Zika is an arbovirus infection mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. In 2016, the burden of Zika epidemic in Brazil was significant. Patients affected by Zika virus can develop Guillain-Barré syndrome, evolving to muscle respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In this setting, delayed recovery of the muscle weakness can result in prolonged weaning, a condition that by itself is related to a high mortality rate. The study is reporting a case of a patient with Zika and Guillain-Barré syndrome who underwent an inspiratory muscle training program starting after twenty-five days of mechanical ventilation and guided by serial measurements of the timed inspiratory effort (TIE) index. The patient was successfully weaned in two weeks and discharged from the hospital 30 days after extubation.

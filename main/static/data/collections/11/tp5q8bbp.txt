A recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 1100000 (April 5, 2020) individuals worldwide and is spreading rapidly. The virus is reported to be derived from bats and the infection was first reported in China. Similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, it is responsible for respiratory tract infection. Real time polymerase chain reaction and radiography are the two main diagnostic methods. Guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization (WHO) should be followed for diagnostic and precautionary measures. Treatment of the infection is still not available; however, antivirals are under clinical trials.

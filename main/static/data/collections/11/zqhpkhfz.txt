The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus spread quickly worldwide in 2009. Since most of the fatal cases were reported in developing countries, rapid and accurate diagnosis methods that are usable in poorly equipped laboratories are necessary. In this study, a mobile detection system for the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus was developed using a reverse‐transcriptase loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (RT‐LAMP) kit with a disposable pocket‐warmer as a heating device (designated as pwRT‐LAMP). The pwRT‐LAMP can detect as few as 100 copies of the virus—which is nearly as sensitive as real‐time reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR)—and does not cross‐react with RNA of seasonal influenza viruses. To evaluate the usefulness of the pwRT‐LAMP system, nasal swab samples were collected from 56 patients with flu‐like symptoms and were tested. Real‐time RT‐PCR confirmed that the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus was present in 27 of the 56 samples. Of these 27 positive samples, QuickVue Influenza A + B immunochromatography detected the virus in only 11 samples (11/27; 40.7%), whereas the pwRT‐LAMP system detected the virus in 26 of the 56 samples (26/27 of the positive samples; 96.3%). These findings indicate that the mobile pwRT‐LAMP system is an accurate diagnostic system for the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus, and has great potential utility in diagnosing future influenza pandemics.

BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressed liver transplant (LT) patients are considered to be at high risk for any kind of infection. What the outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) means for the transplant cohort is a question that, as of now, cannot easily be answered. Data on prevalence, relevance of the novel virus and clinical course of the infection in stable LT patients are limited. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were performed in our outpatient department during the shutdown between March and April 2020 in Germany. RESULTS: The prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 was 3%. Three out of a cohort of 101 LT‐patients were asymptomatic for respiratory diseases. Respiratory complaints were common and not associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The overall monthly mortality rate was 0,22% and did not show alterations during the shutdown in Germany. CONCLUSIONS: If preventive measures are applied, LT‐patients do not seem to be at a higher risk for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Telemedicine in the outpatient setting may help to maintain distance and to reduce direct patient contact. However, standard of care must be guaranteed for patients with relevant comorbidities in spite of pandemics, because complications may arise from preexisting conditions.

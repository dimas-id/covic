INTRODUCTION The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) is a novel device for the treatment of wide-necked intracranial bifurcation aneurysms. The present series demonstrates our 'real-world experience' in the use of all iterations of WEB devices (available in Europe) in ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. METHODS We analyzed our all-inclusive cerebrovascular database for patients treated with the WEB device between October 2010 and May 2015. Anatomic and clinical results are reported for all patients. RESULTS One hundred and eight patients with 114 intracranial aneurysms were included in the series. Forty-seven aneurysms (41.2%) were ruptured. Eighty-six patients received angiographic and clinical follow-up after a mean of 13.4 months. One hundred and ten of 114 WEB devices (96.5%) were deployed successfully. Thromboembolic complications occurred in 11 of 110 interventions (10.0%), with a new permanent deficit in one patient. Re-rupture after WEB treatment was detected in two aneurysms (4.3%), which had both initially presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiographic follow-up revealed adequate occlusion in 68 of 90 aneurysms (75.6%). Fifteen aneurysms required retreatment. CONCLUSIONS This series confirms a high level of safety and efficacy of the WEB device for the treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms.

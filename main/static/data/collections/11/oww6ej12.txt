Abstract Aptamers, are being increasingly employed as favorable receptors for constructing highly sensitive biosensors, for their remarkable affinities towards certain targets including a wide scope of biological or chemical substances, and their superiority over other biologic receptors. The selectivity and affinity of the aptamers have been integrated with the wise design of the assay, applying suitable modifications, such as nanomaterials on the electrode surface, employing oligonucleotide-specific amplification strategies or, their combinations. After successful performance of the electrochemical aptasensors for biomedical applications, the food sector with its direct implication for human health, which demands rapid and sensitive and economic analytical solutions for determination of health threatening contaminants in all stages of production process, is the next field of research for developing efficient electrochemical aptasensors. The aim of this review is to categorize and introduce food hazards and summarize the recent electrochemical aptasensors that have been developed to address these contaminants.

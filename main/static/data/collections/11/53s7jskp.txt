There is increasing interest in the conceptualization of Self-Regulated learning (SRL) as a dynamic process which unfolds over the course of a learning activity. This is partly because this conceptualization could potentially be operationalized and used as the basis for AI and analytics tools which monitor and scaffold SRL in real-time. However, while there is an abundance of research on theories of SRL, little research explicitly reviews and operationalizes such theoretical considerations. Work is needed to develop frameworks for the practical applications of fundamental SRL theories, helping researchers move from conceptual considerations to operationalization in real world settings. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for investigating SRL in the context of online tutoring for upper primary school learners. SRL is interpreted as a social learning construct, and the framework proposed is designed to investigate the influence of tutor practices on the development of learnersâ€™ SRL. We present the results of a pilot study that explored the applicability of the framework.

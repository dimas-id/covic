This study describes the pathology and clinical information on 20 placentas whose mother tested positive for the novel Coronovirus (2019-nCoV) cases. Ten of the 20 cases showed some evidence of fetal vascular malperfusion or fetal vascular thrombosis. The significance of these findings is unclear and needs further study.

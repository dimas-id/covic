BACKGROUND The use of synthetic meshes on infected incisional hernias often fails and is therefore contraindicated. Biological meshes offer a novel solution. Among them, Permacol requires a bibliographic analysis of its efficacy and tolerance. DESIGN A bibliographic analysis was carried out on the efficacy and tolerance of Permacol in parietal and general surgery. RESULTS A total of 22 publications described the use of Permacol in digestive surgery. The advantages of Permacol would be usability in contaminated surgical fields, biocompatibility, no erosion of intestinal wall, and less risk of adhesions. The main drawback of Permacol is its high cost. CONCLUSION Even so, Permacol can play an important part in the short-term management of complex or contaminated abdominal wall defects. The lack of long-term studies and the high cost of the implant call for a medical cost-effectiveness assessment to determine the indications for Permacol in parietal and general surgery.

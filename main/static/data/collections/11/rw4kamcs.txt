BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for the treatment of obesity in ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong. METHODS Seventy consecutive Chinese patients (49 females; mean age 34.7+/-8.8 [range 18-56] years) received LSG for the treatment of obesity from May 2006 to Nov 2007 as a stand-alone procedure for weight reduction. Mean baseline body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) were 108.9+/-22.1 kg (range 71.0-164.9 kg) and 40.7+/-7.8 kg/m(2) (range 27.4-68.4 kg/m(2)), respectively. Outcome measures were collected and assessed in a prospective manner. RESULTS All procedures were performed laparoscopically with no conversion. There was neither mortality nor any postoperative complications that required reoperation. Major complication occurred in two patients (2.9%; esophagogastric junction [EGJ] leak and stomach tube stricture). Mean follow-up was 7.1+/-5.0 months. Mean procedure time was 90.6+/-39.4 min, and mean hospital stay was 3.8+/-2.3 days. Mean BMI loss was 6.3+/-2.5, 9.0+/-3.4 and 12.3+/-4.5 kg/m(2) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Mean percent of excess BW loss was 48.5+/-28.4, 69.7+/-31.7, and 63.5+/-29.4 at 3, 6, and 12 months. CONCLUSION LSG is safe and effective in achieving significant weight loss in obese ethnic Chinese patients.

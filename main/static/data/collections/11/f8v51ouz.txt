The association between hypertension, diabetes, cardio and cerebrovascular disease and severe and fatal COVID-19, described in different countries, is remarkable. Myocardial damage and myocardial dysfunction are postulated as a possible causal nexus. Frequent findings of elevated troponin levels and electrocardiographic anomalies support this concept. On the other hand, hypotheses in favour and against a deleterious effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, a usual treatment for cardiovascular disease, have been raised. There is currently no solid evidence and thus properly designed studies on this subject are urgently needed. In this context, patients with cardiovascular disease should especially avoid being exposed to the virus, should not self-medicate and rapidly seek medical advice should they show symptoms of infection.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic creates a need to protect health care workers (HCWs) from patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures which may transmit the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Existing personal containment devices (PCDs) may protect HCWs from respiratory droplets but not from potentially dangerous respiratory-generated aerosols. We describe a new PCD and its aerosol containment capabilities. The device ships flat and folds into a chamber. With its torso drape and protective arm sleeves mounted, it provides contact, droplet, and aerosol isolation during intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Significantly improved ergonomics, single-use workflow, and ease of removal distinguish this device from previously published designs.

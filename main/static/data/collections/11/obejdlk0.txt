We aimed to assess the efficacy of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and rectus sheath (RS) block in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery. Few studies have addressed the efficacy and safety associated with TAP block and RS block for laparoscopic surgery. Thirty-two patients underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery, either with TAP and RS block (Block(+) group, n = 18) or without peripheral nerve block (Block(-) group, n = 14). Preoperatively, TAP and RS block were performed through ultrasound guidance. We evaluated postoperative pain control and patient outcomes. The mean postoperative hospital stays were 1.56 days (Block+ group) and 2.07 days (Block(-) group; range, 1-3 days in both groups; P = 0.0038). A total of 11 patients and 1 patient underwent day surgery in the Block(+) and Block(-) groups, respectively (P = 0.0012). Good postoperative pain control was more commonly observed in the Block(+) group than in the Block(-) group (P = 0.011). TAP and RS block was effective in reducing postoperative pain and was associated with a fast recovery in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery.

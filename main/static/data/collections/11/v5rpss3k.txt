Medical science relies on classification systems in order to understand the nature of morbidity, and a number of classifications systems are utilized in healthcare. Epidemiologists, medical practitioners, and healthcare administrators must be able to place health conditions into appropriate categories for a variety of reasons. Most existing classification systems were established to facilitate the diagnostic process but have subsequently come to be used for administrative, planning, and fiscal management purposes. Chapter 10.1007/978-1-4939-3423-2_3 provides an overview of the ways in which morbidity data can be categorized, the ways different parties view and utilize the data, and the various official classification systems that are used in health care and other arenas.

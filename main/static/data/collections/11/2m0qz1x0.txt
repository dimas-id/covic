OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of long term (>2 years) leflunomide treatment on radiographic progression in patients with RA. METHODS Patients treated with leflunomide for >2 years in one of three phase III trials and subsequent extensions, for whom paired, evaluable radiographs at baseline and study end point were available, were included. Radiographs of hands and feet were assessed according to the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scoring method, for erosion, joint space narrowing, and total score. Changes from baseline were assessed, and a predicted yearly progression rate estimated for each patient. RESULTS 128 of the original 824 patients were included, with mean disease duration 5.1 years and mean leflunomide treatment duration 4.3 years until the final x ray examination. The mean change from baseline in total score was 8.6 with yearly adjusted rate 1.9, and the median change was 2 with yearly adjusted rate 0.5, compared with 7.9 and 4.9, respectively, before leflunomide treatment. After treatment, the rate improved in 92/128 (72%) patients and deteriorated in 21/128 (16%). In 42 (33%) patients who had a total score >0 at baseline, no radiographic progression occurred after leflunomide treatment. CONCLUSIONS In a subset of patients who continued treatment long term, leflunomide treatment reduced the rate of radiographic damage.

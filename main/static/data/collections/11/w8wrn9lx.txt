AIM: There is a critical need for effective therapies that are immediately available to control the spread of COVID-19 disease. MATERIAL & METHODS: Gamunex(®)-C and Flebogamma(®) DIF (Grifols) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products were tested using ELISA techniques for antibodies against several antigens of human common betacoronaviruses that may crossreact with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. RESULTS: Both IVIGs showed consistent reactivity to components of the tested viruses. Positive crossreactivity was seen in SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. For SARS-CoV-2, positive reactivity was observed at IVIG concentrations ranging from 100 μg/ml with Gamunex-C to 1 mg/ml with Flebogamma 5% DIF. CONCLUSION: Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF contain antibodies reacting against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Studies to confirm the utility of IVIG preparations for COVID-19 management may be warranted.

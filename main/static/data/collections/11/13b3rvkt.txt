The current pandemic of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread worldwide. Pandemic preparedness has been an ongoing project in Iceland since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003-2004. In mid-January 2020, The Directorate of Health (DOH) and The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management (DCPEM) revised the current pandemic preparedness response plan. The DOH and DCPEM, in close collaboration with the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Internal Medicine Services at Landspitali-The National University Hospital (LUH) and deCODE genetics, initiated a nationwide surveillance program for COVID-19, including diagnostic testing which began on 31 January. A report on the extensive screening efforts in Iceland has recently been published.

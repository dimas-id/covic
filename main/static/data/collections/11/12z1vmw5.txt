The paper presents SNexpression: a tool for the symbolic structural analysis of Symmetric Nets (SN). It can operate at a low level, handling expressions required to compute the structural properties of interest, but features also a net-based way of interaction allowing to submit commands referring directly to the net structure avoiding error prone input of low level expressions. The User Interface implements a command line interpreter and provides also a multi-page notebook to keep track of the submitted commands and their result.

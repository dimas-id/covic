Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a large genomic size of 26–32 kilobases. The first human CoV identified in the 1960s was isolated from patients presenting with common cold symptoms. Subsequent epidemic outbreaks of novel zoonotic CoV transmission were reported, examples including HCoV-229E (229E), HCoV-OC43 (OC43), severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The ongoing outbreak of MERS in the Middle East is originating from a zoonotic source of dromedary camels. Surveillance later revealed that three CoV species—HCoV-229E (229E), camel-HKU23, and MERS-CoV—were co-circulating in Saudi Arabia dromedary camels. Camel-HKU23 belongs to Group 2a CoV, which also includes human coronavirus OC43, bovine coronavirus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Recombination, resulting in the generation of different novel genotypes, has been reported previously among these CoVs. Our surveillance of dromedary camels slaughtered in a major abattoir in Nigeria identified camel-HKU23 from nasal swab samples with a prevalence of 2.2 per cent. Phylogenetic analysis showed Nigeria camel-HKU23 is distinct from those previously identified in Saudi Arabia, while still genetically similar, as they share a monophyletic origin. Recombination analysis of Nigeria camel-HKU23 revealed two recombination breakpoints at positions of 22774–24100 base pairs (bp) and 28224–29362 bp. Recombination breakpoint at position 22774, encoding the Group 2a CoV-specific hemagglutinin esterase gene, exhibited high bootstrap support for clustering with RbCoV HKU14, which was previously detected in domestic rabbits in China. The recombination signal is only observed in Nigeria camel-HKU23, suggesting a regional varied evolutionary history of camel-HKU23. Our findings extended the knowledge of the evolutionary relationship among Group 2a CoVs. Further surveillance in other African camels will be important to elucidate the evolution of camel-HKU23.

Sudan virus (SUDV) causes severe lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. The most effective and economical way to protect against Sudan ebolavirus disease is prophylactic vaccination. However, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent SUDV infections. In this study, a bacterium-like particle (BLP)-based vaccine displaying the extracellular domain of the SUDV glycoprotein (eGP) was developed based on a gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) surface display system. Expression of the recombinant GEM-displayed eGP (eGP-PA-GEM) was verified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. The SUDV BLPs (SBLPs), which were mixed with Montanide ISA 201VG plus Poly (I:C) combined adjuvant, could induce high SUDV GP-specific IgG titers of up to 1:40,960 and robust virus-neutralizing antibody titers reached 1:460. The SBLP also elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. These data indicate that the SBLP subunit vaccine has the potential to be developed into a promising candidate vaccine against SUDV infections.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Several epidemiologic studies have enhanced our understanding of the impact of respiratory viruses on bone marrow transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS Respiratory viral infections occur frequently following stem cell transplantation but present atypically. Many patients have asymptomatic infections. There is a growing armamentarium of antiviral agents currently under development, although prospective studies in transplant patients are needed. SUMMARY Respiratory viral infections occur frequently after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Newer agents may prove useful in the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections in this population.

In this paper, a bio-impedance analysis (BIA) based wrist-worn heartbeat monitoring system is proposed. The system is able to estimate heart rate from a subject's wrist with only four electrodes. The design is achieved with a standard BIA device and off-the-shelf components for signal conditioning. The measured heartbeat-related impedance signal is compared with a reference heart rate signal obtained from piezoelectric finger pulse transducer. The BIA results agree with the reference, which validates the feasibility of the proposed system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported BIA heartbeat monitoring system in the wristband configuration.

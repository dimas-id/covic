• Detection of SARS-CoV-2 within 3.5 h (sample-to-answer-time) by random access real time PCR. • Adaption of an already published real time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 to a fully automatic, random access PCR system. • Detection of all SARS-CoV (from 2002, which may be soon labelled as SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2) with a PCR for the highly conserved E gene region. • Differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 with a PCR for the RdRp Gene.

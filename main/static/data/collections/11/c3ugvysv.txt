Objective@#To explore the Expressions of multiple inflammation markers in the patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and their clinical values, and to provide theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.@*Methods@#A total of 164 patients, diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People&apos;s Hospital from January to February 2020, were selected as the research group and divided into three groups (ordinary, severe, and critically severe pneumonia) according to the disease severity. Meandwhile 66 non-infected patients during the same period were selected as negative control group. The expressions of WBC, LYM, CRP, SAA, and PCT were retrospective studied and compared between groups. The diagnostic values of WBC, CRP, SAA and the combination of these three markers in all patients with COVID-19 and in different severity groups were analyzed by ROC curve.@*Results@#Compared with control group (WBC count :8.13(6.51,9.42)×109/L, LYM count:2.00(1.28,2.43)×109/L), WBC count [4.94(4.05, 6.67) ×109/L] and LYM count [1.33(0.94, 1.96) ×109/L] of COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced (Z=-7.435, P&lt;0.01; Z=-4.906, P&lt;0.01) . Compared with the control group [CRP: 1.36 (0.57~5.67) mg/ml; SAA:[4.98 (4.80~15.75) mg/mL], CRP [7.93 (2.45~23.98) mg/ml] and SAA [34.13 (4.83~198.40) mg/ml] were increased in research group (Z=-5.72, P&lt;0.01; Z=-4.166, P&lt;0.01) . PCT in the control group and the research group were 0.100 0(0.030 6~0.100 0)ng/ml and 0.044 5(0.031 6~0.077 0)ng/ml, respectively. There was no statistical difference between two groups (Z=-1.451, P=0.147) . The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of WBC, CRP and SAA in patients with COVID-19 were 0.814, 0.742, 0.673, respectively (P&lt;0.01), while the AUC of the combination of three indexes for COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.882, with 83.33%(55/66) specificity and 84.76% (139/164) sensitivity, P&lt;0.01.The AUCs of WBC, CRP, and SAA for predicting severe and critically severe COVID-19 were 0.799, 0.779, and 0.886 , respectively (P&lt;0.01), and the AUC of the combination of three indexes for the diagnosis of severe and critically severe COVID-19 was 0.924, with 78.67% (118/150) specificity and 14/14 sensitivity (P&lt;0.01).@*Conclusion@#Combining detection of WBC, CRP and SAA can improve the specificity and sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis, with a high diagnostic value for severe and critically severe COVID-19.

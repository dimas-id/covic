Abstract It is well known that the lungs of asthmatics show airway wall remodelling and that asthma exacerbations are linked to respiratory infections. There is some evidence that respiratory infections in early childhood may increase the risk of developing asthma later in life. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by definition, involves structural changes to the airways. However, very little is known about what role virus infections play in the development of this remodelling. This review considers the role of matrix metalloproteases and neutrophil elastase in remodelling, and whether the induction of proteases and other mediators during respiratory virus infections may contribute to the development of airway remodelling.

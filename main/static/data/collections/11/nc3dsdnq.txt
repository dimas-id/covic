Abstract In early 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) became an international globe-travelling virus; it began this frequent flyer journey from mainland China, and travelled to 30 countries across the world. By the end of its worldwide journey it had killed over 800 people and infected over 8000. As part of Australia's response to contain the virus, screening of all arriving international passengers was introduced throughout all of Australia's international airports. This article is a reflection on the experiences that five infection control practitioners (ICPs) had with implementing and conducting this service at Sydney's Mascot International Airport.

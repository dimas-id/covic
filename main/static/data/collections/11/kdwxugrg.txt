INTRODUCTION A novel multi-port (Triport+) and methodology were designed for single port cholecystectomy (SPC) to replicate the principles found in the gold standard 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We present the first case series utilizing the Triport+, and methodology through a single 15-mm periumbilical fascial incision. METHODS The 4 lumen multi-channel port was placed in the umbilicus through a measured 15-mm fascial incision. Instrument design and placement in the port is specific to the performance of the SPC. Retrospective review of the cases was performed. RESULTS 15 SPCs were performed without complications. No conversions or additional ports were required. Fascial defect size measured was 15 mm. Visualization of the critical view was obtained in each case. The mean total operative time was 36 minutes. CONCLUSION The Triport+ and novel SPC methodology successfully replicate the standard of retraction and exposure in traditional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This novel technique eliminates both instrument and hand conflict.

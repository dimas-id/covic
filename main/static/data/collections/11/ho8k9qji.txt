The principles behind the taxonomy of the microorganisms, especially the Â­molecular approach (using the sequence of the 16S RNA in the small subunit of the ribosome) in the identification of bacteria, are discussed. The detailed taxonomy of bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, and viruses (including bacteriophages) is discussed, and emphasis is laid on those microorganisms which are aquatic. The chapter includes information on some of the smaller macroorganisms found in water such as nematodes and rotifers. The activities of aquatic microorganisms in photosynthesis, and the global cycling of nitrogen and sulfur is discussed.

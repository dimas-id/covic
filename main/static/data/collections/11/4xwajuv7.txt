Human coronaviruses (HCV) OC43 and 229E are the second most frequently isolated agents of common colds, and have also been associated with severe upper respiratory infections in children and with gastroenteritis of unknown etiology, such as infantile necrotizing enterocolitis. While HCV-OC43 and neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus NCDCV cannot be held responsible for enteric infection in man, serological data suggest the possible existence of a human coronavirus, antigenically related to HCV-OC43 and NCDCV, and responsible for enteric infections. We developed a rapid and sensitive method for the diagnosis of the human respiratory coronavirus infections, and for detecting these viruses in suspect coronavirus infections. This assay entails a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, followed by Southern blot analysis with a probe specific for the amplification products.

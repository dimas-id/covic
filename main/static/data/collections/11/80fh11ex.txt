This paper analyses how UK academics can make money from their expertise, other than through earning their salary. Using statistics from the success rate and likely remuneration from recent examples, four options are discussed: licensing their intellectual property through their institution's technology transfer office, owning shares in a ‘spin-out’ company, personal consulting and writing books. The case of the ‘average’ academic who does not actively pursue any of these goals, the ‘active’ academic who pursues any one of them, and the top tier academic who is in the top 10 per cent of their profession worldwide are examined. In all cases, consulting is the most economically rewarding option. For the ‘average’ academic, being involved in a venture-funded start-up is the worst.

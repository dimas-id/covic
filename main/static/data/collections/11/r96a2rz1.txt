Coronaviruses, including SARS-Cov-2, are RNA-based pathogens that interface with a large variety of RNA-related cellular processes during infection. These processes include capping, polyadenylation, localization, RNA stability, translation, and regulation by RNA binding proteins or noncoding RNA effectors. The goal of this article is to provide an in-depth perspective on the current state of knowledge of how various coronaviruses interact with, usurp, and/or avoid aspects of these cellular RNA biology machineries. A thorough understanding of how coronaviruses interact with RNA-related posttranscriptional processes in the cell should allow for new insights into aspects of viral pathogenesis as well as identify new potential avenues for the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics.

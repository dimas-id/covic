The authors present an unusual case of a 15-year-old boy in whom sensorineural hearing loss and disequilibrium developed in the setting of a giant basilar artery aneurysm. This patient was treated with a flow-diverting stent and had complete resolution of his clinical symptoms including hearing loss. This case demonstrates the efficacy of flow diversion in select pediatric patients with posterior circulation aneurysms. The features that are thought to result in successful treatment are discussed.

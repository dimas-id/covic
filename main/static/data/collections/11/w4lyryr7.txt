The disease caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), designated COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 in China, in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province), and showed exponential growth in that country. It subsequently spread to all continents, and infection with SARS-CoV-2 is now classified as a pandemic. Given the magnitude achieved, scientific interest in COVID-19 has also grown in the international literature, including its manifestations on imaging studies, particularly on CT. To date, no case series have been published in Brazil. Therefore, our objective was to describe the CT findings in an initial series of 12 patients.

A 55-year-old male with peripheral arterial disease underwent angioplasty of the right lower limb arteries via antegrade femoral access. Angio-SealÂ® closure device was used to treat the puncture site, whereby the intravascular sealing anchor accidentally embolized into the malleolar region of the right posterior tibial artery. Successful retrieval of the anchor was accomplished by a SpiderFX embolic protection device. This technique may be a useful approach to retrieve embolized foreign bodies via endovascular access.

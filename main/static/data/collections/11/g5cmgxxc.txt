Whilst the majority of patients with COVID-19 infection have mild self-limiting symptoms, for some the SARS-CoV2 virus can trigger a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome which is life threatening. Anti-IL6 therapy has shown promise in restraining the hyperinflammatory syndrome and while IL-6 is a pleiotropic mediatory of the inflammatory response, redundancy within inflammatory pathways means that the use of such targeted monoclonal therapy may have too restricted a repertoire in some patients. We present the case of a 53-year-old haematopoetic stem cell transplant recipient who developed a severe COVID-19 that was refractory to anti-IL6 therapy, but responded to Jak-Stat inhibition with ruxolitinib, demonstrating its safety and efficacy in this setting.

-1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) in viruses is often stimulated by a pseudoknot downstream from the slippery sequence. At the PRF junction of HIV-1, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Barmah Forest virus (BFV), Fort Morgan virus (FMV), and Equine arteritis virus (EAV), we identified potential double pseudoknots in either a tandem mode or embedded mode. In viruses with tandem pseudoknots (5'PK & 3'PK), the slippery sequence is encompassed in the 5'PK. The ribosome needs to unwind the 5'PK to get to the slippery sequence. In HIV-1, the 3'PK and several alternative structures are mutually exclusive. Disruption of the tandem pseudoknots may enable one of the alternative structures to form as the effective frameshift stimulator. In TGEV/BFV/FMV, the 3'PK is a conventional frameshift stimulator. In all cases, the tandem pseudoknots may slow down the ribosome before it reaches the conventional PRF signals. In EAV, a compact pseudoknot is embedded within loop2 of the otherwise conventional frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot. All double pseudoknots have the potential to stack their stems coaxially. We built structural models of the HIV-1 and EAV double pseudoknots to show that both the tandem and embedded modes are feasible and reasonable. We hypothesize that the fundamental reason for the viruses to utilize coaxially stacked double pseudoknots is to increase the overall stability of the frameshift regulating structure, and avoid an ultra-stable single pseudoknot which may become a ribosomal roadblock. Our results significantly expand the repertoire of RNA structures and dynamics that may potentially involve in -1 PRF regulation.

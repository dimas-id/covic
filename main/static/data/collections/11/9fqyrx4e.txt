BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of single-port laparoscopic surgery in benign gynecologic diseases and to examine its impact on surgical outcomes. METHODS The medical records of 500 consecutive patients who underwent laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery performed by a single surgeon for benign disease from August 2008 to October 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The surgeries included hysterectomy (n = 239), adnexectomy (n = 212), and myomectomy (n = 51). The indications for surgery included adnexal lesions (48.1%), uterine fibroids (37.8%), preinvasive cervical disease (7.5%), and endometrial pathology (6.6%). Twenty-nine percent of the first 100 cases were single-port laparoscopic surgeries. The percentages increased in the second (62%), third (72%), fourth (71%), and last (86%) 100 cases. The percentages of laparotomy and multiport laparoscopy were 23% and 48%, respectively, in the first 100 cases; however, in the last 100 cases, the percentages dropped to 4% and 10%, respectively. A significant reduction in estimated blood loss and length of hospital stay was observed for all diseases. No differences were identified in the median operative time or complication rate over the study period. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery can be applied to most benign gynecologic surgery without detrimental effects on clinical outcomes.

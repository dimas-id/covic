PURPOSE We compared the outcome of hybrid laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (lapPPPD) and open PPPD (oPPPD) in a retrospective case-matched study. METHODS Patients operated from 2010 to 2013 by lapPPPD were matched 1:1 for age, sex, histopathology, American Society of Anesthesiologists category and body mass index to oPPPD patients operated from 1996 to 2013. RESULTS Patients eligible for lapPPPD are a risk group due to a high rate of soft pancreata. Complication rate and mortality were comparable to oPPPD. There was a significantly reduced transfusion requirement and a trend towards shorter operation time, less delayed gastric emptying, and reduced hospital stay. The main reason for conversion was portal venous tumor adhesion. Patient selection changed and operation time and hospital stay decreased with the surgeons' experience. CONCLUSION In selected patients, a hybrid laparoscopic technique of pancreatoduodenectomy is feasible with complication rates comparable to the open procedure. There seem to be advantages in terms of transfusion requirement, operation time, and hospital stay.

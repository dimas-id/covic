Since its success in Poznan, Poland in 2015, Central and Eastern European Proteomic Conference (CEEPC) was once again hosted in Poland but this time in Ustro≈Ñ from September 23rd to 25th, 2019, with resounding success. CEEPC was founded to promote the 'power of proteomics' and has diligently propagated its Conferences with immense success. It was also the first to promote societal, humanitarian as well as global medical issues in parallel, both on its website and at Conferences, including Malaria, Ebola, Zika, and Coronaviruses. CEEPC has nurtured 'cutting-edge' research and multifaceted proteomics which is pivotal in everyday medicine including emerging viral challenges of today needing deeper understanding of viral proteomics. Proteins can undergo post-translational modifications, enzymatic cleavage and activation or destruction by proteolytic events. Such changes to proteins could be key to understanding disease onset or response to therapy. This is where proteomics plays a major role to decipher and characterize diseases. CEEPC's mission remains to contribute to all approaches of proteomics including 'novel enabling technologies' to study diverse molecular processes or identify structural differences in proteins introduced by mutations, structural variations, modifications or protein truncation in disease. Multi-proteomics together with genomics and metabolomics stands to revolutionize global health.

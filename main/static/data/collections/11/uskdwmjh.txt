INTRODUCTION Lymphangiomatous cysts are submucosal masses that are rarely found in the gastrointestinal tract and more often in the neck, oral cavity, and skin. These cysts are benign tumors and mostly clinically silent. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Their pathogenesis remains unclear. CASE PRESENTATION During a routine ultrasound examination of a Caucasian 25-year-old woman, a structure that raised our suspicions of an ovarian cyst was found. MRI showed a 4.5 cm cystic lesion in the cecal region. Laparoscopic exploration revealed unexpected contact with the ascending colon. The cyst, including its base and of portion of the colon, was resected laparoscopically. The histological examination revealed cystic lymphangioma. CONCLUSION Lymphangiomatous cysts of the colon are very rare lesions. Although their pathology is benign, the recommended treatment is resection, which can be performed with minimal invasiveness.

PURPOSE: To quantify the severity of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on chest CT and to determine its relationship with laboratory parameters. METHODS: Patients with real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed COVID-19 between January 01 and February 18, 2020, were included in this study. Laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical records. Severity of lung changes on chest CT of early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages was scored according to the percentage of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1–5 for each lobe, range 0–20). Relationship between CT scores and laboratory parameters was evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation. The Bonferroni correction adjusted significance level was at 0.05/4 = 0.0125. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (mean age, 47.8 ± 12.0 years [standard deviation]; age range, 24–80 years) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 339 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3–5 days). Median chest CT scores peaked at 4 days after the beginning of treatment and then declined. CT score of the early stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.531, P = 0.011). CT score of the progressive stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.502, P < 0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.414, P = 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.511, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.423, P = 0.004), and lactose dehydrogenase (r = 0.369, P = 0.010). However, CT scores of the peak and absorption stages were not correlated with any parameter (P > 0.0125). No sex difference occurred regarding CT score (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Severity of lung abnormalities quantified on chest CT might correlate with laboratory parameters in the early and progressive stages. However, larger cohort studies are necessary.

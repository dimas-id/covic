BACKGROUND The single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) technique has been used in many surgical procedures, but there are few reports regarding liver surgeries. The purpose of this study was to perform single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH) using standard laparoscopic instrumentation in 8 Chinese patients. The advantages and prospective future applications of SILH are also described. METHODS Selected patients were hospitalized between December 2009 and November 2011. The procedure was accomplished through a 2.5-cm transabdominal wall incision using a laparoscope and 2 other instruments without the assistance of any articulating instruments or single multiport trocar. RESULTS All procedures were successfully performed without the need for supplemental trocars. Postoperative pathological examinations were supportive of the preoperative diagnoses. No complications such as perioperative hemorrhage or infections occurred. CONCLUSION SILH appears to be a safe approach and the results are cosmetically favorable. The accumulation of SILH experience and the development of instrumentation are needed for extensive use of this technique in hepatectomies.

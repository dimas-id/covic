The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other cities in China in 2019 has become a global pandemic as declared by World Health Organization (WHO) in the first quarter of 2020 . The delay in diagnosis, limited hospital resources and other treatment resources leads to rapid spread of COVID-19. In this article, we consider an optimal control COVID-19 transmission model and assess the impact of some control measures that can lead to the reduction of exposed and infectious individuals in the population. We investigate three control strategies for this deadly infectious disease using personal protection, treatment with early diagnosis, treatment with delay diagnosis and spraying of virus in the environment as time-dependent control functions in our dynamical model to curb the disease spread.

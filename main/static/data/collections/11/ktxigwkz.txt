Synthetic mesh products have been used to repair abdominal wall defects (eg, hernias) for many years. Biological mesh products are now available as an option when synthetic mesh products are not appropriate. To correctly prepare biological tissue grafts for use in the OR, perioperative nurses must understand the types of grafts available. Biological tissue grafts may be harvested from human, porcine, bovine, or equine hosts and from skin, pericardium, or small intestine submucosa.

Objective: To research the mechanism of Xinguanzhongqizhenliao formula (XGZQZLF) for COVID-19 treatment by network pharmacology. Methods: “Drug-active ingredient-target-disease” network was constructed by Cytoscape based on TCMSP and GeneCards databases. Mechanism of XGZQZLF in treatment of COVID-19 was implemented by GO and KEGG analysis. Results: A total of 80 active ingredients of XGZQZLF were screened out. They could regulate 208 targets of COVID-19, including AKT1, IL-6, MAPK3, VEGFA, CASP3 and so on, which exerted therapeutic effect on COVID-19 through regulating multiple signaling pathways such as TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, HIF-1 signaling pathway and so on. Conclusion: XGZQZLF plays an important role in the treatment of COVID-19 through multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway, which can provide reference for the synergistic theory of TCM compound prescription.

PURPOSE To present our experience in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation complicated by megarectosigmoid and fecal incontinence who underwent a primary sigmoidectomy and appendicostomy. METHODS We reviewed eight patients referred to the Colorectal Center from 2014 to 2016 with chronic idiopathic constipation and undergoing a sigmoidectomy and appendicostomy. We analyzed the previous medical treatment, indications for the surgical procedure, and outcomes. RESULTS Age at operation was 5-19 years. Time with constipation was 4-15 years. All patients received multiple laxatives, mainly polyethylene glycol, and all had severe social problems. Four patients have autism. The indication for surgery was an unsuccessful laxative trial, refusal to continue with rectal enemas or both, and social fear of continued fecal incontinence. Post-operatively, all patients were having daily bowel movements without fecal accidents. CONCLUSION Selected patients with chronic idiopathic constipation complicated by megarectosigmoid and fecal incontinence can obtain great benefit from primary sigmoidectomy and appendicostomy.

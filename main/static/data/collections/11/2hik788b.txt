Our study investigated the host cell protein which can interact with SARS-CoV N protein, and explored the functional connections. The eukaryotic expression vectors pEGFP-N1/SARS-CoVN and pdsRed2-N1/CXCL16 were constructed and used to co-transfect HEK293FT cells by the calcium phosphate method. The HIS-tagged fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was then built and purified for the binding assay in vitro. The co-localization of SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 in the cytoplasm of HEK293FT cells was also shown using confocal laser scanning microscopy. It is suggested that their interaction might be through direct combination. Under a fluorescence microscope, it was observed that the purified fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was attached to the cell membrane of CXCL16-transfected cells, indicating that SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 can be mutually combined.

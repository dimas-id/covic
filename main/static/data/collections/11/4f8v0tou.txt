Children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than adults and often have a milder course of COVID-19 disease and a lower case fatality rate. Children account for an estimated 1% to 5% of those diagnosed with COVID-19.

Unique aspects of COVID-19 presentation and disease course in children and possible vertical transmission to newborns from COVID-19-positive mothers are discussed.

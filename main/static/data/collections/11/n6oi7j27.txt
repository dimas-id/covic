Abstract International travel is increasing each year, and many travelers are female. Travel-related health risks include diseases, accidents, and other safety concerns. Whether traveling for business or pleasure, women should practice appropriate measures that minimize the impact travel can have on their health and well-being. Female travelers can have unique health risks related to pregnancy, lactation, and infectious disease. A large part of pretravel health preparation is often performed by nurses and should include a comprehensive health risk assessment, education, and vaccinations, all of which can help mitigate potential health risks for travelers.

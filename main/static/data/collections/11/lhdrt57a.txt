OBJECTIVE: To utilize evidence based medicine in determining which spinal surgeries are appropriate during the COVID-19 era. METHODS: A literature review was performed for articles discussing the indications for common procedures in spine surgery. Based on these indications, we sub-categorized these procedures into “elective” versus “urgent” versus “emergent” categories. RESULTS: Indications for spinal surgery were reviewed and determined to which may be considered emergent/urgent/elective. This manuscript presents a decision-making algorithm for determining the appropriateness of proceeding with spinal surgery during this COVID-19 time period. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic is an intricate decision-making process, involving sociologic, clinical, and economic factors.

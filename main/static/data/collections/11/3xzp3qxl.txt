Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) causes a demyelinating disease in infected mice which has similarities to multiple sclerosis. Spleen cells from TMEV-infected SJL/J mice stimulated with antigen-presenting cells infected with TMEV resulted in a population of autoreactive CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that kill uninfected syngeneic cells. We established CD8+ T cell clones that could kill both TMEV-infected and uninfected syngeneic targets, although infected target cells were killed more efficiently. The CD8+ T-cell clones produced gamma interferon when incubated with either infected or uninfected syngeneic target cells. Intracerebral injection of the clones into na√Øve mice induced degeneration, not only in the brain, but also in the spinal cord. This suggests that CD8+ Tc1 cells could play a pathogenic role in central nervous system inflammation.

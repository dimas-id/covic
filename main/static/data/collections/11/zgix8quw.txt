Objective: To report the clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurological diseases with COVID-19 in a Neuro-COVID unit compared to patients without COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective, single centre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. Results: 173 patients were included in this study, of whom 56 resulted positive for COVID-19 and 117 resulted negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older, had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders, and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (all p<0.05). In-hospital mortality rates and incident delirium were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (all p<0.05). COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge (p<0.0001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (p<0.0001). Multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (odds ratio 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; p=0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; p=0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; p=0.009) on admission. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients admitted with neurological disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, incident delirium and higher disability than patients without COVID-19.

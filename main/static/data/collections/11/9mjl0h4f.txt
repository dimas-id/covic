OBJECTIVE Neurologic adverse events remain challenging complications with poor morbidity and mortality post adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for hematologic diseases. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine their spectrum, incidence, and impact on survival. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE through March 2019 for all types of primary studies. Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (RoB). RESULTS We identified 552 eligible studies describing 57.972 patients; one randomized controlled trial, two case-control, 17 prospective, 86 retrospective cohort studies, 21 case series, and 425 case reports. RoB ranged from fair to high although case series were low-risk. The majority of studies traced infectious or drug-related neurologic manifestations. Infectious complications were present in 2.7% (95% CI 1.9-3.6) and 3.3% (95% CI 0.8-7.1) of patients in retrospective and prospective cohort studies, respectively. In retrospective studies, 3.4% (95% CI 2.1-4.9) of patients suffered from drug-related neurologic events. In prospective cohorts the equivalent incidence was 13% (95% CI 4.2-24.8). Neurologic complications had a detrimental impact on survival. INTERPRETATION Our study highlights the wide spectrum and significant impact of neurologic complications on survival post allo-HCT. This systematic review summarizes existing data and provides the necessary background information for every physician involved in the management of these patients.

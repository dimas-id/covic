BACKGROUND: Even though enterococci can cause serious infections in multiple sites, they are a rare cause of pneumonia. We reported a uremic patient with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE-fm) pneumonia, possibly related to epileptic seizures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year old man with uremia on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with complaint of recurrent epileptic seizures, followed by a two-week history of recurrent fever and cough with purulent sputum. Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism. The patient was successfully treated with a four-week course of linezolid according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should consider multi-drug resistant organisms such as VRE in uremic patients with pneumonia that fails to resolve with broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in the cases with aspiration induced by epilepsy, immunocompromised conditions, and repeated or prolonged hospitalizations.

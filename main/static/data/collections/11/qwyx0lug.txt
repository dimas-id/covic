In nearly 1 month, with a rapidly expanding corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), telemedicine has been transformed into an essential service for delivering routine clinical care. This transformation occurred as a crisis management response-driven by the need to provide care for patients with physical distancing measures in place. However, the current rapid adoption of telemedicine presents a transitional state between one that existed before the pandemic and one that could potentially be better aligned with the delivery of a personalized model of care. Using the conceptual framework of digital translucence-situating virtual encounters with more nuanced information regarding patients-we describe the role of integrated remote monitoring and virtual care tools aligned with the patient's electronic health record for adapting telemedicine delivery post-COVID-19.

Abstract Much is being learned about clinical outcomes for adult COVID-19 patients with underlying chronic conditions, however, there is less coverage on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the management of chronic medical conditions in children and youth, such as asthma. Asthma is a common chronic medical condition in children that is uniquely susceptible to changes brought upon by COVID-19. Sudden dramatic changes in the environment, medical practice, and medication use have altered the asthma management landscape with potential impacts on asthma outcomes. In this paper, we review how changes in transportation and travel patterns, school attendance, physical activity, and time spent indoors, along with changes in healthcare delivery since the start of the pandemic all play a contributing role in asthma control in children. We review potentially important influences of asthma control in children during the COVID-19 pandemic worthy of further study.

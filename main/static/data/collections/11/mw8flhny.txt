Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a phytopathogenic fungus capable of causing significant yield losses in numerous crops, including canola, in which the fungus causes sclerotinia stem rot. Immunological detection methods to rapidly determine the presence of S. sclerotiorum on plants may provide growers with a viable diagnostic tool to aid with fungicide use decisions. This paper discusses the generation of a monomeric and dimeric single-chain, variable fragment (scFv) antibody with affinity for S. sclerotiorum using phage display technology. The bacterially expressed and purified scFv is shown to bind S. sclerotiorum with some cross-reactivity with the closely related phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea (Pers.:Fr.). The dimeric scFv displayed improved binding to the fungus as compared to the monomer and could detect the presence of mycelia in inoculated canola petals. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a scFv dimer with affinity for S. sclerotiorum that has the potential for use in the development of a new diagnostic test.

In March 2020, due to the COVID19 virus that is spreading throughout the world, Spain lives an anomalous situation concerning the normal course of basic, secondary, and higher education. On March 2nd, 2020, the state authorities announced the end of face-to-face teaching in schools and universities. Then nothing suggests that a week later all classes went canceled. However, this unusual fact does not end with the teaching–learning process, forcing all educational institutions, as well as the teaching community to reinvent themselves to continue with online teaching. This is the only possible way to do it. The authors must face a specific scenario to readapt the learning-teaching process. The way of teaching of the University of La Rioja is online but it will have to face some problems. The Polytechnic University of Madrid classroom education is compulsory, so there is a big gap between what teachers are used to and what they will have to face. This crisis makes us reflect on new technologies as necessary and essential tools in the new teaching–learning scenario presented. But it must also go beyond considering only the tools available to do it. Reflection must also consider the members of this process and those who eventually make possible education to take place.

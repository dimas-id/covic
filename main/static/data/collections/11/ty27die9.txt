The prevalence of respiratory illness caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 associated with multiple organ failures is spreading rapidly due to its contagious human-to-human transmission and inadequate global healthcare systems. Pharmaceutical re-use, reflecting an effective drug development technique using existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the costs relative to de novo drug discovery. We have performed virtual screening of antiviral compounds targeting the spike glycoprotein (S), main protease (M(pro)), and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex of SARS-CoV-2. PC786, an antiviral polymerase inhibitor, showed improved binding affinity toward all the targets. Furthermore, the post-fusion conformation of the trimeric S protein RBD domain with ACE2 revealed conformational changes associated with the PC786 drug binding. The proposed T cell and B cell epitope identification using the immunoinformatics approach could direct the experimental study with a higher probability of discovering appropriate vaccine candidates with fewer experiments and higher reliability.

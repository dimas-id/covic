In the past few decades, genome-based approaches have contributed significantly to vaccine development. Our aim was to identify the most conserved and immunogenic antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can be potential vaccine candidates in the future. BLASTn was done to identify the most conserved antigens. PSORTb 3.0.2 was run to predict the subcellular localization of the proteins. B cell epitope prediction was done for the immunogenicity testing. Finally, BLASTp was done for verifying the extent of similarity to human proteome to exclude the possibility of autoimmunity. Proteins failing to comply with the set parameters were filtered at each step. Based on the above criteria, out of the initial 22 pneumococcal proteins selected for screening, pavB and pullulanase were the most promising candidate proteins.

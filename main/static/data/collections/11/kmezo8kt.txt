The homotypic and heterotypic antibody response to rotavirus was determined in three pony mares and their foals. The normal concentrations of anti-rotavirus antibodies in mares ‘milk and mares’ and foals′ serum over the first 10 weeks post-partum were measured using IgA, IgG and rotavirus sero-type-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Experimental infection of the foals with serotype 3 equine rotavirus produced a rapid, serotype-specific response which peaked 10 days after infection and a slower heterotypic response which peaked 32 days later. In contrast, vaccination of the mares with an inactivated, adjuvanted serotype 6 bovine rotavirus produced a heterotypic response similar to that of the homotypic response in both serum and milk, although the predominant response in serum was IgG, while in milk it was IgA. These results suggest that non serotype-restricted passive protection of foals against rotavirus may be achieved by parenteral vaccination of mares.

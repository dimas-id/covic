The leader RNA sequence was determined for two pig coronaviruses, tranmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Primer extension, of a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the 5â€² end of the nucleoprotein gene of TGEV was used to produce a single-stranded DNA copy of the leader RNA from the nucleoprotein mRNA species from TGEV and PRCV, the sequences of which were determined by Maxam and Gilbert cleavage. Northern blot analysis, using a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the leader RNA, showed that the leader RNA sequence was present on all of the subgenomic mRNA species. The porcine coronavirus leader RNA sequences were compared to each other and to published coronavirus leader RNA sequences. Sequence homologies and secondary structure similarities were identified that may play a role in the biological function of these RNA sequences.

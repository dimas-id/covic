Oesophagectomy is a challenging operation involving multiple body cavities. The traditional open approach has several described techniques. The Ivor Lewis approach is one of the most commonly utilized approaches and includes a laparotomy and a thoracotomy. Traditionally, this has resulted in some morbidity. This article describes a stepwise approach to a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy including laparoscopic mobilization of the stomach, formation of the gastric conduit, placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube, thoracoscopic oesophageal mobilization and resection and a stapled oesophago-gastric anastomosis. Common pitfalls and technical insights will be presented.

Background: The real impact of SARS-CoV-2 on overall mortality remains uncertain and surveillance reports attributed to COVID-19 a limited amount of deaths during the outbreak. Aim of this study is to assess the excess mortality (EM) during COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths occurred in the first four months of 2020 in health protection agencies (HPA) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths (ED) through a Poisson generalized additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. Results: We estimated 5740 (95% Credible Set (CS): 5552-5936) ED in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS: 3535 - 3877) in Brescia, corresponding to 2.55 (95% CS: 2.50-2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS: 1.89-1.98) folds increase in the number of deaths. The ED wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly two weeks after the introduction of lock-down measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI: 9.1-9.7). Conclusion: EM was significantly larger than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on health system. Time-series analyses highlighted the impact of lockdown restrictions, with a lower EM in the HPA where there was a smaller delay between the epidemic outbreak and their enforcement.

BACKGROUND It is often difficult to assess the clinical significance of scrotal or operative site swelling after a laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of an inguinal hernia. Specifically, surgeons are often faced with the dilemma of determining whether such a swelling is a recurrent hernia or just a swelling only. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 1,065 laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repairs were performed on 944 patients by a single surgeon between December 2000 and December 2008, and we reviewed these data. RESULTS The overall incidence of swelling formation was 6.5% (70 of 1,065 cases). Swellings were more frequent in males, and in association with the following diagnoses: indirect inguinal hernias, larger hernia defects, scrotal hernias, omental incarcerations, and the presence of residual distal sacs. Fifty-eight (83%) of 70 patients who had swelling after laparoscopic TEP did not need any intervention for swelling and the swelling resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS Although postoperative swellings are a common complication after laparoscopic TEP repairs of inguinal hernias, swellings are minor complications, are not associated with hernia recurrence, and generally subside spontaneously.

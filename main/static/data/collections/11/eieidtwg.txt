World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) as pandemic. Its outbreak started in China in Dec 2019 and rapidly spread across all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 infected more than 800,000 people and caused about 35,000 deaths so far and no approved drugs are available to treat COVID-19. Several investigations have been carried out to identify potent drugs to COVID-19 based on drug repurposing, potential novel compounds from ligand libraries, natural products, short peptides, and RNAseq analysis. This review is focused on three different aspects such as (i) targets for drug design (ii) computational methods to identify lead compounds and (iii) drugs for COVID-19. It also covers the latest literature on various hit molecules proposed by computational methods and experimental techniques.

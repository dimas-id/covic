BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During the current pandemic of COVID-19, India is under lockdown which could cause disruption in diet and lifestyle in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We aimed to study lifestyle changes and other common issues related to treatment in our previously seen and treated patients with T2DM. METHODS: Patients (n, 150) who were regularly following up before lockdown were interviewed telephonically (after 45 days of start of lockdown) regarding lifestyle changes, stress and other diabetes-related questions. RESULT: Carbohydrate consumption and frequency of snacking increased in 21% and 23% patients, respectively. Interestingly, 27% patients reported an increase in consumption of fruits. Exercise duration was reduced in 42% and weight gain occurred in 19% patients. Frequency of doing self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was decreased in 23% patients. 'Mental stress' of any kind was reported in 87% patients. Availability of medicines and insulin was uninterrupted in 91% patients. Knowledge about telemedicine was present in 69% and majority (92%) of these patients preferred video consultation. CONCLUSION: During 45 days of lockdown increase in carbohydrate intake, decrease in exercise, decreased SMBG and widespread mental stress in patients with T2DM was recorded, factors which may destabilize or exacerbate hyperglycemia and hypertension. Some positive changes (e.g. increased intake of fruits) were also observed.

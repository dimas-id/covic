Abstract CXCL10 is part of the group of interferon-stimulated genes and it plays an important role during different viral infections by inducing cell activation, chemotaxis and lymphocyte priming toward the Th1 phenotype. In this study, we investigated in vitro the effects of CXCL10 in activated human primary T lymphocytes in terms of apoptosis or survival, and delineated the signaling pathways that are involved. CXCL10, in combination with IL-2 and/or IFNÎ±, induces apoptosis in T lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL10-induced activation of CXCR3 also triggers pro-survival signals that can be blocked by pertussis toxin. The analysis of the downstream signaling kinases shows that apoptosis is p38 MAPK-dependent and the pro-survival signals rely on the sustained activation of PI3K and the transient activation of Akt. On the other hand, the transient activation of p44/p42 ERK did not have an impact on T lymphocyte survival. We propose an immunological model in which CXCL10, together with other co-stimulating cytokines, participates in the activation of T lymphocytes, promotes survival and expansion of certain lymphocyte subsets, and induces chemotaxis toward the infected tissues. On the other hand, CXCL10 might contribute to the triggering of apoptosis in other subsets of T lymphocytes, including those lymphocytes that were transiently activated but later lacked the appropriate sets of specific co-stimulating signals to ensure their survival.

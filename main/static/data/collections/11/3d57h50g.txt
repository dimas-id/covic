This letter argues that we need to pay particular attention to people with dementia during this difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic Social distancing rules and cocooning for people aged 70 years and over are now in place in Ireland to slow down the rate of infection and protect vulnerable older people This letter argues that we need, more than ever, to assert the personhood of people with dementia at this difficult time That means more person-centred care and practical support structures for family carers to allow them to continue to care at home in a safe and life-enhancing way New public broadcasting initiatives could create information and communication channels for people with dementia and their carers, as well as demonstrating empathy and solidarity with their predicament Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and the voluntary sector have risen to the challenge of COVID-19 in all sectors of society So too have ordinary citizens Now we need to unite even more to create an unyielding commitment and adherence to the principles of decency, justice and equity in the allocation of scarce health and social care resources By doing this, we will demonstrate our caring potential and capacity in a way that reflects our shared humanity, not only in the current crisis, but into the future

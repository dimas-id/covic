Nutraceutical treatments can reduce inflammation and prevent the development of inflammatory diseases In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of Smilax guianensis Vitman extract (SGE) were examined SGE suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated nitrite production in RAW 264 7 cells SGE also prevented the LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) but not cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 Western blot analysis showed that SGE attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of IκB kinase, inhibitor of kappa B (IκB), and p65 Additionally, SGE inhibited LPS-induced IκB degradation in RAW 264 7 cells Western blot analysis of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as well as immunofluorescence assay results, revealed that SGE suppressed LPS-induced p65 nuclear translocation in RAW 264 7 cells Moreover, SGE reduced LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression and IL-1β and IL-6 protein expression in RAW 264 7 cells Collectively, these results indicate that SGE suppresses the NF-κB signaling pathway and thereby inhibits the production of NO, IL-1β, and IL-6

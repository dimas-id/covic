In this demo, we present a meta-journalistic tool that reveals post-publication changes in articles of Portuguese online news media. Revisionista.PT can uncover the news cycle of online media, offering a glimpse into an otherwise unknown dynamic edit history. We leverage on article snapshots periodically collected by Web archives to reconstruct an approximate timeline of the changes: additions, edits, and corrections. Revisionista.PT is currently tracking changes in about 140,000 articles published by 12 selected news sources and has a user-friendly interface that will be familiar to users of version control systems. In addition, an open source browser extension can be installed by users so that they can be alerted of changes to articles they may be reading. Initial work on this demo was started as an entry submitted into Arquivo.PT â€™s 2019 Prize, where it received an award for second place.

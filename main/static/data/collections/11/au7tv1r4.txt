BACKGROUND Obesity has been demonstrated to increase the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and may influence the quality and effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Our aim was to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and the outcome of OHCA victims not treated by targeted temperature management. METHODS This was a prospective observational study of OHCA patients. The patients were categorized according to BMI into two groups: the normal BMI group (nBMI) and the elevated BMI group (eBMI). The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), while secondary outcomes were survival to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and survival to ICU discharge. RESULTS Of the initial 99 patients who were transported to the Emergency Department, 84 (85%) were included in the study. Mean BMI was 29.8kg/m2. Thirteen (15.5%) patients achieved ROSC and were admitted to the ICU, with the mean duration of ICU length of stay being 6.7Â±4.9days. Survival to ICU admission and ICU discharge were higher in the eBMI group (17.6% vs. 6.25%, p=0.010 and 10.3% vs. 6.25%, p=0.021, respectively). Survival to ICU discharge was higher in ventricular fibrillation patients compared to patients with non-shockable rhythms, irrespectively of their BMI (p=0.002). All patients that survived to ICU discharge did so with a cerebral performance category score of 2. CONCLUSIONS Survival to ICU admission and ICU discharge were higher in the eBMI group.

BACKGROUND Facial aging is the result of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that lead to gradual reduction of dermal extracellular components and skin elasticity and wrinkle formation. A novel stent-shaped biodegradable and biocompatible scaffold device braided with absorbable polydioxanone (PDO) multifilaments was recently marketed for tissue suturing and augmentation. OBJECTIVE To explore tissue regeneration profiles following implantation of the stent-shaped hollow scaffold in rats and mini-pigs. MATERIALS AND METHODS The scaffold device was implanted under the panniculus carnosus of rat dorsal skin and in the subcutaneous layer of mini-pig dorsal skin. Tissue samples were harvested and histologically evaluated after 3 days and 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks for rats and after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks for mini-pigs. RESULTS Type III collagen was slowly replaced by Type I collagen in the scaffold. Cells from the surrounding tissue infiltrated the hollow space of the scaffold, which induced de novo tissue regeneration in this space. CONCLUSION The novel stent-shaped scaffold used here may be useful for stimulated tissue remodeling of aged skin, collagen synthesis, and partial restoration of dermal matrix components. The cosmetic purpose of this novel soft tissue augmentation device should be clinically investigated in long-term studies.

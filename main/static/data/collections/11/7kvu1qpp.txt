A lethal infection by neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus was prevented by the local adoptive transfer of three virus-specific Lyt-1+2-, L3T4+ T cell clones. The transfer of Lyt-1+ T cells specific for an unrelated antigen (hen egg lysozyme) did not protect. Protection required I region compatibility between the T cells and the recipients, and was reversed either by irradiation of the cells before transfer or by pretreatment of the recipients with cyclophosphamide. Adoptive transfer prevented death due to JHM virus infection but did not result in altered antiviral immunoglobulin synthesis or the suppression of viral replication in the central nervous system (CNS). The data presented implicate a local DTH response in the protection of the host from lethal infection of the CNS by a neurotropic virus, but clearly imply that other antiviral effector mechanisms are necessary for the suppression of viral replication.

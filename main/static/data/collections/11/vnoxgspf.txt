Background. Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) has been highlighted in the recent literature as a means of performing a range of common, minimal access, paediatric surgical procedures. The primary attraction is the absence of visible scarring. Aim. This study aims to describe a cosmetically advantageous means of SILS port placement in children, which preserves the umbilical profile. Methods. We describe a paediatric case series utilising a semicircular incision in the superior umbilical fold for SILS procedures. The linea alba is exposed over 2 cm just superior to the umbilical ring and stay sutures are applied. A vertical incision is made over this distance without entering the umbilical ring. Data were recorded prospectively in a Microsoft Excel database. Results. Twenty-one cases were performed in a 1-year period. Ten appendicectomies, 5 ovarian/paraovarian cystectomies, 2 Palomo procedures, 3 nephrectomy/heminephrectomies, and 1 Meckel's diverticulectomy were performed. There was 1 wound infection. No incisional hernias occurred. Discussion. We believe that our technique, which maintains the integrity of the umbilical ring and allows preservation of the umbilical profile, offers a distinct cosmetic advantage over other incisions for SILS which distort it. Conclusion. We have demonstrated the aesthetic benefits of utilising a superior umbilical-fold incision for SILS in children.

One relevant feature of the Covid-19 disease is the absence of dyspnea, described as 'shortness of breath' or 'an unpleasant urge to breathe'. The lack of dyspnea is observed even in the most severe cases, in which subjects present tachypnea and tachycardia. In the Wuhan cohort, 62.4% of severe cases and 46.3% of those who ended up intubated, ventilated or dead did not present dyspnea[1,2].

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is associated with a decrease in postoperative pain, shortened hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and decrease in chronic pain. Moreover, laparoscopic surgery performed with needlescopic instruments has more advantages than conventional laparoscopic surgery. However, there are few reports of large-scale laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair using needlescopic instruments (nTAPP). This report reviews our experiences with 352 nTAPP in 317 patients during the 15-year period from April 1996 to April 2011. METHODS We performed nTAPP as the method of choice in 88.5% of all patients presenting with inguinal hernia. To perform the nTAPP, 3-mm instruments were used. A 5-mm laparoscope was inserted from the umbilicus, and surgical instruments were inserted through 5- and 3-mm trocars. After reduction of the hernia sac and dissection of the preperitoneal space, we placed polyester mesh or polypropylene soft mesh with staple fixation. The peritoneum was closed with 3-0 silk interrupted sutures. RESULTS The mean operative time was 102.9 min for unilateral hernias and 155.8 min for bilateral hernias. There was no conversion to open repair. Forty-three patients (13.6%) used postoperative analgesics, and the mean frequency of use was 0.5 times. Regarding intraoperative complications, we observed one bladder injury, but no bowel injuries or major vessel injuries. Postoperative complications occurred in 32 patients (10.1%). One patient with a retained lipoma required reoperation. There was no incidence of chronic pain or mesh infection. The operative time for experienced surgeons (â‰¥ 20 repairs) was significantly shorter than that of inexperienced surgeons (< 20 repairs; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The nTAPP was a safe and useful technique for inguinal hernia repair. Large prospective, randomized controlled trials will be required to establish the benefit of nTAPP.

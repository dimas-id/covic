A 5-stage protocol was used to support Board Certified Behavior Analysts providing telehealth support for children with autism spectrum disorder and their families. Stage 1 of the protocol involves 2 acceptance and commitment therapy exercises. Specifically, the Valued Living Questionnaire is used to identify a family member’s values, and the Bull’s-Eye Values Survey is employed to determine the extent to which a family member is living in accordance with stated values. Stage 2 of the protocol involves administering an adult version of the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment to identify preferred activities of parents of a child with autism spectrum disorder. During Stage 3 of the protocol, the goals and objectives of a child with autism spectrum disorder are yoked to the preferred activities of a family member in order to promote child–parent engagement. Stage 4 of the protocol is focused on parent-implemented interventions, and Stage 5 of the protocol is designed as a primer for comprehensive support within an acceptance and commitment therapy model. The 5-stage protocol provides guidelines for Board Certified Behavior Analysts interested in structuring telehealth sessions and optimizing engagement between a family member and a child with autism spectrum disorder.

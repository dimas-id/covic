Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has become an attractive tool for combating the spread of COVID-19 by assessing the presence or levels of the virus shed in a population. However, the methods to quantify viral RNA and to link those quantities to the level of infection within the community vary. In this study, we sought to identify and optimize scalable methods for recovery of viral nucleic acids from wastewater and attempted to use a constitutive member of the gut virome, human-specific crAssphage, to help account for unknown levels of SARS-CoV-2 decay and dilution in the wastewater infrastructure. Results suggest that ultracentrifugation of a small volume of wastewater through a 50% sucrose cushion followed by total nucleic acid extraction yielded quantifiable virus in an area with a modest number of COVID-19 cases. Further, the ratio of log10(SARS-CoV-2):log10(crAssphage) appears to be associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the Syracuse, NY area. In areas where ultracentrifuges are available, these methods may be used to link SARS-CoV-2 quantities in wastewater to levels of transmission within communities with sewer service.

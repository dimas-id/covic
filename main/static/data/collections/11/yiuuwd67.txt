BACKGROUND Anastomotic leak remains a common and potentially deleterious complication after esophagectomy. Preoperative embolization of the left gastric artery and splenic artery (PAE) has been suggested to lower anastomotic leak rates. We present the results of our 5-year experience with this technique. METHODS All patients undergoing PAE before esophagectomy since introduction of this technique in 2004 were compared in a 1:2 matched-pair analysis with patients without PAE. Matching criteria were type of anastomosis, neoadjuvant treatment, comorbidity, and age. Data were derived from a retrospective chart review from 2000 to 2006 that was perpetuated as a prospective database up to date. Outcome measures were anastomotic leak, overall complications, and hospital stay. RESULTS Between 2000 and 2009, 102 patients underwent esophagectomy for cancer in our institution with an overall leak rate of 19% and a mortality of 8%. All 19 patients having PAE since 2004 were successfully matched 1:2 to 38 control patients without PAE; both groups were similar regarding demographics and operation characteristics. Two PAE (11%) and 8 control patients (21%) had an anastomotic leak, but the difference was statistically not significant (p=0.469). Overall and major complication rates for PAE and control group were 89% versus 79% (p=0.469) and 37% versus 34% (p=1.000), respectively. Median intensive care unit and hospital stay were 3 versus 3 days (p=1.000) and 22 versus 17 days (p=0.321), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, PAE has no significant impact on complications and anastomotic leak in particular after esophagectomy.

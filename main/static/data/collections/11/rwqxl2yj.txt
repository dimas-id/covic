In this study we showed that the dengue virus (DENV) core protein forms a dimer with an α‐helix‐rich structure, binds RNA and facilitates the strand annealing process. To assess the RNA chaperone activity of this core protein and other dengue viral RNA‐interacting proteins, such as NS3 helicase and NS5 proteins, we engineered cis‐ and trans‐cleavage hammerhead ribozyme constructs carrying DENV genomic RNA elements. Our results indicate that DENV core protein facilitates typical hammerhead structure formation by acting as an RNA chaperone and DENV NS5 has a weak RNA chaperone activity, while DENV NS3 helicase failed to refold RNA with a complex secondary structure.

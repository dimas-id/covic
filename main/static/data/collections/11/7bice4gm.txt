Abstract The multiplex xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel FAST (RVP FAST) research-use-only assay and xTAG® Human Parainfluenza Virus Analyte-Specific Reagent (HPIV-ASR) assay were evaluated with 99 culture-confirmed human parainfluenza virus (HPIV)–positive and –negative specimens and found to have analytical sensitivities of 95.2% and 100% and specificities of 98.3% and 96.6%, respectively. Since the in vitro diagnostic (IVD) version of the RVP FAST assay does not include HPIVs, the HPIV-ASR assay can be tested in parallel with RVP FAST-IVD for optimal detection of HPIVs.

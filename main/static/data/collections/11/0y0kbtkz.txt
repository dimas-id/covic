The aim of outbreak epidemiology is to study an epidemic in order to gain control over it and to prevent further spread of the disease. Generally outbreak means a “sudden occurrence,” while in the epidemiological sense an outbreak is defined as a sudden increase in the disease frequency, related to time, place, and observed population. Thousands of outbreaks among humans and animals have been reported and investigated during the last two centuries, among them the most numerous being outbreaks of cholera, plague, malaria, smallpox, influenza, SARS, measles, salmonella, chikungunya, and various foodborne outbreaks.

A recent model developed at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) provides forecasts for ventilator use and hospital beds required for the care of COVID19 patients on a state-by-state basis throughout the United States over the period March 2020 through August 2020 (See the related website https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections for interactive data visualizations). In addition, the manuscript and associated website provide projections of deaths per day and total deaths throughout this period for the entire US, as well as for the District of Columbia. This research has received extensive attention in social media, as well as in the mass media. Moreover, this work has influenced policy makers at the highest levels of the United States government, having been mentioned at White House Press conferences, including March 31, 2020. In this paper, we evaluate the predictive validity of model forecasts for COVID19 outcomes as data become sequentially available, using the IHME prediction of daily deaths. We have found that the predictions for daily number of deaths provided by the IHME model have been highly inaccurate. The model has been found to perform poorly even when attempting to predict the number of next day deaths. In particular, the true number of next day deaths has been outside the IHME prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time.

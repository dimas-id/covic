In May of 2011, the Executive Committee of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons approved an evidence-based guideline on reduction mammaplasty developed by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Health Policy Committee. The guideline addresses six clinical questions: procedural efficacy as noted by relief of symptoms, resection weight, the impact of body mass index on surgical complications, use of prophylactic antibiotics, use of drains, and effect on quality of life. The evidence indicates that resection volume is not correlated directly to the degree of postoperative symptom relief. Increased breast resection weight may increase the risks of complication. The evidence is inconclusive on whether increased body mass index is associated with increased risk of complications. Perioperative antibiotics may reduce the risk of infection associated with reduction mammaplasty, and in standard reduction mammaplasty procedures without liposuction, the use of drains is not beneficial. Reduction mammaplasty has been shown to improve quality of life.

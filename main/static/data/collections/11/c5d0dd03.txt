We consider a four-compartment tuberculosis model including exogenous reinfection. We derive sufficient conditions, in terms of the parameters of the system, which guarantee the occurrence of backward bifurcation. We also discuss the global stability of the endemic state by using a generalization of the Poincar√©-Bendixson criterion. An application is given for the case of Internally Displaced People's Camps in North Uganda. The study suggests how important it is to provide qualitative indications on the threshold value of the population density in the area occupied by the camps, in order to possibly eradicate the disease.

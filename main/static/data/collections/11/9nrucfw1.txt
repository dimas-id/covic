In this study we assessed the effect of ethanol on the filtering properties of FFP2 masks. The permeability of parts of a FFP2 mask was measured before and after six cleanings with ethanol. As for any porous medium, the filtering properties of a mask are related to the size and tortuosity of the pores of the filter, and are quantified by its permeability. Any damage to the filter will change its permeability. We show here that after six cleaning cycles, the permeability remains very close to the permeability before cleaning. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of protective masks, this study suggests that ethanol could be used to sanitize a FFP2 mask without significantly altering its filtering properties. Additional measurements on FFP2 and N95 masks from different manufacturers need to be performed to validate this study.

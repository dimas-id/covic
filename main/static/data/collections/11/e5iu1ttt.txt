Two coronaviruses were isolated from brain material obtained at autopsy from two multiple sclerosis patients. The viruses were neutralized by serum and spinal fluid from these patients. Although most of the population have antibody to these virus isolates, multiple sclerosis patients have slightly higher concentrations of serum antibody than controls. The results suggest that coronaviruses should be considered as one additional virus with a potential implication in the etiology of multiple sclerosis.

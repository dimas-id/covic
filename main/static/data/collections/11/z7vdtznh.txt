Reticulation is a recurring evolutionary pattern found in phylogenetic reconstructions of life. The pattern results from how species interact and evolve by mechanisms and processes including symbiosis; symbiogenesis; lateral gene transfer (that occurs via bacterial conjugation, transformation, transduction, Gene Transfer Agents, or the movements of transposons, retrotransposons, and other mobile genetic elements); hybridization or divergence with gene flow; and infectious heredity (induced either directly by bacteria, bacteriophages, viruses, prions, protozoa and fungi, or via vectors that transmit these pathogens). Research on reticulate evolution today takes on inter- and transdisciplinary proportions and is able to unite distinct research fields ranging from microbiology and molecular genetics to evolutionary biology and the biomedical sciences. This chapter summarizes the main principles of the diverse reticulate evolutionary mechanisms and situates them into the chapters that make up this volume.

A 17-year-old man with osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus was planned for possible limb salvage surgery after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, during the surgical phase of treatment, the COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) outbreak occurred changing the healthcare landscape due to uncertainty regarding the virus, risk of COVID-19 infection and complications, and implementation of an enhanced community quarantine restricting movement of people within cities. Instead of limb salvage surgery, the patient underwent a forequarter amputation. Exposure to the virus in a high-risk hospital setting was minimised with patient discharge after a short hospital stay and home convalescence monitored by video conferencing. Multidisciplinary sarcoma team meetings with family members and a sarcoma navigator nurse were crucial in managing expectations and deciding on appropriate treatment in the setting of a novel infectious disease causing a pandemic.

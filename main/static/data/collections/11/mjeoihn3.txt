BACKGROUND Surgical complications are estimated to be as high as 30%-40% during the first 8 weeks after implantation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters. METHODS 70 PD catheters which were implanted by transplant surgeons in 61 children (median age 3.3years, range 0.01-15.5years, 31 boys and 30 girls) in 2009-2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence of complications and revisions during the first 6months after implantation was analyzed depending on children's weight and diagnosis. RESULTS 17 out of 70 catheters needed a surgical revision within 6months after implantation (24.3%). Peritonitis was the most common complication affecting 18.6% of peritoneal dialysis catheters followed by obstruction and dislocation, which it occurred in 9 (12.9%) and 7 (10%) catheters, respectively. Leakage (n=5) only occurred in children with a weight of less than 10kg. The total proportion of complications was higher in children with less than 10kg of weight (P<0.001). CONCLUSION PD is safe in children with acute renal failure and older children with chronic renal failure; however children with a weight of less than 10kg are more likely to develop complications.

COVID-19 emerged in 2019 and rapidly became a global pandemic infecting millions, killing hundreds of thousands. The disease altered the practices of hospitals, clinics, and patients. These changes have implications for Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs). APRNs must remain current on best practices for treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 while being cognizant of changes to their scope of practice. As the pandemic continues, APRNs will remain on the front lines treating COVID-19 patients while also caring for vulnerable populations within the community. To provide high-quality care, APRNs must utilize a multi-faceted approach that heeds ongoing updates to evidence-based practice.

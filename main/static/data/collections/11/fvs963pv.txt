Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are cellular factors involved in the replication of several viruses. In this study we analyzed the expression and intracellular localization of hnRNP A2 and hnRNP K in cell cultures infected with two viruses that cause human hemorrhagic fevers: dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) and Jun√≠n virus (JUNV). We determined that DENV-2 promoted the cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNP K and to a lesser extent of hnRNP A2, meanwhile, JUNV infection induced an increase in hnRNP K cytoplasmic localization whereas hnRNP A2 remained mainly in the nucleus of infected cells. Both hnRNP K and hnRNP A2 were localized predominantly in the nucleus of JUNV persistently-infected cells even after superinfection with JUNV indicating that persistent infection does not alter nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of these hnRNPs. Total levels of hnRNP K expression were unaffected by DENV-2 or JUNV infection. In addition we determined, using small interfering RNAs, that hnRNP K knockout inhibits DENV-2 and JUNV multiplication. Our results indicate that DENV-2 and JUNV induce hnRNP K cytoplasmic translocation to favor viral multiplication.

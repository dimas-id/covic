Background: The Angiotensin system is implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID19. First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-COv-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuals susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID19. Functional ACE1 and ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID19. Methods: We studied 204 COVID19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 indel and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Results: Severe COVID19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p=0.046), and the ACE1-DD genotype (p=0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID19. Conclusions: Adverse outcome of COVID19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype. The ACE1-indel was a significant risk factor for severe COVID19, but the effect was dependent on the hypertensive status.

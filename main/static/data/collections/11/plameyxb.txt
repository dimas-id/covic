COVID-19 is a significant worldwide challenge to many healthcare systems. In Trauma and Orthopaedics, there has been a significant change in the workload but departments have been compelled to change their practice in order to match the demand, as well as respond to the escalating situation of COVID. Some guidance is available on these changes from bodies such as the National Health Service (NHS), Public Health England and the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA). We have implemented certain changes in our university district general hospital trauma and orthopaedic department with regard to staff roles, outpatient and inpatient care and operative protocols. We aim to present some of these changes and their effects on patient care in an attempt to share these with colleagues who may face similar pressures and make some recommendations to help others prepare for a possible second wave of COVID-19.

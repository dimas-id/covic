A 62-year-old male farmer weighing 79 kg was taken to a hospital after experiencing exertional dyspnea and shortness of breath for a month. A chest roentgenogram and computed tomography showed a giant mass in his right thorax. A CT-guided biopsy demonstrated a solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP). Because of the large size of the tumor and the substantial pleural effusion in the right hemithorax, the patient was referred to our institution for radiofrequency ablation. After one month, we performed an exploratory thoracotomy to dissect the giant mass with the right, middle, and lower lobes. The measurement of the tumor was 20 cm × 18 cm × 13 cm and it weighed 3250 g. The histopathology of the resected specimen confirmed SFTP. The patient had no postoperative complications; six months after surgery, no recurrence occurred.

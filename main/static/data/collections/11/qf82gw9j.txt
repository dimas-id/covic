Stapled hemorrhoidectomy (SH) and Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy (LH) are standard for hemorrhoidal disease treatment, but the surgical principle is different. This randomized clinical trial compared the 2 methods. We included 98 patients with grade 3 hemorrhoidal disease: 46 patients treated by SH and 52 patients by LH. Incidence of complications, recurrence, postoperative pain, wound healing time, and time off everyday activity were observed. The follow-up period was 24 months. We found that LH has a significantly shorter wound healing time. The recurrence rate and the overall postoperative complication rate was higher after SH but not significantly (recurrence LH vs. SH: 1.9% vs. 11.1%; complications LH vs. SH: 13.5% vs. 23.9%). Postoperative pain level, analgesic consumption, and time off everyday activity were practically the same in both groups. Both procedures can be used to treat grade 3 hemorrhoidal disease with the same efficacy, but analysis of recurrence after SH is necessary.

The contemporary models and trends of European organisational developments in primary care, identified in part 1 of this article, are the subject of analysis and discussion. Four main issues are identified in relation to the future protection and progress of primary care, and a series of policy interventions specified. These are directed at international agencies and action. Two new case study summaries are supplied as illustrations of the dilemmas now being encountered by primary care organisations across the extended Europe. With some supplementary material, the article is an edited version of the 2008 European Forum for Primary Care (EFPC) position paper on the organisation of primary care in Europe.

DNA chips represent a major advance in microbiology laboratories, enabling the detection of a wide range of possible pathogens using a single test. This study compared a multiplex reverse transcription-PCR combined with DNA chip hybridization (ProDect BCS RV chip; bcs Biotech) with the indirect immunofluorescence test commonly used to detect respiratory viruses. A total of 39 respiratory viruses (38 respiratory syncytial viruses [RSVs] and 1 influenza A virus) were detected in samples from 96 patients using the immunofluorescence test, while 36 viruses (34 RSV, 1 influenza A virus, and 1 influenza B virus) were detected by the DNA chip technique. Results showed a good level of agreement between the two tests for RSV detection; the incidence of other viruses was low, since samples were taken from patients with suspected bronchiolitis. DNA chips displayed high sensitivity (94.6%) and specificity (100%).

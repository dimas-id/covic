After robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, total anatomic reconstruction (TR) with the additions of a circumapical urethral dissection, a dynamic detrusor cuff trigonoplasty, and placement of a suprapubic catheter was performed in 49 patients from June to July 2012. Continence at 6 weeks after catheter removal was assessed for an initial group of 23 patients, and also at 2 weeks in an additional 26 patients who most recently had undergone surgery. Follow-up appointments and telephone interviews were used to assess pad use and continence. Of the initial 23 patients receiving the modified TR, 60.9% had 0 pad use at 6 weeks. By 2 weeks, 65.4% of the most recent 26 patients operated on achieved continence with 0-1 pad use. Preservation and reconstruction of the pelvic floor and supporting bladder structures leads to an earlier return of continence. These key steps need to be validated and confirmed in larger and randomized trials.

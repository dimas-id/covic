The dynamics of network social contagion processes such as opinion formation and epidemic spreading is often mediated by interactions between multiple nodes. Previous results have shown that these higher-order interactions can profoundly modify the dynamics of contagion processes, resulting in bistability, hysteresis, and explosive transitions. In this paper, we present and analyze a degree-based mean-field description of the dynamics of the SIS model on hypergraphs, i.e., networks with higher-order interactions. We derive a hyperdegree-based mean-field equation to describe the contagion dynamics, and illustrate its applicability with the example of a hypergraph where contagion is mediated by both links (pairwise interactions) and triangles (three-way interactions). We consider two different mechanisms of higher-order contagion and healing, and the cases where links and triangles connect preferentially to the same nodes, or are chosen independently of each other. We find that, when links and triangles are chosen independently, heterogeneity in the link degree distribution can suppress explosive transitions. In addition, explosive transitions are more likely to occur when node and triangle connections are positively correlated when compared to the case when they are chosen independently of each other. We verify these results with microscopic simulations of the contagion process and with analytic predictions derived from the mean-field model. Our results show that the structure of higher-order interactions can have important effects on contagion processes on hypergraphs.

We have designed a novel apparatus, the Sunscope, which integrates a semiconductor image sensor into a compact video-guided intubation system. This device consists of three separate modules: viewer, console and visual tube. The 4-inch LCD viewer panel displays the real-time video image with optimal view angle. The console is designed with respect to ergonomics allowing comfortable manipulation and internally accommodating the power supply, image processing components and connector platform for both viewer and probe. The distal end of the detachable probe is packaged with a high resolution lens, CMOS sensor, and four LEDs. The proximal end is a 6-pin connector which can be readily removed and attached on demand. The probe is detachable and disposable with length and diameter adaptable to the size of the endotracheal tube. In our preliminary test, the video-guided apparatus helped inexperienced performers to identify the vocal cords correctly and improve the success rate of intubation on the simulation model. With further improvements on the miniature design, all captured images could be transmitted to remote devices through standard wireless transmission and could thus be stored in a specific database station. The wireless technique enables image sharing on multiple devices while a powerful database can provide valuable resources for training, data mining and serial case studies. We demonstrate that the CMOS image sensor combined with advanced reduced instruction set computer machine can serve as a visual aid for tracheal intubation. The disposable station will become a revolutionary technology both in clinical practice and medical education.

For the last two decades, the outbreaks of diseases caused by coronaviruses and intermittent worldwide public health emergences have reminded us that they still represent a severe threat to global health. The recent outbreak of Corona Virus disease 19 (COVID‐19) highlighted the urgent need for effective treatment, and initiated rapid search for therapies, able to counter the most severe disease effects. Many aspects of COVID‐19 pathogenesis are unknown, but complex interplay of direct viral damage and immune response dysregulation is underline. Intensive research is undergoing for therapeutic targets of virus and high‐efficiency and low toxicity targeted drugs. There is no available specific antiviral treatment of this disease, therefore repurposing of drugs already available for the treatment of other viral and autoimmune diseases has been a part of research efforts. Well known anti‐inflammatory properties of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, agents widely used in dermatology, made them potential candidates for the treatment of COVID‐19. We review pathogenesis and clinical characteristic of COVID‐19, as well as treatment options that have been under evaluation in past several months. In addition, we focus more on Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, their pharmacological properties, clinical utility, and current recommendations for their use in COVID‐19.

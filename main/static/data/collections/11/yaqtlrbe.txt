Increasingly serious environmental problems have generated a large number of small and medium-sized green innovative enterprises. Against the background of rapid technological changes and increasingly fierce market competition, survival is the main problem faced by these enterprises. Exploring the mechanisms and core elements that determine the survival of green innovation enterprises is of great practical significance for improving the survival probability of green innovation enterprises and achieving environmental improvement through green innovation. In this paper, 29 enterprises that have won the title of “Top 10 Green Innovative Enterprises” in China are considered the research objects, and the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method is used to examine the path combinations that affect the survival of enterprises from the perspectives of resource-based and dynamic capabilities. The findings are as follows. First, government support is key to the survival of green innovative enterprises; second, China's green innovative enterprises have a research and development dilemma, and only matching high R&D capacity with product competitiveness can enhance their survival capabilities; and third, the lack of resource base capacity is the key factor affecting the failure of green enterprises, and dynamic capacity is the key factor for the survival of green innovative enterprises. The main contribution of this paper to the field of management is that enterprises must always pay attention to the coordinated development of internal resource-based capability and external dynamic capability. Conversely, the Chinese government should provide high R&D support to enterprises with competitive products so that these enterprises can rapidly grow into leading enterprises through continuous innovation and drive the sustained and rapid development of China's green innovation industry.

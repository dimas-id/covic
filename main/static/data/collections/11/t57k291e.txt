We carry out an investigation of the existence of infinitely many solutions to a fractional $p$-Kirchhoff type problem with a singularity and a superlinear nonlinearity with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Further the solution(s) will be proved to be bounded and a weak comparison principle has also been proved. A {\it `$C^1$ versus $W_0^{s,p}$'} analysis has also been discussed.

The most dreadful complication after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is staple line leak. Its rate varies between 1 and 2%. With the development of interventional endoscopy, its treatment is currently fairly standardized and allows healing in the majority of cases without revisional surgery. However, if endoscopic treatment fails, surgical treatment becomes unavoidable. Fistulojejunostomy is a surgical option in the management of chronic fistula after SG. Laparoscopic fistulojejunostomy in a patient with chronic fistula after SG is difficult but feasible. This procedure allows complete healing and nutritional recovery in the case of failure of other endoscopic modalities.

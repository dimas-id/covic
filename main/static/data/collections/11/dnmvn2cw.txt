BACKGROUND Nephron-sparing surgery in the form of partial nephrectomy is increasingly becoming the standard of care in patients with small renal tumours. Oncological outcomes for partial nephrectomy are equivalent to radical nephrectomy, however, clamping of the hilar vessels to allow resection of tumours during partial nephrectomy may cause ischaemic damage to the kidney and result in long-term renal impairment. AIM We carried out a retrospective review of 43 patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) and assessed functional and oncological outcomes. METHODS The operative technique initially utilised a thulium laser, with later cases using the LigaSureâ„¢ vessel sealing device. All patients underwent preoperative cross sectional imaging and anatomical classification accordingly. RESULTS Forty three patients underwent LPN in our unit from 2006 to 2014. The mean (range) tumour diameter on preoperative cross sectional imaging was 28.2 (12-49) mm. All cases had a warm ischaemia time of zero, as hilar vessels were not clamped in any case. The mean (range) preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 73 (37 to >90) ml/min/1.73 m2 and was not significantly different to the post-operative mean (range) eGFR of 71 (31 to >90) ml/min/1.73 m2. 34 (79%) of the tumours were found to be malignant. Positive surgical margins were found in one case. The mean (range) follow-up time in our cohort was 61.6 (24-127) months and no patient has had a local or distant recurrence. CONCLUSION Zero ischaemia laparoscopic partial nephrectomy appears to be a safe and oncologically satisfactory procedure for the management of small localised kidney tumours.

This chapter focuses on the use of antioxidant liposomes in the general area of free radical biology and medicine. The term antioxidant liposome is relatively new and refers to liposomes containing lipid-soluble chemical antioxidants, water-soluble chemical antioxidants, enzymatic antioxidants, or combinations of these various antioxidants. The role of antioxidants in health and disease has been extensively discussed, and many excellent reviews and books are available (1â€“3). Antioxidant liposomes hold great promise in the treatment of many diseases in which oxidative stress plays a prominent role. Oxidative stress is a physiological condition in which the production of damaging free radicals exceeds the in vivo capacity of antioxidant protection mechanisms to prevent pathophysiology. Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons, often highly reactive and damaging to biological systems. The biological membranes of subcellular organelles are a major site of free radical damage but proteins and DNA are also significant targets. Moreover, free radicals can alter cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. Oxygen radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise from the single electron reductions of oxygen.

BACKGROUND We aimed to improve the tumor localization system using radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology used during laparoscopic surgery for gastric and colorectal cancer. To this end, we developed a detection algorithm and designed improvement for the RFID clip. METHODS To evaluate the proposed system, a swine-based animal study was conducted, followed by experiments on porcine stomachs and colons using the EASIE-R simulator. The success rates of endoscopic clipping, detection time, and detection accuracy, which is the distance between the detection point and RFID tag, were measured. RESULTS Results of the in vivo swine animal study showed success in all three clippings and detections of the RFID clips. Results of the 60 RFID endoclip attempts using the EASIE-R simulator showed a total clipping success rate of 85.0% (n = 51/60; stomach, 83.3%, n = 25/30; colon, 86.7%, n = 26/30). The median detection times were 29.2 s for the stomach and 25.5 s for the colon. The median detection accuracy was 4.0 mm for the stomach and 4.5 mm for the colon. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed that the proposed RFID-based system showed improvements over the system of a previous study. This RFID-based system is effective at localizing gastric and colorectal tumors.

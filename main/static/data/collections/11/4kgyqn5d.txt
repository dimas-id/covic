The highest risk of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to be spread through human-to-human transmission has boosted the use of personal protective equipment at worldwide level. In Europe, the medical face masks must be tested to certify the essential requirements in agreement with European Standard EN 14683:2019, and face masks for industrial use in agreement with European Standard EN 149:2009. Due to the need of large quantitative of medical and non-medical face masks in coronavirus outbreak, several Italian industries are working for shift a portion of their manufacturing capacity for producing medical and non-medical face mask. For screening evaluation of the effectiveness of personal protective equipment produced by reconverted industries, ARPA Lazio and the Department of Chemical Science and Technologies of Tor Vergata University have set-up an analytical system able to simulate the respiratory action and to measure the percentage of particles that pass through the face masks using optical particle counter (based on the EN 16890: 2017 that uses the same light scattering principle to evaluate the filter filtration efficiency). This set-up was challenged using face masks produced by reconverted industries and the data were compared with ones obtained using medical face mask.

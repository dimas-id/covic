The ability of isolated adrenocortical cells to secrete corticosterone in response to ACTH challenge declines as rats age, but the site or mechanism(s) of this impairment is still unknown. To test the functionality of steroidogenic capacity per se, we measured the key enzyme activities involved in corticosterone biosynthesis. We also measured the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content and nonsteroidogenic enzymes specific for subcellular fractions. Mitochondria and microsomal fractions were isolated from the adrenals of 2-, 12-, and 18- month-old animals and used for various enzyme measurements. Mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzyme activity (nanomoles per min mg protein(-1)) increased from a mean of 0.43 ± 0.06 in 2-month-old rats to 1.26 ± 0.11 and 1.51 ± 0.06 in 12- and 18-month old rats, respectively. After incubation with 5- cholesten-3j8,25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol; 25 μg/ml) sidechain cleave activity rose to 5.0 ± 0.6, 12.4 ± 1.2, and 16 ± 1.4 nmol min(-1) mg protein(-1) in adrenal mitochondrial fractions from 2-, 12-, and 18-month-old rats, respectively. In contrast, mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content did not vary with advancing age. Microsomal δ(5)-3β-hyroxysteroid dehydrogenase-δ(5)-δ(4)- isomerase activities were similar in 2- and 12-month-old rats, but 21-hydroxylase (nanomoles per min mg protein(-1)) activity was significantly increased in 12-month-old rats (2-month-old, 5.2 ± 0.2; 12-month-old, 7.7 ± 0.5). Finally, mitochondrial 11β- hydroxylase was comparable in both age groups. In addition, activities of mitochondrial nonsteroidogenic enzymes, such as monoamine oxidase, amytal insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, did not change with age. It appears from the evidence presented that the activities of the steroidogenic enzymes are not responsible for the diminished capacity in corticosterone production seen with aging in the rat.

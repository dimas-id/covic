Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emergent disease due to a novel coronavirus, which caused outbreaks worldwide. Methodology: We report a SARS patient who had developed recurrent chest pain and acute T‐wave inversion over the precordial leads on electrocardiography (ECG). Results: She developed progressive subcutaneous emphysema a few days later. Her CXR showed features suggestive of pneumomediastinum, which was confirmed by high‐resolution CT scan of the thorax. Conclusion: Pneumomediastinum should be considered in SARS patients as a possible cause of chest pain and ECG changes that mimic acute coronary syndrome.

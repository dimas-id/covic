The low-affinity nerve-growth factor receptor p75NTR interacts in vitro with the rabies virus (RV) glycoprotein and serves as a receptor for RV. The Lyssavirus genus comprises seven genotypes (GTs) of rabies and rabies-related viruses. The ability of p75NTR to interact with the glycoprotein of representative lyssaviruses from each GT was investigated. This investigation was based on a specific binding assay between BSR cells infected with a lyssavirus and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells expressing p75NTR on the cell surface. A specific interaction was observed with the glycoprotein of GT 1 RV (challenge virus standard or Pasteur virus strains) as well as wild-type RV and the glycoprotein of GT 6 European bat lyssavirus type 2. In contrast, no interaction was detected with the glycoprotein of lyssaviruses of GTs 2-5 and 7. Therefore, p75NTR is only a receptor for some lyssavirus glycoproteins, indicating that the other GTs must use an alternative specific receptor.

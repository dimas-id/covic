Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes. Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been associated with the origins of pandemics, but are still widely overlooked. We identify ORF3c, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2 that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not more closely related pangolin-CoVs (Guangdong) or bat-CoVs (RaTG13 and RmYN02). We then document evidence of translation from ribosome profiling and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three levels: between-species (n=21 betacoronavirus genomes), between-host (n=3,978 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within-host (401 deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). ORF3c has been independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been misclassified as ORF3b, an unrelated gene in other SARS-related betacoronaviruses, leading to confusion and unfounded functional inferences. Our results liken ORF3c to other viral accessory genes and stress the importance of studying OLGs.

Recent novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan City of Hubei province in China infected nearly 70,000 individuals and killed more than 1700 people within a short span of time leading to global pandemic. The disease is now spread to 26 countries in Asia, North America, Europe and Australasia. The virus is spreading rapidly to Asia-pacific and Southeast Asian countries. The disease is posing a serious threat to human population and has devastating impact on public health and economy. So far 3 Indians are infected and India is at risk of rapid spread of the disease because of its geographical location and other favorable conditions. With a poorer global health security index compared to China (India-57 and China-51), any such situation will have worse outcome. In near future there are also possibilities of similar kind of disease outbreak caused by new strains of coronaviruses due to factors like species jump of new viruses, high population density and inadequate medical facilities. In this short review we have highlighted the risk factors and transmission dynamics of coronaviruses that may pose a serious threat to India. We have also discussed about the possible preventive measure our country should take to control any such outbreak situation.

BACKGROUND This study was designed to compare short-term laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) with open total gastrectomy (OTG) outcomes in gastric cancer. METHODS Seventy patients who underwent total gastrectomy via LTG or OTG were included. All cases were matched for stage, age, and sex by means of statistically generated selection of all gastrectomies performed during the same period. RESULTS Although the operation time was not longer for LTG, the time required for esophagojejunostomy was significantly longer in LTG than in OTG (43 vs 14 min, P < .05). The incidence of anastomotic complications was higher in the LTG group as well. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage and stenosis were observed more frequently in LTG. To improve the safety of esophagojejunostomy in LTG, technical innovations should be pursued.

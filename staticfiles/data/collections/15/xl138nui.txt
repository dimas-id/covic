Penetrating common femoral artery injuries are life-threatening, especially when the femoral bifurcation has been destroyed. In the presence of other associated injuries which preclude immediate definitive vascular reconstruction, temporary arterial shunting may be useful. Presently available shunts, however, are tubular and allow for distal perfusion to only one vessel. We have utilized a modified bifurcated hemodialysis catheter (Mahurkar MAXID; Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, Mass) to successfully provide simultaneous perfusion from the proximal common femoral artery to both the superficial and deep femoral vessels. Such catheters are readily available in most institutions, can be quickly modified, and are easy use in urgent trauma situations.

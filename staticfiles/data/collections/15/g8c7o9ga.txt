The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes fever, respiratory symptoms, malaise and myalgia. Recent observations suggested possible neurological complications of COVID-19, including the first report of suspected viral encephalitis. We report a case of a 29-year-old male with -on nasopharyngeal testing- confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe respiratory symptoms, followed by clinical and radiological signs of encephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed an asymmetric FLAIR-hyperintensity of the left medial temporal cortex associated with mild gyral expansion. Lumbar puncture was normal and PCRâ€™s for SARS-CoV-2 virus on CSF were negative. Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications, like encephalitis. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is difficult as CSF analysis may be normal.

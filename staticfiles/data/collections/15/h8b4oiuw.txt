To improve the detection and molecular identification of infectious bronchitis virus (avian coronavirus), two reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed. As 'diagnostic#10; PCR', a set of consensus nested primers was selected from highly conserved stretches of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. As 'phylogeny' PCR, a fragment of the spike protein gene (S1) was amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. To study the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses from various outbreaks, studies of molecular epizootiology were performed in Sweden, a Nordic region, where the occurrence of natural cases of the disease is relatively low and the occasional use of live vaccine(s) is well recorded and monitored. The disease appeared in the region in 1994, associated with production problems among layers of various ages. During outbreaks in 1995 and 1997, both layers and broilers were affected. To reduce losses, a live attenuated vaccine has been applied since 1997. By examining 12 cases between 1994 and 1998, molecular epizootiology revealed that, before 1997, the viruses had gene sequences very similar to strains of the Massachusetts serotype. However, comparative sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the identity was not 100% to any of the strains of this serotype that we analysed. A virus related to the Dutch-type strain, D274, was also identified on one farm. Surprisingly, from 1997, the year that vaccination commenced with a live Massachusetts serotype vaccine, the majority of viruses detected had S1 sequences identical to the live Massachusetts vaccine strain. This genetic relation to the vaccine virus was also confirmed by N gene sequence analysis. The studies of molecular epizootiology reveal a strong probability that the vaccination had lead to the spread of the vaccine virus, causing various disease manifestations and a confusing epizootiological situation in the poultry population.

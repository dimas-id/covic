The authors prospectively studied ionizing radiation exposure in consecutive 107 very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates, admitted to their Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Number of X-rays, their indications and calculated dose of radiation were documented. Their mean birth weight (+SD) and gestational age (+SD) were 1077 (±219.8) g and 29.7 (+2.57) wk respectively. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates underwent significantly higher radiographs when compared with VLBW neonates; 7.5(5–13.25) vs. 2(1–6); p < 0.0001. ELBW neonates received 3 times higher dose of radiation, when compared with VLBW neonates; 139.4 μsv (81.6–256.15) vs. 46.6 μsv (14.4–115.7); p < 0.0001. Seven percent of ELBW neonates received >1msv radiation. Lifetime risk associated with high radiation exposure during neonatal period is unknown. Every effort should be taken to reduce number of radiographs. Imaging modalities without radiation exposure such as, point of care ultrasound should be used wherever possible.

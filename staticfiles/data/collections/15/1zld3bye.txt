Herein is presented a case of a 71 year-old woman with mild SARS-CoV2 respiratory infection who experienced acute myopericarditis diagnosed by clinical, biological, ECG data and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The presented case highlights the risk of cardiac involvement, even in the absence of severe respiratory COVID-19 infection. The mechanisms involved in acute myocardial injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well known and requires further studies to precise whether it is related to direct myocardial damage by the virus or to a systemic condition.

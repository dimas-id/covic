The current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents psychosomatic clinics with new challenges. In order that psychotherapists in private practice can also obtain a picture for their patients, this article deals with the core aspects of hygiene. There are three fundamental patterns of care and provisions by the institutions that can be differentiated: rededication, stepwise evacuation and stand-by for rededication and continuation of the service under medical epidemic conditions. The following topics are the relevant contents: need for consultation in the matter of anxiety for coronavirus and interpersonal mental and psychosomatic problems due to the necessary social distancing, care especially in precarious living situations, altered communication structures (telephone, video consultation) and care of those occupied with the topic of "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19). All patients undergo a clinical and virologic diagnostic process before admittance and receive psychosomatic psychotherapeutic inpatient care, possibly beginning under quarantine conditions. Furthermore, appropriate general hygiene regulations are explained. Finally, what the patients are told is illustrated using a simple schematic aid: distance (minimum 2 m), rubbing (wash hands with soap often and for at least 20 s), avoidance (pass by in a friendly manner), alternative communication, forsaking (shopping is not always necessary), wiping (regularly wipeing of all surfaces by the cleaning personnel as well as tablet and mobile telephone by the patients themselves) and outside activity as much as possible, alone or sitting together (with safety distance). The psychosomatic services were appropriately converted.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the whole disease process, and provide reference for etiological diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: The clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted in the Infectious Diseases Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China from January 22nd, 2020 to March 8th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. According to whether there were gastrointestinal symptoms (poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea), all patients were divided into gastrointestinal symptom group and asymptomatic group. The characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were counted and analyzed, and the correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and gender, age, basic diseases, disease severity, laboratory examination and drug treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 80 COVID-19 patients were involved, 43 cases (53.8%) presented with poor appetite, 17 cases (21.3%) had nausea and vomiting, and 33 cases (41.3%) had diarrhea. Among them, 5 cases, 1 case and 4 cases respectively preformed poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea before admission, while the others experienced gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours after admission. Duration of poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea (days) of all patients were 5.3±2.1, 2.2±1.0 and 1.4±0.9, respectively. The patients with poor appetite were older than those without symptoms (years old: 48.2±17.6 vs. 39.3±15.1), albumin (Alb) level and the lymphocytes ratio were lower than those in asymptomatic group [Alb (g/L): 39.8 (35.7, 45.1) vs. 46.1 (42.6, 49.4), lymphocytes ratio: 0.19 (0.09, 0.28) vs. 0.28 (0.17, 0.35)], while the neutrophil ratio, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were higher than those in asymptomatic group [the neutrophil ratio: 0.74 (0.61, 0.85) vs. 0.64 (0.52, 0.76), CRP (mg/L): 21.4 (3.9, 52.9) vs. 5.6 (2.4, 14.0), D-dimer (mg/L): 0.2 (0.2, 0.5) vs. 0.2 (0.1, 0.3), LDH (µmol×s-1×L-1): 4.49 (3.59, 5.19) vs. 3.12 (2.77, 4.90)]; at the same time, more traditional Chinese medicine was used in the patients with gastrointestinal symptoms [65.1% (28/43) vs. 40.5% (15/37), all P < 0.05]. In addition, 14 cases of 18 patients with cardiovascular diseases presented with poor appetite, 7 patients had nausea and vomiting symptoms. All of the 3 patients with chronic kidney disease presented with poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, and 2 of them had diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are common. Whether it is caused by the virus or related drugs, diet and mental conditions, clinicians should analyze the causes of these symptoms timely, and then provide a better treatment for patients with COVID-19.

I tentatively re-analyze data from two well-publicized studies on COVID-19, namely the Charit\'{e}"viral load in children"and the Bonn"seroprevalence in Heinsberg/Gangelt"study, from information available in the preprints. The studies have the following in common: - They received worldwide attention and arguably had policy impact. - The thrusts of their findings align with the respective lead authors' (different) public stances on appropriate response to COVID-19. - Tentatively, my reading of the Gangelt study neutralizes its thrust, and my reading of the Charit\'{e} study reverses it. The exercise may aid in placing these studies in the literature. With all caveats that apply to n=2 quickfire analyses based off preprints, one also wonders whether it illustrates inadvertent effects of"researcher degrees of freedom."

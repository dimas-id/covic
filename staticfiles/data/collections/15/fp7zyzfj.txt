The present study aims to examine the comorbidity patterns of the symptoms (intrusion and avoidance) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the role of perceived threat and courtesy stigma in distinguishing specific patterns of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD among children and adolescents who are susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China. A total of 1,172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8â€“18 years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.

AIM: To evaluate the frequency of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal specimens from children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and to detail clinical characteristics and management. METHODS: The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study. All children with RTI and nucleic acid amplification testing from nasopharyngeal specimens were analysed. Clinical data were extracted from electronic health records for all M. pneumoniae‐positive cases. Stored samples of cases and a random selection of matched controls were retested using a M. pneumoniae‐specific nucleic acid amplification test. RESULTS: Of 4460 children, 70 (1.6%) were positive for M. pneumoniae with a median age of 6.4 (IQR: 2.7–9.7). M. pneumoniae was the only organism identified in 50/64 (78%) cases. Macrolide treatment was prescribed in 52/65 (80%); prescription was empirical in 29/52 (56%) and targeted in 23/52 (44%) with no difference regarding patient age, oxygen requirement or duration of hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of M. pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal specimens of children with RTI was low. The detection of M. pneumoniae influenced antibiotic prescriptions, but the benefit of early empirical versus targeted treatment remains unclear.

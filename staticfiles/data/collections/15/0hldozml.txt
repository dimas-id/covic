The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic offers a unique opportunity to study the introduction and evolution of a pathogen into a completely na√Øve human population. We identified and analysed the amino acid mutations that gained prominence worldwide in the early months of the pandemic. Eight mutations have been identified along the viral genome, mostly located in conserved segments of the structural proteins and showing low variability among coronavirus, which indicated that they might have a functional impact. At the moment of writing this paper, these mutations present a varied success in the SARS-CoV-2 virus population; ranging from a change in the spike protein that becomes absolutely prevalent, two mutations in the nucleocapsid protein showing frequencies around 25%, to a mutation in the matrix protein that nearly fades out after reaching a frequency of 20%.

OBJECTIVES Vascular occlusion of hemodialysis arteriovenous access (AVA) using an Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP; St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) is an arising and alternative practice in selected patients; however, few reported cases can be found in the literature. Herein, we report on our experience with endovascular treatment of complicated AVA. MATERIALS AND METHODS From September 2015 to December 2016, 3 patients at our clinic underwent an occlusion of hemodialysis AVA with 2 different Amplatzer vascular plugs: 2 patients with type II and 1 patient with type IV. Of these, 1 patient was treated for an autologous radiocephalic fistula, the second patient was treated for an autologous brachiocephalic fistula located at the elbow, and the third was, instead, treated for a radiocephalic forearm fistula. The reason for closing the AVA in all patients was due to the presence of dialysis-associated steal syndrome with critical hand ischemia and intractable ipsilateral edema. RESULTS All AVAs were treated using an AVP. No plug migration, access revascularization, persistent ischemia, nor other complications were observed. CONCLUSION This report suggests that the use of AVP for embolization of complicated AVA is a safe and reasonable alternative to open surgery in selected patients.

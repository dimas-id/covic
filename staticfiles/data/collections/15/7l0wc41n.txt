This study used an airway model to compare the ability of a pediatric endotracheal tube with a taper-shaped cuff to prevent microaspiration relative to endotracheal tubes with conventional cuffs. Four different types of 5.0-mm inner diameter cuffed pediatric endotracheal tubes (taper-shaped cuff [Taper], high-volume low-pressure [Hi-Lo], middle-volume low-pressure [Intermediate], and low-volume low-profile [Lo-Pro]) were fixed within vertically placed acrylic tubes. The cuffs were maintained at 10, 20, or 30 cmH2 O pressure and 3 mL of simulated stomach contents was added to the top of the cuffs. The volume of leakage around the cuffs after 5 min and 4 h was measured. After 5 min, the volume of leakage was significantly lower with the Taper than with the Hi-Lo, Intermediate, or Lo-Pro at all pressure settings. After 4 h, leakage was significantly lower with the Taper than with the other three tubes regardless of initial cuff pressure (P < 0.05).

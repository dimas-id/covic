The WEB is an endovascular flow-disrupting device used in treating wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. Although the device is available in varying sizes, large aneurysms pose a challenge with the need for custom-made devices. We describe the use of coils as an adjunct to the WEB device in successfully treating large aneurysms in two patients, one with an acutely ruptured aneurysm. This novel technique of jailing a microcatheter, deploying the WEB and then coiling the aneurysm saves the need for intracranial stenting, thereby avoiding the need for antiplatelet therapy, which is of benefit in the setting of acute aneurysm rupture.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading rapidly all over the world, being a major threat to public health. Since clinical feature of COVID-19 has not been fully evaluated yet, empirical antibacterial agents are frequently combined for the treatment of COVID-19 in addition to antiviral agents, concerning co-existing bacterial pathogens. We experienced a case of severe thrombocytopenia with epistaxis and petechiae, while treating a COVID-19 patient with ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. The platelet count decreased to 2,000/mmÂ³ and recovered after discontinuation of the three suspected drugs. In treating a potentially fatal emerging infectious disease, empirical and/or experimental approach would be unavoidable. However, the present case suggests that the possibility of adverse effects caused by polypharmacy should also be carefully considered.

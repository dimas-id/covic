During any epidemic of infectious diseases, pregnant women constitute an extremely sensitive group due to altered physiology and immune functions, and thus altered susceptibility to infection. With regard to the management of pregnant COVID-19 patients, in addition to the treatment of the infection itself, which is not that different from generally accepted principles, it is interesting to consider which obstetric procedures should be used to minimize the adverse effects on mother and child. Questions arise concerning the continuation of pregnancy, how to terminate the pregnancy, the possibility of virus transmission through the placenta, isolation of the newborn after birth, and breastfeeding. The aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in pregnant women. Because the epidemic began in China, most of the available literature comes from studies conducted there. The studies used to prepare this review article are the first non-randomized studies containing small groups of examined women. They do not provide clear indications, but show that in an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management, making decisions about termination of pregnancy, and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences. Further analysis is needed on the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences. This will allow us to develop recommendations on how to deal with patients in the future in case of repeated epidemic emergencies.

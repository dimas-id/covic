Emerging statistics demonstrate that COVID‐19 disproportionately affects African Americans. The effects of COVID‐19 for this population are inextricably linked to areas of systemic oppression and disenfranchisement, which are further exacerbated by COVID‐19: (1) healthcare inequality; (2) segregation, overall health, and food insecurity; (3) underrepresentation in government and the medical profession; and (4) inequalities in participatory democracy and public engagement. Following a discussion of these issues, this article shares early and preliminary lessons and strategies on how public administration scholars and practitioners can lead in crafting equitable responses to this global pandemic to uplift the African American community.

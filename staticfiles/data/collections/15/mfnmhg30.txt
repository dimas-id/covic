We describe spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea through a patent tympanomeningeal (Hyrtl) fissure presenting as recurrent serous otitis media. The CSF leak was observed when a drain was placed through the tympanic membrane by an otologist. The diagnosis was then confirmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the patient underwent a successful surgical treatment via a retrosigmoid approach. We describe the case and review causes of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare elasticity features between patients with plantar fasciitis (PFis) and an asymptomatic healthy control group using shear wave elastography (SWE) and to correlate SWE values with clinical scores. METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with PFis and asymptomatic subjects were enrolled in the present study. Both groups underwent clinical, ultrasound (US), and SWE evaluation. A plantar fascia thickness > 4 mm was considered pathognomonic of PFis. SWE stiffness elasticity (Young's modulus in kPa and shear wave velocity in m/s) was measured 1 cm distally from the calcaneal insertion. Correlations with VAS and the 17-Italian Foot Function Index (17-FFI) were determined. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria for the patient group and were enrolled in the study, and 21 healthy subjects were used as a control group. Statistically significant differences were found for shear wave velocity between the patient and the control group, with SWE findings of 3.8 (5.1; 1.5) m/s and 4.7 (4.07; 7.04) m/s, respectively (p = 0.006). Strong positive correlations were found between the SWE findings and both the pain and the functional scale (VAS: p = 0.001; FFI: p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: SWE allows quantitative assessment of the stiffness of the plantar fascia and can show PFis alterations, increasing the diagnostic performance of B-mode US. In addition, SWE shows a strong correlation with clinical scores, improving patient assessment and follow-up.

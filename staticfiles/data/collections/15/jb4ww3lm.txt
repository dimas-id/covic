BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Mesh fixation in laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair is poorly studied. We compared postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair in suture versus tack mesh fixation. METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair were separated by method of mesh fixation: sutures versus primarily tacks. Medical history and follow-up data were collected through medical records. The primary outcome of this study was the recurrence rates of hernias. Postoperative major and minor complications, such as surgical site infection, small-bowel obstruction, and seroma formation, were regarded as secondary outcomes. Additionally, a telephone interview was conducted to assess postoperative pain, recovery time, and overall patient satisfaction. RESULTS Eighty-six patients were identified: 33 in the suture group and 53 in the tacks group. The number of emergent cases was increased in the tacks group (6 vs 0; P = .022). Mean follow-up time was 2.7 years for both groups. Documented postoperative follow-up was obtained in 29 (90%) suture group and 31 (58%) tacks group patients. Hernia recurrence occurred in 3 and 2 patients in the sutures and tacks groups, respectively (P was not significant). No differences were found in secondary outcomes, including subjective outcomes from telephone interviews, between groups. CONCLUSIONS There are no differences in postoperative complication rates in suture versus tack mesh fixation in laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair.

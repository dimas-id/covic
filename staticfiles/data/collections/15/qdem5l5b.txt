BACKGROUND The paper describes specific technical requirements, limitations, anthropometrical, docking and suturing considerations on the performance of robotic hysterectomy using the da VinciÂ® Single-Site Platform in the cadaver model METHODS A data set was collected for each procedure including port placement, docking sequence, robotic arms placement and angles, robotic instrumentation, optimal ergonomics, operative time, and cadaver anthropometrical measurements. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine whether age, BMI or docking approach were correlated with docking difficulty and likelihood of successful procedure completion. Analysis of the data was performed using SPSS v19.0.0. RESULTS The planned surgical procedure was successfully completed with single-port robotics in 87.5% of cases. High BMI was correlated with difficulty docking the robot, correlation coefficient 0.98. CONCLUSIONS Further work is needed in the development and advancement of single-site robotic platforms, articulated instrumentation, and optics.

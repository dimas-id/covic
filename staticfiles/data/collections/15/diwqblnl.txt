The exceptional outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has let the scientific community to work closely and quickly learnt things in a very short period of time. This has let us recognise that thromboembolic complications are responsible morbidity and mortality among the COVID-19 infected patients. Available data have suggested a possible multifactorial basis of this complications, and while efforts are being made to treat this infection, preventive measure with the use of systemic anticoagulation were quickly adopted to deal with this complication. Despite obvious benefits as appeared with the use of systemic anticoagulation, most of the emerged data were retrospective, and hence raise questions on the possible interplay of the confounders as well as long term benefits and safety of systemic anticoagulation.

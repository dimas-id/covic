The pandemic outbreak and rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not only a threat for humans, but potentially also for many animals. Research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have been transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa, and across animal species, and hence, attracted public attention concerning host-virus interactions and transmission ways. Non-human primates (NHPs), as our evolutionary closest relatives, are susceptible to human viruses, and a number of pathogens are known to circulate between humans and NHPs. Here we generated global statistics of virus infection in NHPs (VI-NHPs). In total, 121 NHP species from 14 families have been reported to be infected by 139 DNA and RNA viruses from 23 virus families; 74.8 percent of viruses in NHPs have also been found in humans, indicative of the high potential for cross species transmission of these viruses. The top ten NHP species with high centrality in the NHP-virus network are two apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus), seven Old World monkeys (Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis, Papio cynocephalus, Lophocebus albigena, Chlorocebus aethiops, Cercopithecus ascanius, C. nictitans) and a lemur (Propithecus diadema). Besides apes, there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and Old World monkeys, given the wide distribution of many Old World monkey species and their frequent contact with humans. We suggest epidemiological investigations in NHPs, specifically in Old World monkeys with close contact to humans, and other effective measures to prevent this potential circular transmission.

Although viruses are the most common causes of childhood throat infections, interest in the etiology of these infections has primarily focused on whether an individual episode is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), particularly since the recent outbreaks of rheumatic fever in certain areas of the country. Penicillin remains the cornerstone of treatment in GABHS pharyngitis. Early treatment effects prompt clinical improvement and reduces the risk of transmission. Whether early treatment suppresses immunologic response and results in a higher recurrence rate than does delayed treatment is still unknown, but recent evidence suggests that it does not. The causes of persistent GABHS carriage, its clinical importance, and optimal methods of treatment are all still in question. When penicillin treatment does not eradicate carriage, other drugs may be efficacious. In children severely affected with recurrent throat infection, tonsillectomy is generally effective and is sometimes a desirable option.

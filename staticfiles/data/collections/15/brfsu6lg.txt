Trazodone is a serotonin receptor antagonist and reuptake inhibitor used extensively as an anxiolytic in human and small animal veterinary medicine. The aims of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetics of oral trazodone in experimental horses and to evaluate the effect of oral trazodone in clinical horses. Six experimental horses were administered trazodone at 7.5 or 10 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations of trazodone and its metabolite (m‐CPP) were determined via UPLC‐MS/MS. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis, sedation and ataxia scores were determined. Trazodone was rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a maximum concentration of 2.5–4.1 μg/ml and half‐life of the terminal phase of approximately 7 hr. The metabolite was present at low levels in all horses, representing only 2.5% of the total area under the curve. In experimental horses, concentration‐dependent sedation and ataxia were noted, lasting up to 12 hr. For clinical cases, medical records of horses treated with trazodone for various abnormal behaviours were reviewed and data were summarized. Trazodone was successful in modifying behavioural problems to some degree in 17 of 18 clinical cases. Tolerance and subsequent lack of drug effect occurred in two of 18 clinical cases following 14 or 21 days of use. In both populations of horses, adverse effects attributed to trazodone include oversedation, muscle fasciculations and transient arrhythmias.

OBJECTIVE Laparoscopic operations for obese patients remain challenging due to technical difficulties at operation as well as higher comorbidities and high risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this study is to identify specific surgical tools and methods for laparoscopic colorectal operations for obese patients, applying knowledge of previous literature as well as our expertise in both laparoscopic and bariatric operations. CONCLUSIONS Current knowledge of bariatric surgery is invaluable in establishing a "customized" approach for laparoscopic colorectal operations in obese patients. The instruments routinely used during surgery on patients with normal body mass index (BMI) should often be modified and substituted according to the patient's BMI. We believe such an approach will prove beneficial to surgeons performing laparoscopic operations on obese patients.

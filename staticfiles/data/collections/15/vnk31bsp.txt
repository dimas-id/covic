Recent advances in ultrasound technology have made ultrasound equipment more versatile, portable and accessible than ever. Modern hand-held, ultra-portable ultrasound devices have been developed by multiple companies and are contributing to make bedside ultrasound evaluation a practice available to all physicians. The significance of making point-of-care ultrasound a common practice that all physicians can eventually use in the evaluation of their patients is changing the way medicine is practiced, allowing physicians to quickly obtain valuable information to complement the traditional physical exam. Despite the proven benefits of using bedside ultrasound imaging as a part of the patient evaluation and for procedure guidance, adoption of this technology is still not widespread among anesthesiology clinicians, nor is there uniform teaching of ultrasound skills to anesthesia residents and faculty. Among obstacles that have been identified as precluding achievement of the goal of widespread utilization of POCUS among anesthesia professionals and trainees is the availability of equipment for all physicians when it is needed and lack of instructor supervision for trainees who desire to use ultrasound but do not always have an instructor knowledgeable in POCUS with them when an US exam is warranted. We analyze the characteristics, advantages and limitations of available ultra-portable, hand-held ultrasound devices, with a focus on the Butterfly IQ pocket-probe, which is available at our institution, and how some of its features, like the capacity to emulate multiple transducers and its cloud-sharing and teleguidance technology, may contribute to increase the availability and utilization of POCUS by anesthesia clinicians.

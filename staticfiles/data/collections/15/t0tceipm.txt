Case A 67-year-old woman known to have iron deficiency anemia and persistent unexplained chronic leukopenia was cared for by our medical center for about 16 years. During this period she was examined thoroughly and diagnosed to have chronic idiopathic neutropenia (also known as chronic benign neutropenia). Her iron deficiency was attributed to nutritional factors and she was non-compliant with her oral iron supplements. The patient fully received her iron supplement medication by nursing staff for two and a half months during an unexpected prolonged hospital stay after her suffering an acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident. An astonishing outcome was that in addition to having her iron deficiency anemia treated, her long-term unexplained neutropenia was also corrected. Conclusion Some patients diagnosed with chronic idiopathic neutropenia and clinically present as having unexplained chronic neutropenia might actually be suffering from a form of not yet described iron deficiency induced neutropenia.

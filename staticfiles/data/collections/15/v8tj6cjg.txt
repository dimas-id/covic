Results of electron microscopical studies of 517 fecal samples from diarrhoeic pigs out of the years 1981 and 1987 were reported. Coronavirus was found in 26.3%, rotavirus in 4.3%, parvovirus in 2.1%, coronavirus like particles in 2.9% and picornavirus like particles in 2.3% of the samples. In some cases (2.3%) double infections could be detected occurring as well between corona- and rotavirus, parvovirus or picornavirus like particles as between rotavirus and parvovirus and picornavirus like particles, respectively. The results were reported annually.

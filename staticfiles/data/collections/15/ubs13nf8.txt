PURPOSE Despite proven benefits of in-utero spina bifida (SB) repair, ≥30% of children at birth have Chiari II malformation or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the repair site. Our study's purpose was to determine CSF pressures in the myelomeningocele sac during mid-gestation in order to design an in-vitro model for evaluating different surgical methods used for watertight closure during in-utero SB repair. METHODS CSF pressures were measured during in-utero SB repair at mid-gestation. An in-vitro chicken thigh model, simulating fetal tissue, tested watertight closure when attached to the base of a water column. Primary closure methods were evaluated using defect sizes of 20 × 3 mm for minimal traction or 20 × 8 mm for moderate traction. Additionally, 3 common in-utero repair patches were compared using 15 × 15 mm defects. RESULTS Using 6-12.5 cm pre-determined CSF pressures, 165 in-vitro experiments were performed. Regardless of methodology we found that in 66 primary-based closures that minimal versus moderate wound edge traction provided better seals. The locking method was superior to the non-locking technique for watertight closure in 99 patch-based closures. CONCLUSIONS Minimal wound edge traction was best for primary closures, and locking sutures ideal for patch-based closures, however surgical techniques should be individualized to improve upon clinical outcomes.

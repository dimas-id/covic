Transanal single-port access microsurgery (TSPAM) is an emerging and feasible minimally invasive method for the transanal excision of large sessile adenomas and early-stage carcinomas of the rectum. Here we present our TSPAM experience on rectal adenomas (high-grade rectal adenomas in 5 cases and carcinoma in situ in 1 case). TSPAM is an innovative method that can be an affordable and disseminated alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery for the local excision of the rectal lesions.

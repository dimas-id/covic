A 90-year-old female with severe peripheral vascular disease developed cardiogenic shock (CS) due to critical aortic stenosis (AS). The balloon aortic valvuloplasty was emergently performed via transvenous and transseptal antegrade approach (ante-BAV), which saved arterial accesses for intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and enabled us to use the Inoue balloon. The IABP augmented systemic perfusions and controlled left heart filling pressures. Multiple times of inflations with stepwisely increased balloon diameters were performed under IABP support (ante-Inoue-BAV + IABP), resulting in remarkable improvements both in clinical and hemodynamic conditions. The ante-Inoue-BAV + IABP efficaciously and safely treats elderly CS-AS for an emergent hemodynamic stabilization.

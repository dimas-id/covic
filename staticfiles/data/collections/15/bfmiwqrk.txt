The unrelenting acceleration of COVID-19 infections due to SARS-CoV-2 is unquestionably the greatest medical challenge of our professional careers. The Scientific and Standardisation Committee (SSC) on disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) is to be commended for the rapid publication of guidance for clinicians worldwide to assist in management of the coagulopathy widely reported to be associated with severe COVID-19 infection. However, we would like to offer constructive feedback as to how the SSC's interim guidance1 might be improved.

Various suture materials have been used for tendon repair. Barbed suture in particular has been demonstrated to be effective for both wound closure and tendon repair. Ten fresh-frozen flexor digitorum profundus tendons of pig were transected and repaired using the two-strand modified Kirchmayr-Kessler technique. The samples were divided into two groups: 4-0 barbed absorbable polyglyconate sutures and 4-0 monofilament absorbable polyglyconate sutures. We measured tensile strength and distance that the testing system pulled the tendon using a universal testing machine. Tensile strength at which 1 and 2 mm of gapping occurred was measured visually at the repair site. Tendons repaired by barbed sutures showed greater tensile strength than monofilament sutures forming still 2-mm gap. However, statistical significance was obtained only at 1-mm gap formation. We concluded that for tendon repair, barbed sutures were superior material to monofilament sutures because of their greater tensile strength, reducing both the initial tendon load and the risk of dehiscence.

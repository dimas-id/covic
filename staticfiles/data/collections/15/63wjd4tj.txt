The course of infection with murine corona virus JHM in C3H mice depends on the age of the animals. Mice up to 20 days of age are fully susceptible while mice older than 23 days resist the infection. Protection of suckling mice from death of infection can be provided by intraperitoneal administration of immune spleen cells but not by non-immune spleen cells from adult mice. The immune spleen cells can be generated by priming adult mice, or by priming non-immune spleen cells from adult mice in baby mice with inactivated JHM virus. Thus the immune system might well be involved in the different outcome of infection with JHM-virus in suckling and adult mice, but it does not seem to be the exclusive factor responsible for the achievement of natural resistance.

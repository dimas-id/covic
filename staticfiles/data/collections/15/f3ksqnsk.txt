This systematic review sought to evaluate the effectiveness of non-facilitated meaningful activities for older people with dementia in long-term care facilities. Searches were conducted in PubMed; CINAHL; EMBASE; Web of science; PsycINFO; Cochrane; ProQuest; and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify articles published between January 2004 and October 2019. A total of six studies were included. Results implied that current randomised controlled trials or controlled trials about non-facilitated meaningful activities for people with living dementia in long-term care facilitates are limited, but those included in this review were of adequate methodological quality. Meaningful non-facilitated activities, such as music, stimulated family presence, animal-like social robot PARO/plush toy and lifelike dolls, may have beneficial effects on agitation, emotional well-being, feelings of pleasure, engagement, and sleep quality. However, there remains a lack of conclusive and robust evidence to support these psychological and physiological effects of non-facilitated meaningful activities for older people with dementia living in long-term care facilities by care staff.

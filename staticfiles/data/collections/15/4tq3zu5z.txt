Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a proven alternative to carotid endarterectomy in patients with significant carotid disease. The femoral artery is the conventional access site for CAS procedures. However, this approach may be problematic because of peripheral vascular disease and anatomic variations. Access site complications are the most common adverse event after CAS from the transfemoral approach (TFA) and most technical failures are related to a complex aortic arch. The transradial approach has been evaluated to address the shortcomings of TFA. In cases involving a complex arch, transradial access may be a viable alternative strategy.

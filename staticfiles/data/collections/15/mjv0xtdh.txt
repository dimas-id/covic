Canine kobuviruses (CaKoV) have been found in healthy and diarrheic dogs as well as asymptomatic wild carnivores in various countries. In order to investigate the prevalence and evolution of CaKoV in Tangshan, China, 82 dog fecal samples from pet hospitals in Tangshan were subjected to RT-PCR targeting a segment of the 3D gene of CaKoV. Using this method, we identified CaKoV in 14 samples (17.07%, 14/82). Of the CaKoV-positive samples, 78.57% (11/14) and 50% (7/14) were positive for canine parvovirus and canine coronavirus, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of the 14 strains 96.6%–100% identical to each other and 77.6%–99.2% identical to representative sequences from the NCBI GenBank database. We also amplified the 14 VP1 gene sequences and found that they were 93.3%–99.6% identical to each other and 73.3%–97.8% identical to representative sequences from the NCBI GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 14 CaKoV strains from Tangshan are closely related to those identified in China and Thailand and display less similarity to those found in Africa, the United States, and Europe. Our data suggest that CaKoV circulated in young pet dogs in Tangshan and displays a high co-infection rate with CCoV and CPV. However, the relationship between the three viruses and their roles in the host requires further investigation.

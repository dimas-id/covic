BACKGROUND Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is an echocardiography modality that is able to measure left ventricular (LV) characteristics, including rotation, strain and strain rate. Strain measures myocardial fibre contraction and relaxation. This study aims to assess the effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) on functional myocardial parameters, including STE, and to identify potential differences between responders and non-responders. METHODS The study population consisted of 31 consecutive patients undergoing RDN in the context of treatment for resistant hypertension. Patients were included between December 2012 and June 2014. Transthoracic echocardiography and speckle tracking analysis was performed at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. RESULTS The study population consisted of 31 patients with treatment-resistant hypertension treated with RDN (mean age 64 ± 10 years, 15 men). The total study population could be divided into responders (n = 19) and non-responders (n = 12) following RDN. RDN reduced office blood pressure by 18.9 ± 26.8/8.5 ± 13.5 mmHg (p < 0.001). A significant decrease was seen in LV posterior wall thickness (LVPWd) (0.47 ± 1.0 mm; p = 0.020), without a significant change in the LV mass index (LVMI). In the total cohort, only peak late diastolic filling velocity (A-wave velocity) decreased significantly by 5.3 ± 13.2 cm/s (p = 0.044) and peak untwisting velocity decreased significantly by 14.5 ± 28.9°/s (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION RDN reduced blood pressure and significantly improved functional myocardial parameters such as A-wave velocity and peak untwisting velocity in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, suggesting a potential beneficial effect of RDN on myocardial mechanics.

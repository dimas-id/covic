Sheep erythrocytes stabilized by treatment with glutaraldehyde were used successfully in haemagglutination tests with Newcastle disease, and equine influenza viruses. The fixation enabled storage of the cells for at least 21 days without altering their agglutinable properties. Stability was best when the cells were stored at -114 degrees C in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen.

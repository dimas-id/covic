Motivation in writing this article stems from many things: a lack of time spent in the veterinary curriculum discussing vaccines, a growing concern(by the general public and the veterinary community) regarding adverse reactions associated with vaccines, and a desire to prevent a recurrence of preventable infectious diseases resulting from a fear-driven cessation of vaccine administration. The objectives of this article are to present a basic review of immunology as related to vaccines, to discuss general guidelines for pediatric vaccines in canine and feline patients,and to offer suggestions as to how we can most positively influence our patients' health from the first visit.

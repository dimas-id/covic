PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to review recent literature regarding the risks of disease exposure to pre-hospital providers and the patients they serve, as well as the challenges they face in minimizing transmission and exposure. RECENT FINDINGS: Many studies continue to show poor compliance with consistent universal precautions, as well as proper hand hygiene. Vaccination rates are suboptimal despite attempts to encourage compliance. With the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms, new techniques of decontamination need to be investigated. SUMMARY: There remains a general lack of information and studies regarding the risks of disease exposure and transmission to EMS providers despite the significance hazards their profession can pose. However, there remains a continued theme throughout the majority of EMS and pre-hospital studies, demonstrating that hand washing and consistent use of personal protective equipment remains a persistent, preventable means of disease exposure and transmission.

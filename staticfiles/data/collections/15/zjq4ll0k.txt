RATIONALE Pre-operative lobar function is estimated by scintigraphy in patients with pulmonary malignancies and compromised function. This study compared the lobar perfusion determined by scintigraphy (PS) with data from SPECT/low-dose-CT (SPECT/ldCT) analyzed manually and semi-automatic. METHODS Retrospective analysis on 39 patients (m/f = 25/14; age: 72.5 [22-89] years) with indication for pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy. Imaging was performed using SPECT/ldCT. Data was analyzed manually and by semi-automatic software. Readers' confidence in 3D-segmentation was scored by two independent readers. Interrater agreement was calculated. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation and Wilcoxon's test were used. RESULTS Results from PS differed significantly from SPECT/ldCT processed manually or semi-automatically in 4/5 lobes (total difference ≤21.6%; rho ≥0.44) and in 3/5 (total difference 21.6%; rho ≥0.37), respectively. Readers' confidence in 3D-segmentation showed a perfect interrater agreement (κ = 0.98). CONCLUSION Quantification of lobar perfusion by SPECT/ldCT differs significantly from planar scintigraphy (e.g., with potential influence on therapy). The semi-automatic software analysis provides an applicable methodology.

The aim of this study was to examine the use of pedometers as a tool to promote daily physical activity levels in patients with COPD.A systematic review meta-analysis of pedometer physical activity promotion in patients with COPD was conducted. Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and CINAHL were searched from inception to January 2019. The search strategy included the following keywords: physical activity promotion, pulmonary rehabilitation and daily physical activity. The eligibility criteria for selecting studies were randomised controlled trials reporting pedometer physical activity promotion in patients with COPD.Improvements in steps per day were found with pedometer physical activity promotion either standalone (n=12, mean 0.53 (95% CI 0.29-0.77); p=0.00001) or alongside pulmonary rehabilitation (n=7, 0.51 (0.13-0.88); p=0.006). A subgroup analysis reported significant differences in the promotion of physical activity based on baseline physical activity levels and the type of instrument used to assess levels of physical activity.Future trials should consider the way in which pedometers are used to promote physical activity to inform clinical practice in the setting of pulmonary rehabilitation.

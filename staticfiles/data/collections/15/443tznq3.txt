In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous countries worldwide declared national states of emergency and implemented interventions to minimise the risk of transmission among the public Evidence was needed to inform strategies for limiting COVID19 transmission on public transport On 20 March 2020, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science and the World Health Organization's database of `Global research on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)' to conduct a rapid review on interventions that reduce viral transmission on public ground transport After screening 74 records, we identified 4 eligible studies These studies suggest an increased risk of viral transmission with public transportation use that may be reduced with improved ventilation International and national guidelines suggest the following strategies: keep the public informed, stay at home when sick, and minimise public transport use Where use is unavoidable, environmental control, respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene are recommended, while a risk-based approach needs to guide the use of non-medical masks

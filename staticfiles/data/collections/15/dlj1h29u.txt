Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Hyper-immune/convalescent plasma derived from recently recovered donors seems to be useful to treat COVID-19 patients, an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The endpoints are the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of these patients. However, the efficacy of hyper-immune/convalescent plasma treatment for severe infectious diseases is still controversial. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of hyper- immune/convalescent plasma therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.

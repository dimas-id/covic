Despite all the advances in hip arthroscopy, microfracture is still the workhorse for treating focal and full-thickness cartilage lesions. The success of this treatment is owed to its reliability and simplicity. Given the structure of the hip joint, however, there are challenges to this procedure using a conventional microfracture pick. This note presents our current and preferred microfracture technique using a curve drill guide and flexible drill. This method offers greater range of access to different regions of the joint with ease, thus ensuring a reproducible and quicker procedure with less risk.

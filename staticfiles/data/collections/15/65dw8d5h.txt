COVID-19 has sickened millions, killed hundreds of thousands, and disrupted daily life for citizens around the world. Utterly devastating, COVID-19 is but the most recent pandemic to sweep the globe. Throughout history, surgeons like Guy de Chauliac, James Lind, John Hunter, John Snow, and Walter Reed have led scientific campaigns to understand, prevent, and treat epidemics like the bubonic plague, scurvy, syphilis, cholera, and yellow fever. We as a surgical community should herald their examples and re-focus our efforts to pioneer investigations into the coronavirus, helping elucidate the biology, understand its social effects, and provide effective treatment regimens for the disease.

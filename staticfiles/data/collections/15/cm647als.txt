The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is widely expressed, among others, in immune and cancer cells, it provides an efficient cytosolic H+extrusion mechanism and regulates vital functions such as oxidative burst, migration and proliferation. Here we demonstrate the presence of human Hv1 (hHv1) in the placenta/chorion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) using RT-PCR. The voltage- and pH-dependent gating of the current is similar to that of hHv1 expressed in cell lines and that the current is blocked by 5-chloro-2-guanidinobenzimidazole (ClGBI) and activated by arachidonic acid (AA). Inhibition of hHv1 by ClGBI significantly decreases mineral matrix production of cMSCs induced by conditions mimicking physiological or pathological (inorganic phosphate, Pi) induction of osteogenesis. Wound healing assay and single cell motility analysis show that ClGBI significantly inhibits the migration of cMSCs. Thus, seminal functions of cMSCs are modulated by hHv1 which makes this channel as an attractive target for controlling advantages/disadvantages of MSCs therapy.

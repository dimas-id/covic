• Most of the COVID-19 cases in Nepal are in the Southern districts of Nepal bordering India with travel histories to India. • Very few positive cases of COVID-19 are detected in Nepal which could either be due to early national lockdown. • Low PCR positivity rates could also be due to inefficiency of the PCR methods. • Whole genomes of 93 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients were analyzed to find the primer and probe binding sites. • Mutations in probe binding sites were found which could impact PCR efficiency resulting in false negative results.

This volume contains the proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming (MSFP 2020). The meeting was originally scheduled to take place in Dublin, Ireland on the 25th of April as a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory&Practice of Software (ETAPS 2020). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ETAPS 2020, and consequently MSFP 2020, has been postponed to a date yet to be determined. The MSFP workshop highlights applications of mathematical structures to programming applications. We promote the use of category theory, type theory, and formal language semantics to the development of simple and reasonable programs. This year's papers cover a variety of topics ranging from array programming to dependent types to effects.

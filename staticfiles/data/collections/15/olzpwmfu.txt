Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary global situation and all Countries have adopted their own strategies to diminish and eliminate the spread of the virus. All measures are in line with the recommendations provided by WHO. Scientific societies, such as ESHRE and ASRM, have provided recommendations and guidance to overcome and flatten the growing curve of infection in patients that undergo IVF treatments. Although there is no evidence yet that the virus causing COVID-19 may exert negative effects on IVF outcome, fertility treatments have been postponed in order to support the healthcare systems by avoiding additional stress contribution. The possibility of the virus affecting sperm function and egg performance cannot be excluded. Also, an indirect effect of the virus on gametes and embryos during their manipulation cannot be ruled out. This commentary aims to provide some ideas on the possible effect of the virus on gametes and embryos as well as how it can affect the normal functioning of the embryology laboratory.

Bats have been shown as important mammal resevoirs to carry a variety of zoonotic pathogens. To analyze pathogenic species in bats from southeast coastal regions of China, we performed metagenomic sequencing technology for high throughput sequencing of six sentinels from southeast coastal area of China. We obtained 5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closely-related to known human/animal pathogens, including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans.

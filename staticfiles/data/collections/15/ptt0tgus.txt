Background: The Sysmex XT‐2000iV is a hematology analyzer that combines laser and impedance technology. Its usefulness for determining cell counts in canine and feline intracavitary effusions has not yet been studied. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the analytical performance of the Sysmex XT‐2000iV for cell counts in effusions from dogs and cats, and to assess correlation with an impedance counter and concordance with diagnoses based on cytologic findings. Methods: Effusions (43 pleural, 23 peritoneal, 6 pericardial) were analyzed from 32 dogs and 34 cats. Total nucleated cell count (TNCC), HCT, and RBC count were determined on the Sysmex and compared with those obtained on an impedance counter (Hemat 8, SEAC). Imprecision, linearity, and limit of detection were determined for the Sysmex. An algorithm was designed using quantitative and qualitative data from the Sysmex to classify the effusions and the results were compared with diagnoses based on cytologic findings. Results: Intra‐assay and interassay coefficients of variation on the Sysmex were variable. Linearity of TNCC was ≥0.993 for dogs and cats, with the exception of effusions from cats with feline infectious peritonitis, which had delta (Δ) TNC values >3.0. In comparison with the Hemat 8, a proportional error was found for TNCC on the Sysmex. Effusion classification based on the algorithm was concordant with that obtained by cytologic examination in 43/72 (60%) samples. Discordant results usually were due to the misclassification of cells with similar morphology (such as mesothelial and carcinoma cells) in Sysmex scattergrams. Conclusion: The Sysmex XT‐2000iV provides a precise and accurate TNCC and has moderate concordance with cytologic findings for classifying canine and feline effusions. Although microscopic examination of effusions is necessary to achieve an accurate diagnosis, the Sysmex can provide preliminary information that may be helpful to cytopathologists.

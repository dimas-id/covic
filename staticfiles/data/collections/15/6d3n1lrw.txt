A 2-year-old, 4.5 kg, neutered male domestic shorthair cat was presented to the emergency service with dyspnoea, anorexia and apathetic behaviour. Thoracic radiographs showed typical signs for a thoracic trauma and a tracheal lesion in the region of the carina, consistent with pseudoairway formation. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in the conscious cat to avoid aggravation of air leakage associated with ventilation. The additional CT findings were consistent with a novel pattern of a traumatic avulsion of the left principal bronchus expanding into the carina and caudal thoracic trachea. Despite the complex avulsion pattern, successful treatment was achieved surgically by performing an end-to-end anastomosis via a fifth right intercostal lateral thoracotomy. The cat was ventilated with a feeding tube and jet ventilation throughout. The cat showed excellent recovery 6 months after surgery.

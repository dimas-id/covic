The Andean cat ( Leopardus jacobita) is one of the most threatened and least known wild felids in the world. Using molecular and serologic tests, we screened a free-ranging Andean cat for 17 pathogens of conservation concern. Results suggested no evidence of infection or exposure. Whether pathogens are a threat for Andean cat populations remains currently unknown.

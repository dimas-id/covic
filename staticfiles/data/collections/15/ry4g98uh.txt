PEM-Database.org is an unaffiliated, not-for-profit website, dedicated to the field’s advancement of pediatric emergency medicine. PEM-Database published the first early access pediatric-related SARS-CoV-2 articles on March 13th, two days following the World Health Organization’s declaration of a global pandemic. Over the following 2 weeks, the number of PEM-Database entries increased dramatically. This surge expresses interest by pediatric emergency medicine physicians in data on pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection.

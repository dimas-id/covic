The development of a strategy to deliver a gene to pulmonary endothelium will be useful for gene function study and for pulmonary gene therapy. Cationic lipidic vectors are efficient in gene transfer to pulmonary endothelium via the vascular route; however, gene expression is transient and lasts for only a few days. In this study, we show that pulmonary gene transfer via cationic lipidic vectors can be significantly improved using an Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV)-based expression plasmid. Systemic administration of cationic liposomes followed by the EBV-based plasmid led to gene expression in the lung that lasted for more than 3 weeks. Prolonged and high levels of gene expression can also be obtained in primary mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) following lipofection with an EBV-based plasmid. These results suggest the utility of this gene transfer protocol in studying the expression of cloned genes in lung endothelial cells and in pulmonary gene therapy.

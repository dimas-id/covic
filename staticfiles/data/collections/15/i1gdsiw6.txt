the prevention of the COVID-19 epidemic between the LTCFs having been contaminated by at least one case of COVID-19 among residents and/or LTCFs staff and LTCFs with no cases of COVID between March 23rd and May 6th, in the year 2020 Methods Participants The epidemic risk being variable over time and from one region to another, and because the guidance have evolved over time in short-term periods, our study was limited to all the LTCFs of the Haute-Garonne department (Occitania region), SouthWestern France, between March 23rd and May 6th, 2020 We sent a questionnaire to LTCFs directors/medical staff by email on March 30th, to all the 132 LTCFs registered in the Haute-Garonne department After sending the questionnaire, we systematically performed a phone call (period of 6 to 19 May 2020) to the LTCFs either coordinating nurse or coordinating doctor in order to explain the questions and guide them on how to complete the questionnaire online The questionnaire focused on the preventive measures implemented in the LTCF before March 23rd, 2020 This date refers to the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in LTCFs in the department of Haute Garonne At that period, none of the other LTCFs had confirmed cases of COVID-19 The questionnaire therefore relates to practices at the time that preceded the arrival of the epidemic wave This date was also chosen because it was, on the basis of our field knowledge (7), an important motivational element for local LTCFs to implement more strictly all the guidance for LTCFs This event was indeed widely diffused in the media in the Haute Garonne department, in the official website of the association of LTCFs coordinating doctors and allowed a temporal reference of a major local event helping LTCFs staff to complete the questionnaire accurately Variables of interest The questionnaire included the status of the LTC (public, private for-profit, private non-profit) and the presence of a coordinating physician (yes/no) The implementation of the guidance were listed (each recommendation was a dichotomy: yes/no) regarding: the systematic wearing of masks by the healthcare professional;access to effective masks (surgical and/or FFP2);satisfactory supply of masks;satisfactory supply of hydro-alcoholic solute;access to specific internal or external training on hygiene measures throughout the year;the use of containment in residents' rooms;during meals, separating residents to each other, respecting a distance of at least one meter (in the dining room with distance, in small groups, in bedroom);cessation of group activities for residents (with distance, in small groups);the use of interim jobs;staff compartmentalization within zones (organization of the work so that the team works in small groups in one area of the LTCF with no physical connection with the other members of the team);resident compartmentalization within zones (organization of the LTCF so that the resident live in small groups in one area of the LTCF with no possible physical connection with the other residents);specific dressing procedure at the entrance (complete daily routine dress change at the entrance and exit of the LTCF for anyone entering the LTCF) In order to judge the global prevention effort made by the healthcare team, the questionnaire ended with a self-assessment scale: To what extent do you think the nursing home staff has satisfactorily applied all the recommended «barrier» measures? (rated from 0, not at all, to 10, perfectly) At the end of the phone call, the coordinating nurse or coordinating doctor was asked to give a global judgment of the follow-up of the guidance by the all nursing home staff Outcome measure The coordinating nurse or doctor should specify whether, in the LTCFs, one or more residents and/or one or more caregivers were infected with COVID-19 (yes/no) The cases had to be confirmed by a positive rt-PCR test Unity of measurement was the LTCF Ethics This study is a survey of the leaders of the LTCFs and no data relating to residents was collected The approval of the ethics c mmittee was not required Statistical Analysis Qualitative variables are described as numbers and percentage [n (%)] and quantitative variables as mean and standard deviation (SD) Bivariate analysis used the chi-square test (Fisher's exact test if applicable) and the Student's ttest for independent samples, as appropriate In order to consider the confounding factors, a logistic regression was realized Multicollinearity was assessed The initial model was composed of variables found associated with a LTCFs infected by COVID-19 to a threshold of 0 20 in bivariate analysis Then, a reduced model was performed, using a step by step backward regression Analysis has been duplicated separately for private and public LTCFs Results Among the 132 LTCFs in the region, 124 (93 9%) agreed to participate and 8 refused In 30 LTCFs, confirmed cases of COVID-19 (24 2%) were found among: one or more residents (n = 6 LTCFs), one or more caregivers (n = 17), or both (n = 7) Seven LTCFs (5 6%) had confirmed cases for two or more residents Table 1 shows the implementation of guidance in the LTCFs with confirmed COVID cases vs those without confirmed cases In bivariate analyses, LTCFs ownership, staff compartmentalization within zones, use of professional interim, and organization of the meals with ≥ 1-meter distance separating residents to each other were significantly associated with infection of COVID-19 in the LTCFs The

Viruses enter the host cell by binding cellular receptors that allow appropriate delivery of the viral genome. Although the horizontal propagation of viruses feeds the continuous emergence of novel pathogenic viruses, the genetic variation of cellular receptors can represent a challenging barrier. The SARS coronavirus, henipaviruses and filoviruses are zoonotic RNA viruses that use bats as their reservoir. Their lethality for man has fostered extensive research both on the cellular receptors they use and their entry pathways. These studies have allowed new insights into the diversity of the molecular mechanisms underlying both virus entry and pathogenesis.

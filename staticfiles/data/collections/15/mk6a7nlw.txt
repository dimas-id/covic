BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess reperfusion and clinical outcome of treatment with the self-expanding retrievable Separator 3D in revascularization of acute ischemic stroke. The three-dimensional (3D) device secures thrombus with direct aspiration and supports debulking of the clot. METHODS At two centers, 129 consecutive stroke patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores ≥5 were treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Separator 3D as a component of the Penumbra System within 8 h of symptom onset; modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) revascularization scores, NIHSS score on admission and discharge, mortality rates, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes at 90 days were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 129 vessels in 129 patients were treated. Occlusions were located in the middle cerebral artery (MCA, 48%), internal carotid artery (ICA, 33%), cervical ICA-MCA (3%), and vertebrobasilar arteries (16%). Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was given to 78% of patients. Median NIHSS was 15 prior to treatment. Reperfusion to mTICI 2b or 3 was successful in 96/129 (74%) target arterial lesions, with more than half of cases (51%) achieving mTICI 3. The mean time from arterial puncture to revascularization was 65 min. At 90 days, the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was 4%, all cause mortality was 32%, and 43/99 patients (43%) achieved functional independence with an mRS score of ≤2. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the Separator 3D enables safe and effective revascularization of occluded large arteries in acute stroke intervention, leading to a high rate of functional independence at 90 days.

Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG), esophagojejunostomy is an effective but difficult procedure to perform. We describe a simple modification that substantially facilitates insertion of the anvil into the esophagus and avoids oral injuries and complications. After mobilization of the stomach and esophagus, a semicircumferential esophagotomy is made at the anterior esophageal wall. An OrVil anvil (Orvil, Covidien, Norwalk, CT, USA) is delivered laparoscopically and secured with a POLYSORB (Covidien) suture to the esophagus. The suture is advanced anteriorly so that the center rod penetrates the esophageal wall. The esophagus is transected with the stapler at this point. A circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy is then performed using the hemidouble stapling technique. Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomies were performed for 40 patients with gastric cancers (T1N0M0). All procedures were completed laparoscopically without any complications. The time required to place the anvil averaged 5 min compared with 9 min reported by others. There were no major complications or mortality in this series. The major advantage of this technique is that circular stapling is much easier than linear stapling, allowing surgeons without advanced surgical skills in LATG to perform the procedure effectively and safely.

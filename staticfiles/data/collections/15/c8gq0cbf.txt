BACKGROUND/AIM: A great proportion of patients with rectal cancer initially present with locally advanced disease and can potentially benefit from neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for downstaging before surgery. However, risk and clinical outcome stratification remain a great challenge. We aimed to find the potential biomarker to predict the effect of neoadjuvant CCRT on rectal cancer. METHODS: We identified epiregulin (EREG) as the most significant predictive marker for neoadjuvant CCRT response from the published rectal cancer transcriptome data set GSE35452. We collected 172 biopsy specimens from rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CCRT followed by radical proctectomy, performed EREG immunohistochemistry, and analyzed the H-scores. We further examined the correlations between the expression level of EREG and clinicopathological features, tumor regression grade, and survival, including disease-specific survival (DSS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). RESULTS: High EREG expression was significantly related to early pretreatment (pre-Tx) and posttreatment (post-Tx) tumor status (T1, T2, p = 0.047 and p < 0.001), pre-Tx and post-Tx negative nodal status (N0, p < 0.001 and p = 0.004), less vascular and perineurial invasion (p = 0.015 and p = 0.023), and higher tumor regression grade (p < 0.001). In the survival analysis, high EREG expression was significantly associated with better DSS (p < 0.0001), LRFS (p = 0.0004), and MeFS (p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, high EREG expression remained prognostically significant for better DSS (p = 0.003; hazard ratio: 5.599). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that EREG is a potential predictive marker and therapeutic target in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant CCRT.

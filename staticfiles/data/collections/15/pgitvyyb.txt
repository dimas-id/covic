During the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the spring of 2003, strict infection control measures were implemented in Toronto and surrounding hospitals. These measures included extreme restrictions on those who would normally accompany patients to the hospital, screening for SARS, and protective attire for hospital staff, including masks, face shields, goggles, gloves and gowns. At Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children (HSC), patients could only be accompanied or visited by one person, often only in patients' rooms. For the first four weeks, patients and their designated parent had to wear masks in almost all areas of the hospital. Staff wore masks (and other appropriate protective clothing) whenever in contact with patients and in many patient care areas. Although these barriers were an important part of containing SARS, their use created significant challenges for patients and staff. This article focusses on the use of infection control masks in routine pediatric healthcare and the tools developed by HSC staff to reduce the negative psychosocial impact on children and families.

In this chapter, we will discuss concepts of information diffusion in social networks. We are interested in knowing how a piece of information (knowledge) is spread through a network. These may be computer viruses spreading on the Internet or a network of computers, diseases through a social network, or rumors and ideas through a social network. Information diffusion methods are commonly used in viral marketing, in collaborative filtering systems, in emergency management, in community detection, and in the study of citation networks.

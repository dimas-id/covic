Abstract Emerging zoonotic diseases have received tremendous interests in recent years, as they pose a significant threat to human health, animal welfare, and economic stability. A high proportion of zoonoses originate from wildlife reservoirs. Rodents are the most numerous, widespread, and diverse group of mammals on the earth and are reservoirs for many zoonotic viruses responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of virome diversity in rodents would be of importance for researchers and professionals in the field. Therefore, we developed the DRodVir database (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/), a comprehensive, up-to-date, and well-curated repository of rodent-associated animal viruses. The database currently covers 7690 sequences from 5491 rodent-associated mammal viruses of 26 viral families detected from 194 rodent species in 93 countries worldwide. In addition to virus sequences, the database provides detailed information on related samples and host rodents, as well as a set of online analytical tools for text query, BLAST search and phylogenetic reconstruction. The DRodVir database will help virologists better understand the virome diversity of rodents. Moreover, it will be a valuable tool for epidemiologists and zoologists for easy monitoring and tracking of the current and future zoonotic diseases. As a data application example, we further compared the current status of rodent-associated viruses with bat-associated viruses to highlight the necessity for including additional host species and geographic regions in future investigations, which will help us achieve a better understanding of the virome diversities in the two major reservoirs of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.

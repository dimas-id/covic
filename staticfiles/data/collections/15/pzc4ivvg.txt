The virus removal of protein A affinity chromatography, inactivation capacity, acid pH and a combination of high temperature with a chaotropic agent was determined in this work. The model viruses studied were sendaivirus, human immunodeficency virus (HIV-IIIb), human poliovirus type-II, human herpesvirus I and canine parvovirus. The protein A affinity chromatography showed a maximum reduction factor of 8 logs in the case of viruses larger than 120 nm size, while for small viruses (18â€“30 nm) the maximum reduction factor was about 5 logs. Non viral inactivation was observed during the monoclonal antibody elution step. Low pH treatment showed a maximum inactivation factor of 7.1 logs for enveloped viruses. However, a weak inactivation factor (3.4 logs) was obtained for DNA nonenveloped viruses. The combination of high temperature with 3 M KSCN showed a high inactivation factor for all of the viruses studied. The total clearance factor was 23.1, 15.1, 13.6, 20.0 and 16.0 logs for sendaivirus, HIV-IIIb, human poliovirus type-II, human herpesvirus I and canine parvovirus, respectively.

In this review, we aim to introduce the reader to the technique of electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a focus on its biological and medical applications. We explain the theoretical and experimental aspects of the EIS with the details essential for biological studies, i.e interaction of metal electrodes with biological matter and liquids, strategies of increasing measurement rate and noise reduction in bio-EIS experiments, etc. We give various examples of successful bio-EIS practical implementations in science and technology: from the whole-body health monitoring and sensors for vision prosthetic care to single living cell examination platforms and virus diseases research. Present review can be used as a bio-EIS tutorial for students as well as a handbook for scientists and engineers due to extensive references covering the contemporary research papers in the field.

Dental institutions in the United States are reeling from the consequences of the novel SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, the causative agent of CODIV-19. As oral health care providers, we have been trained on prevention of aerosol transmissible diseases, but we are still grappling with many unknown factors regarding COVID-19.

This article discusses the challenges that we face currently and offers some simple strategies to bridge the gaps in dental education to overcome this emergency.

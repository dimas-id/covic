The incidence of legionnairesâ€™ disease (LD) seems to increase with age, particularly in males [36]. It was considered an infrequent cause of pneumonia in the past, but it currently ranks second to pneumococcus in the list of etiologic agents of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of bacterial origin [2, 24, 60, 89]. Considering less severe cases, in a series of 145 pneumonias in which BCYE culture, serology and the Legionella urinary antigen (LUA) test were systematically applied, Vergis et al. [91] reported a prevalence of LD of 13.7%. In another series of 392 adult patients with CAP treated in a university hospital, Sopena et al. found a prevalence of 12.5%, and LD was the second cause of pneumonia [83].

Background: Recent literature suggests that ocular manifestations present in people suffering from COVID-19. However, the prevalence and the type of ocular symptoms varies substantially, and most studies report retrospective data from patients suffering from more serious versions of the disease. Little is known of exactly which ocular symptoms manifest in people with milder forms of COVID-19. Methods: An online questionnaire obtained self-report data from people in the community, who reported to be inflicted with COVID-19. The type and frequency of different symptoms suffered during COVID-19 were obtained. Details of any pre-existing ocular conditions and the duration of symptoms of COVID-19 were ascertained. Results: Data from 132 participants showed that the four most reported COVID-19 symptoms were Dry Cough (63%), Fever (67%), Fatigue (83%), and loss of Smell/Taste (63%). 56% of the participants reported to having experienced an eye symptom, 46% reported to having a new or different eye symptom compared to pre-COVID-19 state. Three ocular symptoms (watery eyes, sore eyes, sensitivity to light) were significantly different from Pre-COVID-19 state (p<0.05). Logistic regression showed a significant association of eye symptoms with Fever (p=0.035). Conclusion: Nearly half of the sample of people studied experienced ocular symptoms. The significant ocular symptoms, indicative of viral conjunctivitis, might have been missed in patients with more serious manifestations of the disease. It is also important to differentiate between the types of ocular manifestation, as symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis (i.e. mucous discharge, gritty eyes) were not significant. Possible mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 infection within the eye are discussed.

Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) make use of rich and complex data about students and their learning activities to assist educators in understanding and making informed decisions about student learning and the design and improvement of learning processes. With the increase in the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of data on students, manual navigation and sense-making of such multi-dimensional data have become challenging. This paper proposes an analytical approach to assist LAD users with navigating the large set of possible drill-down actions to identify insights about learning behaviours of the sub-cohorts. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that it takes a process mining lens to examine and compare studentsâ€™ learning behaviours. The process oriented approach considers the flow and frequency of the sequences of performed learning activities, which is increasingly recognised as essential for understanding and optimising learning. We present results from an application of our approach in an existing LAD using a course with 875 students, with high demographic and educational diversity. We demonstrate the insights the approach enables, exploring how the learning behaviour of an identified sub-cohort differs from the remaining students and how the derived insights can be used by instructors.

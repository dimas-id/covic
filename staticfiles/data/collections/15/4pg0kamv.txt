The WHO considers non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as obesity, a major risk factor for becoming seriously ill with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) (1). A study by the UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre indicates that two thirds of people who developed serious or fatal COVID-19-related complications were overweight or obese (2). The report includes data from all COVID-19 admissions in intensive care units in the UK until midnight, March 19, 2020. The study shows that almost 72 % of those in critical care units are either overweight or with obesity suggesting the impact of obesity in seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

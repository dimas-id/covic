OBJECTIVE To study the functional outcomes of 30 patients who had previously undergone laparoscopic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction using videourodynamic (VUDM) assessment 180 days postoperatively. METHODS Between November 2010 and December 2013, 30 male patients had undergone laparoscopic radical cystectomy with bilateral standard pelvic lymphadenectomy and pure laparoscopic orthotopic ileal U-shaped neobladder diversion. The demographic data were as follows: median age, 67 years (range, 62-79); body mass index, 22.3 kg/m(2) (range, 16-26.1 kg/m(2)); and mean American Society of Anesthesiologists score 2.2 (range, 1-3). Functional outcomes were assessed performing a standard VUDM study combined with perineal floor electromyography 180 days postoperatively. RESULTS VUDM evaluations showed good functional outcomes of the reservoirs. Mean maximal neobladder capacity was 287 mL (range, 210-335 mL). Residual peristaltic activity was observed in all the individuals evaluated; however, only 9 of 30 individuals (30%) displayed severe peristaltic activity. Six of these 9 individuals (66.6%) experienced urinary leakage during these contractions. Mean postvoid residual volume was 44 mL (range, 0-105 mL), and peak flow rate was 13.9 mL/s (range, 9.7-29.2 mL/s). The Valsalva maneuver was positive in 5 of 30 subjects (17%). Bladder morphology assessed during contrast cystography showed the desired U-shape in all cases. Ureteral reflux was observed in 7 of 30 individuals (23.3%). CONCLUSION Based on VUDM, our study shows that U-shaped ileal neobladders achieved by a totally laparoscopic approach obtained good functional outcomes. These findings support the evidence that a minimally invasive approach does not impose technical limitations that negatively impact the surgical results.

This article examines how health news gets framed and the influence of exposure to news framed differently. A content analysis of Taiwanese newspapers indicates that health news in general, and H1N1 flu news in particular, is more likely to use alarm rather than coping frames. According to an experiment, exposure to H1N1 flu news in an alarm frame evokes greater fear and increases perceived severity and vulnerability, though it does not help develop prevention and treatment efficacy. A survey of the general public also shows that attention and exposure to televised news coverage of the H1N1 flu are associated with greater levels of worry and perceptions of the severity of and vulnerability to this health problem, but they are not related to issue knowledge, detection, or prevention efficacy. Thus, it is important for news coverage to provide information that increases the audience's efficacy when alerting it to health threats.

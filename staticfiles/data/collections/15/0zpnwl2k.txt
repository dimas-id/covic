OBJECTIVE: To report the understanding and decision-making of neuroimmunologists and their treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS: A survey instrument was designed and distributed online to neurologists in April 2020. RESULTS: There were 250 respondents (response rate 21.8%). 243 saw > = 10 MS patients in the prior 6 months (average 197 patients) and were analyzed further (92% USA, 8% Canada; average practice duration 16 years; 5% rural, 17% small city, 38% large city, 40% highly urbanized). Patient volume dropped an average of 79% (53â€“11 per month). 23% were aware of patients self-discontinuing a DMT due to fear of COVID-19 with 43% estimated to be doing so against medical advice. 65% of respondents reported deferring > = 1 doses of a DMT (49%), changing the dosing interval (34%), changing to home infusions (20%), switching a DMT (9%), and discontinuing DMTs altogether (8%) as a result of COVID-19. Changes in DMTs were most common with the high-efficacy therapies alemtuzumab, cladribine, ocrelizumab, rituximab, and natalizumab. 35% made no changes to DMT prescribing. 98% expressed worry about their patients contracting COVID-19 and 78% expressed the same degree of worry about themselves. > 50% believed high-efficacy DMTs prolong viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and that B-cell therapies might prevent protective vaccine effects. Accelerated pace of telemedicine and practice model changes were identified as major shifts in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Reported prescribing changes and practice disruptions due to COVID-19 may be temporary but could have a lasting influence on MS care.

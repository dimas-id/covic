OBJECTIVES This cross-sectional study examines the relationship of depression symptoms to periodontal diseases and decayed (D), missing (M) and filled teeth (FT) in a sample of the Jordanian population. METHODS Subjects escorting dental patients attending two dental hospitals in North Jordan were included. Each subject received full periodontal examination, including probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI). The numbers of M, D and F teeth were also recorded. The Zung Self-rating Depression Scale was used to determine susceptibility to depression. RESULTS The frequency of high susceptibility to depression among periodontitis-free subjects and those with periodontitis was found to be 48% and 50% respectively. There was no statistically significant association between susceptibility to depression symptoms and periodontal parameters, including PPD, CAL, PI and GI (P > 0.05). HOWEVER, SUBJECTS WITH LOW SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DEPRESSION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FT THAN SUBJECTS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEPRESSION. CONCLUSIONS High susceptibility to depression does not play a significant role in the aetiology and severity of periodontitis in the population studied.

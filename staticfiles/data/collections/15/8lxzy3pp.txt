Some nations in the world and some states in India have had more success in containing this pandemic. Recent efforts in strengthening the health sector have focused largely on reforms in modes of financing, but as the pandemic brings home to us, the main challenge in India remains the challenge of the organization of public services using a health systems understanding.

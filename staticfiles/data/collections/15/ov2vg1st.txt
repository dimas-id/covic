Peritoneal macrophages from genetically resistant C(3)H mice and genetically susceptible Princeton (PRI) mice adsorbed the MHV (PRI) strain of mouse hepatitis virus equally well. The difference between the permissive cells and the nonpermissive ones seems to reside in the ability of the former to "eclipse" the virus and, subsequently, support virus replication. C(3)H cells exposed to low multiplicities of the virus remained intact with no demonstrable viral replication. Virus, taken up by the resistant cells, was protected from heat and underwent slow inactivation while few or no virus particles were released into the medium.

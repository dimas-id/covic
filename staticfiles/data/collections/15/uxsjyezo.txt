Abstract There has been renewed interest in harnessing the power of the immune system as a countermeasure against infectious pathogens and cancers. One immune cell target in the development of these approaches is the γδ T cell. These cells are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses against infectious agents and cancers, and they migrate to, and reside in, mucosal tissues. γδ T cells exhibit a broad array of natural (or constitutive) and induced effector functions, including antigen presentation, that can be fine-tuned depending on their stimulation. They express unique antigen receptors as well as nonantigen, innate immune type surface receptors that can be targeted. In this chapter, we will review the biology and the basis for use of γδ T cells as a therapeutic target. We will then summarize novel plant- and microbe-derived materials that enhance γδ T cell activity in animal models and humans that can be used as a new strategy for mucosal vaccine development.

INTRODUCTION Influenza virus infections cause significant morbidity, and the unique ability of these viruses to undergo antigenic drift and shift means that it is critical for current laboratory assays to keep pace with these changes for accurate diagnosis. New subtypes have the potential to evolve into pandemics hence accurate virus subtyping is also essential. AREAS COVERED In this article, the authors review the current techniques available to detect influenza virus. EXPERT OPINION The biggest gains in improving on influenza diagnostics may lie in reappraising our current approach and optimizing all existing steps in influenza detection: pre-analytical, analytical, post-analytical. In addition, we must foster close collaboration between governments, surveillance networks and frontline diagnostic laboratories, and utilize advances in information technology to facilitate these interactions and to disseminate crucial information.

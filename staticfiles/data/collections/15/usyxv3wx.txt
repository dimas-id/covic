We present a case of 5 year-old female with funnel chest, by which cardiovascular structures were displaced into the left chest cavity. This caused left bronchial compression by the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, for which an external stenting was successfully performed. The patient had features suggestive of skeletal dysplasia with tracheobronchial malacia. One possible mechanism of vascular compression could be an association of fragility of the thoracic cavity and inspiratory dyspnea, causing thoracic deformity.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the repeatability of gallium-68 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic (DOTA)-D-Phe1-Try3-octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) positron emission tomography (PET) in neuroendocrine tumors. METHODS Five patients with neuroendocrine tumors were imaged with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET twice within 5 days. Maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) and kinetic parameters (K-Patlak and K-influx) of target lesions were measured. The repeatability of these measurements was investigated. RESULTS Forty-seven target lesions were identified on whole-body PET and 21 lesions on dynamic images. There was excellent repeatability with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.99 for SUVmax, SUVmean, and K-Patlak, and 0.85 for K-influx. The median absolute percent differences and the interquartile ranges (IQR) between 2 scans for SUVmax and SUVmean were 7.4% (IQR, 14.1%) and 9.3% (IQR, 10.6%), respectively. The median absolute percent differences for K-Patlak and K-influx were 12.5% (IQR, 12.6%) and 29.9% (IQR, 22.4%), respectively. The SUVmax of target lesions did not differ by more than 25% between the 2 scans. CONCLUSIONS 68Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging of neuroendocrine tumors is highly reproducible. A difference of more than 25% in SUVmax represents a change that is larger than the measurement error observed on repeated studies and should reflect a significant change in the biological character of the tumor.

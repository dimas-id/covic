We investigate the emerging scenarios from a two-population Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Asymptomatic-Symptomatic-Dead (SIRASD) model, where populations differ by their degree of compliance with social distancing policies. Considering the data of the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, where there is a significant stake of the population making their living in the informal economy and thus prone to not follow self-isolation, we assert that if the confinement measures are lifted too soon, namely as much as one week of consecutive declining numbers of new cases, it is very likely the appearance of a second peak.

To investigate the influence of the type of liver graft donation on donor mortality and morbidity. The clinical course of 87 living liver donors operated on at our center between 2002 and 2009 was retrospectively analysed and data pertaining to all complications were retrieved. No donor mortality was observed and no donor suffered any life-threatening complication. Four donors (4.6%) developed biliary leakage, nine (10.3%) had to be readmitted to hospital and six (6.9%) required some or other type of reoperation related to the previous liver donation. Reoperations included incisional or diaphragmatic hernia repair (n = 4), biliary leakage repair (n = 1) and segmental colon resection combined with diaphragmatic hernia repair (n = 1). There was a statistically significant difference in hospital stay (P < 0.001), autologous blood transfusions (P < 0.001) and operating time (P < 0.005) when right lobe donations (Segments V-VIII) were compared with left lobe (Segments II-IV) and left lateral lobe (Segments II-III) donations, whereas no difference was found between these groups regarding hospital readmission, operative revisions and the incidence or severity of complications. Right lobe donation was associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased blood transfusions and prolonged operating time when compared with left and left lateral lobe donation, whereas donor mortality and morbidity did not differ between these groups.

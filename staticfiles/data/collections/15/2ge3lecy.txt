The biosynthesis of fusion-competent envelope glycoproteins (GPs) is a crucial step in productive viral infection. In this issue, Klaus et al. (2013) identify the cargo receptor endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53) as a binding partner for viral GPs and a crucial cellular factor required for infectious virus production.

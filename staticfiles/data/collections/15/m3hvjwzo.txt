Familial Mediterranean Fever is a genetic disorder frequently diagnosed among the Arabs. It is also prevalent among Jews, Armenians and Turks. The clinical picture consists of febrile and painful attacks that differ in quality across patients and even within the same patient. There may be accompanying joint pain, chest pain, skin manifestations and other findings, and amyloidosis may occur in some patients as a complication. The primary treatment is Colchicine, which decreases the frequency of the attacks and prevents the occurrence of amyloidosis. The gene responsible for Familial Mediterranean Fever, MEFV, has been mapped and cloned and mutations were identified within its coding sequence. It encodes a protein that is expected to be a down regulator of inflammation. The spectrum of mutations in the Arabic population is partially studied. There are still several issues to be solved before we fully understand the disorder, and to enable us to confront it and decrease the morbidity and mortality inflicted by it.

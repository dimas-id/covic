BACKGROUND Total endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (TECAB) is currently performed exclusively with the help of a telemanipulator. After extensive practice in a biomechanical model, the operation was performed as a nonrobotic approach in an animal study. METHODS Six large domestic pigs were anesthetized and intubated. Port access and endoscopic vision were used exclusively during the intrathoracic procedure. In five animals, an internal mammary artery was harvested, extracorporeal circulation was established via peripheral vessel access, and the ascending aorta occluded with an intraluminal balloon. In cardioplegic arrest, an anastomosis of internal mammary artery and left anterior descending coronary artery was performed with shortened 7-0 monofil thread running suture. As a terminal study, the animals were humanely killed and the quality of the anastomoses was checked. RESULTS After a steady learning curve, the fifth animal was operated on successfully and a satisfactory anastomosis was documented. CONCLUSION Despite demanding differences to humans as shape of thoracic cavity and size of peripheral access vessels, the viability of the nonrobotic TECAB concept was documented in a living animal model.

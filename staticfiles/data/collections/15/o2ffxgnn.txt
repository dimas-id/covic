The health care provider faced with the management of a child with septic shock relies on a comprehensive understanding of the numerous disciplines embodied in the practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The child with septic shock may have simultaneous derangements in the function of virtually every system of the body including: cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, renal, coagulation, hepatic, metabolic and neurologic. The degree to which physiologic alterations are manifest in a given patient is variable and influenced by multiple host and non-host factors including: the developmental stage, the presence of co-morbidities, pathogen-related factors, and genetic influences on both the host inflammatory response as well as the response to pharmacologic agents, all combining to have a profound influence on outcome. The clinician must possess a systematic and multifaceted approach to these critically ill patients. The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive description of the epidemiology, biology and pathophysiology (at both the cellular and organ level) of sepsis, as well as outlining the current principles of managing septic shock. It will be apparent that optimal management requires a strong working knowledge of cardiovascular physiology, infectious diseases, multiple organ interactions, immunity, coagulation, pharmacology, and the molecular biology of inflammation.

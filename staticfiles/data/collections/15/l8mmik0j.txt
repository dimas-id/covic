INTRODUCTION Plasma exchange (PLEX) is effective in myasthenia gravis (MG), but there are concerns about its safety. METHODS We collected data prospectively from 42 patients randomized to PLEX treatment in a comparison study with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Detailed information on the PLEX treatment methodology and adverse events are reported. RESULTS Forty of 42 patients completed PLEX. Ninety percent were treated in an outpatient setting. Fifty-five percent had no complications, and 45% had mild-moderate reactions that did not require stopping treatment; the majority were citrate reactions and peripheral vascular issues that were easily treated. Fifty-seven percent of patients responded to treatment, and 83% completed PLEX via peripheral venous access. Two patients had severe adverse events: 1 related and 1 unrelated to PLEX. Comorbid disease and age did not predict reactions. CONCLUSION PLEX is safe, effective, and well tolerated in patients with MG. Our results do not raise concerns about the safety of PLEX in patients with moderate-severe MG.

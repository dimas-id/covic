BACKGROUND: China announced an outbreak of new coronavirus in the city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019; lash to now, the virus transmission has become pandemic worldwide. Severe cases from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in Wuhan were confirmed pneumonia with a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of genome selection and packaging is critical for developing antiviral strategies. Thus, we defined the correlation in 10 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) sequences from different countries to analyze the genomic patterns of disease origin and evolution aiming for developing new control pandemic processes. METHODS: We apply genomic analysis to observe SARS-CoV2 sequences from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 (China, C1), MN985325 (USA: WA, UW), MN996527 (China, C2), MT007544 (Australia: Victoria, A1), MT027064 (USA: CA, UC), MT039890 (South Korea, K1), MT066175 (Taiwan, T1), MT066176 (Taiwan, T2), LC528232 (Japan, J1), and LC528233 (Japan, J2) for genomic sequence alignment analysis. Multiple Sequence Alignment by Clustalw (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) web service is applied as our alignment tool. RESULTS: We analyzed 10 sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database by genome alignment and found no difference in amino acid sequences within M and N proteins. There are two amino acid variances in the spike (S) protein region. One mutation found from the South Korea sequence is verified. Two possible "L" and "S" SNPs found in ORF1ab and ORF8 regions are detected. CONCLUSION: We performed genomic analysis and comparative multiple sequences of SARS-CoV2. Studies about the biological symptoms of SARS-CoV2 in clinic animals and humans will manipulate an understanding on the origin of pandemic crisis.

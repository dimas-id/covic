Preliminary data suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with higher mortality among cancer patients, particularly in those on systemic therapy. It is unclear whether this applies to patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In this case series, 74 patients from a single institution with genitourinary (GU) cancer on ICI were followed up during a 12-wk period. During this period, 11 patients (15%) developed symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and four (5%) tested positive. Two patients had metastatic urothelial cancer (treated with atezolizumab) and two had metastatic renal cancer (treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab). All had additional risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and two received steroids within 1 mo of infection. Two patients developed symptoms requiring hospitalisation. All four are alive 32-45 d after their first symptoms and 28-38 d after testing positive. These patients all had multiple risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. These data suggest that the higher risk of COVID-19 death associated with systemic therapy in cancer may not apply to patients on ICIs. Assessment of COVID-19 severity in these patients can be complicated by the underlying cancer and its treatment.

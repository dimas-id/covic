PURPOSE Laparoscopic wedge resection of gastric submucosal tumor may be difficult in case of the endophytic mass or the mass located unreachable area such as cardia, and intragastric approach can be useful. We would present the experiences of the intragastric wedge resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS There were 7 patients diagnosed as gastric submucosal tumor and underwent the intragastric wedge resection at Surgery, Chungnam National University Hospital. We reviewed medical record. RESULTS There were 3 male and 4 female. Mean age was 65 years-old (57~73). Mean body mass index was 26.28 kg/m(2) (21.28~35.30). Location of lesions was 4 cardia, 2 fundus and 1 midbody, respectively. Mean operation time was 83.6 minutes (70~105). All patients were healed without any complication. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.4 days (4~6). Mean size was 2.7 cm (2.3~3.8). Pathologic finding was 5 gastrointestinal stromal tumor and 2 leiomyoma. CONCLUSIONS The single incision intragastric wedge resection of gastric submucosal tumor is feasible and acceptable, especially in mass of gastric upper part.

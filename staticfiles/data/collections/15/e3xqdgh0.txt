BACKGROUND The authors report their experience with single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy (SLS) and compare postoperative outcomes of conventional multiport laparoscopic splenectomy (MLS) with SLS in patients with spleen sizes ≤15 cm. METHODS Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were analyzed retrospectively and compared between patients who underwent MLS from June 20, 2006, to July 9, 2009 (MLS group, 18 patients) and those who underwent SLS from July 28, 2009, to November 2, 2010 (SLS group, 16 patients). RESULTS Blood loss was significantly greater in the SLS group than in the MLS group (206.25 ± 142.45 vs 111.11 ± 99.58 mL, respectively; P = .047). The Numeric Pain Rating Scale in the SLS group was significantly lower than in the MLS group (3.81 ± 0.91 vs 4.56 ± 1.29, respectively; P = .041). There were no significant differences between the groups for other variables. CONCLUSIONS SLS is a feasible method with good cosmetic benefit and equivalent clinical outcomes as compared with MLS.

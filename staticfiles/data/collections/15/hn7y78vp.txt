Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. With 1 million deaths reported in 1996, measles was the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths. However, in recent years, significant progress has been made in measles control, reducing deaths attributed to measles to 454,000 in 2004 and 242,000 in 2006. The main strategy behind this reduction has been the improvement of vaccination coverage and implementation of a second opportunity for immunization with the live-attenuated measles vaccine. The Measles Initiative, a partnership between the American Red Cross, CDC, UNICEF, WHO and UN Foundation, has had a significant role in this achievement. Here, we provide an overview of old and new vaccination strategies, and discuss changes in the route of administration of the existing live-attenuated vaccine, the development of new-generation nonreplicating measles virus vaccine candidates and attempts to use recombinant measles virus as a vector for vaccination against other pathogens.

Cardiovascular risk is assessed for the prediction and appropriate management of patients using collections of identified risk markers obtained from clinical questionnaire information, concentrations of certain blood molecules (e.g., N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide fragment and soluble receptors of tumor-necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-2), imaging data using various modalities, and electrocardiographic variables, in addition to traditional risk factors.

The present study aimed to examine the antioxidant properties of Houttuynia cordata (HC) and its protective effect on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. Results showed that aqueous extract of HC exhibited a different magnitude of antioxidant activities in all model systems tested. Although HC showed weaker free radical scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity than vitamin E, its anti-lipid peroxidation activity in rat liver homogenate was close to that of vitamin E. In animal studies, HC significantly decreased the levels of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, hydroxyproline, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, an increase in the concentration of catalase was noted in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. HC also remarkably improved the morphological appearance of the lung of bleomycin-treated rats. These results suggest that HC possesses a protective effect against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Interestingly, this protective effect was more pronounced than that of vitamin E. In conclusion, the protective effect of HC on pulmonary fibrosis could be partly associated with the reduction of oxidative damage caused by bleomycin.

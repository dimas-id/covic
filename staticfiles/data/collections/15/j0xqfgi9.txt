The transmission of infectious diseases depends on the social networks among people and the protections that people have taken before being exposed to the disease. Mass media is playing a key role in making the public aware of the disease and its transmissibility and severity. Motivated by the importance of heterogeneous risk perception in the population to response to infectious disease outbreaks, we propose a heterogeneous three-layer network model, namely the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Unaware-Aware-Protected (SEIR-UAP) model, where people's vulnerability to the disease is influenced by the processes of awareness information diffusion, preventive behavior change and infectious disease transmission. We found that (a) the awareness of the disease plays the central role in preventing disease outbreak; (b) we need a reasonable ratio of"over-reacting"nodes to effectively control the disease outbreak; (c) diseases with a longer incubation period and a higher recovery rate are easier to control because the processes of information diffusion and behavior change can help people prepare for the upcoming exposure to the disease; (d) it is more difficult to control the disease with asymptomatic cases. The results provide evidence that mass media should not play down the transmissibility and severity of diseases, so that the public can become aware of the disease as soon as possible.

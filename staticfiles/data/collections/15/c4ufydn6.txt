As Food is related to human survival and health, the country’s reputation and image, and the economic benefit and position in the international trade, it has become one of the hottest issues in the world now. As the continuous growth of world population, the constant changes of human life style and the continued deterioration of natural environment, higher requests for food safety are put forward by human society. Therefore, we should not only ensure the safety of quantity, but also to ensure the safety of quality in the food safety field by 2050. New concepts and technological means should be adopted to ensure the constant production and supply of the “green” and safe agricultural production to meet the people’s great need for food safety, nutrition and health.

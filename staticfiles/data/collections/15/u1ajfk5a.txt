During epidemics or pandemics affecting the respiratory systems, hospital equipment such as ventilators may become insufficient and different solutions can be considered In fast spreading respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 due to the rapidly increasing number of patients, ventilatory machine insufficiencies may appear It may be considered to use one hospital ventilator for more than one patient by dividing the airway of the machine with a specially designed splitter The aim of this study was to determine whether a ventilator can be modified to provide ventilation of two or more patients simultaneously by using 3D designed and manufactured splitters A two-port and four-port splitter were designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 computer program and manufactured by 3D printer using PolyJet technology (Stratasys J750) Two sets of splitters were used to adapt to the ventilator during trial process: one for inspiratory and one for expiratory outputs Two intensive care specialists voluntarily tried this study on themselves It was concluded from the study that 3D designed and manufactured two-port splitter can be used to separate the airway of a single ventilator to multiple patients within a very limited indication and time interval

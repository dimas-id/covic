After more than four months of the COVID-19 pandemics with genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe, there are more than 1000 complete genomes of this virus. We used 691 genomes from the GISAID database. Several studies have been reporting mutations and hotspots according to the viral evolution. Our work intends to show and compare positions that have variants in 30 complete viral genomes from South American countries. We classified strains according to point alterations and portray the source where strains came into this region. Most viruses entered to South America from Europe, followed by Oceania. Only Chilean isolates demonstrated a relationship to Asian isolates. Some changes in South American genomes are near to specific domains related to replication or S protein. Our work contributes to global understanding of which sort of strains are spreading throughout South American countries, and the differences among them according to the first isolates introduced in this region.

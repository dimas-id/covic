A case of pneumonia that requires ventilation, whether invasively or non invasively, is always a serious event associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in the elderly, even though it is often considered by the media as an infection that is “easy” to resolve. Why is this a controversial indication for NIV? Because there are observational studies that are absolutely against the use of NIV and a couple of randomized controlled trial in favor, in theory, but not necessarily in all cases of pneumonia or in all patients.

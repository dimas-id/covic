Structuring medical text using international standards allows to improve interoperability and quality of predictive modelling. Medical text classification task facilitates information extraction. In this work we investigate the applicability of several machine learning models and classifier chains (CC) to medical unstructured text classification. The experimental study was performed on a corpus of 11671 manually labeled Russian medical notes. The results showed that using CC strategy allows to improve classification performance. Ensemble of classifier chains based on linear SVC showed the best result: 0.924 micro F-measure, 0.872 micro precision and 0.927 micro recall.

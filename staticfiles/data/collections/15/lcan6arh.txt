We present the first report in the literature of a child with human metapneumovirus pneumonia who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for survival. This was a 3-month-old premature boy from British Columbia, Canada, who developed severe respiratory failure, experienced failure of high-frequency oscillatory mechanical ventilation, and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for 10 days. This case illustrates the importance of including this newly discovered pathogen among the causes of childhood pneumonia.

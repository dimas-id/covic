Accreditation is an internationally recognised process through which healthcare organisations are able to improve the safety and quality of services delivered to patients. The focus of accreditation is to help organisations understand what they are doing well and what opportunities are available for improvement. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient care. In 38 recent Canadian Accreditation AIM surveys, that included at least one surgical team, there were a total of 75 recommendations made to the teams. Most recommendations related to process as opposed to outcome issues, implying that surgeons need to become more proactive in the functioning of the surgical team and to participate more effectively in management issues related to surgical care. Attention to these details will position surgical programmes to effectively deal with the rapid pace of change that is inherent in a modern surgical practice

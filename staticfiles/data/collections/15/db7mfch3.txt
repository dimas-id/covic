PURPOSE The present study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) in elderly gastric cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study included 78 gastric cancer patients aged 80 years or above [39 in the LG group and 39 in the open gastrectomy group (matched)]. Patient characteristics, surgical outcomes, survival time, and immunonutritional status were compared. RESULTS Mean blood loss was significantly lower in the LG group, although the operation time did not differ. There were no significant differences in the number of dissected lymph nodes, postoperative morbidity, mortality, total hospital stay, and the causes of death. The prognostic nutritional index and skeletal muscle index at 1 year were better maintained in the LG group than in the open gastrectomy group. The overall and relapse-free survivals did not differ. CONCLUSIONS LG may be feasible in elderly patients with gastric cancer. A prospective randomized controlled trial should be conducted to confirm its efficacy.

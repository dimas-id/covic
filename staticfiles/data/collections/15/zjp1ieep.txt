From 26 January - 21 April 2020, 9 online courses for COVID-19 were published on OpenWHO.org. The courses are available in 18 different languages, totalling 53 learning resources and more than 1.5 million course enrolments. This paper analyses key trends in the growth of enrolments in these resources. The number of enrolments increased significantly between 26 January and 21 April, with distinct spikes in growth preceded by important global milestones in the timeline of the outbreak. The surge in users demonstrates that the platform is serving as a source of digitized learning for COVID-19, helping meet the broad demand for outbreak-related information.

OBJECTIVE To study the organism distribution and drug resistance of seven cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) death patients with secondary bacterial infection. METHODS Thirty strains of bacteria from seven cases of SARS patients with secondary bacterial infection were classified and drug resistance was analyzed. RESULTS Seven cases of SARS death patients were all infected secondly and 5 cases were polyinfection. Twenty-four (31.5 percent) of 76 examed samples were positive. There were 30 strains of bacteria isolated from seven cases of SARS death patients with secondary bacterial infection. There were 9 strains of Gram negative bacteria (GNB), 8 strains of Gram positive cocci (GPC), and 13 strains of Fungi. The sensitive rate of vancomycin to GPC was 100.0 percent. The sensitive rate of imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactan was 100.0 percent, 44.5 percent, respectively. The sensitive rate of fluconazole to fungi was 92.4 percent. CONCLUSION SARS patients are consitive to be infected secondary bacteria. Secondary bacteria infection is one of important reason of death.

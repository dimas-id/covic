The use of LigaSure™ vessel sealing system in head and neck surgery was reported to be reliable and safe, providing sufficient hemostasis and reducing operating time. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of this technique in patients undergoing selective neck dissections. This study was carried out as a prospective controlled study at an otolaryngology department of a tertiary medical center between July 2013 and July 2015. Twenty-five patients older than 18 years who underwent unilateral selective neck dissection for head and neck cancer were included in the study. In the control group (group 2, 10 patients) only monopolar and bipolar diathermy was used; in the Ligasure group (group 1, 15 patients) Ligasure was used for hemostasis and dissection in addition to the conventional techniques. Cervical lymphadenectomy time, operation time, preoperative hemoglobin levels, preoperative hematocrit levels, postoperative hemoglobin levels, postoperative hematocrit levels, total neck drainage and drain removal time were analyzed and compared between the groups. Median operation time in group 1 and 2 were 95 min (IQR = 35) and 142.5 min (IQR = 63), respectively. Median cervical lymphadenectomy time in group 1 and 2 were 55 min (IQR = 23) and 102.5 min (IQR = 49), respectively. Median operation time and cervical operation time were significantly lower in group 1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, LigaSure™ vessel sealing system is a safe, efficacious technique and significantly lowers cervical lymphadenectomy and operation time in selective neck dissections compared to controls. Given the superb hemostatic properties, this technique should be in the surgeon's armamentarium when possible.

Summary A central nervous system (CNS) disorder characterized by non-suppurative encephalomyelitis with neurological signs was induced experimentally in gnotobiotic pigs by intravenous and oral or intranasal inoculation of the porcine teschovirus (PTV) Toyama 2002 strain isolated from breeding pigs in Japan. Lesions consisting of perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, focal gliosis, neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia were observed in the brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. Non-suppurative ganglionitis in the spinal ganglion and neuritis in the spinal root were also observed. Regardless of the route of inoculation, all pigs infected experimentally with PTV showed a similar distribution of CNS lesions. Histological lesions in the CNS caused by oral or intranasal inoculation of the virus were mild compared with those induced by intravenous infection. Immunohistochemically, the distribution of PTV antigens corresponded closely with the distribution of brain lesions. PTV particles were detected via electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the spinal cord of inoculated pigs. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of PTV RNA in the CNS, tonsils and large intestines of 21 of the 22 pigs inoculated. Direct CNS invasion via the blood vessels appears to be a major route of infection for PTV. The gnotobiotic pig provides a useful model for further study of PTV pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND Experience with the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms by flow diverter devices (FDDs) is limited to four devices (Pipeline, Covidien; FRED, Microvention; Silk, Balt Extrusion; Surpass, Stryker), as reported in different studies. OBJECTIVE To describe the initial experience and the technical innovations of a new-generation FDD (p64 Flow Modulation Device, Phenox, Bochum, Germany). METHODS Between December 2014 and February 2015, six intracranial aneurysms in five patients (four women, one man; mean age 63 years) were treated with the p64 Flow Modulation Device. RESULTS Immediate post-treatment angiography showed reduced flow into all aneurysms. No long-term angiographic data are available. The device may be easily deployed and totally retrieved with a unique mechanical detachment. No periprocedural technical complications occurred. No early or delayed aneurysm rupture, no ischemic or hemorrhagic complications, and no neurological morbidity or death were seen. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of cerebral aneurysms with the p64 Flow Modulation Device is a safe procedure with no technical complications. The mechanical detachment and the 100% retrievability are significant advantages of this new device. However, large prospective studies with long-term clinical and angiographic follow-up are necessary to assess the role of the p64 in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW To provide an update on new developments in paediatric vasculitis. RECENT FINDINGS New classification criteria for childhood vasculitis have recently been proposed and are currently undergoing validation. Infectious triggers are still implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of Kawasaki disease and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Several genetic polymorphisms in vasculitides have now been described that may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications and newer therapeutic approaches such as biologic agents. However, new challenges are looming with regard to the role of inflammation in endothelial health and the long-term cardiovascular morbidity for children with primary systemic vasculitis. SUMMARY As our understanding of disease pathogenesis in vasculitis of the young has advanced, novel therapeutic approaches have been adapted. International multicentre collaboration is of great importance to further increase and standardize the scientific base of investigating and treating childhood vasculitis.

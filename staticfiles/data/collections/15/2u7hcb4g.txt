OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to ascertain the correlation between preserved pelvic nerve networks and bladder function after laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy. METHODS Between 2009 and 2011, 53 patients underwent total laparoscopic radical hysterectomies. They were categorized into groups A, B, and C based on the status of preserved pelvic nerve networks: complete preservation of the pelvic nerve plexus (group A, 27 cases); partial preservation (group B, 13 cases); and complete sacrifice (group C, 13 cases). To evaluate bladder function, urodynamic studies were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS No significant difference in sensory function was found between groups A and B. However, the sensory function of group C was significantly lower than that of the other groups. Group A had significantly better motor function than groups B and C. No significant difference in motor function was found between groups B and C. Results showed that the sensory nerve is distributed predominantly at the dorsal half of the pelvic nerve networks, but the motor nerve is predominantly distributed at the ventral half. CONCLUSION Various types of total laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomies can be tailored to patients with cervical carcinomas.

We describe Per Anal Endoscopic Rectopexy (PAER), a new treatment for complete rectal prolapse, which involves fixing the anterior rectal wall to the under-surface of the anterior abdominal wall and posterior rectal wall to the sacrum, through a submucosal tunnel (both endoluminally). This is a prospective single-centre pilot study done at a tertiary care centre. A total of 12 patients with a mean age of 48 years underwent the procedure. Constipation and incontinence were present in 8 and 4 patients, respectively and a significant improvement was seen in both following the procedure. A significant decrease in anorectal angle and its descent was also observed on post procedure magnetic resonance defecography. One patient had partial recurrence of prolapse. No major morbidity was observed. PAER is a minimally invasive and safe option for rectal prolapse, which needs to be validated in more patients over a longer follow up period.

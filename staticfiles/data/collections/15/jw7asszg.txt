Importance: With the rising number of COVID-19 cases, global health resources are strained by the pandemic. No proven effective therapies or vaccines for this virus are currently available. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, distinguishing between mild and severe patients as early as possible has become pivotal. Objective: To systematically review evidence for the risk factors of COVID-19 patients progressing to critical illness. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic databases. The American agency for health research and quality tool was used for quality assessment. A meta-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: Twenty articles (4062 patients) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First and foremost, we observed that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 infections. Second, compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had more serious symptoms such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, abnormal laboratory tests were more prevalent in severe patients than in mild cases, such as elevated levels of white blood cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, as well as decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review exploring the risk factors for severe illness in COVID-19 patients. Our study may be helpful for clinical decision-making and optimizing resource allocation.

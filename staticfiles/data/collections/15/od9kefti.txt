The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is using an automated short message service (SMS) application named 'Annie' as part of their COVID-19 response with a protocol for coronavirus precautions, which can help the Veteran monitor symptoms and can advise the Veteran when to contact their VA care team or a nurse triage line. We surveyed 1,134 Veterans on their use of the Annie application and coronavirus precautions protocol. Survey results support what is likely a substantial resource savings for the VA, as well as non-VA community healthcare. Moreover, the majority of Veterans reported at least one positive sentiment (felt more connected to VA, confident, or educated and/or felt less anxious) by receiving the protocol messages. The findings from this study have implications for other healthcare systems to help manage a patient population during the coronavirus pandemic.

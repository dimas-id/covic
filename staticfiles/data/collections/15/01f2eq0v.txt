BACKGROUND Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair has been accepted as a popular procedure for inguinal hernia repair, but surgeons still encounter technical difficulties owing to unfamiliar pelvic anatomy and limited working space. We sought to estimate the learning curve for laparoscopic TEP repair without supervision. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients scheduled for laparoscopic TEP repair of an inguinal hernia from December 2000 to October 2007. RESULTS We reviewed medical records for 700 patients. The cases were divided into 8 groups: 20 patients each in groups I-V and 200 patients each in groups VI-VIII. No significant difference in demographic characteristics was identified among the groups. The mean duration of surgery significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in relation to experience; it reached a plateau of less than 30 minutes (mean 28 min) after 60 cases. The mean length of stay in hospital was 0.97 days, reaching a plateau after 20 cases. Six patients were converted to other techniques: 1 patient each in groups III and VIII and 4 patients in group VII. Three recurrences were detected; however, 2 were excluded because the patient had bilateral inguinal hernias. CONCLUSION We estimate the learning curve for laparoscopic TEP repair is 60 cases for a beginner surgeon. The presence of an experienced supervisor during the first 60 cases can help prevent unnecessary complications and shorten the duration of surgery.

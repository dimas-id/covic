Isolation selective cerebral perfusion (ISCP) technique is reportedly an effective method for preventing brain complications during the treatment of arch aneurysms. Here we present the case of a patient with intracardiac disease complicated by mobile atheroma in the proximal aorta. In this patient, not only the arterial cannulation of the ascending aorta might have posed a high risk of brain stroke but also the original ISCP technique could not be applied. We applied the ISCP technique for non-aortic disease without using circulatory arrest to prevent aortogenic brain embolism. The patients who underwent treatment using this technique were discharged without neurologic complications.

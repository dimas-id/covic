In this study is demonstrated our experience in single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILS), compared to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were 48 single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies (SILS) performed during one-year period (A group) and results have been compared with a group of 50 patients who underwent standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (B group). Outcome measures included operative time, need for conversion, complications, additional analgesia for pain control after procedure, hospital stay and cosmetic outcome. The mean operative time was 46 +/- 3.5 min in A group, and 43 +/- 4 min in B patients group. Early postoperative complications were not detected. The mean hospitalization period was 2 days in both groups. Our experience suggests that SILS cholecystectomy can be performed with outcome similar to standard laparoscopic surgery while affording better cosmesis.

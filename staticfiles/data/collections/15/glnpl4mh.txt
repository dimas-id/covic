BACKGROUND Persistent urachal sinuses or fistulas are rare but may potentially cause various symptoms and lead to repeated operations. Both laparoscopic and open surgery have been used for the resection of the urachus. METHODS This report describes the first case of an external urachal fistula with recurrent infections and discharge of the umbilicus treated by complete resection using single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). This involved a laparoscopic single-incision three-trocar-technique, leaving the infected site of the umbilicus untouched. RESULTS Healing of the umbilicus was uneventful and complete. To date, the authors have not seen any recurrence of the fistula or its symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Remnants of the urachus should be considered in cases of recurrent infections or discharge of the umbilicus. The SILS procedure is an excellent option for the radical resection of the remnant urachus. Compared with the standard laparoscopic approach, it requires only one incision, decreasing the risks compared with those of several trocars. At the same time, the patient benefits from the better cosmetic result.

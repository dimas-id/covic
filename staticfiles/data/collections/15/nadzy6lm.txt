Abstract Asymptomatic but infectious people have been reported in many infectious diseases. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers would be a hidden reservoir of COVID-19. Aim This review identifies primary empirical evidence about the ability of asymptomatic carriers to infect others with COVID-19 pandemic and reflects on the implications for control measures. Methods A systematic review is followed by a narrative report and commentary inclusion criteria were: studies reporting primary data on asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients, who were considered to have passed on COVID-19 infection; and published in indexed journals or in peer review between January 1 and March 31, 2020. Results Nine articles reported on 83 asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons. Conclusions The evidence confirms COVID-19 transmission from people who were asymptomatic at the time. A series of implications for health service response are laid out. Keywords: Covid-19, Asymptomatic, Pre-symptomatic, Public Health

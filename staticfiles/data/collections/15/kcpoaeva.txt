This chapter presents representative photographs of common diseases in the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, appendix, and rectum. Most of the diseases discussed here are infectious or neoplastic; a few others appear that students should be able to identify. A few microscopic photographs are added to support the understanding of gross lesions.

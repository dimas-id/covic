Kawasaki disease (KD) has emerged as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed world. The cause of KD remains unknown, although an as-yet unidentified infectious agent might be responsible. By determining the causative agent, we can improve diagnosis, therapy and prevention of KD. Recently, identification of an antigen-driven IgA response that was directed at cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in KD tissues has provided new insights that could unlock the mysteries of KD.

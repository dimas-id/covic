Advances in biomedicine and other fields of science and technology depend on research teams and their peer-reviewed publications. The scientific literature represents an invaluable socioeconomic resource guiding future research. Typically, this growing body of information is explored by queries in bibliographic databases concerning topics of interest and by subsequent scrutiny of matching publications. This approach informs readily about content, but leaves the workforce driving the field largely unexplored. The hurdle can be overcome by a transparent team-centered analysis that visualizes the teams working in a field of interest and that delineates their genealogic and collaborative relations. Context-specific, but citation-independent metrics gauge team impact and reveal key contributors valuing publication output, mentorship and collaboration. The new insight into the structure, dynamics and performance of the workforce driving research in distinct disciplines complements ongoing efforts to mine the scientific literature, foster collaboration, evaluate research and guide future policies and investments.

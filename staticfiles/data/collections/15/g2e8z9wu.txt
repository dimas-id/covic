Hepatitis viruses are major threats to human health. During the last decade, highly diverse viruses related to human hepatitis viruses were found in animals other than primates. Herein, we describe both surprising conservation and striking differences of the unique biological properties and infection patterns of human hepatitis viruses and their animal homologues, including transmission routes, liver tropism, oncogenesis, chronicity, pathogenesis and envelopment. We discuss the potential for translation of newly discovered hepatitis viruses into preclinical animal models for drug testing, studies on pathogenesis and vaccine development. Finally, we re-evaluate the evolutionary origins of human hepatitis viruses and discuss the past and present zoonotic potential of their animal homologues.

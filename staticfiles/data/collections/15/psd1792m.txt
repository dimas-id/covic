Transanal endoscopic surgery has slowly gained widespread acceptance among colorectal surgeons, despite the need for specific training and the high costs of specialized instrumentation. At the other extreme, some laparoscopic surgeons recommend single port access surgery using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery was applied to perform transanal endoscopic microsurgery in a patient with T1 rectal cancer under spinal anesthesia. The patient was a 74-year-old man who presented with a 2-cm elevated lesion in the right anterior portion of the rectum. Ordinary laparoscopic instruments were used to perform submucosal resection. The tumor was completely excised from the rectal wall with the use of an ultrasonic surgical scissors. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 4 days after the operation. There was no fecal incontinence or soiling during the postoperative follow-up. Colonoscopy at 4 months after the operation showed no recurrence of either adenocarcinoma or adenoma.

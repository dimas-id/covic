Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an important pig pathogen that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, leading to serious damage to the swine industry worldwide. In this study, a nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) assay targeting the N gene of PEDV was developed and the sensitivity and specificity were investigated. Under the optimized conditions for detection of PEDV RNA, the nanoPCR assay was 100-fold more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay. The lower detection limit of the nanoPCR assay was 2.7×10−6 ng/μL of PEDV RNA and no cross-reaction was observed with other viruses. This is the first report to demonstrate the application of a nanoPCR assay for the detection of PEDV. The sensitive and specific nanoPCR assay developed in this study can be applied widely in clinical diagnosis and field surveillance of PEDV-infection.

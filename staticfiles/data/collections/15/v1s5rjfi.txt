By the end of March 2020, Spain was one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This commentary provides an initial picture of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak during its initial stage in Spain. Data of 3055 participants aged 18-88 years old were collected over a week (March 17th-24th 2020) using an online forms platform. Participants provided information regarding sociodemographic data and completed the Spanish version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, which assesses psychological distress caused by a traumatic life event in terms of three symptomatic responses (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal). Results revealed that 36.6% of participants showed psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Avoidance was the most prevalent symptom in the total sample and for all genders studied. The psychological impact was consistently higher for young people, and for women compared to men. Our data confirm the great psychological toll that the COVID-19 crisis took on the Spanish general population during the first week of confinement. Women and young people seem particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological impact of the pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

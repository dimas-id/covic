For both, plastic and hand surgeons it is crucial to act responsible, minimize the transmission of the virus and aid in reasonable and adequate allocation of resources for the treatment of affected patients during this pandemia. This article aims to provide an overview over the latest developments and insights that affect plastic and hand surgeons. At the same time plastic and hand surgeons are required to participate actively in the discussion of new regulatory measures that on one hand aim to ensure a proper medical care of COVID-19 patients and on the other hand need to guarantee coverage of all other patients. Furthermore exit - strategies after the pandemia need to be discussed by our societies.

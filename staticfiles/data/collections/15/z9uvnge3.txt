PURPOSE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association of the prevalence of depression and time since spousal loss in widowed people. METHODS The databases MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo were searched (May 2017) for papers reporting on time since spousal loss in widowed people and the prevalence of common mental disorders. A systematic review was conducted according to MOOSE guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses of the prevalence of depression were conducted by intervals of time since spousal loss. RESULTS The literature search identified 12,982 studies of which 22 were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Of these, 14 were furthermore eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The summary estimates found in the meta-analysis for the prevalence of depression in the intervals of time since spousal loss were: â‰¤ 1 month: 38.2% (21.9-55.8%); > 1 month to 3 months: 25.0% (17.3-33.5%); > 3 months to 6 months: 23.1% (18.0-28.7%); > 6 months to 12 months: 19.4% (15.2-24.0%); > 12 months to 18 months: 11.1% (5.3-18.7%); > 18 months to 24 months: 15.2% (12.3-18.2%); > 24 months to 60 months: 10.5% (4.3-18.5%). CONCLUSION Widowhood is associated with a high prevalence of depression and the study identifies a population group needing special attention in daily clinical practice. The prevalence is highest in the first month of widowhood, however, continues to be high at least 5 years into widowhood.

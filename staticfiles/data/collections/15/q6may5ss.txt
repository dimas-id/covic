OBJECTIVE To compare unmodulated, retrospective electrocardiographic (ECG) gating to prospective ECG gating with systolic acquisition for CT coronary angiography (CTCA) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), considering the radiation dose and the diagnostic confidence achieved with each technique. METHODS A retrospective service evaluation was conducted before and after prospective gating with systolic acquisition replaced retrospectively gated imaging for patients with AF undergoing CTCA at our institution. 25 consecutive patients were examined in each group. The scan parameters and radiation dose information had been collected in a prospective fashion. The image sets were read by blinded, expert readers who rated their diagnostic confidence using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS The radiation dose received by patients was significantly greater in the retrospectively gated group than those being scanned using prospective gating (21 vs 5.9 mSv, p < 0.01). The prospective gating technique was also associated with greater diagnostic confidence (mean, per-patient score 3.09 vs 3.78, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION Prospective gating with systolic acquisition appears to improve diagnostic confidence at a significantly reduced radiation dose compared with retrospective gating in patients with AF. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE The use of prospective gating with systolic triggering significantly reduces the radiation exposure to patients in AF undergoing CTCA. The same protocol also appears to improve diagnostic confidence.

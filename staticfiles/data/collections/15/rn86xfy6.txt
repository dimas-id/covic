Studies have shown that people who require single room isolation while in hospital often feel lonely, sad, worried, bored and in need of information. A literature review identified only 16 papers reporting on the child's experience of isolation. Findings indicate that children feel lonely, are scared of the personal protective equipment and feel bored. Patients' parents feel guilty, worried and under increased pressure to visit their children. It is also suggested that isolation may affect child development.

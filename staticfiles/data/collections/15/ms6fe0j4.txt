Last week’s noisy resignation of Mauro Ferrari as president of the €2 2 billion European Research Council (ERC)—the European Union’s foremost funder of basic research—revealed a rift over its approach to research on the coronavirus pandemic Ferrari’s departure, just 3 months into the job, also showed the limits of an ERC president’s power to influence the course of a funding agency that prides itself on its independence On 7 April, the same day Ferrari stepped down as ERC president and chair of its Scientific Council, he released a statement to the Financial Times, saying he had “lost faith in the system” and was upset by ERC’s unwillingness to set up a “special program” to address the COVID-19 pandemic But the next day, the 19 other members of the science council hit back In a sharp statement, the council said Ferrari “displayed a complete lack of appreciation for the raison d’être of the ERC ” It also suggested that Ferrari had neglected his duties to attend to personal projects in the United States It said the council unanimously called for his resignation on 27 March

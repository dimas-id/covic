BACKGROUND After pancreaticoduodenectomy, the Finnish binding pancreaticojejunal anastomosis (FBPJ) seems to reduce the risk for pancreatic fistula (POPF). Our aim was to investigate whether FBPJ is feasible and prevents the risk for POPF even after left pancreatectomy (LP). PATIENTS AND METHODS 47 consecutive patients underwent LP. 27 patients were recruited on the basis of CT and, of these, 16 patients were randomized on the basis of findings during surgery (transection line must be left of portal vein, as 2-3 cm pancreatic mobilization is required for FBPJ) to receive either Roux-Y FBPJ or hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant. RESULTS Only 34% (16/47) of the patients met the randomization criteria. Clinically significant POPF rate was higher in FBPJ group (60%) compared to thand-sewn closure group (13%; P<0.05). POPF rate in FBPJ group was higher even when compared to all patients with hand-sewn closure (60% versus 37%; P<0.05). Overall, FBPJ was technically feasible for only 28% of patients. CONCLUSION FBPJ cannot be recommended for the routine closure of the pancreatic remnant after LP, as it was not technically achievable in 72% of the cases. Moreover, the technique does not seem to reduce the risk for POPF compared to the hand-sewn closure.

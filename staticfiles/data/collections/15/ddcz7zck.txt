An improved, sensitive, specific, and rapid one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting the 5â€² untranslated region (UTR) was developed to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Based on an accelerating primer (AP), the present assay, named AP-LAMP, has the advantages of rapidity and sensitivity over the routine LAMP method. The possible AP-based amplification pathway during the reaction was revealed by restriction enzyme digestion and eletrophoresis. The detection limit of the AP-LAMP assay was approximately 84 IU/ml, and no cross-detection was observed. The assay was evaluated further with 126 clinical specimens, and the results indicated the suitability and simplicity of the test as a rapid diagnostic tool for detection of HCV RNA.

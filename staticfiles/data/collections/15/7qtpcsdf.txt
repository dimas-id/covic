The objective of this study was to describe the operative technique and outcome of a simplified laparoscopic gastropexy approach in dogs. Twenty-one dogs undergoing prophylactic laparoscopic gastropexy with a simple continuous barbed suture without incising the seromuscular layer of the stomach and transversus abdominis muscle were reviewed. In 20 cases, additional procedures were performed (18 ovariectomies and 2 prescrotal castrations); 1 dog had two prior episodes of gastric dilation without volvulus and underwent gastropexy with a prophylactic intent. The gastropexy procedure had a median duration of 33 min (range 19-43 min). V-Loc 180 absorbable and the V-Loc PBT nonabsorbable suturing devices were used in 8 and 13 dogs, respectively. Minor intraoperative complications occurred in four cases: broken suture (1), needle dislodgement (2), and folded needle (1). Minor complications included self-limiting wound complications (3), abdominal discomfort (2), vomiting (1), and inappetence (2). Postoperative abdominal ultrasound performed after a median of 8 mo (6-36 mo) confirmed permanent adhesion at the gastropexy site in all dogs. One dog developed a fistula (1 yr postoperatively) and another a granuloma (3 mo postoperatively), both at the gastropexy site. Prophylactic laparoscopic gastropexy may be performed with knotless unidirectional barbed suture without creating an incision on the abdominal wall and stomach.

Abstract In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year multicentre study intrathecally administered natural human fibroblast interferon (IFN-B) was effective in reducing exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with exacerbating/remitting disease. The mean reduction in exacerbation rate of 34 patients who received IFN-B (recipients) was significantly greater during the study than that of 35 patients who received placebo (p <0.04). The prestudy exacerbation rates were comparable in recipients and controls, but the rate at the end of the study was significantly lower in recipients than in controls (p <0.001). IFN-B was given by nine or ten lumbar punctures over the first 6 months of the study, and patient observations continued for 2 years. IFN-B was well tolerated in 95% of the recipients, and the side-effects experienced were clearly acceptable for the benefits achieved. Low doses of indomethacin reduced the toxicity of IFN-B and played an important role in successful double-blinding.

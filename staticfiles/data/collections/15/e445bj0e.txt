For last months, humanity has faced a formidable unknown enemy, which is presented as a new coronavirus infection. Despite the fact that the causative agents of new diseases appear at a certain frequency and that the virus SARS-CoV-2 has certain common properties with its predecessors, at the moment we are dealing with a new unknown pathogenesis of the development of severe complications in patients with risk factors. A final understanding of pathological process mechanisms is the goal of the scientific community. Summarizing research data from different countries, it became obvious that in severe cases of viral infection, we are dealing with a combination of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Thrombotic microangiopathy is represented by a group of different conditions in which thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiple organ failure occur. The article reflects the main types of TMA, pathogenesis and principles of therapy. The main participants in the process are described in detail, including the von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS-13. Based on the knowledge available, as well as new data obtained from patients with COVID-19, we proposed possible models for the implementation of conditions such as sepsis, TMA, and DIC in patients with severe new coronavirus infection. Through a deeper understanding of pathogenesis, it will be possible to develop more effective diagnosis and therapy.

Objective: Screening for novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis among the patients with coronavirus disease-19. Methods: Prospective series case study. Eighty-one patients diagnosed as coronavirus disease-19 in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Hospital were enrolled with ophthalmological consultation screening for novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis, including the inquiring of eye symptoms and checking for conjunctivitis-related signs. Conjunctival swab novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed on patients with clinical manifestation of conjunctivitis. Results: Only 3 of the 81 patients (3.70%) complained of eye discomfort, which appeared on the day 16.67Â±9.29 after the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19. The eye signs did not meet the characteristics of viral conjunctivitis. Bilateral conjunctival swab novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests were negative. There was no evidence to support the diagnosis of novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis. Screening of clinical symptoms and signs of conjunctivitis in the remaining 78 patients showed no significant abnormalities. Conclusions: There wasn't any novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis in 81 patients with coronavirus disease-19.(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56:).

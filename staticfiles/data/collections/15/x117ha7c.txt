The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a call that psychologists must answer with a dynamic, integrated mental health response that incorporates public education and dissemination, training, research, and service. These areas are central components to our mission at the Clinical-Disaster Research Center, housed in the Department of Psychology at the University of Mississippi and part of the university's doctoral training program in clinical psychology. We discuss some of our efforts in each of these areas in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the hope that the information may be of use to psychologists assuming a range of professional responsibilities.

AKT1, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a critical role in the controlling of intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this study, we investigated whether polymorphisms in AKT1 affect susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms of AKT1, IVS3+18C>T and +726G>A were genotyped in Chinese patients with pulmonary TB by polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment length polymorphism. Patients with pulmonary TB had significantly lower IVS3+18 C/C genotype and higher C/T genotype compared with age‐, gender‐ and ethnically matched controls (P < 0.05). The T–A haplotype frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our result indicates that AKT1 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to pulmonary TB.

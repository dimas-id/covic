Intelligent systems of simulation become a key stage of the scheduling of companies and industries work. Most of the existing decision support systems are desktop software. Today there is a need to use durability, flexibility, availability and crossplatforming information technologies. The paper proposes the idea of working cloud based decision support system BPsim.Web and this one consists of some set of services and tools. The model of the multiagent resources conversion process is considered. The process of the simulation model developing via BPsim.Web is described. An example of the real process model is given.

In order to diagnose the infectious disease from clinical samples, the various protocols such as culturing microorganism, rapid diagnostic test using chromatographic method, ELISA, conventional PCR are developed. Since a novel strain of avian influenza can be cross-infected human as well as birds and livestock due to genetic reassortment, some strains of influenza such as H7N9 and H5N1 have emerged as a severe virus which can be threaten the health of poultry as well as human. Therefore, we explored the development of simultaneously and rapid diagnostic tool for seasonal influenza (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (A/H5N1, A/H7N9). We analyzed the unique nucleotide sequences of influenza types including three seasonal influenza, A/H7N9, and A/H5N1, and distinguished each type of influenza and diagnosed through One Step RT-PCR. In the results, Chip-based PCR technique can be diagnosed rapidly and directly from naked eye with EvaGreen the influenza also respiratory specimens within 23 min 15 s, including reverse transcription. The Chip-based PCR is a point-of-care system, and it is expected to reduce diagnosis time and to develop a diagnostic kit. Furthermore the Chip based PCR technique can be used for high risk pathogen in bioterror and/or biological warfare in the field.

Extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation provides pulmonary and/or cardiac support over a limited period of time for severe reversible cardio pulmonary diseases. It is an invasive technique with large risks associated but an improved survival rate of around 80%. It has strict selection criteria for neonatal and pediatric patients. The main complications are hemorrhage, stroke, convulsions, cardiac failure, kidney failure, arterial hypertension, and hemolysis. Extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation must be implemented only in high-complexity neonatal and pediatric centers with trained personnel.

Abstract The current study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient-related delay with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at a tertiary center in the United Kingdom. The study demonstrated a significant delay in symptom-to-first medical contact and a higher cardiac troponin-I level on admission in patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic versus the pre-COVID era.

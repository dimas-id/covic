Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare chronic renal infection characterized by the destruction of renal parenchyma. Traditional treatment involves open radical nephrectomy, which is challenging due to the inflammatory process associated with XGP. More recently, laparoscopic nephrectomy has been employed successfully in adult XGP. We present a case of a six-year-old female child with XGP who was successfully treated by laparoscopic nephrectomy with minor complications. Our case demonstrates the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic nephrectomy for childhood XGP, indicating that it should be considered a management option in such cases.

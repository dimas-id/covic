Sutton et al. [1] recently reported on universal testing with nasopharyngeal swabs to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection in 215 women admitted for delivery at the Presbyterian Allen Hospital in New York, USA. They identified 33 (15.3%) infected women, of whom only four had fever or symptoms suggesting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These findings suggest that only universal testing can reliably recognize infected cases. However, this approach is only feasible in major hospitals in high-resource countries with efficient lab facilities in-house. Alternative approaches deserve consideration.

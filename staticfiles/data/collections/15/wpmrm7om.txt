BACKGROUND Future shortages in platelet supply are expected in Germany due to demographic changes. A rising cancer incidence will lead to an increasing demand for platelet concentrates (PCs) while the number of potential donors will decrease. Pathogen inactivation (PI) aims to inactivate various infectious agents including emerging pathogens to extend the shelf-life of PCs and reduce the frequency of acute transfusion reactions (ATRs). In this context, the clinical and economic impact of PI on platelet transfusion was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Model calculations were conducted for 2 scenarios considering different production settings. Frequencies of ATRs were based on literature analyses, platelet and ATR costs on cost analyses. RESULTS The estimated average costs for ATRs of grade 1 and 2, irrespective of origin, and grade 3 (allergic) were € 104, € 238, and € 1,200, respectively. Approximately 400 PC-related ATRs per 10(5) transfusions can be avoided, with estimated savings amounting to € 77,000. The total cost increase was calculated to approximately € 30-50 per PI-treated PC. CONCLUSION PI potentially saves plasma, prolongs shelf-life, decreases donor deferral, and reduces ATRs. Model calculations considering clinical and safety benefits of PI show a rational cost increase. The impact of PI should be further evaluated from a societal perspective regarding future blood supply and infectious disease globalization.

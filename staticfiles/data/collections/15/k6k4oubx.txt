Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid/protein complex synthesized by the alveolar epithelium and secreted into the airspaces, where it coats and protects the large respiratory air-liquid interface. Surfactant, assembled as a complex network of membranous structures, integrates elements in charge of reducing surface tension to a minimum along the breathing cycle, thus maintaining a large surface open to gas exchange and also protecting the lung and the body from the entrance of a myriad of potentially pathogenic entities. Different molecules in the surfactant establish a multivalent crosstalk with the epithelium, the immune system and the lung microbiota, constituting a crucial platform to sustain homeostasis, under health and disease. This review summarizes some of the most important molecules and interactions within lung surfactant and how multiple lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions contribute to the proper maintenance of an operative respiratory surface.

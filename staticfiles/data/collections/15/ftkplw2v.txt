Summary At a concentration of 2 Î¼g/ml, neither amphotericin B nor deoxycholate had an inactivating effect upon transmissible gastroenteritis Coronavirus in-fectivity. However, amphothericin B stimulated plaque formatin in agarose and facilitated the entry of viral RNA into swine testis cells. The combination of amphotericin B + deoxycholate inactivated virus infectivity and induced a decrease in plaque diameter. Finally, in the presence of these agents, the production of infectious virus and interferon was unchanged.

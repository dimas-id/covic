GOALS We sought to determine the incidence of jackhammer esophagus (JE) after lung transplantation (LT) and identify potential risk factors for the development of JE after LT. BACKGROUND JE is a rare esophageal motility disorder, and its pathophysiology remains unclear. Lung transplantation has been implicated as a potential risk factor for JE, but the incidence of JE after LT is unknown. STUDY A retrospective cohort of adult patients who underwent LT at 2 tertiary care centers over 7.5 years was reviewed. Analysis was performed on patients who underwent a high-resolution esophageal manometry (EM) study before and after LT. JE was defined according to the latest Chicago classification, version 3.0. RESULTS A total of 57 patients without JE identified on pre-LT EM also underwent an EM study after LT. Fifteen (25.4%) were found to have new JE after LT. Patients with newly diagnosed JE after LT were older (61.3±5.3 y vs. 51.6±15.6 y; P=0.02) and more often had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 47.6% vs. 16.6%; P=0.03) compared with those without COPD. There was a trend toward increased risk for JE among female individuals (60% vs. 33.3%; P=0.07) and those with shorter surgical anastomosis times (75.8±12.2 min vs. 84.4±14.3; P=0.06). There was no significant difference between body mass index, opioid use, pretransplant EM findings, surgical ischemic time, occurrence of gastroparesis, or measured post-LT outcomes between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS JE occurs not uncommonly in patients after LT. Older age and COPD pre-LT may be significant risk factors.

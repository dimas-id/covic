Although inadequate immunization is a significant public health problem, as covid-19 is an urgent reminder, it has been largely ignored in amateur youth sports. By comparison, safety issues such as concussions have drawn extensive concern. This article examines the case for immunizing athletes who participate in amateur sports for youth. It begins with risks of transmission and current gaps in addressing immunization of amateur athletes. It then considers arguments for immunization, along with objections to immunization requirements for participation. The article concludes that amateur youth sports organizations must pay far more attention to immunization than they currently do, have published policies about immunization, inform participants of these policies, and educate athletes, coaches, and officials about contagion risks.

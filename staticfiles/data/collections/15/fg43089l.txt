To reduce pulmonary complications after esophagectomy, the transthoracic procedure should be shortened or totally avoided. Transcervical approach assisted by mediastinoscope for the upper mediastinum may be advantageous for this purpose. We carried out video-assisted transcervical mediastinal dissection (VATCMD) as part of totally non-transthoracic radical esophagectomy. A single-port laparoscopy device was adopted to a small cervical incision and the mediastinum was inflated with a positive pressure of 6 to 10 mmHg. Without assistant's retractor, the upper mediastinum and partially the middle mediastinum were dissected mainly by mediastinoscopic-assisted surgery. Video of the operation is demonstrated with illustrations. We have carried out and reported 17 cases of esophagectomy including VATCMD and its perioperative outcome. Non-transthoracic esophagectomy was completed without conversion to transthoracic procedure in all 17 cases. Procedure-related adverse event was not observed and postoperative course was favorable with a zero occurrence (0%) of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, chyle leakage or pulmonary complications. Median number of harvested lymph nodes from the upper mediastinal stations was 10. VATCMD is suggested as a safe and feasible approach for the upper mediastinum in esophagectomy for malignancies. It enabled a totally non-transthoracic radical esophagectomy in combination with a transhiatal approach.

Acute gastroenteritis is among the most common illnesses of human beings, and its associated morbidity and mortality are greatest among those at the extremes of age; children and elderly. During the 1970s, several viruses were associated with this syndrome, which are now known to be caused mainly by viruses belonging to four distinct familiesâ€”rotaviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses. Other viruses, such as the toroviruses, picobirnaviruses, coronavirus, and enterovirus 22, may play a role as well. Transmission by food or water has been documented for astroviruses, caliciviruses, rotaviruses, and norovirus. In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a common cause of death in children <5 years, while deaths from diarrhea are less common, much illness leads to hospitalization or doctor visits. Laboratory confirmation of waterborne illness is based on demonstration of virus particles or antigen in stool, detection of viral nucleic acid in stool, or demonstration of a rise in specific antibody to the virus. Newer methods for syndrome surveillance of acute viral gastroenteritis are being developed like multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCRs. Application of these more sensitive methods to detect and characterize individual agents is just beginning, but has already opened up new avenues to reassess their disease burden, examine their molecular epidemiology, and consider new directions for their prevention and control through vaccination, improvements in water quality, and sanitary practices.

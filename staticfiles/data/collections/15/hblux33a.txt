The aim of this review was to propose multi-pronged resumption strategies for lacrimal practice in an effort to plan a sustainable recommencement of elective surgeries after we emerge from the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies for lacrimal practice were classified into 7 subtypes, and each of the blueprints were reassessed based on existing information on resumption strategies of elective surgeries from other specialties in COVID-19 era. The specific needs of lacrimal practice were then added to construct algorithms summarizing the resumption strategies. The basic principle of 'primum non nocere' needs to be followed. The overall proposed plan advocates the transition to a more sustainable health care reality in a world where we would still co-exist with COVID-19. A comprehensive effort involving screening, laboratory testing, appropriate triage, effective personal protection and specific precautionary measures for lacrimal clinics and operating room are needed to be able to safely resume elective surgery when the pandemic peak declines. To predict the timing of the resumption of elective surgeries is quite complex and influenced by several geographic, political and economic factors. It is equally important to remember that COVID-19 crisis is a dynamic situation and constantly evolving, hence the strategies provided are subject to change. Strict adherence to standard COVID-19 guidelines combined with effective testing and personal protection strategies can ensure slow yet smooth and safe return to full lacrimal practice after the COVID-19 pandemic calms down. The local government directives, individual and institutional discretion are advised.

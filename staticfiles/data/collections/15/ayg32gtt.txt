The biological record suggests that life on Earth arose as soon as conditions were favorable, which indicates that life either originated quickly, or arrived from elsewhere to seed Earth. Experimental research under the theme of “astrobiology” has produced data that some view as strong evidence for the second possibility, known as the panspermia hypothesis. While it is not unreasonable to consider the possibility that Earth’s life originated elsewhere and potentially much earlier, we conclude that the current literature offers no definitive evidence to support this hypothesis. Chladni’s view, that they fall from the skies, pronounced in 1795, was ridiculed by the learned men of the times. (Rachel, 1881) Evidence of life on Mars, even if only in the distant past, would finally answer the age-old question of whether living beings on Earth are alone in the universe. The magnitude of such a discovery is illustrated by President Bill Clinton’s appearance at a 1996 press conference to announce that proof had been found at last. A meteorite chipped from the surface of the Red Planet some 15 million years ago appeared to contain the fossil remains of tiny life-forms that indicated life had once existed on Mars.

Massive viral outbreaks draw attention to viruses that have not been thoroughly studied or understood. In recent decades, microfluidic chips, known as "lab-on-a-chip", appears as a promising tool for the detection of viruses. Here, we review the development of microfluidic chips that could be used in response to viral detection, specifically for viruses involved in more recent outbreaks. The advantages as well as the disadvantages of microfluidic systems are discussed and analyzed. We also propose ideas for future development of these microfluidic chips and we expect this advanced technology to be used in the future for viral outbreaks.

OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes respiratory failure in patients with extensive pulmonary parenchymal involvement, but it is a rare cause of ARDS. We report our experience of TB presenting with ARDS. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 187 patients admitted with a diagnosis of ARDS over the previous 7 years. Data are presented in a descriptive fashion using mean±SD or median (range). RESULTS: Nine (4.9%) of 187 patients had ARDS secondary to tuberculosis. All patients were mechanically ventilated. The diagnosis was made on clinico-radiological grounds and confirmed later using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy in seven patients, and lymph node biopsy and examination of the joint aspirate in the remaining two. All patients were empirically started on anti-tubercular therapy with a median time to initiation of therapy being 3 days (range 2–8 days). Three patients had multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) without any evidence of bacterial infection. Seven of nine (77.8%) patients survived; two died because of severe ARDS, MODS, and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is an uncommon but definite cause of ARDS, and in patients with ARDS of obscure aetiology where the clinical features suggest tuberculosis as the inciting cause, antitubercular therapy should be started empirically and the diagnosis actively pursued later.

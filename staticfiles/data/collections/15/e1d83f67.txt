Salvage surgery after gefitinib therapy in a 66-year-old female with cT4N1M1a lung adenocarcinoma in the right middle lobe, which had gene mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor, is presented. The patient had bulky hilar lymph nodes, pleural dissemination, and pulmonary metastases in the ipsilateral lobes. After 3 courses of chemotherapy, the patient was treated with gefitinib, resulting in partial response, i.e. only the primary tumor and the middle lobe atelectasis remained. We performed the middle lobe lobectomy aimed at local control and pathological confirmation of the remaining tumor. Because the hilum of the middle lobe was occupied with scar tissue, its pulmonary vein had to be cut within the pericardium and its pulmonary artery and bronchus had to be transected simultaneously with a stapler. Pathological stage was yp-T2aN0N0 with Ef 2. For salvage surgery after good response to gefitinib therapy, it should be taken care to expose pulmonary vessels.

OBJECTIVE To present seven cases of single incision laparoscopic nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy in children as a recent videoscopic innovation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Seven children with nonfunctioning kidneys, three with multicystic dysplastic kidneys, two with end-stage renal nephropathy due to vesicoureteral reflux, and two with giant hydronephrosis were qualified to nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy. The surgery was performed transperitoneally using single incision access laparoscopy. The operative time was in the range of 50-90 min. RESULTS There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patients were discharged on the third postoperative day. The incision scars were hidden inside the umbilicus. CONCLUSIONS Nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy using a single transumbilical port in children is a feasible and efficacious technique. The advantages are shortened convalescence, excellent cosmetic results, and reduction of potential wounds complications. However, clear indication of single site laparoscopic procedures in children remains to be clarified.

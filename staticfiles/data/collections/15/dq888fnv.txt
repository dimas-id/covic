PURPOSE To compare a surgically adjusted dose of strabismus surgery using topical anesthesia in cooperative patients with dosage guidelines adapted to the surgeon's personal technique using sub-Tenon's anesthesia. DESIGN Randomized, controlled, single-site clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS Sixty patients with nonparalytic, nonrestrictive esotropia who were cooperative for surgery under topical anesthesia. METHODS Twenty-eight patients were assigned to topical anesthesia, and 32 patients were assigned to sub-Tenon's anesthesia. Visual acuity, refraction, and deviation angle were determined in all patients preoperatively and postoperatively, and stereoacuity was measured postoperatively. Deviation angle was measured by simultaneous and alternate prism and cover test, and stereoacuity was measured using Randot circles (Stereo Optical Co., Chicago, IL). The amount of surgery under topical anesthesia was adjusted intraoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The amount of surgery used in the 2 treatment groups (measured in millimeters and millimeter/degree of deviation angle) and 6-month motor and stereoacuity outcomes. RESULTS Patients in the topical group required 3.2 mm less surgery on average than those in the sub-Tenon's group (5.9 and 9.1 mm, respectively; 0.4 and 0.6 mm of recession/degree, respectively) (P<0.01). Motor success (84% and 75%, respectively, P=0.38) and stereoacuity (339.6 and 323.9 arc seconds, respectively, P=0.87) at 6 months were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Topical anesthesia requires a smaller amount of surgery and number of operated muscles to correct esotropia compared with classic surgery guidelines adapted to the surgeon's personal technique.

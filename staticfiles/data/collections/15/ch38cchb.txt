Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the cardio-pulmonary function of pregnant women, the anesthetic management and protection of medical staff in the cesarean section is significantly different from that in ordinary surgical operation. This paper reports a case of cesarean section for a woman with COVID-19, which was successfully performed in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine on February 8, 2020. Anesthetic management, protection of medical staff and psychological intervention for the pregnant woman during the operation were discussed. Importance has been attached to the preoperative evaluation of pregnant women with COVID-19 and the implementation of anesthesia plan. For moderate patients, intraspinal anesthesia is preferred in cesarean section, and try to reduce its influence in respiration and circulation in both maternal and infant; general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation should be adopted for severe or critically ill patients. Ensure the safety of medical environment, and anesthetists should carry out level-â…¢ standard protection. Special attention and support should be paid to maternal psychology: fully explanation before operation to reduce anxiety; relieve the discomfort during operation, so as to reduce tension; avoid the bad mood due to pain after operation.

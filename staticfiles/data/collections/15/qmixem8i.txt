Abstract COVID-19 is a new highly infectious disease with an incompletely described clinical course, which has caused a pandemic, with Europe being identified as the third epicentre. COVID-19 has placed unprecedented pressure on critical care services which is likely to stretch resources beyond capacity. The situation is exacerbated by increased staff absence from self-isolation and illness, increased referral of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who develop respiratory failure, and limited availability of Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) services. In addition, there is the ongoing challenge of patients being transferred between departments and hospitals for ongoing care. In consequence, as current needs continue to rise, innovative approaches are needed to redress shortages and support the continuance of services. This article provides an overview of severe COVID-19 infection, outlining treatment strategies and nursing processes that will need to develop and extend in response to this evolving situation.

The standard of care for treatment of Barrett's esophagus (BE) with early esophageal neoplasia, including high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMC), has undergone a revolution over the past several years. With the introduction and popularization of endoscopic ablative technologies, along with the refinement of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) techniques, the majority of cases of early neoplasia in the setting of BE now are managed by endoscopic approaches. As a result, many patients who previously would have been referred for esophagectomy now may be spared from this major surgical procedure with its inherent morbidity, potential for mortality, and negative impact on long-term gastrointestinal function. The esophageal surgeon must be knowledgeable about the indications for such endoscopic therapies, as well as their limitations and potential pitfalls, so as to apply them in the appropriate clinical scenarios.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a childhood leukemia for which allogeneic BMT is the only curative therapy. At our pediatric stem cell transplantation unit, we performed 26 BMTs in 23 children (age 0.5–12.7 years). Conditioning was CY/TBI based (1980–1996, n=14) or BU/CY/melphalan based (1996–2001, n=9). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (n=11), unrelated volunteers (n=9) or mismatched family members (n=3). A total of 10 patients survive in CR (median follow-up 6.8 years, range 3.1–22.2 years). Relapse or persistent disease was observed in eight and two patients, respectively. Nine of these patients died, one achieved a second remission following acute nonlymphatic leukemia chemotherapy (duration to date 5.3 years). Transplant-related mortality occurred in four patients. Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 43.5%. Using T-cell-depleted, one-antigen mismatched unrelated donors was the only significant adverse factor associated with relapse in multivariate analysis (P=0.039, hazard ratio 4.9). Together with a trend towards less relapse in patients with graft-versus-host-disease and in patients transplanted with matched unrelated donors, this suggests a graft-versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic BMT in JMML.

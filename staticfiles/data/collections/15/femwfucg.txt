The collaboration of blood transfusion service in the management of severely combat-injured individuals has proved to be an essential factor for the successful treatment of these patients. While the operating and anesthesiology teams are engaged in maintaining the vital signs and controlling blood loss of the injured, the transfusion service representatives follow the information on the amount of blood products given and the latest laboratory tests, as well as provide consultations regarding further blood component requirements on the basis of data obtained. A major effort of the treating team should be aimed at diagnosis and correction of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia. For the massively bleeding combat trauma injured, which can amount to as high as 8% of all trauma patients, a generous use of plasma at a one-to-one ratio with packed cells, along with the early addition of platelets and cryoprecipitates, should be considered. Early point-of-care thromboelastography is helpful for identification of coagulopathies. The use of a preset massive transfusion protocol is beneficial; however, it should be tailored according to the patient’s actual needs, depending on the type of injury and the individual’s general condition.

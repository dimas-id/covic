Mortality of 20% of a flock of 1000 chukar partridge chicks occurred over a 6-week period in Northern California from August to September 2012. Affected birds were 2 to 42 days old and died without premonitory clinical signs or after showing ruffled feathers and anorexia for 24 to 72 hours. Three carcasses were submitted for necropsy, 2 birds had hemorrhagic tracheitis grossly, and all 3 had lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic myocarditis with myocardial necrosis microscopically. The differential diagnoses and the diagnostic workup to achieve a final diagnosis are discussed. The detection of 2 zoonotic agents in these birds makes this an interesting case from a public health perspective.

Recent analysis concerning the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) receptor interaction in enterocytes, the definition of gut-lung axis, as well as the molecular basis of sialic acid-related dual recognition concept in gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection, have brought a new perspective to potential therapeutic targets. In this review evolving research and clinical data on gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed in the context of viral fusion and entry mechanisms, focusing on the different triggers used by coronaviruses. Furthermore, it is emphasized that the viral spike protein is prevented from binding gangliosides, which are composed of a glycosphingolipid with one or more sialic acids, in the presence of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. In gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection the efficiency of these repositioned drugs is debated.

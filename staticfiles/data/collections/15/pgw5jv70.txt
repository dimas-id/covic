Abstract We recently reported that anti-CD13 mAbs induce homotypic aggregation of monocytic cells. This phenomenon is signal transduction dependent and does not require CD13 aminopeptidase activity. Since CD13 is heavily glycosylated and a member of the galectin family (galectin-4) has been shown to associate with CD13 in the intestinal epithelium, we hypothesized that CD13-mediated aggregation might proceed through a carbohydrate-dependent mechanism involving galectin-3, the most highly expressed galectin on monocytes. We report here that lactose and anti-galectin-3 antibodies completely abrogate homotypic aggregation induced by anti-CD13 antibodies. Furthermore, galectin-3 co-immunoprecipitates with CD13 from resting U-937 cells and this association decreases during the aggregation process, a phenomenon that may have functional implications. Together, the results presented here point to a key role for galectin-3 in CD13-mediated homotypic aggregation of monocytic cells.

DNA replication stress is often defined by the slowing or stalling of replication fork progression leading to local or global DNA synthesis inhibition. Failure to resolve replication stress in a timely manner contribute toward cell cycle defects, genome instability and human disease; however, the mechanism for fork recovery remains poorly defined. Here, we show that the translesion DNA polymerase (Pol) kappa, a DinB orthologue, has a unique role in both protecting and restarting stalled replication forks under conditions of nucleotide deprivation. Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect. Taken together, our results identify a previously unanticipated role for Pol kappa in promoting DNA synthesis and replication stress recovery at sites of stalled forks.

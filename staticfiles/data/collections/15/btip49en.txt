While conventional in vitro culture systems and animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis of viral infections and to facilitate development of vaccines and therapeutics for viral diseases, models that can accurately recapitulate human responses to infection are still lacking. Human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices that recapitulate tissueâ€“tissue interfaces, fluid flows, mechanical cues, and organ-level physiology have been developed to narrow the gap between in vitro experimental models and human pathophysiology. Here, we describe how recent developments in Organ Chips have enabled re-creation of complex pathophysiological features of human viral infections in vitro.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is one of the most frequent and severe long-term side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies have extensively investigated CIPN searching for effective strategies to limit its severity or to treat CIPN-related impairment, but the results have been disappointing. Among the reasons for this failure are methodological flaws in both preclinical and clinical investigations. Their successful resolution might provide a brighter perspective for future studies. Among the several neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs, oxaliplatin may offer a clear example of a methodological approach eventually leading to successful clinical trials. However, the same considerations apply to the other neurotoxic agents and, although frequently neglected, also to the new "targeted" agents.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE T-helper type 17 (Th17) cells produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and help to protect against inflammation and infection in periodontal disease. Furthermore, while follicular dendritic cell-secreted protein (FDC-SP) may be involved in the inflammation of periodontal tissue, the biological role of FDP-SP in periodontal disease is still unknown. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the expression of IL-17 and FDC-SP in experimental periodontitis in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seven-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into baseline control, sham and test groups. Experimental periodontitis was induced by placing a ligature in the mesiopalatal area, and untreated rats served as a baseline control group. Morphological changes in alveolar bone were investigated 7, 14 and 28 d after treatment. Expression of the Rankl, osteoprotegerin (Opg) and Il17 genes was analyzed 5 and 7 d after the induction of experimental periodontitis. RESULTS Alveolar bone resorption progressed in the test group for 7 d, but not thereafter. At 5 d after the induction of periodontitis, the Rankl/Opg mRNA ratio and the expression of IL-17 in the test group were significantly increased compared with the respective values in the baseline control group; however, there were no significant differences between the test and control groups at 7 d. The expression of FDC-SP was significantly decreased in the test group compared with the baseline control group at 5 and 7 d after the induction of periodontitis, and this value had returned to normal levels at 14 and 28 d. CONCLUSION These results suggest that both IL-17 and FDC-SP could be involved in the inflammatory response, and FDC-SP in the junctional epithelium might play an important role in the Th17 cell-related immune response.

Infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the Coronaviridae family and is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus originating from Wuhan, China, was declared a global public health emergency on 11 March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is characterized by symptoms such as fever and dyspnea accompanied by infrequent incidence of lymphopenia, gastrointestinal complications such as elevated hepatic aminotransferases, and diarrhea. Originating in bats, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been transmitted to humans likely via an intermediate host that is yet to be discovered. Owing to the absence of any vaccines or definite anti-viral drugs alongside the greater mobility of people across the globe, international and national efforts in containing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection are experiencing severe difficulties. In this review, we have provided a picture of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological characteristics, the clinical symptoms experienced by patients of varying age groups, the molecular virology of SARS-CoV-2, and the treatment regimens currently employed for fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as their outcomes.

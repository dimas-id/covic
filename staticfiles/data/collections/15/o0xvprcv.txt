The coronavirus pandemic faces a number of challenges for healthcare professionals. The virus is spread by droplet infection and has a high virulence, so any intervention that involves the formation of respiratory aerosols potentially endangers the health of those involved in care. Mortality from coronavirus infection can be as high as 10%, so resuscitation is common in COVID-19 patients. During resuscitation, the likelihood of airway aerosol formation is increased, so there is a high risk of infection for care staff. The aim of our article is to provide a practice-oriented overview of the specialties of resuscitation in patients infected with coronavirus. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161 (17): 710-712.

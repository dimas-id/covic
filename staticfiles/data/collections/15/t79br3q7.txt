Publisher Summary This chapter provides a brief historical introduction and the distinction between hydrolysable and condensed tannins, a description of their chemistry and a short historical review on their use in leather tanning, the more recent developments in tannins for adhesives with and without the use of any aldehyde-yielding compounds, even without the use of any hardeners. Examples of the use of tannins for other industrial, nonleather, applications are reported. In particular, this chapter focuses briefly on their new intended use in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. New data on their antiviral effectiveness against a great number of different viruses compared to their higher, lower, or absent cytotoxicity are also presented.

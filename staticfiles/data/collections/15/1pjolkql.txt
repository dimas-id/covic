Abstract The history and development of infectious disease genomics have been closely associated with the Human Genome Project (HGP) during the past 20years. It has been emphasized since the beginning of the HGP that such effort must not be restricted to the human genome and should include other organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm for comparative sequence analyses. A brief history is reviewed in this chapter. As of 2016, more than 7000 completed genome sequencing projects have been reported. One of the important motivations for these efforts is to develop preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies through the analysis of sequenced microorganisms, parasites, and vectors related to human health. A number of examples are discussed in this chapter.

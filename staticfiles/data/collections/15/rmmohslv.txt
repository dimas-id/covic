BACKGROUND In recent years the number of reconstructive procedures for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) through robotic surgery has constantly increased. This paper describes the technical aspects of robotic hysteropromontopexy using the da Vinci surgical system. METHODS Two consecutive 35-year-old patients with POP, who wished to preserve the uterus, underwent hysteropromontopexy by robotic surgery. RESULTS Both procedures were performed successfully using a robotic approach. No additional reconstructive procedures were thought to be necessary at the end of surgery. Neither intra- nor post-operative complications occurred. After a follow-up of 18 and 6 months for case 1 and 2, respectively, both patients declared themselves satisfied with the anatomical and functional results achieved. CONCLUSIONS This procedure represents an effective option for the management of POP in selected women requiring fertility-sparing options.

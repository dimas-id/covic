Patients with 2019 novel Coronavirus infection are probably showing positive testing results again. In order to better treat these patients and provide basis for further control measures, we analyze the epidemiological outcomes and clinical features of patients with residual Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) in Linyi city. From January 23 to March 31 in 2020, epidemiological and clinical information of confirmed patients are collected for analysis. Stool and pharyngeal swab samples are collected for RT-PCR testing. 64 confirmed patients are included and 17 patients present re-positive testing after discharge. For these 17 patients, 70.59% are family aggregated, the interval between first time of negative testing and first time of re-positive testing is 11.82{+/-}3.42 days. There is no difference between patients with continued negative testing results and re-positive testing. After discharge, the interval between first time of negative testing and first time of re-positive testing is associated with severity of disease (p=0.013). Besides, the duration from first time to last time of re-positive testing is associated with exposure or contact history (p=0.049) and severity of disease (p=0.001). The analysis reveals epidemiological characteristics of patients with residual SARS-Cov-2 and provide basis for further control measures.

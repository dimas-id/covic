OBJECTIVE In this secondary analysis of results of the Clinical Outcomes in MEasurement-Based Treatment (COMET) trial, patient behaviors that might account for the differences observed in clinical outcomes were examined. METHODS Patients (N=914) diagnosed as having major depressive disorder participated in telephone interviews either monthly for six months (intervention) or at three and six months (usual care) asking about antidepressant medication-taking, use of psychotherapy or counseling, and participation in depression support groups. Physicians (N=83) in the intervention arm received monthly feedback regarding their patients' depression severity. RESULTS A total of 664 (73%) patients completed the month 6 interview. The adjusted odds of current antidepressant use at six months were 85% greater (p=.01) for patients in the intervention (N=380) versus usual care (N=284) arms, according to multivariate regression analyses. CONCLUSIONS More frequent measurement of depression symptoms was associated with greater medication persistence, which in turn may have mediated clinical improvements.

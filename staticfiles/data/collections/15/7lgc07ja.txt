BACKGROUND The degree of antiplatelet response to clopidogrel has been associated with clinical outcomes. Studies have investigated whether adjustment of antiplatelet therapies based on a single platelet function test is beneficial. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to test the stability of platelet reactivity measurements over time among patients treated with standard and double doses of clopidogrel. METHODS The ELEVATE-TIMI 56 (Escalating Clopidogrel by Involving a Genetic Strategy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 56) investigators genotyped 333 patients with coronary artery disease and randomized them to various clopidogrel regimens. Patients with at least 2 platelet function results on the same maintenance dose of clopidogrel (75 mg or 150 mg) were analyzed. Platelet aggregation was measured using P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). RESULTS In total, the mean platelet reactivity and the total number of nonresponders (PRU â‰¥230) with clopidogrel did not change between 2 periods for the 75-mg (22.4% vs. 21.9%; p = 0.86) and 150-mg doses of clopidogrel (11.5% vs. 11.5%; p = 1.00). In contrast, when evaluating each patient individually, 15.7% of patients taking clopidogrel 75 mg and 11.4% of patients taking 150 mg had a change in their responder status when tested at 2 different time points (p < 0.001). Despite being treated with the same dose of clopidogrel, >40% of patients had a change in PRU >40 on serial sampling, which approximates the average PRU difference caused by increasing the clopidogrel dose from 75 mg to 150 mg. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of platelet reactivity vary over time in a significant proportion of patients. Thus, treatment adjustment according to platelet function testing at a single time point might not be sufficient for guiding antiplatelet therapy in clinical or research settings.

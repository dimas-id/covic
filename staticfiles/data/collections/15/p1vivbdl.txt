The minor discomforts of pregnancy present difficulties for the health care provider as well as for the pregnant woman herself. Management of the various symptoms requires astute observations and the ability to individualize therapy. Knowledge of a variety of treatment options, therefore, allows practitioners to collaborate with their patients in selecting the best therapeutic approach for the specific situation. This three‐part series reviews the common discomforts associated with upper respiratory infections, minor pain, and gastrointestinal problems as they are manifested during pregnancy. Both nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical therapies are discussed. Frequent references are made to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Risk Factors which categorize both over‐the‐counter and prescribed drugs according to their documented safety for ingestion during pregnancy. Part I, “Managing Upper Respiratory Infections in Pregnancy,” appears in this issue (JNM 32:6); Part II, “Managing Minor Pain in Pregnancy,” will appear in JNM 33:1; and Part III, “Managing Gastrointestinal Problems in Pregnancy,” will appear in JNM 33:2.

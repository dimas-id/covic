OBJECTIVE To evaluate the lung function in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 10 years after recovery and the influencing factors. METHODS Pulmonary function tests were performed in 25 convalescent patients who had a diagnosis of SARS in 2003. Total lung volume, residual capacity, vital capacity, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, FEV1/FVC and lung carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO) were measured, and compared with the values obtained immediately after recovery in 2003. Of the 25 cases, 3 were males and 22 were females, aging 31-69 years [average (45.8 ± 12.2)]. Twenty-five healthy adults (6 males, 19 females), aged 31-62 years [average (42.3 ± 11.9) years], were recruited as controls. RESULTS Of the 25 cases, 2 showed simple diffusion dysfunction, 2 simple restrictive ventilatory dysfunction, 11 combined diffusion and restrictive ventilatory dysfunction, and 1 combined diffusion and obstructive ventilatory dysfunction. The remaining 10 cases showed normal lung function. There were no statistical differences in the pulmonary function measurements as compared with those measured 10 years ago, including DLCO (73 ± 12)% vs (72 ± 15)% (P>0.05), FEV1/FVC (83 ± 11)% vs (85 ± 7)%, (P>0.05), FEV1 (88 ± 7)% vs (86 ± 14)% (P>0.05), FVC (87 ± 21)% vs (87 ± 17)% (P>0.05), and RV (100 ± 17)% vs (78 ± 3 0)% (P>0.05). The lung functions of the patients showed no significant difference as compared with those obtained from the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS The pulmonary functions of SARS patents largely returned to normal after 10 years of convalescence, and the lung function damage was characterized by diffusing and restrictive ventilatory dysfunctions.

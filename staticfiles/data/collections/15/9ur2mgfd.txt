We read with interest the paper entitled «The impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease on 95 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective study.»1 The authors retrospectively reported that hospitalized patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) had poorer clinical outcomes compared with those without LPR according to Reflux Symptom Index (RSI). The LPR diagnosis was based on RSI>13, which is the threshold used by Belafsky et al. to suspect LPR.2 This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Group A rotavirus (RV) and coronavirus (CV) are common viral pathogens associated with neonatal diarrhoea in numerous animal species. The purpose of this work was to investigate the presence of these viral agents in two farm populations of captured guanacos (Lama guanicoe) in the Argentinean Patagonia region, that developed severe diarrhoea outbreaks. Stool and serum samples were analysed for RV and bovine CV antigen and antibody by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Rotavirus was detected in faeces from two new‐born guanacos with acute diarrhoea, one in each farm. After electrophoretic analysis, each isolated strain, showed a distinctive long dsRNA electropherotype characteristic of group A rotaviruses (4:2:3:2). In addition, 95% (38 of 40) of the sampled animals were positive for RV antibodies, suggesting a high prevalence of RV infection in the populations tested. No evidence of CV circulation by antigen or antibody analysis was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection and isolation of RV associated with neonatal diarrhoea in Lama guanicoe.

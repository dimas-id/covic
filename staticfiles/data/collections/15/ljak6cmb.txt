A method was developed to amplify ligated cDNA copies of mRNA 5' ends before cloning and sequencing. The method facilitates the study of the 5' end sequence on many molecules of an individual mRNA species. It can also be used to study the 5' end sequence on other kinds of single-stranded RNA molecules.

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put healthcare services all over the world into a challenging situation. The contagious nature of the disease and the respiratory failure necessitating ventilatory care of these patients have put extra burden on intensive care unit (ICU) services. India has been no exception; by March 2020, the number of COVID-19 patients started increasing in India. This article describes the measures taken and challenges faced in creating ample ICU bed capacity to cater to the anticipated load of patients in the state of Delhi, India, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main challenges faced, among others, were estimating the number of ICU beds to be created; deciding on dedicated hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients; procuring ventilators, personal protective equipment, and other related material; mobilizing human resources and providing their training; and providing isolated in-house accommodations to the staff on duty. The authors acknowledge and agree that the methodology proposed in this article is but one way of approaching this difficult scenario and that there could be other, perhaps better, methods of dealing with such a problem.

Bacterial infection of subcutaneous "pockets" housing cardiovascular implantable electronic devices is a significant clinical complication. In this study, pacemakers encapsulated in a blood plasma-based material (PBM) composited with antibiotics were investigated for use as prophylactics against such infections. PBMs, which are made from pooled allogeneic plasma and platelets, are off-the-shelf biomaterials that can be manufactured in the form of complex 3D shapes, extrudable putties, or injectable pastes. In vitro studies with PBM pastes formulated with rifampicin and minocycline demonstrated antibiotic release over 6 days, activity against Escherichia coli, and reduced cytotoxic effects of the antibiotics on fibroblasts. The materials were also evaluated in vivo in a rabbit model in which pacemaker pockets were inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) strain and examined 1 week later. The pockets containing the pacemaker plus S. aureus were grossly purulent and culture positive, whereas pockets into which PBM with antibiotics were injected around the pacemaker were free of purulence and culture negative (p < 0.001). None of the pockets into which PBM without antibiotics were placed demonstrated purulence, but 60% were culture positive. These results demonstrate the potential of PBMs to deliver antibiotics to diminish the incidence of pocket infections for pacemakers and other implantable devices.

Uniform interpolants were largely studied in non-classical propositional logics since the nineties, and their connection to model completeness was pointed out in the literature. A successive parallel research line inside the automated reasoning community investigated uniform quantifier-free interpolants (sometimes referred to as “covers”) in first-order theories. In this paper, we investigate cover transfer to theory combinations in the disjoint signatures case. We prove that, for convex theories, cover algorithms can be transferred to theory combinations under the same hypothesis needed to transfer quantifier-free interpolation (i.e., the equality interpolating property, aka strong amalgamation property). The key feature of our algorithm relies on the extensive usage of the Beth definability property for primitive fragments to convert implicitly defined variables into their explicitly defining terms. In the non-convex case, we show by a counterexample that cover may not exist in the combined theories, even in case combined quantifier-free interpolants do exist.

Among the molecular forms of angiotensin peptides generated by the action of renin on angiotensinogen (Aogen), both angiotensin II (Ang II) and the amino terminal heptapeptide angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)] are critically involved in the long-term control of tissue perfusion, cell-cell communication, development, and growth. Whereas an impressive body of literature continues to uncover pleiotropic effects of Ang II in the regulation of cell function, research on Ang-(1–7) has a shorter history as it was only 16 yr ago that a biological function for this heptapeptide was first demonstrated in the isolated rat neuro-hypophysial explant preparation (1). On the contrary, the synthesis of angiotonin/ hypertensin (now Ang II) was first obtained in 1957 (2), three decades ahead of the discovery of Ang-(1–7) biological properties.

OBJECTIVE To summarize the clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and observe the therapeutic effect with integrative Chinese and western medicine (ICWM) approach in treating patients with SARS. METHODS Forty-eight patients selected from the authors' hospital, whose diagnosis confirmed as SARS were analysed to sum-up the diagnostic type and basic feature of patients and the chief clinical characteristics. All the patients were randomly divided into the trial group and the control group, 24 in each. The control group was treated with the western medical therapeutic program and the trial group was treated with ICWM therapeutic program. The differences between the two groups were compared in terms of development of illness, time of using corticosteroid and absorption time of pulmonary inflammatory lesion, etc. RESULTS Most patients were youth and adult aged between 18 to 40 years old, the initial symptom was mainly the high fever, accompanied with general soreness, chest stuffiness and cough, etc. The hospitalization time, body temperature fluctuation sustaining time and time of using corticosteroid in the trial group were shorter than those in the control group, showing significant difference (P < 0.05). ICWM treatment showed a better effect in defervescence and inflammatory lesion absorption time, but with no statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients of SARS are mainly youth and adults in the prime of life, fever always appears as the initiation of illness and some accompanying symptoms would appear. As compared with the western treatment, ICWM treatment could evidently shorten the course of illness, prevent the rebounding of fever and reduce the time of using corticosteroid.

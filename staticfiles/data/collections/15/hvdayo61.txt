INTRODUCTION In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (warfarin, phenprocoumon) is effective both for primary and secondary stroke prevention with a 60-70% relative reduction in stroke risk compared with placebo. Mortality is reduced by 26%. VKA have a number of well-documented shortcomings which were overcome by non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Areas covered: Results of randomized trials for four NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) have been published (ARISTOTLE, RE-LY, ENGAGE, ROCKET-AF). In this review, the authors discuss the results in subgroups of patients with prior transient ischemic attacks or ischemic stroke. In aggregate, the NOACs are superior to warfarin for secondary prevention and result in a 50% reduction in intracerebral hemorrhage. Apixaban was superior to aspirin in the AVERROES trial and had a similar rate of major bleeding complications. Expert opinion: NOACs add to the therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF and offer advantages over warfarin including a favorable bleeding profile and convenience of use. Aspirin should no longer be used for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF.

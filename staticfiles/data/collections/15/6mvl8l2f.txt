PURPOSE OF REVIEW Extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (eRARP) is an alternative to the more commonly employed transperitoneal RARP (tRARP) for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. The purpose of this review is to discuss indications in which eRARP would be a more favorable approach in comparison to tRARP. In addition, we will discuss the safety and technique of eRARP. RECENT FINDINGS Recently published work has highlighted the outcomes and safety of eRARP in comparison to tRARP; specifically that eRARP is not inferior to tRARP. In addition, eRARP may be preferred in certain circumstances. For example, Ludwig et al. recently discussed the concomitant repair of inguinal hernia during eRARP. Extraperitoneal RARP is a safe and effective alternative to tRARP. With previous knowledge and experience with tRARP, urologists can adapt the extraperitoneal approach without difficulty. This approach is useful for specific situations in which tRARP may be challenging.

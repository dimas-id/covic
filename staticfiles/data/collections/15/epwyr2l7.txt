The Brevinin peptides are antimicrobial agents obtained from frog skin secretions. Brevinin-2R has attracted many attentions due to its very low hemolytic activity, cationic property, and high affinity to cancer cells. Moreover, it has shown little toxicity against normal mammalian cells, while having killed several tumor cell lines by activation of lysosome-mitochondrial death pathway. In this review, we introduced the Brevinin superfamily with a focus on its therapeutic applications. Next, some unique properties of Brevinins were briefly discussed, including their ability to stimulate insulin secretion, dendritic cell maturation, and wound healing. In this context, we also provide information about the decoration of nanoparticles, such as cerium nano-oxide, by Brevinins. Finally, we addressed their potential for anti-tumor and drug design applications.

Handlebar injuries are well described in pediatric patients and are frequently associated with internal injuries, including the "classic" duodenal hematoma and solid organ injuries. Before this report, traumatic handlebar hernias were considered rare. They occur when the end of the handlebar (often bare or lacking protective equipment) applies a significant force to a focal area of the abdomen leading to a disruption in the underlying muscle fibers and fascia while sparing the overlying skin. Such nonpenetrating injuries may present with subtle clinical signs and should always be considered in the differential diagnosis. Imaging, with the use of computed tomographic scan or ultrasound will confirm the diagnosis as well as identify any associated injuries. The management plan usually requires surgical exploration and repair of the defect. The prognosis is favorable presuming that there is no significant underlying injury. In this report, we present a series of 5 patients with traumatic handlebar hernia-the most frequently-occurring injury in our series-and review concurrent associated injuries.

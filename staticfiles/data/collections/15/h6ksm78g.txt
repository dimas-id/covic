A 4.5-wk-old lynx (Felis lynx) was presented for necropsy with a history of poor growth, mild diarrhea, anemia, and lethargy. The liver was enlarged and had a 7 mm long fracture that resulted in severe intraabdominal hemorrhage and death. Microscopic lesions were indicative of severe ulcerative cystitis and septicemia. Pure cultures of Salmonella arizonae were isolated from the liver, kidney, and spleen. Based on differences in the chronicity of inflammation in the urinary bladder versus other organs, we speculate that chronic cystitis caused by S arizonae lead to septicemic infection.

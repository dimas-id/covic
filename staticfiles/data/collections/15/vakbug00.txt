Schiff bases are the biologically privileged scaffolds in organic chemistry, commonly synthesized from the condensation reaction of carbonyl functional group with amines. Naturally occurring and synthetically prepared Schiff bases are active molecules with many pharmacological activities like antibacterial, anti-cancer, anti-fungal, anti-malarial, antioxidant and many more. This review article summarizes pharmacological developments in the recent few years and gives a brief overview of their therapeutic potential.

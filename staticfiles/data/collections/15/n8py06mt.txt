OBJECTIVE: To evaluate urology applicants' opinions about the interview process during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was emailed to applicants to our institution from the 2019/2020 Urology matches prior to issuance of professional organization guidelines. The survey inquired about attitudes toward the residency interview process in the era of COVID-19 and which interview elements could be replicated virtually. Descriptive statistics were utilized. RESULTS: 80% of urology applicants from the 2019/2020 matches received our survey. 156 people (24% of recipients) responded. 34% preferred virtual interviews, while 41% in-person interviews at each program, and 25% regional/centralized interviews. 64% said that interactions with residents (pre/post-interview social and informal time) were the most important interview day component and 81% said it could not be replicated virtually. Conversely, 81% believed faculty interviews could be replicated virtually. 87% believed that city visits could not be accomplished virtually. A plurality felt that away rotations and second-looks should be allowed (both 45%). COMMENT: Applicants feel that faculty interviews can be replicated virtually, while resident interactions cannot. Steps such as a low-stakes second looks after programs submit rank lists (potentially extending this window) and small virtual encounters with residents could ease applicant concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Applicants have concerns about changes to the match processes. Programs can adopt virtual best practices to address these issues.

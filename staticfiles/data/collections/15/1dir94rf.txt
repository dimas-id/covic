OBJECTIVE To analyze the effect of learning in two surgeons on complications and conversion to laparotomy during total and subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed retrospectively 236 total and subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomies done by two surgeons from the time they first performed the procedure. The interventions were classified in three groups based on the surgeon's experience: the first 75 hysterectomies ("novice period"), the subsequent 75 hysterectomies ("intermediate"), and the subsequent 86 hysterectomies ("routine period"). RESULTS Patient's characteristics changed as surgeons gained experience, with more complex operations (greater obesity, previous surgery and malignant disease) becoming more frequent. During the second group of operations when surgeons had an intermediate level of experience, the risk of major complications decreased (adjusted odds ratio: 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.10-0.85), as did the risk of type III complications of Clavien-Dindo classification (adjusted odds ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.93). However, the percent rate of conversion to laparotomy remained stable in the second (intermediate experience) group. In the third group, after the surgeons had performed 150 procedures and when the risk of any type of complication was lowest, the risk of conversion to laparotomy decreased compared to the routine group. CONCLUSIONS The surgeon's experience in performing laparoscopic hysterectomy plays an essential role in the decrease in the risk of complications, and this finding supports the importance of providing appropriate training for residents and gynecologists to enable them to perform this procedure with an optimal degree of competence and safety.

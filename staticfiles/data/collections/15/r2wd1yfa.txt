This chapter is written to make the fast-paced, expanding field of the genetics of autism accessible to those practitioners who help children with autism. New genetic knowledge and technology have quickly developed over the past 30 years, particularly within the past decade, and have made many optimistic about our ability to explain autism. Among these advances include the sequencing of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001) and the identification of common genetic variants via the HapMap project (International HapMap Consortium, 2005), and the development of cost-efficient genotyping and analysis technologies (Losh, Sullivan, Trembath, & Piven, 2008). Improvement in technology has led to improved visualization of chromosomal abnormality down to the molecular level. The four most common syndromes associated with autism include fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, 15q duplications, and untreated phenylketonuria (PKU; Costa e Silva, 2008). FXS and 15q duplications are discussed within the context of cytogenetics. TSC is illustrated within the description of linkage analysis.

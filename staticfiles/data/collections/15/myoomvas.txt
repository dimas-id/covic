BACKGROUND: Currently very little is known about the perceptions and experiences of kidney transplant recipients from a qualitative perspective. As highlighted by the European Kidney Health Alliance recommendations, providing holistic care to kidney patients is important however this is currently an unmet care need in renal disease. It is imperative to understand patient experiences to ensure that they are included in key strategies and future renal service planning. Ignoring these important patient views means that there is a significant risk of inappropriate renal service provision and lack of adequate support impacting on overall health. METHOD: A purposive sampling strategy will recruit individuals currently living with a kidney transplant, 6 months to 5 years post-transplant. A maximum of 30 patients will be recruited between two Regional Nephrology units within the United Kingdom via clinical gatekeepers. In-depth interviews will be undertaken with participants living with a kidney transplant across the two sites. Interviews will be digitally-recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. DISCUSSION: Renal healthcare professionals need to understand more than the biological impact of receiving a kidney transplant. Understanding the holistic and multi-domain experiences that these patients experience will help healthcare professionals to recognize the needs of this group and ensure more responsive care.

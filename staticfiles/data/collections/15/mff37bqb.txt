Rebleeding episodes after a ruptured intracranial aneurysm has been secured are considered a significant source of patient morbidity and mortality. Theoretically, acute treatment with a flow-diversion device may offer a reasonable treatment option to prevent future bleeding and to remodel the diseased vessel segment. The authors identified two patients who underwent emergent treatment with the placement of a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the setting of an acute rebleeding of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm previously treated with clip reconstruction. The first patient was a 50-year-old woman who underwent clip reconstruction for a broad-based right anterior choroidal artery aneurysm measuring approximately 2Ã—8 mm. Clip reconstruction was achieved with a single fenestrated clip. On day 14, the patient experienced a rebleeding episode. She underwent emergent treatment with a single PED but experienced another rebleeding and died. The second patient was a 53-year-old woman who presented with a ruptured dorsal variant blister aneurysm, which was treated with clip reconstruction. On day 22, she experienced a rebleeding episode and underwent emergent treatment using two PEDs in a duplicative fashion. After the procedure, she experienced another acute rebleeding episode and died. The treatment of reruptured intracranial aneurysms in a salvage fashion with emergent placement of PEDs in two patients resulted in good technical placement of the device covering the neck of the aneurysm, yet both patients experienced additional rebleeding and did not survive. Future generations of flow diverters may have more appropriate properties that would allow their use as salvage treatment in the setting of acutely ruptured aneurysms.

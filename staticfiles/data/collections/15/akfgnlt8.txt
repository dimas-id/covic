Genetic variation in or near the C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) has been associated with plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in healthy individuals. CLEC4M is a lectin receptor with a polymorphic extracellular neck region possessing a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). A total of 491 participants (318 patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease [VWD] and 173 unaffected family members) were genotyped for the CLEC4M VNTR polymorphism. Family-based association analysis on kindreds with type 1 VWD demonstrated an excess transmission of VNTR 6 to unaffected individuals (P = .0096) and an association of this allele with increased VWF:RCo (P = .029). CLEC4M-Fc bound to VWF. Immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that HEK 293 cells transfected with CLEC4M bound and internalized VWF. Cells expressing 4 or 9 copies of the CLEC4M neck region VNTR showed reduced interaction with VWF relative to CLEC4M with 7 VNTR (CLEC4M 4%-60% reduction, P < .001; CLEC4M 9%-45% reduction, P = .006). Mice expressing CLEC4M after hydrodynamic liver transfer have a 46% decrease in plasma levels of VWF (P = .0094). CLEC4M binds to and internalizes VWF, and polymorphisms in the CLEC4M gene contribute to variable plasma levels of VWF.

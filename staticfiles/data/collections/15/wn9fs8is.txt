COVID-19 has ravaged through the lives of individuals, families, communities, and societies and, in the process, exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, oppression, and poverty among our most at-risk community members. Social workers, guided by values and ethics, are counteracting these ailments in society, concentrating on protecting the most vulnerable, older adults. In this letter we describe the impact of COVID-19 on older adults, note social work values from the National Association of Social Workers, and expand on the current role of the practicing social worker values in action during COVID.

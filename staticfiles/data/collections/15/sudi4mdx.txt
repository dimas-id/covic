BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an increasingly common intervention in the treatment of pancreaticobiliary disorders. Patients are often elderly with complex co-morbidities. While monitored anaesthesia care with sedation is commonly used for most cases, few would require general anaesthesia with an endotracheal tube. Both low-flow and high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) are established ways of delivering supplemental oxygen, but it is unclear whether one technique is better than the other. HFNC seems a promising tool for advanced procedures but evidence to support its application in high-risk ERCP cases is limited. The rate of oxygen desaturation during endoscopy has been reported to be as high as 11%â€“50% and the method of oxygen delivery for ERCP merits further study. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial comparing the efficacy of oxygen supplementation through HFNC versus low-flow nasal cannula during ERCP, in a cohort of patients at risk of adverse respiratory events. A total of 132 patients will be recruited across three sites and randomly assigned to either the low-flow or the HFNC group. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients experiencing hypoxia, defined by any event of SpO2 < 90%. The secondary outcomes include parameters centred on oxygenation, requirement of airway manoeuvres, successful completion of procedure, perioperative complications, patient satisfaction and cost analysis of the consumables. An intention-to-treat principle will be applied while analysing. DISCUSSION: The demand for ERCPs is likely to increase in the future with the aging population. Our study results may lead to improved outcomes and reduce airway-related complications in patients undergoing ERCPs. The results will be presented at national and international meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ANZCTR.org.au, CTRN12619000397112. Registered on 12 March 2019.

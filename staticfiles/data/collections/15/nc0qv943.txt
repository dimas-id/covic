INTRODUCTION Robotic lobectomy is an increasingly common surgical approach for anatomic lung resection. Over the last decade, robotic lobectomy has shown to be safe, with oncologic efficacy similar to lobectomy via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Comparative analysis between these modalities is an active area of investigation. While initially expensive, the costs of a robotic platform decrease as the number of operations performed increases, length of stay is shortened, and postoperative morbidity is reduced. Moreover, the added cost has value which is defined over long periods of time. Areas covered: The clinical technique and optimal conduct of lobectomy is explained in granular detail for all five types of lobectomies. The advantages and disadvantages of a robotic platform are analyzed, including a review of the recent literature. Expert commentary: The number of robotic pulmonary resections performed has tripled in the past two years. Anticipated developments in robotic surgery include improvements in robotic training, continued refinement of robotic instrumentation, and additional adjunctive technologies. The overall costs of robotic surgery will decrease, in part, due to increasing competition as additional companies enter the market.

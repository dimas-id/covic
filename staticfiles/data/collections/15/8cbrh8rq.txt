INTRODUCTION The ideal way of preparing patients for small-bowel capsule endoscopy has been controversial. Previous studies have shown that ingestion of 2 l of polyethylenglycol (PEG) 12 hours prior to capsule ingestion leads to improved visibility in comparison to no preparation at all. We speculated that using a post-ingestion (PI), booster-based cleansing protocol might provide an alternative to the PEG cleansing protocol. METHODS This randomized, blinded, prospective study enrolled 45 individuals. Patients were allocated to either of two groups. The PEG group ingested 2 l PEG 12 hours prior to the exam (n = 22) and the PI group ingested one sachet of Picolax® dissolved in 250 ml of water one hour after swallowing the capsule with 500 ml of water (n = 18). Primary endpoints were overall small bowel and distal third of small bowel cleansing levels. Secondary endpoints were average gastric and small-bowel transit time. RESULTS Forty-five patients participated in this study. Five individuals were excluded because of incomplete study. Percentage of patients with adequate visibility in the distal third of the small bowel in the PEG group was 9% vs 72% in the PI group (p < 0.0001). Average gastric time and total transit time were shorter in the PI group vs the PEG group (p = 0.0065). CONCLUSION Timing of ingestion of the Picolax® purgative 60 minutes after swallowing the capsule endoscopy delivers better visibility in the distal third of the small bowel than the accepted cleansing protocol of ingesting 2 l PEG 12 hours prior to the capsule endoscopy procedure.

The potential antiviral activity of 6-azauridine and 5-iododeoxyuridine was evaluated in a coordinated study at five institutions. Experimental models in five species, the mouse, rabbit, swine, cat, and ferret, were established with use of 10 viruses: Herpesvirus hominis types 1 and 2, murine cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, Shope fibroma virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, swine influenza virus, feline viral rhinotracheitis virus, feline panleukopenia virus, and ferret distemper virus. Criteria for selection were: (1) representation from a number of major groups of viruses, (2) reproduction of natural routes of infection, and (3) simulation of potentially treatable viral infections of man. Antiviral activity was observed for 5-iododeoxyuridine in H. hominis infections in hairless mice and influenza in swine, and a slight degree of efficacy was noted in rabbits infected with Shope fibroma virus. Toxicity was also observed in most of the experimental models. There was a suggestion of antiviral activity with 6-azauridine in swine infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; however, enhancement of disease and some toxicity were seen in most of the other models. Efficacy of these two compounds was not well substantiated by these studies.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a new training exercise to improve technical textbfskills in the surgeons who performtextbf Single Port Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (SPLC), a technique that requires active improvements to overcome the lack of triangulation and collision of instruments both within and outside the abdominal cavity. The proposed mechanisms were developed based on peg transfer tests, performed by an expert surgeon in SPLC, with straight forceps and SILS$^{\mathbf {TM}}$ access in a pelvictrainer afterwards an unstructured interview was showed to the surgeon. These methodological tools provided the characteristics of the type of movement required by the peg transfer test at the time of performing the training task, which was taken as a reference to propose a new protocol to be implemented. The mentioned structure was tested by an expert surgeon, who performed 5 tasks, within an average running time of 170 seconds. At the end of the tests, a semi-structured interview was carried out again to the surgeon, where the improvement of the technique was tested.

Cancer is a major burden on the healthcare system, and new therapies are needed. Recently, the development of immunotherapies, which aim to boost or use the immune system, or its constituents, as a tool to fight malignant cells, has provided a major new tool in the arsenal of clinicians and has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers. Cellular immunotherapies are based on the administration of living cells to patients and have developed hugely, especially since 2010 when Sipuleucel-T (Provenge), a DC vaccine, was the first cellular immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA. The ensuing years have seen two further cellular immunotherapies gain FDA approval: tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta). This review will give an overview of the principles of immunotherapies before focusing on the major forms of cellular immunotherapies individually, T cell-based, natural killer (NK) cell-based and dendritic cell (DC)-based, as well as detailing some of the clinical trials relevant to each therapy.

The zoonotic transmissions of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype that have occurred since 1997 have sparked the development of novel influenza vaccines. The advent of reverse genetics technology, cell-culture production techniques and novel adjuvants has improved the vaccine strain preparation, production process and immunogenicity of the vaccines, respectively, and has accelerated the availability of pandemic influenza vaccines. However, there is still room for improvement, and alternative vaccine preparations can be explored, such as viral vectors. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), originally developed as a safe smallpox vaccine, can be exploited as a viral vector and has many favourable properties. Recently, we have demonstrated that an MVA-based vaccine could protect mice and macaques against infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype. In the present study, recombinant MVA expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus was evaluated in the ferret model. A single immunization induced modest antibody responses and afforded only modest protection against the development of severe disease upon infection with a 2009(H1N1) strain. In contrast, two immunizations induced robust antibody responses and protected ferrets from developing severe disease, confirming that MVA is an attractive influenza vaccine production platform.

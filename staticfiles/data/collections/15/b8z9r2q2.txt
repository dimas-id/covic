COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus, can lead to acute respiratory failure or even sepsis. Patients with multiple co-morbidities are more likely to develop these severe forms of the disease. The aim of this report is to highlight cases the analysis of which might help discover factors that influence the course and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia. The past medical history of our elderly patient (75-year-old female) includes rectum resection with intraoperative cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. In January 2020, the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and concomittant pulmonary embolism. Following 6 weeks of therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, the cancerous colonic section was resected. The patient arrested intraoperatively but was successfully resuscitated. On post-operative day 15, the patient developed arterial anastomosis bleed, which necessitated acute right-sided hemicolectomy. Post-operatively she became pyrexial and COVID-19 was confirmed, but later became apyrexial with symptomatic treatment. Subsequently, the patient developed partial anastomosis insufficiency, which resolved with conservative management. Following three negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, she was successfully discharged from hospital. It is worthy of note that due to the active anastomosis bleed the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor treatment was stopped, and later the patient got infected with SARS-CoV-2. A long-lasting LMWH therapy was performed. The timely management of colorectal carcinoms remains important even during an epidemic. The appropriate treatment of these patients during the pandemic presents a great challenge for all doctors, but, as shown in our case report, surgical treatment of even those with multiple co-morbidities can be successful.

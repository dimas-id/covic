Biomedical values of organic natural cinnamon that are buried in their bulk counterpart can be exposed and customised via nanosizing. Based on this factor, a new type of spherical cinnamon nanoclusters (Cin-NCs) were synthesised using eco-friendly nanosecond pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) approach. As-grown nontoxic Cin-NCs suspended in the citric acid of pH 4.5 (acted as organic solvent) were characterised thoroughly to evaluate their structural, optical and bactericidal properties. The effects of various laser fluences (LF) at the fixed wavelength (532 nm) on the physiochemical properties of these Cin-NCs were determined. The FTIR spectra of the Cin-NCs displayed the symmetric-asymmetric stretching of the functional groups attached to the heterocyclic/cinnamaldehyde compounds. The HR-TEM image of the optimum sample revealed the nucleation of the crystalline spherical Cin-NCs with a mean diameter of approximately 10 ± 0.3 nm and lattice fringe spacing around 0.14 nm. In addition, the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) and optical density (OD(600)) of the proposed Cin-NCs were measured to assess their antibacterial potency against the Staphylococcus aureus (IZD ≈ 24 mm) and Escherichia coli (IZD ≈ 25 mm) bacterial strains. The strong UV absorption (in the range of 269 and 310 nm) shown by these NCs was established to be useful for the antibacterial drug development and food treatment.

This chapter describes the activities of the Bad Bugs Bookclub, which brings scientists and non-scientists together to read novels where infectious disease formed part of the plot, and considers how these novels could be used to promote a better understanding of disease, epidemiology and the work of the professional scientist. A particular focus of the bookclub was to suggest how teachers in Higher Education might use these novels in their practice, although this specialised format can be used to benefit a wide range of professional (and non-professional) audiences. The Bad Bugs Bookclub has also been targeted towards students reading for a degree in Biomedical Science, accredited by the Institute of Biomedical Sciences: graduates are professionally qualified to be employed as biomedical scientists.

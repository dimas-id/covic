Specific pathogen free kittens were vaccinated with an unattenuated field isolate of canine coronavirus (ccv) either by aerosol or subcutaneously, and received boosting vaccinations four weeks later. Aerosolisation elicited a homologous virus-neutralising (vn) antibody response that increased steadily over a four-week period and levelled off one to two weeks after revaccination. The initial aerosolised dose produced an asymptomatic infection with excretion of ccv from the oropharynx up to eight days after vaccination; virus shedding was not detected, however, after the second inoculation. Cats vaccinated subcutaneously developed low vn antibody titres after the first ccv dose and experienced a strong anamnestic response after the second dose. Neutralising antibody titres then levelled off one to two weeks after revaccination at mean values somewhat lower than in cats vaccinated by aerosol. ccv was not isolated from the oropharynx after either subcutaneous dose. Four weeks after ccv boosting inoculations, vaccinated cats and sham-vaccinated control cats were divided into three subgroups and challenged by aerosol with the virulent ucd1 strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv ucd1) at three different dosage levels. Five of six cats (including sham-vaccinated controls) given the lowest challenge dose showed no signs of disease, while all other cats developed lesions typical of feline infectious peritonitis (fip). The five surviving cats developed fip after subsequent challenge with a fivefold higher dose of fipv. Thus heterotypic vaccination of cats with ccv did not provide effective protection against fipv challenge.

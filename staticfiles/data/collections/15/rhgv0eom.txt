Directed bigraphs are a meta-model which generalises Milnerâ€™s bigraphs by taking into account the request flow between controls and names. A key problem about these bigraphs is that of bigraph embedding, i.e., finding the embeddings of a bigraph inside a larger one. We present an algorithm for computing embeddings of directed bigraphs, via a reduction to a constraint satisfaction problem. We prove soundness and completeness of this algorithm, and provide an implementation in jLibBig, a general Java library for manipulating bigraphical reactive systems, together with some experimental results.

INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to analyse the hospital cost of treatment with robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy for women with endometrial cancer or atypical complex hyperplasia and to identify differences in resource use and cost. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cost analysis was based on two cohorts: women treated with robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 202) or with total abdominal hysterectomy (n = 158) at Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark. We conducted an activity-based cost analysis including consumables and healthcare professionals' salaries. As cost-drivers we included severe complications, duration of surgery, anesthesia and stay at the post-anesthetic care unit, as well as number of hospital bed-days. Ordinary least-squares regression was used to explore the cost variation. The primary outcome was cost difference in Danish kroner between total abdominal hysterectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy. RESULTS The average cost of consumables was 12,642 Danish kroner more expensive per patient for robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy than for total abdominal hysterectomy (2014 price level: 1â‚¬ = 7.50 Danish kroner). When including all cost-drivers, the analysis showed that the robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure was 9386 Danish kroner (17%) cheaper than the total abdominal hysterectomy (p = 0.003). When the robot investment was included, the cost difference reduced to 4053 Danish kroner (robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy was 7% cheaper than total abdominal hysterectomy) (p = 0.20). Increasing age and Type 2 diabetes appeared to influence the overall costs. CONCLUSION For women with endometrial cancer or atypical complex hyperplasia, robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy was cheaper than total abdominal hysterectomy, mostly due to fewer complications and shorter length of hospital stay.

Major perioperative cardiovascular events are important causes of morbidity in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease who undergo reparative surgery. Current preoperative clinical risk assessment strategies have poor accuracy for identifying patients who will sustain adverse events following heart surgery. There is an ongoing need to integrate clinical variables with novel technology and biomarkers to accurately predict outcome following pediatric heart surgery. We tested whether preoperative levels of miRNAs-208a can serve as such a biomarker. Serum samples were obtained from pediatric patients immediately before heart surgery. MiRNA-208a was quantified by RQ-PCR. Correlations between the patientâ€™s clinical variables and miRNA levels were tested. Lower levels of preoperative miRNA-208a correlated with and could predict the appearance of postoperative cardiac and inflammatory complications. MiRNA-208a may serve as a biomarker for the prediction of patients who are at risk to develop complications following surgery for the repair of congenital heart defects.

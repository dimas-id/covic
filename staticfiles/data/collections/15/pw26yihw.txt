CONTEXT Satureja (Lamiaceae) species are used as flavoring compounds in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries because of its sweetness and simple cultivation characteristics. They have traditionally been used as muscle pain relievers, tonic, and carminative agents to treat stomach and intestinal disorders such as cramps, nausea, indigestion, and diarrhea, due to their considerable phytochemical characteristics. OBJECTIVE This review evaluates some information published since 1989 on Satureja genus from a systematic perspective in terms of its pharmacological and phytochemical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to March 2014. "Satureja" was used as a research term without narrowing or limiting research elements. After obtaining all reports from database (a total number is about 637), the papers were carefully analyzed in order to find data related to the topic of this review. RESULTS In this review, 453 reports were used which were published between 1989 and 2014. The study was compiled into two sections (Pharmacology and Phytochemistry). In the pharmacology section, more than 50 different activities were studied. In the second section, in addition to other compounds and inorganic substances, volatiles, phenolic acids, and flavonoids were discussed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION According to our contemporary information, Satureja species have been evaluated for their wide range of biological activities. However, a small part of these studies have been carried out on the active principles. Therefore, in the future, more studies should be carried out to identify responsible phytochemicals for the various activities.

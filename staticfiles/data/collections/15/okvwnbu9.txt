OBJECTIVE To compare the surgical outcomes between reduced-port robotic surgery (RPRS) using the Octo-Port channel and multiport robot-assisted laparoscopy for myomectomy. STUDY DESIGN This prospective study compared and analyzed data from 15 consecutive women who underwent RPRS for myomectomy and 15 consecutive women who underwent multiport robot-assisted laparoscopy to treat symptomatic uterine myoma from January 2016 to June 2016. The patients were treated by two surgeons at two institutions. RESULTS The two study groups did not differ demographically. The differences in surgical outcomes, such as docking time, console time, hospital stay, estimated blood loss, Hb change, myoma count, and weight, also did not differ between the two groups. On the contrary, the number of port site was only 2 in RPRS compared with 4-5 in multiport robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy. CONCLUSION RPRS for myomectomy seems technically feasible and safe, with short-term perioperative outcomes similar to those from multiport robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy.

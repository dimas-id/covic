The clinical signs and symptoms associated with many infectious diseases are often too nonspecific to discriminate between causative agents, and thus, definitive diagnosis requires specific laboratory tests for all of the suspected pathogens. In particular, respiratory tract infections can be caused by numerous different viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens that are indistinguishable by clinical diagnosis. Respiratory tract infections are also among the most common infections in humans, with approximately 6−9 episodes per year in children and 2−4 episodes per year in adults [1]. These infections cause considerable morbidity and mortality as well as high healthcare costs associated with doctor visits, hospitalizations, treatment, and absences from work and school. Early diagnosis of the etiological agent in a respiratory infection permits effective antimicrobial therapy and appropriate management of the disease.

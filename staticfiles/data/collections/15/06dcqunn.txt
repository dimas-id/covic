BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is considered a safe and effective treatment for severe obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. We sought to examine the outcome of LAGB delivered through a Canadian publicly funded obesity program. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the cases of patients who underwent LAGB within a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, publically funded obesity program. RESULTS A total of 178 patients underwent LAGB. Mean percentage total body weight loss at 1, 2 and 3 years was 15.8%, 20.7% and 20.3%, respectively. The most common short-term complication was postoperative nausea (19%). The medium-term complications included band migration (5.6%) and port site complications, band leakage and incisional hernia at 1% each. The reoperation rate was 4.5%. The mean surgery duration was 56 minutes and the mean length of stay was 1.4 days. The average numbers of clinic visits and band adjustments were highest in the first year. The most common investigation for postoperative symptoms was fluoroscopy (86%). An outcome comparison between the 2 generations of the REALIZE gastric band was inconclusive, requiring further data collection. CONCLUSION Publicly funded LAGB results in effective weight loss and acceptable safety over the short term. Our patients may represent a distinct population that differs from that in the private system. Long-term data are necessary to determine the cost-effectiveness of this important surgical option for severe obesity.

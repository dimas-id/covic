SARS CoV 2 is very much homologous in structure to SARS CoV. Review of literature suggests the in-vitro virucidal action of povidone iodine in SARS CoV and MERS. The oropharynx and nasopharynx are target sites of SARS CoV 2. A significant proportion of COVID 19 sufferers are asymptomatic, but shedding these viral particles, PVP-I has been shown to be a safe therapy when used as a mouthwash or taken nasally or used during ophthalmic surgeries. AIMS: MATERIALS AND METHODS: 0.5% PVP-I solution is prepared from commercially available 10% PVP-I solution. Patients were instructed to put 0.5% PVP-I drops in nose and rinse mouth with gargle prior examinations for 30â¯s. For endoscopic procedure (nasal and throat) nasal douching and gargling to be started one day prior. Douching and rinsing to be repeated just before procedures. Nasal packing with 0.5% PVP-I along with 4% xylocaine/adrenaline solution, tolerability and any allergic reaction noted. RESULTS: The patient and health care workers tolerated the 0.5%. No allergy was noted. CONCLUSION: We propose the use of 0.5% PVP-I in healthcare workers and their patients to minimise the risk of spread of the disease in addition to the recommended PPE.

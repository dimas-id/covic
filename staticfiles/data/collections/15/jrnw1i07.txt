In this work, we add to the rich history of decision-support system research by implementing and evaluating a pilot implementation of a novel system, which we call Decidio. Our tool was integrated into a pre-existing decision-making process regularly conducted by 9 teams of undergraduate students. We find an overall positive response to Decidio based on the results of a tool evaluation survey that we conducted after our experiment. Furthermore, we conduct a Big-Five Factor personality survey of participants and associate personalities with interactions recorded by our tool. We find that the students who demonstrate leadership behaviors through their interactions score higher in extraversion and lower in conscientiousness than other students. Our analysis also reveals that agreeableness is strongly correlated with dissimilarity between group ranking outcomes and initially indicated individual preferences.

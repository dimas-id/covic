INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the technique of choice in the treatment of adrenal tumors. SILS has recently been introduced in this field and applied in Viet Duc University Hospital. Herein, we report our experience with single-incision transperitoneal adrenalectomy. METHODS Between August 2010 and January 2012, 61 patients (23 men, 38 women) underwent SILS adrenalectomy at our institution. The diagnoses consisted of 20 patients with pheochromocytoma, 17 with nonfunctioning adenoma, 16 with Conn syndrome, 4 with Cushing syndrome and 4 with adrenal cysts. The mean age was 47.8 years (range, 21-68 years). There were 29 right-sided and 32 left-sided tumors; their mean diameter was 30.7 mm (range, 8-59 mm). Patients were in the flank position with the operated side up. A 2.5-cm pararectal incision at the level of the umbilicus was made to insert the SILS Port. RESULTS The mean operating time was 78 min (range, 50-120 min), and mean blood loss was approximately 70 mL. Left-sided tumors were excised entirely with the SILS technique. Right-sided lesions sometimes required an additional trocar (hybrid technique). No drainage was needed at the operating site. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, but one case was converted to the conventional three-port technique. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.4 days (range, 2-6 days). CONCLUSION Our preliminary results show that SILS adrenalectomy is safe and technically feasible. It should be considered among the surgical managements for selected patients with adrenal tumors.

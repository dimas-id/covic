Although current studies suggested that conjunctivitis is not a common presentation of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), several studies have reported the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) in ocular secretions. Coronavirus had not yet been successfully cultured from tears or conjunctival swabs in humans, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor SARS-CoV. However, live feline coronavirus has been isolated from conjunctival swabs. In addition, infection of COVID-19 through unprotected eye exposure had been suspected in several articles. Reports of ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID-19 also raised concern on ocular transmission. As a result, we strongly suggest that personal protective equipment (PPE) should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes of ophthalmologists, especially when conjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral follicular conjunctivitis.

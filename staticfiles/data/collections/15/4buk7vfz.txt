Several studies report results that suggest the need of vascularization blocking for efficient gene transfer to the liver, especially in nonviral gene therapy. In this study, we describe a surgical strategy for in vivo isolation of the pig liver, resulting in a vascular watertight organ that allows the evaluation of several gene injection conditions. The hepatic artery and portal, suprahepatic and infrahepatic cava veins were dissected. Then, liver vascularization was excluded for 5-7 min. In that time, we first injected 200 ml saline solution containing the p3c-eGFP plasmid (20 Âµg/ml) simultaneously through two different catheters placed in the portal and cava veins, respectively. Vital constants were monitored during the surgery to assess the safety of the procedure. Basal systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 92.8/63.2 mm Hg and dropped to 40.7/31.3 mm Hg at the end of vascular exclusion; the mean basal heart rate was 58 bpm, reaching 95 bpm when the blood pressure was low. Oxygen saturation was maintained above 98% during the intervention, and no relevant changes were observed in the ECG tracing. Peak plasma AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels were observed after 24 h (151 and 57 IU, respectively). These values were higher, but not relevant, in 60 ml/s injection than in 20 ml/s injection. Efficiency of gene transfer was studied with simultaneous (cava and portal veins) injection of eGFP gene at flow rates of 20 and 60 ml/s. Liver tissue samples were collected 24 h after injection and qPCR was carried out on each lobe sample. The results confirmed the efficiency of the procedure. Gene delivery differed between 20 ml/s (9.9-31.0 eGFP DNA copies/100 pg of total DNA) and 60 ml/s injections (0.6-1.1 eGFP DNA copies/100 pg of total DNA). Gene transcription showed no significant differences between 20 ml/s (15,701.8-21,475.8 eGFP RNA copies/100 ng of total RNA) and 60 ml/s (12,014-36,371 eGFP RNA copies/100 ng of total RNA). The procedure is not harmful for animals and it offers a wide range of gene delivery options because it allows different perfusion ways (anterograde and retrograde) and different flow rates to determine the optimal conditions of gene transfer. This strategy permits the use of cell therapy and viral or non-viral liver gene therapy, especially appropriated to a wide variety of inherited or acquired diseases because of the liver's ability to produce and deliver proteins to the bloodstream.

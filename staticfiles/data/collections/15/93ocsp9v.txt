The purpose of this article is twofold, one is to provide a brief review on various lavatory cleaning devices while the other is to study the feasibility of using these devices in public toilets in developing countries. The article presents a literature review on various lavatory cleaning devices, focusing on various designs available as patent documents and commercially available toilet cleaning robots. The issues that prevent these devices from being deployed in multi-lavatory public toilet complexes in developing countries are discussed. Design considerations of a simple, cost-effective, semi-automated lavatory cleaning robot that may serve as a solution to these issues are also covered in this article.

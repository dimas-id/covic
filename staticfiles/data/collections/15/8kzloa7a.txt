ABSTRACT: Vulnerability of respiratory mucosa to invasions of airborne pathogens, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and avian viruses which sometimes cause a life-threatening epidemic and even pandemic, underscores significance of developing a pulmonary vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS). Herein, 30-nm aluminum nanoparticles (ANs), unlike the mostly used adjuvant alum which is unsuitable for delivering pulmonary vaccines due to side effects, proved able to act as a VADS fitting inhalation immunization to elicit wide-spread anti-antigen immunity. In vitro ANs facilitated cellular uptake of their cargos and, after pulmonary vaccination, induced mouse production of high levels of anti-antigen IgG in serum and IgA in saliva, nasal, bronchoalveolar and also vaginal fluids. Besides, IFN-Î³ and anti-antigen IgG2a enriched in immunized mice which meanwhile showed no obvious lung inflammation indicated balanced Th1/Th2 responses were safely induced. These outcomes suggest ANs may be an efficient pulmonary VADS for defending against pathogens, especially, the ones invading hosts via respiratory system. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: Aluminum nanoparticles can safely induce humoral and cellular immunity at systemic and mucosal level through pulmonary vaccination to contrast the conventional adjuvant alum.

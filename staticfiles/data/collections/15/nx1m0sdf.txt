BACKGROUND Laparoscopy is a surgical approach recommended for the treatment of gall bladder disease. It is recommended also in geriatric patients. Recently Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (SILC) has been proposed to minimize surgical trauma, recovery and hospitalization time. However, the results and advantages of SILC in the geriatric population have received minimal attention. This case series review is focused on the results of SILC in the geriatric population. METHODS The records of 355 patients who had undergone SILC were reviewed. This report identifies, in the entire cohort, 40 patients aged 65 years or older at the time of surgery who will be the object of this study (geriatric series). Clinical outcomes and results were evaluated. Moreover, post-operative pain of the geriatric cohort was compared to that of the entire series. RESULTS SILC was successfully completed for 347 out of 355 patients of the entire series, with no mortality reported. In total SILC was converted to standard laparoscopy in 10 patients (2.2%) but never to open procedure. No significant difference was found between the total cohort and the geriatric series in terms of median time of operation (61.20 min vs 68.38 min). Post-operative pain was significantly lower in geriatric patients. CONCLUSION SILC is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of gallbladder disease of elderly, also in terms of post-operative pain and it represents an alternative to the standard laparoscopic approach on a routine basis.

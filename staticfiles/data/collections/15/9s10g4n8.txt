Structural holes are channels or paths spanned by a group of indirectly connected nodes and their intermediary in a network. In this work we emphasize the interesting role of structural holes as brokers for information propagation. Based on the distribution of the structural hole numbers associated with each node, we propose a simple yet effective approach for choosing the most influential nodes to immunize in containing the spreading processes. Using a wide spectrum of large real-world networks, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in a remarkable way. In particular, we find that the performance gains of our approach are particularly prominent for networks with high transitivity and assortativity, which verifies the vital role of structural holes in information diffusion on networked systems.

INTRODUCTION Management of fistula-in-ano requires understanding of both perianal and rectal anatomy, as well as the surgical approaches available to ensure the highest possible postoperative continence and wound healing. Further, high rates of recurrence with medical management commonly bring these patients under the care of the colorectal surgeon after variable periods of failed conservative management. Novel techniques provide surgeons with tools to treat increasingly complex fistulas with a focus on maintaining sphincteric functionality and limiting recurrence. METHOD This manuscript presents our practice, including perioperative decision making regarding surgical approach, in managing patients with fistula-in-ano. CONCLUSION Familiarity with these techniques prepares the general surgeon and colorectal surgeon to improve wound healing and functional outcomes in these patients, especially with complex disease involving the external and internal anal sphincters.

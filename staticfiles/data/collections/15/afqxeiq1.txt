The study reported that expression of misfolded proteins in the ER affects the composition of complexes containing EDEM1, SEL1L, and LC3-I, thereby modulating ERAD activity in the absence of UPR induction. During efforts to extend this work, we have been unable to replicate some of the results obtained by the first author of the paper. The authors have now found that Western blot data shown in Figures 1B, 3A, and 4A were inappropriately processed by the first author of the paper, such that they do not accurately report the original data. This could call into question some of our conclusions on how the presence of misfolded proteins might affect assembly and function of the ERAD machinery. The authors therefore wish to immediately retract the paper. The authors' lab continues working on the regulation of the ERAD machinery aiming to publish verified data in the near future. The authors sincerely apologize for any difficulties that may have been experienced by the scientific community. The first author, R.B., declined to sign the retraction notice.

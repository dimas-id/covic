Abstract Monoclonal hybridoma antibodies (MAb) of defined polypeptide specificity and biological activity were used in a competition binding assay to identify antibody binding sites (epitopes) on the glycoproteins of murine hepatitis virus-4 strain JHM (MHV-4). Individual MAb were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and used as probes in a competition enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Four topographically distinct antigenic sites were detected on the E2 glycoprotein of MHV-4. Antibodies reacting with these four determinants provisionally designated A(E2), B(E2), C(E2), and D(E2) had corresponding biological activities (M. J. Buchmeier, H. A. Lewicki, P. J. Talbot, and R. L. Knobler (1984) Virology 132, 261â€“270). Antibodies to sites A(E2) and B(E2) mediated virus neutralization in vitro and passively protected mice against lethal virus challenge in vivo. Antibody to site C(E2) neutralized virus efficiently in vitro but did not alter disease in vivo, while antibody to site D(E2) neither neutralized nor protected. Two major nonoverlapping antigenic sites were defined on the El glycoprotein. Overlapping epitopes A(El) and B(El) constituted one site and epitope C(E1) the other.

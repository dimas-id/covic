BACKGROUND An adverse event in laparoscopic bariatric surgery that has not received much scrutiny involves tube/probe stapling or suturing during gastrectomy or gastroenterostomy. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed using a questionnaire sent to all bariatric surgeons (n = 43) in Israel. RESULTS Eight surgeons reported on 17 cases in which intraoperative nasogastric/orogastric tube (n = 8), temperature probe (n = 6), or bougie stapling (n = 3) was identified. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed in 14 patients and laparoscopic gastric bypass in 3 patients. The patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative results are reported. CONCLUSION Tube/probe complications can occur during laparoscopic bariatric surgery but are seldom reported. However, they can be associated with significant morbidity. The treatment options are dependent on the situation. More importantly, prevention strategies must include constant communication with the anesthesiologist and removal or relocation of a tube before stapling or suturing.

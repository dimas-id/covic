OBJECTIVE To describe a case of spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to pulmonary thromboembolism possibly associated with pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism. CASE SUMMARY A 7-year-old spayed female Collie weighing 26 kg was referred for evaluation of spontaneous pneumothorax. An exploratory thoracotomy was performed and revealed 2 lung lobes to be diffusely hemorrhagic and they were resected. Histologic examination of multiple sections documented diffuse thromboembolism. A 2-3 cm thrombus was visualized distal to the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery during an echocardiographic examination postoperatively. The dog was discharged to the owner after recovery from surgery. The thrombus had resolved at the 4-week recheck examination. Diagnosis of pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism was confirmed based on follow-up endocrine testing. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED This is the first report of pulmonary thromboembolism causing spontaneous pneumothorax in the dog.

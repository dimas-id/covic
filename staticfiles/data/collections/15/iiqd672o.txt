PURPOSE To determine the risk factors and clinical impact of stent fractures after superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting. METHODS From May 2009 to June 2012, 171 consecutive patients (mean age 74.5Â±7.8, years; 106 men) who presented with SFA stenosis or occlusion in 205 limbs underwent stent implantation in the SFA at a single center. Stent fractures were determined by radiography and classified into types I through V. Loss of patency was assessed by duplex ultrasonography (>2.4 peak systolic velocity ratio) or angiography (percent diameter stenosis >50%). RESULTS The 12- and 24-month primary patency rates were 49.8% and 43.4%, respectively. Stent fractures occurred in 12.5% and 26.8% per limb (6.6% and 19.4% per stent) at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Primary patency was numerically worse in the stent fracture group but not statistically different from the group without fractures at 2 years. Primary patency for different classes of stent fracture were 30.8% (type I), 50.0% (type II), and 31.3% (type III-V). Hyperlipidemia (p=0.001), TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II classification (p=0.007), chronic total occlusion (CTO; p<0.001), proximal lesion location (p=0.008), lesion calcification (p=0.025), total stent length (p=0.005), stent diameter (p=0.001), and number of stents (p=0.001) were statistically significant predictors of stent fracture. Multivariate analysis showed that CTO (hazard ratio 0.173, 95% confidence interval 0.042 to 0.716, p=0.015) was an independent predictor of stent fracture. CONCLUSION Stent fractures occur more frequently in patients with CTOs after treatment of longer stented lesions. Although multivariate analysis showed that CTO was the only independent predictor regardless of stent length or number, the stent fracture rate was numerically higher in the severe calcification and proximal SFA lesion subgroups. Stent fracture did not appear to affect long-term patency rates, but this is yet to be confirmed with further follow-up.

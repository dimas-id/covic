This manuscript highlights the risk that shelter-in-place instructions during COVID-19 places on victims of domestic violence and serves as a call-to-action to address this crisis. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, "stay at home" has become the mantra of governments and public health organizations alike. But for victims of domestic violence, home is often not a place of safety. Staying at home not only places survivors of domestic violence at risk for further violence, but also isolates them from networks of support. Containment policies may lead to higher rates of domestic violence, substance abuse, anxiety, major depression, suicide, and other manifestations of unmet mental health needs. Job losses and financial insecurity may tip at-risk relationships into violence.

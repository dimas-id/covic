The grey-headed flying fox ( Pteropus poliocephalus) is a species endemic to coastal eastern Australia. This study presents a comprehensive set of biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis biomarkers from which reference values were derived. Blood samples collected from free-ranging P. poliocephalus were submitted for hematology ( n = 140) and plasma biochemistry ( n = 161) and urine for urinalysis ( n = 95). The values for P. poliocephalus were broadly consistent with those values published for other Australian Pteropus species. Statistically significant within-species age and sex effects were observed: adult P. poliocephalus had higher mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, alanine transferase (ALT), protein, globulin, urinary specific gravity, and urinary ketones, whereas subadults had higher mean red blood cell, white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, and juveniles had higher mean neutrophil count and alkaline phosphatase; male P. poliocephalus had higher mean reticulocyte count, alanine transferase, glucose, and urinary ketones, whereas females had higher mean WBC, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts. The findings inform both clinical and research scenarios for P. poliocephalus in captivity or rehabilitation and for health assessments of free-living populations.

PURPOSE While LigaSure is commonly used for blood vessel closure, our aim was to research the effectiveness of using the latter tool for the purpose of closing intestines in rats. METHODS Twenty Wistar albino rats were divided into two groups per 10 each. In Group 1, the sigmoid colon was cut from its middle and its distal was closed with 4/0 silk. In Group 2, on the other hand, the sigmoid colon was divided from the middle with LigaSure LS1200 probe and its distal was closed with LigaSure. In both groups, the proximal sigmoid colon was entered by means of colostomy with 4/0 silk to the left part of the abdomen. Operation durations, adhesion levels and explosion pressures were recorded. Tissue samples were taken for tissue hydroxyproline level. RESULTS While the average duration of the operation was 25.7 minutes in Group 1, it was 18.8 minutes in Group 2 and the difference between them was significant in favour of LigaSure. (p<0.001). Stump explosion pressure was 181.4 (160-190) mmHg in average in the suture group (Group 1), and 173.3 (150-190) mmHg in the LigaSure group (Group 2) and the difference between them was not statistically significant. Tissue hydroxyproline level was 123.6 (13-232) in Group 1, and 123.3 (32-216) in Group 2 and no significant difference was determined between the groups. Adhesion level between the groups was also similar. CONCLUSIONS This study experimentally shows that the duration of effective stump closure as part of Hartman colonostomy can be shortened with LigaSure (Tab. 1, Fig. 4, Ref. 12).

PURPOSE We studied fissure status and devices used to divide lung parenchyma during thoracoscopic pulmonary lobectomy (TPL). METHODS 52 consecutive TPL indicated for congenital pulmonary airway malformation or interlobar pulmonary sequestration performed between 2009 and 2019 were reviewed prospectively to compare patients with absent fissure and no visible interlobar pulmonary artery (IPA) treated by stapling (group A; n = 10), incomplete fissure with partially visible IPA treated with an Enseal® or LigaSure™ device (group I; n = 17), and complete fissure with fully visible IPA treated by electrocautery (group C; n = 25). RESULTS Patient demographics were similar. Mean age at TPL was 2.82 years (range 0.03-9.81). Mean duration of follow-up was 4.77 years (range 0.33-10.19). Operative time and duration of chest tube insertion were similar (p = NS). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in group C compared with group I (p = 0.028). Complications were minor bronchial artery hemorrhage during anterior-to-posterior bronchial dissection (group A: n = 1; group I: n = 1), problematic single lung ventilation (group I: n = 1), and persistent postoperative air leak (group I: n = 1). CONCLUSION While fissure status does not appear to affect the outcome of TPL in children, the choice of device for dividing lung parenchyma relies specifically on fissure status.

An alveolar pattern is defined by the existence of more or less broad portions of the lung more opaque than normal due to partial or complete alveolar filling. With a few exceptions, the pulmonary architecture is overall preserved, and, if signs of interstitial involvement are present, they are not prevalent. On HRCT the different opacity of the alveolar pattern reminds the variable density of the clouds.

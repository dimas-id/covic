Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are two of the most common bariatric procedures performed in 2011. Although the complication rates associated with these procedures are low, the consequences of these complications are significant and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis and proper management of these complications are extremely important. The most commonly used radiologic studies in bariatric surgery are the upper GI contrast study and the CT scan, which are used to rule out leak, obstruction, perforation, anastomotic stricture, or pouch dilatation. As with all imaging studies, a negative result should not override strong clinical suspicion of a complication.

We give some numerical observations on the total number of infected by the SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. The analysis is based on a tanh formula involving two parameters. A polynomial correlation between the parameters gives an upper bound for the time of the peak of new infected. A numerical indicator of the temporal variability of the upper bound is introduced. The result and the possibility to extend the analysis to other countries are discussed in the conclusions.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the mechanisms and preventability of occupational percutaneous blood exposure of healthcare workers through needlestick injuries and to discuss rational strategies for prevention. METHODS: To calculate the preventability, we surveyed in a first step the number and kind of needlestick injuries and in a second step the reasons for the injuries and the working conditions of the healthcare workers. Both data sets were collected in independent anonymous questionnaire covering occupational blood exposure among healthcare workers in a German university hospital. RESULTS: Needlestick injuries were caused through unsafe procedures, difficult working conditions and unsafe devices. On average, 50.3% (n = 492/978) of all needlestick injuries could have been avoided by the use of safety devices, whereas only 15.2% could have been prevented by organizational measures. In our study, 31.5% (n = 503/1598) of participant healthcare workers had sustained at least one needlestick injury in the past twelve months. The rate of underreporting was about 75%. After introduction of safety devices, 91.8% of the healthcare workers reported being satisfied with the anti-needlestick devices and 83.4% believed that safety devices would increase the safety of the work environment. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to blood is a common problem among healthcare workers. The introduction of safety devises is one of the main starting points for avoidance of needlestick injuries, and acceptance among healthcare workers is high. Further targets for preventive measures, such as training in safe working routines, are necessary for improvement of safe work conditions.

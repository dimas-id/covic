The correction of an unfavorable outcome after otoplasty requires a thorough understanding of the anatomy of prominent ear and recognition of the spectrum of secondary deformities and their origin. The goal of this article is to describe the causes of postotoplasty deformity, including both undercorrection and overcorrection. The latter presents the more complicated reconstructive problem, as both skin shortage and permanent cartilage disruption need to be addressed. The authors propose an algorithm for revision otoplasty based on clinical findings and patient concerns. Finally, a case with overcorrection secondary to both skin deficiency and cartilage disruption is illustrated showing the sequential steps needed for optimal correction.

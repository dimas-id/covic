Solid organ transplant recipients are considered at a high risk for severe COVID‚Äê19 disease due to chronic immunosuppression, though their risk compared to that of the general population remains unclear. Management of lung transplant recipients can be particularly challenging given high levels of maintenance immunosuppression, high incidence of rejection, constant exposure of the graft to the external environment, and diagnostic uncertainty in patients with respiratory symptoms. There is currently limited data on manifestations, management, and outcomes in lung transplant recipients who develop this novel infection (1).

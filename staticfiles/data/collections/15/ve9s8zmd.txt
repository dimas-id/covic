Abstract In this paper the authors question whether the development of a vaccine against cryptosporidiosis could be taken into consideration. The necessity and feasibility of such a vaccine for human and veterinary application is discussed. Developmental stages within the life cycle of the parasite that might act as possible targets for vaccine development are summarised, as well as the target antigens offered by molecular biology and immunology studies. Vaccination trials against cryptosporidiosis carried out so far, including the active and passive immunisation approach, are also overviewed. It seems that with respect to a Cryptosporidium vaccine two target groups can be considered: children of the developing world and neonatal ruminants. Antigens representing possible candidates for a subunit vaccine were identified based on their function, location and/or the immune response they evoke. While the active vaccination of newborn calves, lambs and goat kids has to face a number of important limitations, the passive immunisation approach, where dams were immunised to protect their progeny by colostral transfer, was proven to be a valuable alternative. Finally, a number of points of action for the near future are put forward.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process through which double‐stranded RNA induces the activation of cellular pathways, leading to potent and selective silencing of genes with homology to the double strand. Much excitement surrounding small interfering RNA (siRNA)‐mediated therapeutics arises from the fact that this approach overcomes many of the shortcomings previously experienced with approaches such as antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides and pharmacological inhibitors. Induction of RNAi through administration of siRNA has been successfully used in treatment of hepatitis, viral infections, and cancer. In this review we will present a brief history of RNAi, methods of inducing RNAi, application of RNAi in the therapeutic setting, and the possibilities of using this highly promising approach in the context of transplantation.

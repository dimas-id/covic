The United States (US) spends more on healthcare than any other country with little evidence of better, or even comparable, outcomes. We reflect on the US and the COVID-19 pandemic and focus on cultural, economic and structural barriers that threaten both current and future responses to infectious diseases emergencies. These include the US healthcare delivery model, the defunding of public health, a scarcity of infectious diseases physicians, the market failure of vaccines and anti-infectives and the concept of American exceptionalism. Without institutionalizing the lessons learned, the US will be positioned to repeat the missteps of COVID-19 with the next pandemic.

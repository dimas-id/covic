BACKGROUND A clear operative view of the middle and lower mediastinum is possible in prone position during video-assisted thorocoscopic surgery of esophagus (VATS-E), but the working space in the upper mediastinum is limited and lymph node dissection along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is difficult in this position. METHODS Esophagectomy and lymph node dissection are performed for pneumothorax by maintaining CO2 insufflation in the prone position. Working space in the left upper mediastinal area for lymph node dissection around RLN is limited in this position. To create space, the residual esophagus is stripped in the reverse direction and retracted toward the neck after the stomach tube is removed through the nose. Lymph node dissection is performed after stripping the residual esophagus. RESULTS We could obtain a clear operative field in the upper left mediastinum by stripping the residual esophagus in the prone position, enabling safe and straightforward lymph node dissection along the left RLN. The rate of permanent RLN paralysis was 1.2%. CONCLUSIONS Lymph node dissection along the left RLN after esophageal stripping is possible in the prone position during VATS-E.

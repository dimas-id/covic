BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has turned into a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological research showed that gender was associated with the severity of COVID‐19, but the underlying mechanism of gender predisposition remains poorly understood. We aim to study the gendered differences in inflammation reaction, and the association with severity and mortality of COVID‐19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 548 COVID‐19 inpatients from Tongji Hospital from January 26 to February 5, 2020, and followed up to March 3, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical features, and inflammatory indexes were collected and compared between males and females. Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to identify gendered effect on mortality of COVID‐19 after adjusting age, comorbidity and smoking history. Multiple linear regression method was used to explore the influence of sex on inflammation reaction. RESULTS: Males had higher mortality than females did (22.2% vs. 10.4%), with the HR of 1.923 (95% CI, 1.181‐3.130); elder age and comorbidity were significantly associated with decease of COVID‐19 patients. Excess inflammation reaction was related to severity of COVID‐19. Male patients had greater inflammation reaction, with higher levels of IL‐10, TNF‐α, LDH, ferritin and hsCRP, but lower lymphocyte count than females adjusted by age and comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, age, and comorbidity are critical risk factors for mortality of COVID‐19. Excess innate immunity and proinflammation activity, and deficiency in adaptive immunity response promote males especially elder males to develop cytokine storm, causing potential ARDS, multiple organ failure and decease.

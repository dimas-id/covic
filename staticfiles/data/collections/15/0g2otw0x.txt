Background and Purpose Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is an established treatment of acute anterior circulation stroke caused by large vessel occlusion (LVO). We compared the clinical outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale, mRS) in hyperacute (<3h from the onset of symptoms) ischemic stroke between an MT and an intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) cohort in proximal (ICA and the proximal M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery) and distal (the distal M1 and the M2 segment) LVOs. Methods We prospectively reviewed 67 patients who underwent MT with newer-generation stent retrievers. The IVT cohort consisted of 98 patients who received IVT without MT. We recorded baseline clinical, procedural and imaging variables, technical outcome, 24-h imaging outcome, and the clinical outcome. Differences between the groups were studied with theoretically appropriate statistical tests and binary logistic regression analysis. Results The proportion of patients who had a proximal LVO and experienced good (mRS ≤2) or excellent (mRS ≤1) clinical outcome was significantly larger in the MT group (62 vs. 7%, p < 0.001; 47 vs. 3%, p < 0.001, respectively). In a regression model including relevant confounding variables, good clinical outcome was seen significantly more often among patients with proximal occlusions (OR = 6.0, CI 95% 1.9-18.3, p = 0.002). In a similar model, no statistically significant differences were observed in patients with more distal occlusions. Conclusions MT is superior to IVT in achieving good clinical outcome in hyperacute anterior circulation stroke in the most proximal occlusions (ICA and proximal M1 segment). In the distal M1 and M2 segments neither of these therapies clearly outperforms the other.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the status of ocular donor tissues of a COVID-19 postmortem donor. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected via a pharyngeal swab and broncho-alveolar lavage in the COVID-19 suspect. Postmortem tissue procurement and preparation were performed with personal protective equipment (PPE) and the necessary protective measures. qRT-PCR-testing was performed for the following ocular tissues and fluids: conjunctival fluid swabs, bulbar conjunctiva, corneal epithelium, corneal stroma, corneal endothelium, anterior chamber fluid, lens, iris, vitreous, retina, uvea, sclera, and optic nerve. Informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to this study (196/2020BO2; Date of approval: 03/26/2020; Ethics Committee of the University of Tuebingen). RESULTS: In all ocular tissue and fluid samples no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected via qRT-PCR of the confirmed COVID-19 postmortem donor. CONCLUSIONS: and Importance: Late-stage COVID-19 patients might not harbor an ocular reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. The risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via ocular tissues and fluids might be low. This may bear future implications for patient management in ophthalmological practice, surgery and transplantation.

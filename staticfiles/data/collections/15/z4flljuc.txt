Paramyxovirus might adopt a molecular mechanism of membrane fusion similar to that of other class I viruses in which the heptad repeat (HR) regions of fusion protein (F) HR1 and HR2 form a six-helix bundle structure inducing membrane fusion. In this study, we examined the structure and function of HR1 and HR2 from the avian paramyxovirus-2 (APMV-2) F protein. The study showed that APMV-2 HR1 and HR2 formed a stable six-helix bundle. Only a soluble APMV-2 HR2 peptide showed potent and specific virus-cell fusion inhibition activity. Cross-inhibiting activity with APMV-1 (Newcastle disease virus, NDV) was not found. A possible mechanism of membrane fusion inhibition by the paramyxovirus HR2 peptide is discussed.

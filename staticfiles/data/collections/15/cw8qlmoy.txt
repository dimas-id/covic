Abstract Following infection of RN2 rat Schwannoma cells with unfiltered JHMV inocula, a cell line with an altered phenotype evolved, which was shown to be a somatic cell hybrid of RN2 and mouse L-2 cells. This cell line, EJ, persistently yields JHMV at titres greater than 106 pfu/ml and does not show the suppression of virus production at 39.5 Â°C that is characteristic of a persistently infected RN2 line. Intracellular viral nucleocapsids are demonstrated. Cloning of EJ hybrids yields cell lines that show a variety of responses to infection by JHMV or MHV3.

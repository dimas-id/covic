Robotic surgery has greatly improved surgeon dexterity and ergonomics but has substantially increased the number and size of ports required. The typical robotic surgical procedure will use three 8-mm ports and two 12-mm ports. Single-port laparoscopy, also known as Laparo-Endoscopic Single Site (LESS) surgery, is an attempt to further enhance cosmetic benefits and reduce morbidity of minimally invasive surgery.We present our initial clinical experience and technique with robotic-assisted single-port surgery in gynecology.

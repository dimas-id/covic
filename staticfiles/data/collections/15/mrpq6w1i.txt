Abstract Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is associated with the severe hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) outcomes, however the host-virus interaction mechanism and the pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in variety physiological and pathological processes, but the functions of lncRNAs in EV71 infection remain elusive. Here we profiled the expression of lncRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from EV71-infected mild patients, severe patients as well as the healthy controls, and identified 8541 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. Focused on the dynamic changed lncRNAs, we performed systematic bioinformatics analysis with Series Test of Cluster (STC) algorithm, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, pathway analysis and lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network analysis, and revealed the potential functions and related pathways of these lncRNAs were associated with immunity and inflammation during the clinical process of EV71-infected HFMD. Among the significant dynamic changed lncRNAs, ten lncRNAs were screened whose expression were further validated in EV71-infected mild patients, severe patients and healthy control. These results shed light on the potential roles of lncRNAs in EV71-infected HFMD, especially in distinguishing the mild and severe cases for early diagnose and treatment, moreover, provide deeper insight into the mechanism of EV71-induced immune and inflammatory responses, as well as the pathogenesis of the imbalanced inflammation in severe EV71 infection.

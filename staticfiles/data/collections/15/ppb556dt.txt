Asking questions is one of the most crucial pedagogical techniques used by teachers in class. It not only offers open-ended discussions between teachers and students to exchange ideas but also provokes deeper student thought and critical analysis. Providing teachers with such pedagogical feedback will remarkably help teachers improve their overall teaching quality over time in classrooms. Therefore, in this work, we build an end-to-end neural framework that automatically detects questions from teachersâ€™ audio recordings. Compared with traditional methods, our approach not only avoids cumbersome feature engineering, but also adapts to the task of multi-class question detection in real education scenarios. By incorporating multi-task learning techniques, we are able to strengthen the understanding of semantic relations among different types of questions. We conducted extensive experiments on the question detection tasks in a real-world online classroom dataset and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model in terms of various evaluation metrics.

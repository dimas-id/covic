An outbreak of flaccid paralysis syndrome in adults is ongoing in Congo. Molecular analysis of faecal, throat and cerebrospinal samples identified wildtype 1 poliovirus and an additional enterovirus C strain related to enterovirus 109 as the cause. As of 22 November, the cumulative number of cases was 409, of which 169 (41.3%) were fatal. This is one of the largest wild type 1 poliovirus outbreaks ever described associated with an unusually high case fatality rate.

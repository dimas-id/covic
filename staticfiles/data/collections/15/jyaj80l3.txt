The effects of glycyrrhizin diammonium (GD) and lithium chloride (LiCl) on cell infection by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were investigated using cytopathic effect observation, plaque-reduction assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The anti-viral effect of GD and LiCl on virus, on virus-infected cells or on cells pre-treated by both drugs was analysed, respectively. Our results showed that GD had a direct antiviral activity, leading to complete inhibition of cell infection. The cell infection was not alleviated by either pre-treatment of cells with GD or addition of the drug post infection, confirming that the inhibitory effect of GD, unlike LiCl, on IBV is a viral factor, rather than a cellular factor. The inhibitory effect of both drugs was confirmed by infecting primary chicken embryo kidney cells. In addition, apoptosis of infected cells was positively related with cytopathic effect and could be inhibited by effective drug treatment. Our data indicate that GD and LiCl have potential to prevent IBV infection in vitro through different antiviral mechanisms. The data are helpful for using antivirals efficiently.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a potentially severe disease caused by the recently described SARS-CoV-2. Whether liver fibrosis might be a relevant player in the natural history of COVID-19 is currently unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association between FIB-4 and the risk of progression to critical illness in middle-aged patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study with prospective follow-up of 160 patients aged 35–65 years with COVID-19, FIB-4, clinical, and biochemical variables were collected at baseline. FIB-4 ≥2.67 defined patients with risk for advanced liver fibrosis. RESULTS: Risk for advanced fibrosis was estimated in 28.1% of patients. Patients with FIB-4 ≥2.67 more frequently required mechanical ventilation (37.8% vs 18.3%; P = .009). In multivariate analysis, FIB-4 ≥2.67 (odds ratio [OR], 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30–8.92), cardiovascular risk factors (OR, 5.05; 95% CI, 1.90–13.39), previous respiratory diseases (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.36–15.10), and C-reactive protein (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02) increased significantly the risk of ICU admission. Bootstrap confirmed FIB-4 as an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged patients with COVID-19, FIB-4 may have a prognostic role. The link between liver fibrosis and the natural history of COVID-19 should be evaluated in future studies.

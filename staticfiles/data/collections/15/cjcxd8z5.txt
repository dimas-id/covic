The COVID-19 has been successfully contained in China but is spreading all over the world. We calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized Richards model and the generalized growth model to the reported number of infected cases from for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, and 19 countries and regions that are undergoing major outbreaks. We dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogeneous situations across provinces. The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. Borrowing from the experience of China, we made scenario projections on the development of the outbreak in other countries. We identified that Europe and US have passed the inflection point and entered into an after-peak trajectory, which is estimated longer than what a classical Logistic model predicts, in contrast to most provinces in China where the after-peak trajectory is much faster. We expect Europe to have 1.83 million final total confirmed cases (2452 per million population) and US to have 1.26 million final total confirmed cases (3851 per million population). We identified three groups of countries in different level of outbreak progress, and provide informative implications for the current global pandemic.

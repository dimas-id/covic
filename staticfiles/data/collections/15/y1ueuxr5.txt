With increased use of medical imaging, the incidental detection of benign solid liver tumors has become more frequent. Facing with benign disease, the indications for surgery are still object of discussion in light of the stable natural course of most lesions and obvious drawbacks of any surgical intervention; therefore, in most situations, a conservative approach is recommended, and surgery is mainly reserved for those cases with persistent or worsening symptoms, or who are at risk for complications as malignant transformation. The advent of ablative techniques has widened the range of treatment options available to these patients, presenting as a valid alternative to resection in terms of safety and efficacy in selected cases, particularly in patients who are considered poor surgical candidates and with smaller lesions. This review outlines the role of percutaneous ablative methods for benign solid liver tumors that are encountered in adults, providing a per histology analysis of the existing evidence. The up-to-date strategies for management of the most common benign solid tumors are recapitulated.

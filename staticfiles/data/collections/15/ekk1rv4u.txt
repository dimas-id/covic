Five landmark multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point clinical trials have recently demonstrated significant clinical benefit of endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients presenting with proximal intracranial large vessel occlusions. The Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology (SVIN) appointed an expert writing committee to summarize this new evidence and make recommendations on how these data should guide emergency endovascular therapy for AIS patients.

INTRODUCTION The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus demands the development of strategies not only to detect or inactivate the virus, but to treat it (therapeutically and prophylactically). COVID-19 is not only a critical threat for the population with risk factors, but also generates a dramatic economic impact in terms of morbidity and the overall interruption of economic activities. AREAS COVERED Advanced materials are the basis of several technologies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19: biosensors might allow early virus detection, nanosized vaccines are powerful agents that could prevent viral infections, and nanosystems with antiviral activity could bind the virus for inactivation or destruction upon application of an external stimulus. Herein all these methods are discussed under the light of cutting-edge technologies and the previously reported prototypes targeting enveloped viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature search (including pubmed) performed on April 2020. EXPERT OPINION Perspectives on how biosensors, vaccines, and antiviral nanosystems can be implemented to fight COVID-19 are envisioned; identifying the approaches that can be implemented in the short term and those that deserve long term research to cope with respiratory viruses-related pandemics in the future.

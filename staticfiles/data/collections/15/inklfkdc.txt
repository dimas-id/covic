Metacognitive experience (ME) plays an important role in self-regulated learning. To date, through mainly self-reporting methodology, metacognition assessment lacks objective evidence and therefore hinder the discussion of its subjective and implicit nature. In exploring ME, eye-tracking and skin conductance response (SCR) offer certain advantages over self-reporting methods. However, to date, most studies tend to focus on utilizing these measures to explore metacognitive skills (MS) rather than ME. Also, while some studies do explore ME with these measures tend to utilize the data from a summative perspective rather than aligning the data with the real-time ME behaviours. Based on previous works in this field, this research will discuss how feeling of difficulty (i.e. a type of ME) functions in real-time based on the hypothesis that eye-tracking and SCR data can provide objective measures. Through such, a better understanding of how FOD functions could be gained and therefore contribute to the support of learnersâ€™ metacognitive competencies.

The etiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was discovered in Wuhan in late 2019 and has spread to the world, were expounded. In view of the application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the plague over these years, the therapeutic advantages of TCM in different stages of COVID-19 were expounded as “strengthening body resistance and eliminating evil, meeting changes with constancy”, “Syndrome differentiation and treatment, meeting change with variance”, with aim to reduce the sequelae caused by hormone and other drugs and the mortality. It is suggested that Chinese medicine of clearing heat and removing toxin should be used to prevent the uninfected people from COVID-19, and intervene in the early stage of the disease and control the development of it to be severe by inhibiting the “cytokine storm”. In order to refine the dialectical classification according to the theory of “defensing-qi-nutrient-blood syndrome differentiation”, to give full play to the individual advantages of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. We should pay attention to the rational use of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, collect the real world clinical data, and integrate TCM and Western medicine with TCM as the main part. The COVID-19 database of integrated TCM and Western medicine can be used to prepare for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

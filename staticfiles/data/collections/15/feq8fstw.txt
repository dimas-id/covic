Fetal tissue from primiparous hamsters prevented simian virus 40 (SV40) tumorigenesis in male hamsters, whereas fetal tissue from multiparous hamsters did not. The parity status of normal (uninoculated) hamsters also influenced the cytotoxicity of their lymphoid cells against tumor cells. Lymph node cells from nonpregnant primiparous and multiparous animals were cytotoxic in microcytotoxicity tests against SV40, polyoma, and adenovirus 7 tumor cells, but were not active against control BHK cells. Lymph node cells from virgin female donors were inactive. Peritoneal exudate cells from these donors reacted in similar fashion against SV40 tumor cells in vitro and in adoptive transfer tests in vivo. However, the cytotoxicity of peritoneal exudate cells from multiparous hamsters was greatly reduced during pregnancy, a time when noncytotoxic humoral antibody reactive with surface antigen of SV40 tumor cells is present. This humoral antibody is not detected during first pregnancy, and peritoneal exudate cells obtained from pregnant primiparous hamsters demonstrated a high degree of cytotoxicity.

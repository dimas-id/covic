Clinical and economic outcomes in hospitalized patients with CAP directly are related to the way that certain processes of care are executed at the local-hospital level. For each process of care, a clear and evidence-based recommended course of action should be stated. Having an unambiguous action plan helps to develop process-of-care indicators and to educate healthcare workers. Improving processes of care is a secure way to improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with CAP.

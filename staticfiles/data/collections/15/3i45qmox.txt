Respiratory infections caused by respiratory viruses are common in paediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and are associated with increased morbidity. There is only little data on the incidence of viral respiratory pathogens causing exacerbations in the adult CF patient population. In this observational pilot study we show, by using molecular as well as conventional techniques for viral isolation, that during 1 y a viral pathogen could be isolated in 8/24 (33%) adult CF patients who presented with a pulmonary exacerbation. This result shows that there is a considerable incidence of viral pathogens in pulmonary exacerbations in adult CF patients. Newly identified viruses such as pandemic influenza A/H1N1, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and human coronavirus NL63 were not detected in our population, except for 1 human coronavirus NL63.

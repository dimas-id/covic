In the standard technique of pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is approached following Kocher maneuver of the duodenum. Alternative approaches include SMA first with no touch approaches. The aim of this article is to report the preoperative planning for and operative techniques of a combined artery first with no touch technique (CTPD) for the performance of PD. The CTPD technique is described with a detailed discussion of the operative anatomy, and of the importance of preoperative mapping using computed tomography to aid dissection of the mesenteric root and identification of the SMA. The use of careful preoperative mapping of arterial anatomy on cross-sectional imaging helps to facilitate identification of the SMA and simplifies the operative approach to PD. By incorporating detailed preoperative planning and a careful anatomical dissection, the CTPD technique provides an earlier assessment of the superior mesenteric vessels and determination of resectability.

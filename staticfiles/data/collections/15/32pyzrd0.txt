Acute bronchitis is one of the most common infections reported in children under 5 years of age, and is a leading cause of hospitalisation. In general practice, confusion surrounds the clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis, especially when distinguishing it from asthma. The microbiological causes are mostly known, but the contribution of each is much less clear, and they are non-specific in their clinical expression in individual cases. Viral pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus and rhinoviruses are cited as the leading agents in the development of serious episodes, but other pathogens may also be important. This article covers a range of issues surrounding acute bronchitis, including epidemiology and pathogenesis, as well as the management, prevention and treatment of disease in children.

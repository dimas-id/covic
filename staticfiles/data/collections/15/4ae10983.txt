A 2-month-old intact female Miniature Pinscher puppy presented with footpad swelling and crusted pustules of ear pinnae. The dog had been vaccinated with a polyvalent canine vaccine 5 days prior to the onset of clinical signs. With the history of recent vaccination, the clinical presentation and the histopathological observations were suggestive of ischemic dermatopathy. Treatment involved oral prednisolone, azathioprine, and other immune modulating drugs, which did not work. Chlorambucil plus cyclosporine therapy was initiated for vigorous immune suppression after rush therapy using intravenous immunoglobulin. Clinical signs again gradually improved with no relapse or side effects, even at a 4-month follow-up. The case report is suggested ischemic dermatopathy refractory to conventional therapy and suggests effective approaches to long-term management of the disease.

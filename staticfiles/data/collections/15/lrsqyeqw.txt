A symbolic Lie p-ring defines a family of Lie rings with [Formula: see text] elements for infinitely many different primes p and a fixed positive integer n. Symbolic Lie p-rings are used to describe the classification of isomorphism types of nilpotent Lie rings of order [Formula: see text] for all primes p and all [Formula: see text]. This classification is available as the LiePRing package of the computer algebra system GAP. We give a brief description of this package, including an approach towards computing the automorphism group of a symbolic Lie p-ring.

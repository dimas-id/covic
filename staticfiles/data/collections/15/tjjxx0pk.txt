The traffic among the cellular compartments is thought to be mediated by membrane vesicles, which bud from one compartment and fuse with the next. Despite the continuous exchange of membrane components among them, the organelles maintain their characteristic protein and lipid compositions such that the traffic remains selective, thus, avoiding intermixing of components. This membrane traffic recycles components from the cell surface to the interior of the cell and back to the cell surface again. The membrane traffic between the ER and the cell surface involves a major sorting problem. Little is known of how the animal cell has solved this problem in molecular terms. One experimental tool in this direction is provided by some enveloped animal viruses, which mature at the cell surface of infected cells. Such viruses include influenza virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). They are extremely simple in makeup and hence are very well characterized. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the use of the enveloped viruses as tools in the study of membrane traffic in the animal cell. This is done in the context of the life cycle of the virus in the host cell. The article will be concerned mainly with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which is the virus that has been worked upon in the chapter. SFV belongs to the alphaviruses, a genus of the togavirus family.

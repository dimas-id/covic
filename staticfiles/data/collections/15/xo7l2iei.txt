COVID‐19 originated in Wuhan, China and has developed into a pandemic since late 2019. The virus possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as transmissibility. Many open questions remain, including the description of potential involvement of other organs than the respiratory tract. Most patients have mild influenza‐like symptoms. A minority, especially patients with chronic lung disease, develops lethal disease including severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure and septic shock.

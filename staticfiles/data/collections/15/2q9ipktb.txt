Laparoscopic heminephrectomy was performed in a 64-year-old woman with a chronically obstructed horseshoe kidney moiety. More than 3000 cc of pyonephrosis was drained through two percutaneous nephrostomy tubes for infection control before left moiety laparoscopic resection. This case report attests to the feasibility of laparoscopic resection of a massively obstructed horseshoe kidney when performed in a staged manner after prolonged drainage. Since an incision was required for removal of the large specimen, ligation of the horseshoe isthmus was completed through the same incision after hilar control and laparoscopic mobilization of the moiety were completed.

BACKGROUND Adverse drug reactions are a common cause of potentially avoidable harm, particularly in older adults. AIMS To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a pilot multifactorial intervention to reduce potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in older adults. METHODS We conducted a phase 2, feasibility, open-label study in the ambulatory setting of an integrated healthcare network in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We recruited primary care physicians (PCPs) and measured PIM use in a sample of their patients (65 years or older). Educational workshops for PCPs were organized with the involvement of clinician champions. Practical deprescribing algorithms were designed based on Beers criteria. Automatic email alerts based on specific PIMs recorded in each patient's electronic health record were used as a reminder tool. PCPs were responsible for deprescribing decisions. We randomly sampled 879 patients taking PIMs from eight of the most commonly used drug classes at our institution and compared basal (6 months prior to the intervention) and final (12 months after) prevalence of PIM use using a test of proportions. RESULTS There was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in all drug classes evaluated. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (basal prevalence 5.92%; final 1.59%); benzodiazepines (10.13%; 6.94%); histamine antagonists (7.74%; 3.07%); opioids (2.16%; 1.25%); tricyclic antidepressants (8.08%; 4.10%); muscle relaxants (7.74%; 3.41%), anti-hypertensives (3.53%; 1.82%) and oxybutynin (2.96%; 1.82%). The absolute reduction in the overall prevalence was 8.5 percentage points (relative reduction of 51.4%). CONCLUSION This multifactorial intervention is feasible and effective in reducing the use of potentially inappropriate medication in all drug classes evaluated.

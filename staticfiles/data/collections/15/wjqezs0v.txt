Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Several in vitro and in vivo experimental models have been used to study TB pathogenesis and induction of immune response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Precision cut lung tissue slices (PCLTS) is an experimental model, in which all the usual cell types of the organ are found, the tissue architecture and the interactions amongst the different cells are maintained. PCLTS in good physiological conditions, monitored by MTT assay and histology, were infected with either virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv or the TB vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Histological analysis showed that bacilli infecting lung tissue slices were observed in the alveolar septa, alveolar light spaces, near to type II pneumocytes, and inside macrophages. Mycobacterial infection of PCLTS induced TNF-Î± production, which is consistent with previous M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo studies. This is the first report of using PCLTS as a system to study M. tuberculosis infection. The PCLTS model provides a useful tool to evaluate the innate immune responses and other aspects during the early stages of mycobacterial infection.

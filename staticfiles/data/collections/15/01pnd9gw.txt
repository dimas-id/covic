This chapter discusses the bacterial pathogens that cause infective exacerbations, trials of antimicrobial therapy, individual antimicrobial agents, and guidelines for their use in the treatment of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The relationship between respiratory tract infection, especially viral infection, and exacerbations of airway diseases is very well established. However, research is required to find new ways to distinguish between the colonization and infective exacerbations of COPD to gain a better understanding of the role of infection in the disease. With advances in molecular biology, the antigenic structures of bacteria and the evaluation of the antibody response to antigens can become the basis for identifying an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECB). Most clinical trials of antibiotics were performed for licensing, and patients with pathogens resistant to different antimicrobials were excluded. Future studies of new antimicrobials should examine clinical efficacy more stringently based on a classification system that would help select patients most likely to benefit from an antibiotic. These studies should also include well-defined prospective economic analyses and quality-of-life assessment to ascertain the cost utility of the antibiotic in question.

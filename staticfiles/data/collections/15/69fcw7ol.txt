Abstract Not all infectious disease outbreaks undergo full epidemiological investigations. In certain situations, the resultant lack of knowledge has led to the development of epidemics and public health emergencies. This review will examine six emerging pathogens including their history, present status, and potential to expand to epidemics. Recommendations to improve our understanding of these hidden outbreaks and others also will be provided in the context of health systems policy.

During the clinical course of COVID-19, it has been observed that hepatic injury occurs in a significant proportion of patients, particularly in those with severe or critical illness. Mild increase in sinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration and multifocal hepatic necrosis are the main pathologic changes. Direct viral induced cellular injuries and potential hepatotoxicity from therapeutic drugs are two likely underlying mechanisms. In addition, preexisting chronic liver disease exacerbated during COVID-19, and COVID-19-related hyper-inflammatory reactions may contribute to liver injury as well. Further studies of additional autopsy cases will help clarifying these possibilities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

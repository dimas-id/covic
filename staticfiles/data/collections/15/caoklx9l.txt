System vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the software or hardware on a server or a client that can be exploited by a determined intruder to gain access to or shut down a network. Vulnerabilities exist not only in the hardware and software that constitute a computer system but also in policies and procedures, especially security policies and procedures, that are used in a computer network system and in users and employees of the computer network systems. Vulnerabilities can be found in so many areas in a network system and are indeed anything in a computer network that has the potential to cause or be exploited for an advantage. This chapter explores the sources and assessment of a computer network systemâ€™s vulnerabilities.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently recognized infectious disease associated with severe morbidity and mortality. It presents with non-specific signs and symptoms and because no definitive laboratory test is readily available, it poses a great risk to healthcare workers as well as difficulty in quarantine. The global response has been coordinated and enthusiastic in trying to understand and control this disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome poses a threat to the Caribbean because of easy and convenient travel and the vibrant tourist industry.

Nowadays, nanotechnology has made huge, significant advancements in biotechnology and biomedicine related to human and animal science, including increasing health safety, production, and the elevation of national income. There are various fields of nanomaterial applications in veterinary medicine such as efficient diagnostic and therapeutic tools, drug delivery, animal nutrition, breeding and reproduction, and valuable additives. Additional benefits include the detection of pathogens, protein, biological molecules, antimicrobial agents, feeding additives, nutrient delivery, and reproductive aids. There are many nanomaterials and nanocomposites that can be used in nanomedicine such as metal nanoparticles, liposomes, carbon nanotubes, and quantum dots. In the near future, nanotechnology research will have the ability to produce novel tools for improving animal health and production. Therefore, this chapter was undertaken to spotlight novel methods created by nanotechnology for application in the improvement of animal health and production. In addition, the toxicity of nanomaterials is fully discussed to avoid the suspected health hazards of toxicity for animal health safety.

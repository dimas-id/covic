During the last century, 3 influenza A pandemics have occurred, and pandemic influenza will inevitably occur in the future. Although the timing and severity of the next pandemic cannot be predicted, the probability that a pandemic will occur has increased based on the current outbreaks of A(H5N1) in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Because of these widespread outbreaks, the World Health Organization declared a phase 3 pandemic alert in the fall of 2005. Early detection is essential to prevent the spread of avian influenza. Planning now can be achieved by integrating interventions to ensure a prompt and effective response to a pandemic. This article provides an overview of the current status of A(H5N1) influenza worldwide and recommendations for the prevention and control of avian influenza should it emerge in humans in the United States.

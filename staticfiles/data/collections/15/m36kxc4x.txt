BACKGROUND: Following delivery, extremely premature infants are vulnerable to rapid development of hypothermia and hypoglycemia. To reduce local rates of these morbidities, a multidisciplinary team developed a protocol standardizing evidence-based care practices during the first hour after birth. METHODS: Using quality improvement methodology, the Golden Hour protocol was implemented for all inborn infants <27 weeks’ gestation. Data were collected (2012–2017) over three phases; pre-protocol (n = 80), Phase I (n = 42), and Phase II (n = 92). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in infant characteristics. Improvements in hypothermia (59% vs 26% vs 38%; p = 0.001), hypoglycemia (18% vs 7% vs 4%; p = 0.012), and minutes to completion of stabilization [median (Q1,Q3) 110 (89,138) vs 111 (94,135) vs 92 (74,129); p = 0.0035] were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an evidence-based, Golden Hour protocol is an effective intervention for reducing hypothermia and hypoglycemia in extremely premature infants.

OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that spatial accessibility to primary care is a contributing factor to appropriate health care utilization, with limited primary care access resulting in avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department visits which are burdensome on individuals and our healthcare system. Limited research, however, has examined the effects on children. METHODS: We evaluated associations of spatial accessibility to primary care on health care utilization among a sample of 16,709 children aged 0-3 years in Philadelphia who were primarily non-White and publicly insured. Log-Poisson models with generalized estimating equations were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) while accounting for three levels of clustering (within individual, within primary care practice, within neighborhood). RESULTS: In age-adjusted models, the lowest level of spatial accessibility was associated with 7% fewer primary care visits (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91, 0.95), 15% more emergency department (ED) visits (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09, 1.22), and 18% more avoidable hospitalizations (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01, 1.37). After adjustment for individual- (race/ethnicity, sex, number of chronic conditions, insurance status) and neighborhood-level (racial composition and proportion of housing units with no vehicle), spatial accessibility was not significantly associated with rate of health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level predisposing factors, such as age, race, and need, attenuate the association between accessibility to primary care and use of primary care, emergency department visits, and avoidable hospitalization. Given the possibility of modifying access to primary care unlike immutable individual factors, a focus on spatial accessibility to primary care may promote appropriate health care utilization.

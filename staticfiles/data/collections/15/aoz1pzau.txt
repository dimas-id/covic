BACKGROUND: Feline skin fragility syndrome (FSFS) is an acquired disorder characterized by altered collagen production resulting in an extremely thin and fragile skin. FSFS is associated with diseases characterized by excessive steroidal hormones that can inhibit collagen synthesis. It is also described concomitantly with severe inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic conditions where the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To describe three cases of FSFS in cats that become cachectic secondary to different causes without glucocorticoid involvement. To describe the histopathological features of connective tissue for both fragile skin and the skin after healing. RESULTS: All cats developed cachexia in less than two months (body condition score ranging from 1–1.5). Concomitant diseases were diagnosed in Case 1 (aspiration pneumonia due to mega‐oesophagus) and Case 2 (feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)). In Case 3, malnutrition was suspected as a primary cause. The main histological feature of fragile skin was an atrophic dermis with pale eosinophilic, thin and irregular collagen fibres with numerous red cores observed with Masson's stain. Elastic fibres were normal. Postrecovery histopathological findings at 11 (Case 1) and six months (Case 3) after diagnosis, indicated normalization of the collagen and of the whole skin as compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report describing a reversible, nonsteroid‐induced FSFS, associated with rapidly developing cachexia in cats.

Abstract Enteric disorders predispose poultry to malnutrition. The objectives of this paper were 1) to simulate the inanition of poult enteritis mortality syndrome by restricting feed intake and 2) to develop a drinking water supplement that supports the immune functions of poults with inanition. Poults were restricted to 14 g of feed/d for 7 d beginning at 14 d of age then fed ad libitum until 36 d (recovery). The control was fed ad libitum. During the feed-restriction period, duplicate groups of 6 poults received 1 of 5 drinking water treatments: 1) restricted feed, unsupplemented water; 2) restricted feed + electrolytes (RE); 3) RE + glucose + citric acid (REGC); 4) REGC + betaine (REGCB); or 5) REGCB + zinc-methionine (REGCBZ). Immunological functions were assessed by inoculating poults with SRBC and B. abortus (BA) antigen at 15, 22, and 29 d of age. Antibody (Ab) titers were determined 7 d later for primary, secondary, and recovery responses. The primary and secondary total Ab titers to SRBC for restricted feed were 4.71 and 6.16 log3, which where lower (P < 0.05) than for controls (8.00 and 9.66 log3) and the other treatments. The recovery Ab titer for controls was 10.7, significantly higher than restricted feed (8.71) and RE (8.10) groups but not different from other treatments. The primary total Ab responses to BA were significantly lower in the restricted feed and RE groups as compared with the control and other treatments. Although feed restriction of poults to maintenance reduces the humoral immune responses, these responses can be significantly improved by drinking water containing electrolytes and especially sources of energy such as glucose and citric acid.

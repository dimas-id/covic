The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China rapidly became a pandemic across the world, including the US. Since March 2020, we started to received peripheral blood smear review consults for the patients who were admitted with COVID-19. We reviewed 15 peripheral blood smears from 15 most recently admitted patients (Table 1). These patients range from 26 to 90 years of age and include 8 males and 7 females. The reasons for peripheral blood smear consult were primarily concerns for hemolysis (9 out of 15 cases), followed by anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.

PeopleTraffic is a proposed initiative to develop a real-time, open-data population density mapping tool open to public institutions, private companies and the civil society, providing a common framework for infection spreading prevention. The system is based on a real-time people' locations gathering and mapping system from available 2G, 3G and 4G mobile networks operators, enforcing privacy-by-design through the adoption of an innovative data anonymizing algorithm inspired by quantum information de-localizing processes. Besides being originally targeted to help balancing social distancing regulations during the Phase-2 of the COVID-19 pandemics, PeopleTraffic would be beneficial for any infection spreading prevention event, e.g. supporting policy-makers in strategic decision-making.

This paper introduces the third DIHARD challenge, the third in a series of speaker diarization challenges intended to improve the robustness of diarization systems to variation in recording equipment, noise conditions, and conversational domain. The challenge comprises two tracks evaluating diarization performance when starting from a reference speech segmentation (track 1) and diarization from raw audio scratch (track 2). We describe the task, metrics, datasets, and evaluation protocol.

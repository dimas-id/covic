The transmission behaviour of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still being defined. It is likely that it is transmitted predominantly by droplets and direct contact and it is possible that there is at least opportunistic airborne transmission. In order to protect healthcare staff adequately is necessary that we establish whether aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Where we do not have evidence relating to SARS-CoV-2, guidelines for safely conducting these procedures should consider what risk procedures would have of transmitting related pathogens. Currently there is very little evidence detailing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with any specific procedures. Regarding aerosol generating procedures and respiratory pathogens in general, there is still a large knowledge gap that will leave clinicians unsure what risk they are putting themselves in when offering these procedures. This review aimed to summarise the evidence (and gaps in evidence) around AGPs and SARS-CoV-2.

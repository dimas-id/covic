BACKGROUND: For people returning from the tropics, malaria is the most common cause of fever. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most common and most dangerous form of malaria, called malignant tertian malaria or falciparum malaria. METHOD: Search and evaluation of the current literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Over 90 % of all malaria cases and malaria deaths occur in Africa, while the remaining cases are divided between India, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. In Germany, between 513 and 613 cases of malaria have been reportet annually over the last 10 years according to the Robert Koch Institute, including 389–541 cases of potentially fatal falciparum malaria (Plasmodium falciparum). All fever patients who have been in to the tropics during the last 4 months must be tested for malaria. However, immigrants from tropical regions might develop malaria even years after their last trip to their former home country. Rapid diagnostic tests are now available—particularly for falciparum malaria. However, the occasional negative or false-positive results are possible. The treatment of malaria depends on the Plasmodium species, the clinical severity, and the region in which the infection was acquired.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with a high asymptomatic incidence. Asymptomatic infections within a population will inevitably lead to diagnosis via unrelated medical imaging. We report the case of an asymptomatic patient undergoing a spine CT examination for trauma who was incidentally found to have lung abnormalities later confirmed to be COVID-19. We aim to familiarize neuroradiologists with the spectrum of COVID-19 pulmonary manifestations that are likely to be observed on neck and spine CT imaging.

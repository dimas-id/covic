Seeds from 37 species of Nama (Hydrophyllaceae) were examined by scanning electron microscopy in order to assess systematic implications of seed coat structure. Generally, seed coat morphology is species specific. Nevertheless, similarities among species in seed coat organization, particularly, outer testa anatomy and wall thickening‐pitting patterns allow the recognition of six groups among examined taxa; furthermore, seed coat features often suggest both intra‐group and inter‐group relationships. Recognized groupings do not correspond well with the more classicial treatments of Nama; rather, they suggest that a restructuring of the infrageneric and even the generic taxonomy of Nama is in order.

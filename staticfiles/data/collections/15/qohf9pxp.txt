Expression and purification of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein from a prokaryotic expression system as histidine-tagged fusion protein are presented in this chapter. Expression of histidine-tagged fusion N protein with a molecular mass of 57 kDa is induced with isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The expressed N protein inclusion body is extracted and purified by chromatography on nickel-agarose column to near homogeneity. The protein recovery can be 10 mg from 100 ml of bacterial culture. The purified N protein is a superior source of TCoV antigen for antibody-capture ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV.

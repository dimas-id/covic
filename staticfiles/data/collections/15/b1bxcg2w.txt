Total hip and knee arthroplasties are commonly performed orthopedic procedures that involve a complex interaction between the prosthetic device and its surrounding biological environment. Recent developments in the field of proteomics have enabled a better understanding of these interactions in patients with a total joint arthroplasty and have the potential to lead to development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities that may improve the care of these patients, particularly those who have developed complications of wear, osteolysis, loosening and periprosthetic joint infection. This article reviews several of the areas of active research that are occurring at the intersection of the fields of proteomics and total joint arthroplasty.

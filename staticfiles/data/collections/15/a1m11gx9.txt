Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a serious public health threat to the whole world, and the number of infected is still rising dramatically at this moment. Several studies have confirmed that cytokine storms play a critical role in causing a case to worsen from mild to severe or critical. The current treatment for cytokine storms is limited, so the international medical community is focusing on a specific and effective remedy. Jaktinib hydrochloride is a broad spectrum JAK inhibitor. It can inhibit cytokine-induced immune activation by multiple mechanisms and also slow viral proliferation by inhibiting AAK1 without causing unacceptable toxicity. Jaktinib hydrochloride has great potential for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

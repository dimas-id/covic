The DA rat is highly susceptible to induction of arthritis after immunization with homologous type II collagen (CII) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA), resulting in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The DA rat also develops arthritis after injection of FIA alone (oil-induced arthritis (OIA)). This finding allows a direct comparison of two different models for rheumatoid arthritis; one induced with a defined auto-immunogen and one with a pure adjuvant. Both CIA and OIA develop approximately 2 weeks after induction but OIA is a self-limited acute disease whereas CIA induced with homologous CII follows a chronic disease course. Immunization with CII leads to a strong autoantibody response to CII while injection of FIA leads to no or very limited anti-CII antibody response. The Lewis rat develops neither CIA nor OIA while F1 (DA x Lewis) rats develop CIA but not OIA. Olive oil or CII emulsified in olive oil does not induce arthritis in DA rats. Pretreatment with CII in olive oil vaccinates against CIA but not OIA whereas pretreatment with FIA vaccinates against OIA but not CIA. These findings demonstrate that inclusion of CII in the adjuvant leads to a disease distinct from OIA which is characterized by a CII autoimmune response and chronicity of the disease course.

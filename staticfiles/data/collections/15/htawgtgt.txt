OBJECTIVES The number of young surgeons in Japan has significantly decreased in recent years, which may lead to future problems in the medical field. Therefore, comprehensive training programs for young surgeons are needed. DESIGN Retrospective study SETTING We developed a specific education program called the "Recruitment of Young Medical Apprentices" (RYOMA) project. PARTICIPANTS We performed this project between January 2008 and August 2013 on fourth- to sixth-year medical students and internship doctors. The RYOMA project included step-by-step surgical education programs on open and scopic procedures as dry, wet, and animal laboratory training. Our goal was to increase the number of young and specialist surgeons. RESULTS Based on an interview questionnaire answered by 90 medical students, most young students were interested in surgical training and several chose to become surgeons in the future. The most positive opinions regarding the field of surgery were the impressive results achieved with surgery, whereas negative opinions included the difficulty of the surgical skill, physical concerns related to difficult work environments, and the severity of surgical procedures. The present program has begun to resolve negative opinions through adequate training or simulations. Of the 19 medical students and internship doctors who attended the RYOMA project in 2008, 17 trainees (90%) were satisfied with this special surgical program and 16 (88%) showed interest in becoming surgeons. The number of participants considering the field of surgery increased between 2008 and 2013. Of 23 participants, 19 (83%) had a positive opinion of the program after the training. CONCLUSIONS Gaining experience in surgical training from an early stage in medical school and step-by-step authorized education by teaching staff are important for recruiting students and increasing the number of young surgeons.

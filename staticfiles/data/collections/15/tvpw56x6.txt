Viruses are obligate parasites known to interact with a wide variety of host proteins at different stages of infection. Current antiviral treatments target viral proteins and may be compromised due to the emergence of drug resistant viral strains. Targeting viral‐host interactions is now gaining recognition as an alternative approach against viral infections. Recent research has revealed that heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1, an RNA‐binding protein, plays an essential functional and regulatory role in the life cycle of many viruses. In this review, we summarize the interactions between heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) and multiple viral proteins during the life cycle of RNA and DNA viruses. hnRNPA1 protein levels are modulated differently, in different viruses, which further dictates its stability, function, and intracellular localization. Multiple reports have emphasized that in Sindbis virus, enteroviruses, porcine endemic diarrhea virus, and rhinovirus infection, hnRNPA1 enhances viral replication and survival. However, in others like hepatitis C virus and human T‐cell lymphotropic virus, it exerts a protective response. The involvement of hnRNPA1 in viral infections highlights its importance as a central regulator of host and viral gene expression. Understanding the nature of these interactions will increase our understanding of specific viral infections and pathogenesis and eventually aid in the development of novel and robust antiviral intervention strategies.

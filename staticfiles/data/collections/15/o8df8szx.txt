Abstract Objective To describe the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Results The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74] vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared. Conclusions Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality. Inflammatory factor cascade and coagulation abnormality may be the potential mechanisms of COVID-19 combined with cardiac injury.

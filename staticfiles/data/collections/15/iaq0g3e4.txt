Influenza continues to be a significant public health challenge. Two glycoproteins on the surface of influenza virus, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, play a prominent role in the process of influenza virus infection and release. Monoclonal antibodies targeting glycoproteins can effectively prevent the spread of the virus. In this review, we summarized currently reported human mAbs targeting glycoproteins of influenza A and B viruses.

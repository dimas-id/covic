By combining laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) techniques with the da Vinci robotic platform, single-incision robotic colectomy (SIRC) aims to further minimize incision-related complications and improve cosmetic outcomes from the current standard of care, laparoscopic colectomy. While there is limited literature on SIRC, all available reports suggest SIRC to be a safe and feasible procedure in terms of perioperative outcomes. Future research should focus on further clarification of proposed benefits of SIRC such as cosmetics, ergonomics, incidence of incision-related complications, and long-term oncologic outcomes.

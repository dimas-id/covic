We show that strong quantum entanglement can support a stable traversable wormhole without any explicit interaction or tunnelling term between the two boundary theories of the wormhole. Specifically we work with two complex SYK models. The entangled state is prepared using a tunnelling term in imaginary time but the tunnelling term is removed from the time evolution operator so the two complex SYK models are not coupled. Low temperature states show revival dynamics which is the hallmark of a traversable wormhole geometry. To send any meaningful information from one system to the other, one only needs to turn on a very small interaction term. The technique that we are employing can be applied to other systems to study aspects of quantum entanglement.

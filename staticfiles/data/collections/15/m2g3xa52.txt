By analysing rumour content as covered by major Chinese newspapers, this article explores the multiple dimensions of SARS‐related rumouring throughout China during the 2003 epidemic. Findings indicate a strong correlation between the scale of SARS infections and level of rumour activities across regions. As for channels of dissemination, the rumour process still found a natural habitat in word of mouth, while internet‐based platforms and cell phone text messaging emerged as viable grapevines. Our particular typology of SARS‐incurred rumours leads us to identify four distinct types of rumours: legendary rumours; aetiological narratives; proto‐memorates; and bogies. The four types of rumours are discussed against the background of superstitious beliefs, folklore practices, popular mentalities, and China’s particular socio‐political information environment.

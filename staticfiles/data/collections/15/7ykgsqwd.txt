Between February and March 2020, the Journal of Thrombosis and Hemosthasis has published four papers addressing the intricate, complex and still little understood relation between COVID‐19 and thrombogenesis (1‐4). ARS‐Cov‐2 induces in severe cases a cytokine storm that ultimately leads to the activation of the coagulation cascade, causing thrombotic phenomena (5). There is a further strong link between abnormal coagulation parameters (D‐dimer and fibrin degradation products) and mortality. Tang et al. described that 71.4% of nonsurvivors and 0.6% of survivors showed evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), suggesting that DIC is a frequent occurrence in severe COVID‐19 (4). The frequency of DIC in these patients is much higher than that reported for severe SARS (6).

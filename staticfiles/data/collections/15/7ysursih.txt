Background Development of incisional complications following ventral median celiotomy might depend on suture pattern for skin closure. Methods In this prospective study, 21 healthy male horses underwent celiotomy. Skin closure was either performed via a continuous percutaneous pattern (CO group; 5 warmbloods/5 ponies) or an intradermal pattern (ID group; 5 warmbloods/6 ponies). Follow-up examination of the incisional site included daily monitoring for edema, dehiscence, and drainage. Transcutaneous ultrasound was performed at Days 3, 6, and 10 as well as on Week 8 and 12 to evaluate size of edema and presence or absence of sinus formation, and hernia formation. Prevalence of incisional infection on base of positive microbiological analysis at any time up to Day 10 was evaluated and compared between ID and CO group. Furthermore, edema size was analysed by a linear mixed-effect model for group and time dependency. Results Observed incisional complications included edema (9/10 in CO, 10/11 in ID), suture sinus formation (2/10 in CO, 1/11 in ID), surgical site infection (2/10 in CO, 0/11 in ID), and incisional hernia (1/10 in CO, 0/11 in ID). The overall prevalence of incisional infection was 9.5% without significant differences between both groups (20% in CO, 0% in ID; p = 0.214). Edema size was not dependent on time or group (p = 0.545 and p = 0.627, respectively). Discussion CO and ID suture pattern are appropriate for skin closure following ventral median celiotomy in horses. None of the animals in the continuous ID group developed surgical site infections, even without the use of antibiotics.

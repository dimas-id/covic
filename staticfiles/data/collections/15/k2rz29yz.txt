The spike gene of the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), strain FECV-1683, was PCR amplified from total RNA extracted from FECV-infected cells and its sequence determined. A primary translation product of 1454 amino acids is predicted from the nucleotide sequence, containing a N-terminal signal sequence, a C-terminal transmembrane region and 33 potential N-glycosylation sites. The sequence shares 92% homology with the previously published feline infectious peritonitis virus, strain WSU-1146; however, several regions were identified that distinguished FECV from Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus, FIPV. The full length FECV S gene was cloned and expressed in vaccinia virus. Recombinants produced a 200 kD protein which was recognized by sera from cats infected with FIPV. When kittens were immunized with the vaccinia/FECV S recombinant, neutralizing antibodies to FIPV were induced. After challenge with a lethal dose of FIPV, the recombinant vaccinated animals died earlier than control animals immunized with vaccinia virus alone.

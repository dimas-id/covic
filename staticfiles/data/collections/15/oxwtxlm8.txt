NIAD supports a broad spectrum of both basic and applied research in virology to expand the understanding of the biology, pathogenesis, and the immunology of viral diseases, leading to their prevention, control, and treatment, including research on (i) the viral replication cycle; (ii) the structure and function of the viral components; (iii) host virus interactions, including pathogenesis, immune evasion, and immune enhancement; (iv) viral genetics and evolution; (v) viral interference and defective interfering particles; (vi) virus vector relationships; (vii) epidemiology and natural history; and (viii) preclinical and clinical research to develop vaccines, adjuvants, therapeutics, immunomodulators, and diagnostics (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/viral/introduction.)

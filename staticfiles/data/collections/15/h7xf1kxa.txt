As we are facing worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, we aimed to identify potential pathophysiological mechanisms leading to increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in obesity. Special emphasis will be given on increased susceptibility to infections due to obesity-related low-grade chronic inflammation, higher expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and pathway-associated components, as well as decreased vitamin D bioavailability, since all of them provide easier ways for the virus to enter into host cells, replicate and stunt adequate immune responses.

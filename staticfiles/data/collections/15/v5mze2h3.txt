Among 146 nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab pairs collected &#8804;7 days since illness onset, CDC real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 assay diagnostic results were 95.2% concordant. However, NP swab Ct values were lower (indicating more virus) in 66.7% of concordant-positive pairs, suggesting NP swabs may more accurately detect amount of SARS-CoV-2.

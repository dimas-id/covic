PURPOSE The study objective was to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in conjunctival swabs from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS Forty patients who tested positive by real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were enrolled. Conjunctival swabbing was used to collect the tear and conjunctival secretions of patients. RESULTS Conjunctival swab rRT-PCR was positive for three patients and negative for 37 patients. Ten of the patients (25%) were diagnosed with conjunctivitis during the ophthalmic examination. Of these patients, one was found positive by conjunctival swab rRT-PCR, and nine were found negative. The difference between patients who tested positive or negative using conjunctival swab rRT-PCR was without statistical significance in terms of the presence of conjunctivitis (p = .720). CONCLUSION The rate of positivity from conjunctival swab rRT-PCR was 7.5% in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

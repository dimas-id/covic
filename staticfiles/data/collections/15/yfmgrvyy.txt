Automata networks are a very general model of interacting entities, with applications to biological phenomena such as gene regulation. In many contexts, the order in which entities update their state is unknown, and the dynamics may be very sensitive to changes in this schedule of updates. Since the works of Aracena et al., it is known that update digraphs are pertinent objects to study non-equivalent block-sequential update schedules. We prove that counting the number of equivalence classes, that is a tight upper bound on the synchronism sensitivity of a given network, is [Formula: see text]-complete. The problem is nevertheless computable in quasi-quadratic time for oriented cacti, and for oriented series-parallel graphs thanks to a decomposition method.

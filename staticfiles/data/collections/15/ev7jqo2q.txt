Anemia is common in pediatric intensive care units (PICU). Severe anemia can significantly increase the risk of death. Only a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion can rapidly treat a severe anemia. In stable PICU patients, RBC transfusion is probably not required if the hemoglobin concentration is above 7 g/dL, unless the patient has a cyanotic cardiac condition. The trigger or goal that should be used to direct RBC transfusion therapy in unstable critically ill children remains undetermined, although some data suggest that RBC transfusion may help in the early treatment of unstable patients with sepsis if their ScvO(2) is below 70 % after mechanical ventilation, fluid challenge, and inotropes/vasopressors perfusions have been initiated. Plasma and platelets are used to prevent or to treat hemorrhage attributable to a coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. The risks and benefits of plasma and platelet concentrates in PICU patients are discussed. There is almost no evidence at the present time that might permit a strong recommendation with regard to the use of plasma and platelets in PICU. Good knowledge of transfusion reactions is required in order to appropriately estimate the cost/benefit ratio of transfusion. Nowadays, non-infectious serious hazards of transfusion (NISHOT) are more frequent and more challenging for pediatric intensivists than transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases. The decision to prescribe a transfusion must be tailored to individual needs and repeated clinical evaluation of each critically ill child.

mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase and participates in cell proliferation, cellular metabolism was found to be activated during Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection and replication. During viral replication mTOR, downstream target genes such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta 1 (S6K1) and Eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E-binding protein1 (4-E-BP1) are activated result in ribosome biosynthesis and efficient protein synthesis. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), mTOR plays a key role in the association of adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF-7) leading to the transcriptional activation of type-I interferon (IFN) genes. Viruses also inactivate the interferon α (IFN-α) pathway by impairing the IRF-7 mediated activation of IFN-α gene transcription. Thus, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can help in suppressing the early stages of viral infection and replication. Interestingly, the key tumor-suppressor p53 protein will undergo degradation by virus-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) leading to an increased viral survival in host cells. Thus, the mTOR inhibitors and p53 activators or microRNAs that functions as p53 and can target 3′-UTR of mTOR and RPS6KB1 might effectively inhibit viral replication in the human respiratory tract and lung cells.

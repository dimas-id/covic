PURPOSE OF REVIEW To assess the current status of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer. RECENT FINDINGS Robot-assisted radical cystectomy is steadily growing with a feasible learning curve in those experienced in robotic prostatectomy. Pelvic lymphadenectomy appears to provide adequate nodal yield in several studies. Urinary diversions are most commonly performed extracorporeally, but several centers are attempting intracorporeal techniques. Short-term perioperative outcomes appear acceptable, but oncologic efficacy remains unknown. SUMMARY Robot-assisted radical cystectomy with urinary diversion appears to be growing steadily in academic institutions. Long-term data regarding oncologic efficacy remain lacking but perioperative outcomes appear favorable.

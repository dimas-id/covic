PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to highlight the past impact and current role of the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for echocardiography in value-based healthcare, and to address future implications in light of the recent mandate from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to incorporate AUC for other imaging modalities. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have proven that the AUC effectively stratify the clinical practice of echocardiography as they predict important echo abnormalities and impact optimal patient care. Recent investigations have tested new technologies and demonstrated the feasibility and scalability of the application of the AUC for echocardiography at the point of care. SUMMARY: The AUC for echocardiography has accomplished their core mission, as utilization has moderated over the last decade and mandatory implementation at the point of care for echocardiography remains rare. While a new mandate signals another wave of focus on appropriate utilization, echocardiography stands ready.

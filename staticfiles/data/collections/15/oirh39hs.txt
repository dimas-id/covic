In this case report, a 50-year-old man who had no medical history, presented with multiple cardiac arrests following a week with progressing symptoms of pneumonia. After achieving return of spontaneous circulation he presented with respiratory failure with severe hypoxia, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. A chest X-ray showed signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite aggressive intensive care management, the patient died 7.5 hours after admission. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was later confirmed, and the presumed cause of death was SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. In conclusion: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to a fatal outcome in younger healthy residents, who are not treated timely in case of severe symptoms like dyspnoea.

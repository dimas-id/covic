COVID-19 is spreading almost all over the world at present, which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It was an epidemic firstly in Hubei province of China. The Chinese government has formally set COVID-19 in the statutory notification and control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. China currently is still struggling to respond to COVID-19 though intensive actions with progress made. The Burn Department of our hospital is one of sections with the highest infectious risk of COVID-19. Based on our own experience and the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (7th Version) with other regulations and literature, we describe our experience with suggestions for medical practices for burn units during the COVID-19 outbreak. We hope these experiences and suggestions benefit our international colleagues during the pandemic of the COVID-19.

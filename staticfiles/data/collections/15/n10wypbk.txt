The rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are the most common causative agents of the acute upper respiratory tract infection in humans. They include several species that vary in the pathogenicity, some causing severe respiratory tract diseases. In this work, the species prevalence of rhinoviruses and coronaviruses was studied in 92 virus-positive clinical patients that were collected at the area of the Moscow region during the period from 2007 to 2012. Using the real-time PCR the virus circulation has been established for all species common in humans, including three rhinoviruses, HRV A, HRV B, and HRV C, and four coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. For eight patients, the identity of the rhinoviruses, including 4 cases of HRV-C, 3 cases of HRV-A, and a single case of HRV-B, was corroborated using partial sequencing of the 5 non-coding regions and phylogenetic analysis. The viruses of HRV-C, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 were prevalent in children with severe respiratory diseases.

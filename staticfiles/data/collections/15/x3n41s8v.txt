Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a nonenveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that has been detected in a wide variety of animals. In 2017, an avian-like HEV was identified in sparrow feces sampled from around a pig farm in the midwestern United States. Sequence analysis revealed that the sparrow isolate represents a novel HEV that is distantly related to chicken and little egret HEVs.

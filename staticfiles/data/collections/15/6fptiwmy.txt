The COVID‐19 pandemic has brought attention to the stark inequities in public education worldwide, with the United Nations sharing these statistics: Schools closed in 191 countries, affecting 1.5 billion students and 63 million primary and secondary school teachers. Half of students did not have access to a computer, and 40% did not have internet access. A total of 56 million children live in areas that are not served by mobile networks — for example, in sub‐Saharan Africa. In the United States, about 7 million school‐aged children are in homes without home internet service.

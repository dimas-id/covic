Alterations in natural landscapes, mainly caused by anthropic pressures, have been threatening the world's biomes, including aquatic environments and its biota. This study describes the diet of Bryconamericus iheringii, and how its body shape relates to environmental variables in populations of 22 streams. A wide array of food items were found, mainly composed of allochthonous plants (50.5%) and autochthonous invertebrates (25.2%). Even though food items remained almost the same, the predominant food group significantly differed among streams, mainly in relation to environmental characteristics. There was variation in body shape primarily associated with body depth and length of the pre-dorsal region; however, these differences did not correspond with streams. PLS-CA analyses indicated that environmental characteristics, such as substrate type, percentage of marginal vegetation have some influence over food items availability but not on body shape. This may be because B. iheringii is a non-specialist species capable of prey switching based on availability due to an intermediate body shape suited for generalist feeding habits.(AU)

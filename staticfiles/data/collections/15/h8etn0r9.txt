Vaccines should only be administered following a complete risk/benefit analysis by a veterinarian in conjunction with the owner. The designation of “core” or “noncore” vaccines are not absolute and will depend upon specific circumstances. Vaccines must be administered by the correct route, at the correct time, in the correct manner. Vaccination schedules must take maternal immunity into account, and revaccination must take duration of immunity data into account. Serologic tests should be employed to determine the need for revaccination. Vaccines must be stored and administered correctly. They may be administered by diverse routes, in addition to injection. Intranasal and oral vaccination, intraocular and aerosolization are all possible routes.

The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of diethyl 2-azidoethyl-, 3-azidopropyl-, 2-azido-1-hydroxyethyl-, 3-azido-2-hydroxypropylphosphonates with selected N-propargyl nucleobases gave a series of the phosphonylated 1,2,3-triazole acyclonucleosides in which the phosphonate residue and nucleobases were linked by three- and four-carbon chains. Under standard conditions (TMSBr, ethanol), all synthesized O,O-diethylphosphonates were transformed into the respective phosphonic acids. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for activity against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses. Unfortunately, no antiviral activity was observed at 100 Î¼M.

Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are among the most frequent adverse reactions in patients receiving drug therapy. They have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, are caused by various drugs, and result from different pathophysiological mechanisms. Hence, their diagnosis and management is challenging. Severe cutaneous ADRs comprise a group of diseases with major morbidity and mortality, reaching 30 % mortality rate in cases of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. This chapter covers the terminology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and classification of cutaneous ADR, describes the severe cutaneous ADRs and the clinical and laboratory approach to the patient with cutaneous ADR and presents the translation of laboratory-based discoveries on the genetic predisposition and pathogenesis of cutaneous ADRs to clinical management guidelines.

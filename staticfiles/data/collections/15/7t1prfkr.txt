BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Predictors for severe COVID-19 infection have not been well defined. Determination of risk factors for severe infection would enable identifying patients who may benefit from aggressive supportive care and early intervention. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: Of 197 hospitalized patients, the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 60.6 (16.2) years, 103 (52.3%) were male and 156 (82.1%) were black. Severe COVID-19 infection was noted in 74 (37.6%) patients, requiring intubation. Patients aged above 60 were significantly more likely to have severe infection. Patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease and had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to patients with non-severe infection. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for severe infection included pre-existing renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% CI 2.5-22.0), oxygen requirement at hospitalization (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.7), acute renal injury (OR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6) and initial CRP (OR,1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.01). Race, age and socioeconomic status were not identified as independent predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Acute or pre-existing renal disease, supplemental oxygen at the time of hospitalization and initial CRP were independent predictors for the development of severe COVID-19 infections. Every 1 unit increase in CRP increased the risk of severe disease by 0.06%.

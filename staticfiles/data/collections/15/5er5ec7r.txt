ARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a world-wide pandemic. The Spike protein plays central role in cell entry of the virus, and triggers significant immuno-response. Our understanding of the immune-response against S protein is still very limited. Herein, we constructed a peptide microarray and analyzed 55 convalescent sera, three areas with rich linear epitopes were identified. Potent neutralizing antibodies enriched from sera by 3 peptides, which do not belong to RBD were revealed.

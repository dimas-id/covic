Abstract Stringent, exacting and local oversight for the control and use of Select Agents and Toxins is crucial to ensuring biosecurity. However, review of research involving Select Agents and Toxins can present particular challenges to the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). Institutional review for biosecurity programs focuses on security assessments and access control, whereas most IBCs primarily focus on occupational exposure assessment, biohazard control, and biosafety practices. Determining how and where to interweave biosecurity program requirements into programs based on occupational health priorities is the key to integrated and effective compliance management. Recent new or pending regulations on dual use or gain of function research suggests or mandates additional duties for the IBC. This chapter explores challenges and strategies for institutional oversight and support of Select Agent program compliance.

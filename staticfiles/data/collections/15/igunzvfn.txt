BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection appears related to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that often results in mechanical ventilation (MV). We investigated the role of tocilizumab (TCZ) on interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) trends and MV in SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, 112 patients were evaluated from 2/1/2020 ‐ 5/31/2020. TCZ was administered followed by methylprednisolone to patients with > 3L oxygen (O2) requirement and pneumonia severity index (PSI) score ≤ 130 with CT scan changes. IL‐6, C‐reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D‐dimer, and procalcitonin were monitored on days 0, 3, and 6 of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed with significance ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: 80/112 SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients (45 males, 56.96%; 34 females, 43.04%) were included in this study. Seven patients expired (8.75%) and nine patients required MV (11.25%). Median IL‐6 levels pre‐administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25 ‐ 666.25) pg/mL compared to post‐administration on day 3 (563; 162 ‐ 783) pg/mL (P < 0.00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50 ‐ 678.50) pg/mL compared to day 3 (P = 0.709). CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D‐dimer levels were reduced following TCZ therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D‐dimer levels. The sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. IL‐6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool.

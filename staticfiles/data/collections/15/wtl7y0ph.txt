N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (NBCA) is a liquid embolic material that is widely used in various endovascular procedures because of its permanent and rapid vascular occluding effect regardless of the coagulation profile of the patient. However, NBCA migration to unintended vessels may result in serious complications. This report describes the retrieval of a migrated NBCA cast from the transverse-sigmoid sinus during dural arteriovenous fistula embolization using a transvenous snaring technique.

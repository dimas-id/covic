We reported a 33-year-old female case with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by Acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She had a gestational age of 34 weeks. The patient referred to treatment clinic for COVID-19 in Imam Reza hospital of Tabriz (Iran) after having flu-like symptoms. In radiologic assessment, ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation was found in upper right lobe. Lopinavir/ritonavir (200mg/50mg) two tablet tow times, Ribavirin 200mg every six hours, and Oseltamivir 75mg tow times were given for the treatment of COVID-19. The medications used for treatment of pneumonia were Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin. All doses of medications were administrated by adjusted dose assuming the patient is anephric. Also, a few supplements were also given after ATN development including daily Rocaltrol and Nephrovit (as a multivitamin appropriate for patients with renal failure), Folic acid and Calcium carbonate. The patient is still under ventilator with a Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of eight. SpO2 is 94% but the patient's ATN problem has been resolved. We started weaning from mechanical ventilator. The patient is conscious with full awareness to time, person and place. The maternal well-being is achieved and her neonate was discharged.

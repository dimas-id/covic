Fast and widespread diagnosis is crucial to fight against the outbreak of COVID-19. The present work surveys the landscape of available and emerging biosensor technologies for COVID-19 testing. Molecular diagnostic assays based on quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction are used in most clinical laboratories. The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed the testing capacity and motivated the development of fast point-of-care tests and the adoption of isothermal DNA amplification. Antigenic and serological rapid tests based on lateral flow immunoassays suffer from low sensitivity. Advanced digital systems enhance the performance at the expense of speed and large equipment requirement. Emerging technologies, including CRISPR gene-editing tools, benefit from high sensitivity and selectivity of molecular diagnostics and the easy use of lateral flow assays. DNA sequencing and sample pooling strategies are highlighted to bring out the full capacity of the available biosensor technologies and accelerate mass testing.

Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious enteric disease of swine, which became infrequent with the appearance of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). TGE was last reported in Hungary in 2013 and the virus has not been found since, therefore a serological survey was planned to estimate the level of protection against it. 908 sera of sows from 93 farms were selected together with 174 archive samples from one farm covering a wider age group. All samples were screened with an indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test with a positive result of 15.42% and 17.82%, respectively. All IF-positive samples were examined with a commercial ELISA, revealing seropositivity against PRCV in almost all cases. These findings should serve as a recommendation to not omit TGE from the diagnostics of diarrhoea in swine.

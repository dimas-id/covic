The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an international health emergency. Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, the gold standard test that involves the amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.

Abstract The unique glycoprotein of influenza C virus, designated hemagglutinin (HEF), exhibits three functions: hemagglutination, esterase activity, and fusion factor. As the virus uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as a high-affinity receptor determinant for attachment to cells, its binding activity was used to reveal O-acetylated sialic acid residues after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose sheets of proteins and thin-layer chromatography of lipids. The specificity of the binding for O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates was investigated. Our results showed that influenza C virus could detect the different forms of the two murine glycophorins which are known to be O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates. The virus also bound to O-acetylated gangliosides isolated from embryonic chicken brain such as purified O-acetylated NeuAcα(2–8)NeuAcα(2–8)NeuAcα(2–3)Galβ(1–4)Glcβ(1-1)ceramide (GT3). The esterase activity of the HEF protein of influenza C virus was used to unmask the sialic acid. After its deacetylation by the virus enzyme, the O-acetylated GT3 was recognized by a monoclonal antibody which binds only to the nonacetylated derivative. The results presented here show that influenza C virus is a discriminating analytical probe for identifying O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates directly after Western blotting of proteins and thin-layer chromatography of lipids, thus providing a new analytical tool.

Scientific discovery and dissemination has radically transformed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. For COVID‐19 research, this includes rapid research funding opportunities with streamlined application processes, self‐funded research, fast‐tracked clinical trials and research studies being completed in a fraction of the normal time. Unfortunately the downside has been complete closure of research laboratories and stoppage of clinical trials not related to COVID‐19. Hematologists and scientists in the thrombosis, hemostasis and vascular biology fields are front and center in this science owing to the sinister coagulopathy associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection [1].

In recent years, several paramyxoviruses have emerged to infect humans, including previously unidentified zoonoses. Hendra and Nipah viruses (henipaviruses within this family) were first identified in the 1990s in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, causing epidemics with high mortality and morbidity rates in affected animals and humans. Other paramyxoviruses, such as Menangle virus, Tioman virus, human metapneumovirus and avian paramyxovirus 1, which cause less morbidity in humans, have also been recently identified. Although the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses has been previously recognised as biomedically and veterinarily important, the recent emergence of these paramyxoviruses has focused our attention on this family. Antiviral drugs can be designed to target specific important determinants of the viral life cycle. Therefore, identifying and understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of viral entry, replication, assembly and budding will be critical in the development of antiviral therapeutic agents. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms discovered and the antiviral strategies pursued in recent years for emerging paramyxoviruses, with particular emphasis on viral entry and exit mechanisms.

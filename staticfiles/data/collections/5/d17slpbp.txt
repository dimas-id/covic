BACKGROUND The application of factor analysis in the study of the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was investigated, to provide a reference for basic research on COVID-19 and its prevention and control. METHODS The data of 60 patients with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Second People's Hospital of Longgang District in Shenzhen were extracted using principal component analysis. Factor analysis was used to investigate the factors related to symptoms of COVID-19. Based on the combination of factors, the clinical types of the factors were defined according to our professional knowledge. Factor loadings were calculated, and pairwise correlation analysis of symptoms was performed. RESULTS Factor analysis showed that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 cases could be divided into respiratory-digestive, neurological, cough-wheezing, upper respiratory, and digestive symptoms. Pairwise correlation analysis showed that there were a total of eight pairs of symptoms: fever-palpitation, coughexpectoration, expectoration-wheezing, dry mouth-bitter taste in the mouth, poor appetite-fatigue, fatiguedizziness, diarrhea-palpitation, and dizziness-headache. CONCLUSIONS The symptoms and syndromes of COVID-19 are complex. Respiratory symptoms dominate, and digestive symptoms are also present. Factor analysis is suitable for studying the characteristics of the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, providing a new idea for the comprehensive analysis of clinical symptoms.

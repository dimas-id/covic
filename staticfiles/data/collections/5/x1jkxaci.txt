Abstract The complex antiviral immune mechanisms involve both adaptive and innate reactions mediated by γδ T lymphocytes, whose unique immunosurveillance contributions are analyzed here in different clinical and experimental settings. It is beyond any doubt that the fast, potent, cytotoxic as well as non-cytolytic antiviral activities of γδ T cells are critical in protecting the host against diverse viral pathogens.

• We demonstrated the first patient with COVID-19 developing an isolated SCC lesion on brain MRI, suggestive of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS). • We showed that cerebellar ataxia could be developed as the initial manifestation of COVID-19. • MERS can be considered as a differential diagnosis for neurological symptoms of COVID-19, especially when patients develop transient cerebellar ataxia or disorientation.

Pancreatic surgery is challenging for both surgeon and patient. With the advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques, patient morbidity could be reduced. However, these techniques must conform to established principles of open pancreatic surgery with regards to meticulous dissection, haemostasis and oncologic results. The robotic platform is utilized in all facets of surgery, and is being increasingly applied in pancreatic surgery. As with the introduction of any new technology, this approach must undergo rigorous examination before widespread adoption of the technique. In this article, we review the techniques and outcomes of robotic-assisted pancreatic resections, focusing on robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy, robotic-assisted distal pancreatectomy and robotic-assisted central pancreatectomy. As the outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery have yet to be rigorously evaluated against the gold standard of open surgery, this Review also highlights major laparoscopic pancreatic series in an effort to summarize the available literature on minimally invasive pancreatic surgery.

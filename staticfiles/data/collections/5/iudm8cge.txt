Let $p\equiv -q \equiv 5\pmod 8$ be two prime integers. In this paper, we investigate the unit groups of the fields $ L_1 =\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2, \sqrt{p}, \sqrt{q}, \sqrt{-1} )$ and $ L_1^+=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2, \sqrt{p}, \sqrt{q} )$. Furthermore , we give the second $ 2$-class groups of the subextensions of $L_1$ as well the $2$-class groups of the fields $ L_n =\mathbb{Q}( \sqrt{p}, \sqrt{q}, \zeta_{2^{n+2}} )$ and their maximal real subfelds.

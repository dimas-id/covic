Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19)-affected patients with severe immune abnormalities have a risk of cytokine release syndrome. The definition, prevention, and treatment of symptoms of cytokine release syndrome in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are important problems. This was a single-center case series of 11 COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China from January 26, 2020 to February 18, 2020. The termination date of follow-up was February 19, 2020. In this single-center analysis of 11 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 8 patients were determined to have characteristics of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including pulmonary inflammation, fever, and dysfunction of non-pulmonary organs; an increase of- Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in peripheral blood was the highest risk factor and an early indicator of CRS in COVID-19.

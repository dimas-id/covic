Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are underrepresented during the current COVID-19 outbreak Unlike other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 rather infects adults who subsequently infect their children From recent Chinese and Italian data, children commonly present mild to moderate disease, a large proportion of them being asymptomatic In particular, children present significantly less fever, cough and pneumonia compared to adults However, more cases of pneumonia were reported from children infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those infected with H1N1 No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described so far

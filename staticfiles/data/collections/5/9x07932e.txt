A case of fatal Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in a previously healthy 18-year-old girl is reported. On hospital day 9, the antibody titer to M. pneumoniae was 1:512 in the complement fixation test and 1:5120 in the microparticle agglutination assay. After five weeks in the intensive care unit, the patient died from necrotizing hemorrhagic pneumonia with multi-organ failure. No significant superinfections occurred during ICU treatment. Corticosteroids (hospital day 8 onward) did not influence the course of the disease. It is noteworthy that, as in some previously reported cases, the clinical state deteriorated during presumably adequate antibiotic treatment (2 days before admission onward), and despite documented eradication of the pathogen from the respiratory tract (PCR from bronchoalveolar fluid on hospital day 22 was negative). However, the illness had lasted for several days before admission to the hospital, therefore the potentially beneficial effect of antibiotic treatment at an early stage of the disease cannot be assessed. Clearly, in default of other treatment options, correct diagnosis and early treatment of mycoplasma community-acquired pneumonia seems mandatory. This is the third case of fatal mycoplasma pneumonia reported from Austria in recent years, making this topic worthy of further scientific attention.

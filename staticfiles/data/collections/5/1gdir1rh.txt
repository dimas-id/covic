Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are malicious inputs crafted to fool pre-trained models. Adversarial examples often exhibit black-box attacking transferability, which allows that adversarial examples crafted for one model can fool another model. However, existing black-box attack methods require samples from the training data distribution to improve the transferability of adversarial examples across different models. Because of the data dependence, fooling ability of adversarial perturbations is only applicable when training data are accessible. In this paper, we present a data-free method for crafting adversarial perturbations that can fool a target model without any knowledge about the training data distribution. In the practical setting of black-box attack scenario where attackers do not have access to target models and training data, our method achieves high fooling rates on target models and outperforms other universal adversarial perturbation methods. Our method empirically shows that current deep learning models are still at a risk even when the attackers do not have access to training data.

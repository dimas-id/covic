This article describes the investigation of a neonatal calf diarrhoea outbreak in a dedicated tuberculosis isolation unit. Like many calf rearers purchasing young calves, this farmer did not have control over the first 7 days of their lives. Focus therefore was on treatment of sick animals, reducing the risk of spread of pathogens and diagnostic testing to aid management. Longer term an all‐in all‐out programme followed by disinfection, and a review of purchasing policy to help selection of source farms was established.

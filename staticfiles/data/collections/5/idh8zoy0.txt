Background Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has become the major surgical option for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Endoscopic instruments such as stapler cartridges are essential for VATS procedures. In this study, we investigated the factors that affect the number of stapler cartridges used in VATS lobectomy. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who underwent complete VATS lobectomy for NSCLC from January 2013 to December 2015. Results In total, 596 patients underwent complete VATS lobectomy. The average number of stapler cartridges used for VATS lobectomy was 5.3±1.9. The number of stapler cartridges used for VATS lobectomy was higher in men (5.5±1.9 vs. 5.0±18, p=0.006), those aged older than 70 years (5.5±2.1 vs. 5.1±1.7, p=0.038), those who underwent upper or middle lobectomy procedures (5.7±1.9 vs. 4.1±1.2, p<0.001), those with a higher fissure sum average (p<0.001), and those in whom surgery was performed by a surgeon with a preference for staplers (5.6±2.0 vs. 4.9±1.6, p<0.001). Conclusion The number of stapler cartridges required to perform VATS lobectomy in NSCLC patients appears to be influenced by sex, age, the location of the tumor, the degree of fissure development, and the surgeon's preference.

Controlling transboundary diseases requires an inclusive and collaborative international approach. Decisions should be taken (and seen to be taken) on advice from multidisciplinary teams of scientists and representatives from all groups significantly affected by the disease (the 'stakeholders'). Changes in trade and travel mean that, unless a new model is developed for disease prevention, there is a real possibility that transboundary animal diseases will become increasingly difficult to control. The traditional government approach of dealing almost exclusively with the commercial sector of the livestock industry is no longer sufficient, and new ways must be found to include all sectors, including 'grey' husbandry (fragmented, disparate groups whose involvement with animals may range from the legal and responsible to the unsanctioned and/or illegal). The increasing convergence of human and animal health issues makes it imperative to make the best possible use of new tools. The particular challenges confronting veterinary science are: preventing the introduction of disease, rapidly identifying disease and controlling epidemics. This paper focuses on the United Kingdom to investigate the inadequacies of current approaches, identify needs, offer recommendations and propose a new approach to disease control, which emphasises global considerations. The objectives are: better participation across the entire sector, better communication, better science and better decision-making, all of which should lead to better security from disease.

Cocoa production is the major contributor to livelihoods for farming families that constitute nearly two-thirds of the population of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, a Province in Papua New Guinea (PNG). These families, living mostly in subsistence poverty as a result of the Bougainville Civil War (1988â€“98), have significantly reduced cocoa production. Efforts to rebuild the industry have not been realised, due to known agricultural factors such as labour shortages, pests and diseases, poor support for farmers from trained agricultural extension officers and inefficient cocoa supply chains. But cocoa production involves factors other than agricultural ones. This article describes how we applied One Health methods to design and undertake a 6-year research project in Bougainville to improve cocoa productivity. Maximising the health and wellbeing of farming families and increasing agricultural productivity we argue, requires an in-depth understanding of the non-linear interactions between health, labour, household decision-making, yields and incomes.

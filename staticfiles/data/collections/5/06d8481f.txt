The novel corona virus disease has shaken the entire world with its deadly effects and rapid transmission rates, posing a significant challenge to the healthcare authorities to develop suitable therapeutic solution to save lives on earth. The review aims to grab the attention of the researchers all over the globe, towards the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease. ACE2 serves as a molecular target for the SARS-CoV-2, to enter the target cell, by interacting with the viral glycoprotein spikes. However, the complexity began when numerous studies identified the protective response of ACE2 in abbreviating the harmful effects of vasoconstrictor, anti-inflammatory peptide, angiotensin 2, by mediating its conversion to angiotensin-(1â€“7), which exercised antagonistic actions to angiotensin 2. Furthermore, certain investigations revealed greater resistance among children as compared to the geriatrics, towards COVID-19 infection, despite the elevated expression of ACE2 in pediatric population. Based upon such evidences, the review demonstrated possible therapeutic interventions, targeting both the protective and deleterious effects of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, primarily inhibiting ACE2-virus interactions or administering soluble ACE2. Thus, the authors aim to provide an opportunity for the researchers to consider RAAS system to be a significant element in development of suitable treatment regime for COVID-19 pandemic.

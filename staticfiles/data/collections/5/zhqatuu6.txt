INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS A presumed high failure rate of conventional procedures for prolapse has been part of the rationale for new surgical approaches. The aim of the present retrospective cohort study was to estimate the reoperation rate for prolapse within 10 years of primary surgery for prolapse. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent primary surgery for prolapse at four large regional centers in Austria in 1997 and 1998. Hospital databases were searched to determine whether patients had been reoperated for prolapse through 2008. RESULTS A total of 456 patients underwent a primary operation for prolapse in 1997 and 1998. The most common primary operation was vaginal hysterectomy with colporrhaphy (89 %). We identified 13 reoperations for prolapse, for a 10-year reoperation rate of (at least) 2.9 %. The median interval between primary and secondary surgery was 5.5 years (range 1.5-10 years). CONCLUSION The reoperation rate for prolapse after primary vaginal hysterectomy and colporrhaphy appears to be modest in this series of patients.

Abstract Autophagosomes are double-membrane sequestering vesicles that are the hallmark of the intracellular catabolic process called macroautophagy. They are formed by the orchestrated interplay of the AuTophaGy-related (ATG) proteins. The cargo molecules targeted by autophagosomes ranges from long-lived proteins and superfluous or excess organelles to invading pathogens. Autophagosomes finally fuse with lysosomes delivering the sequestered material in the interior of these organelles where it is degraded by resident hydrolases. Autophagy represents a key survival mechanism because it clears the cytoplasm from unwanted and potentially toxic structures, and the autophagosomes are the central stage of it.

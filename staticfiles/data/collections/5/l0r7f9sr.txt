Summary This study describes a loophole in the international quarantine system during the recent Asian severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Specifically, that of travelers disguising symptoms of respiratory tract infection at international airports, in order to board aircraft to return to their home countriesâ€”notwithstanding the infection risks this involves to others. High medical fees for treatment to non-residents in epidemic areas were found to be the main cause for this behaviour. This phenomenon revealed a loophole in the control mechanisms of international quarantine procedures, letting travelers carrying a highly contagious virus slip by undetected and causing possible multi-country outbreaks of communicable diseases. Clinical evidence collected from medical records at medical centers can highlight this oversight.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is the world’s second largest industry (by volume) that develops products and market drugs licensed for use as medications. Medicines manufactured in the modern era are associated with major controversies such as non–target specificity, resistance, repeated administration, immune rejection, and other adverse effects on the body. Thus, there is a great need to find drugs that do not raise the aforementioned issues. Nature is an excellent hub providing a diverse range of phytoconstituents that open the way to phototherapeutics, which need a scientific path to deliver the active elements in a supported way to increase patient compliance and reduce the need for repeated administration. To discover a novel phytochemical as a lead compound for a therapeutic purpose is a real challenge. In former times, drug discovery was a complex process, as it took several years to find a lead compound for use against a particular disease. Nowadays, however, virtual screening methods have been developed, which are target specific, time consuming, and cost effective. To avoid increased and repeated administration of a drug, nanosized drug delivery systems for herbal drugs have been developed to enhance the activity and overcome problems associated with synthetic medicines. This review summarizes three main fields: drug discovery, docking for drug design, and last—but not least—drug delivery systems. Nowadays, nanobased drug delivery systems are in demand for delivery of herbal medicines used for therapeutic purposes. Herbonanoceuticals—herbal drugs of a nanosize—have better remedial value and fewer detrimental effects than modern medicines. Therefore, herbonanoceuticals can be a boon in the field of therapeutics.

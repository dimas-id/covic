The WHO declared the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and "call(ed) on all countries to exchange country experiences and practices in a transparent and timely way" (http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/pages/news/news/2020/03/who-announces-covid-19-outbreak-a-pandemic). To date, many medical societies have announced their intention to collect and analyze data from COVID-19 patients and some large-scale prospective data collections are already running, such as the LEOSS registry (Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients) or the CAPACITYCOVID registry (registry of patients with COVID-19 including cardiovascular risk and complications). The necessity to mobilize and harmonize basic and applied research worldwide is of utmost importance (Sansonetti, 2020).

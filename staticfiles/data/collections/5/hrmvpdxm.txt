This paper lays out two teaching/learning methods that are becoming increasingly prevalent in computer science - hackathons, and Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions - and the pedagogic theory that underpins them. A case study of each is analysed, and the underpinning similarities extracted. The frameworks are then generalised to Learn-Apply-Reinforce/Share Learning - a social constructivistic method that can be used subject-independently. The applicability of this new method to distance learning is then investigated - with a mind to potential necessity to work from home - both due to increasing demand in the Higher Education sector, but also the devastating impact of crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, a few potential extensions and future applications are discussed - including the possibilities of pivoting the method to be more research-driven, or indeed, to drive research.

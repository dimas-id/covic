Infections of the ear, nose and throat are common and may threaten life. Intracranial complications may arise from infections of the ear and paranasal sinuses. Orbital complications (loss of vision) may arise from infection of the paranasal sinus. Respiratory embarrassment may result from infections of the upper aerodiogestive tract. The clinical presentation, implications and management of foreign bodies in the ear, nose and throat depend on the nature of the foreign body and the site at which it becomes lodged.

By using cell-type-specific markers and neural cultures derived from various areas of the nervous system, it has been possible to identify various interactions between OC43 virus and mouse oligodendrocytes, neurons, astrocytes, and fibroblasts. Neurons derived from dorsal root ganglia produced viral antigen and infectious virus. Astrocytes and fibroblasts both produced viral antigen but not infectious virus. Oligodendrocytes produced neither infectious virus nor viral antigen. Human embryo brain cells, including astrocytes, were susceptible to OC43 infection but did not produce infectious virus.

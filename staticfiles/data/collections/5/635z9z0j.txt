Image-guided tumor ablation for lung malignancies has emerged as a treatment modality for medically inoperable patients. Overall, image-guided lung tumor ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that has an acceptable safety profile and less impact on lung function. This is important for patients with poor pulmonary and/or cardiac functions or with multiple comorbidities, which prevent them from undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Herein, we review the principle, techniques, clinical application, and patient outcomes of image-guided lung tumor ablation.

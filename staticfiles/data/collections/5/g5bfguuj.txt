I read the article on the overall reduction of Solid Organ Transplantation (SOT) activity in Italy, with growing concerns as also the National Regulatory Bodies (NRB) of Spain and the UK report substantial reduction of activity in their bulletins; currently, in the UK only five Kidney TxC are still operational. Importantly, another study reported in the US restricted SOT, with more than 70% of US Transplant Centres (TxC) having suspended Living Donor Kidney Transplantation (LDKT).

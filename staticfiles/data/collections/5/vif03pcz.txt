In this chapter infectious diseases of the nervous system are discussed. These include bacterial, viral, fungal, spirochetal, and parasitic infections. Although the central nervous system (CNS) is protected from bacterial invasion by the intact blood-brain barrier, bacterial invasion is enhanced by the special surface properties of bacteria as well as host immune deficiencies. Similar to any type of infection of the nervous system, bacteria may involve any of the nervous system compartments: the epidural space (epidural abscess); the dura (pachymeningitis); the subdural space (subdural empyema); the leptomeninges and the subarachnoid space containing cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis or leptomeningitis); and the brain parenchyma (brain abscess). The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, pathology, etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.

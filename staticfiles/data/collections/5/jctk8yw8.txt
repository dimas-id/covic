The root of Strobilanthes cusia BREMEK. (Acanthaceae), popularly known as Da-Ching-Yeh, has been commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is used to treat influenza, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, encephalitis B, viral pneumonia, mumps, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this study, we found a new lignan glycoside (6) and two new phenylethanoid glycosides (7, 8) together with five known compounds as chemical constituents of Strobilanthes cusia root. Some samples were examined for anti-herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) activity. Among the tested samples, lupeol showed anti-HSV-1 activity (EC(50): 11.7 microM) and showed 100% inhibition of virus plaque formation at 58.7 microM.

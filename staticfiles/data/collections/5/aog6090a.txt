The lengthy 5' nontranslated region of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) forms a highly ordered secondary structure containing an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES), which plays an important role in controlling viral translation and pathogenesis. The stem-loop V (SL-V) of this IRES contains a large lateral bulge loop which encompasses two conserved GNRA motifs. In this study, we analyzed the effects of point mutations within the GNRA motifs of the CVB3 IRES. We characterized in vitro virus production and translation efficiency and we tested in vivo virulence of two CVB3 mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. The GNAA1 and GNAA2 RNAs displayed decreased translation initiation efficiency when translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. This translation defect was correlated with reduced yields of infectious virus particles in HeLa cells in comparison with the wild type. When inoculated orally into Swiss mice, both mutant viruses were avirulent and caused neither inflammation nor necrosis in hearts. These results highlight the important role of the GNRA motifs within the SL-V of the IRES of CVB3, in directing translation initiation.

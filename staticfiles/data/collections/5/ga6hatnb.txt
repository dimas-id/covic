Type 1 phototherapeutic agents based on diarylamines were assessed for free radical generation and evaluated in vitro for cell death efficacy in the U937 leukemia cancer cell line. All of the compounds were found to produce copious free radicals upon photoexcitation with UV-A and/or UV-B light, as determined by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Among the diarylamines, the most potent compounds were acridan (4) and 9-phenylacridan (5), with IC50 values of 0.68 μM and 0.17 μM, respectively.

The term endophytes refers to a group of endosymbionts usually bacterium, fungus or interactive bacterium-fungal species residing asymptomatically and grows within plants for at least a part of their life cycle intra- and intercelullarly in the tissues of higher plants without causing any visible manifestation of disease. The endophytes represent a potential source of novel natural and ecofriendly products for medicinal, agricultural and industrial uses with least adverse effect on the environment. The enormous biological diversity coupled with their capability to biosynthesize bioactive secondary metabolites has provided the momentum for the researchers working on endophytes. The present review was undertaken to highlight the biotechnological processes and bioprospection of endophytes as potential antimicrobial agents, secondary metabolites, antibiotics, antagonists against disease causing phytopathogens, cytotoxic, anticancer, insecticidal, antioxidant antiviral compounds andisolation and production of bioactive compounds with potent enzymatic activities. Endophyte enhances biodegradation and hydrolysis processes significantly important against pathogenic infection, biotransformation studies and production of compounds with immense industrial applications. The interaction of the endophytic microbiota with the plants are more protected and can withstand the adverse environmental conditions and contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration, enhanced phytoremediation efficiencies and amelioration of metal induced toxicity. The strategies governed by the endophytes for efficient production of novel bioactive phytocompounds was comprehensively discussed. The review envisaged the biodiversity, transmission of endophytes, plant endophyte interactions for the production of bioactive compounds for therapeutic, environmental and agricultural sustainability.

The polypeptides of purified preparations of the coronavirus responsible for transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs have beem examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Four major polypeptides, VPI (mol. wt. 200000), VP2 (50 000), VP3 (30000) and VP4 (28500) and two minor polypeptides, VPIa (105000) and VPIb (80500) have been reproducibly demonstrated in the virion, of which VPI, VP3 and VP4 contain carbohydrate. Treatment of the virion with the proteolytic enzyme bromelain removes the surface projections and VPI, thus identifying this glycopolypeptide as the major structural component of the projection.

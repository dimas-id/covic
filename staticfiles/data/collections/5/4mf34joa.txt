OBJECTIVE There is a lack of consensus regarding which length of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) device provides optimal thromboprophylaxis. This trial was conducted to compare hemodynamic performance of a thigh-length and knee-length IPC device. The hypothesis is that thigh-length IPC will be more efficient in preventing stasis. METHODS This single-center trial tested the thigh-length sleeve (TLS) and knee-length sleeve (KLS) in 47 healthy volunteers. Peak systolic velocity and total volume flow were measured at rest and during the 11-second compression cycle. Measurements were obtained at the popliteal vein for the KLS and at the common femoral vein for the TLS. RESULTS The study was completed by 47 volunteers (32 women, 15 men), who were a mean age of 39.7 years (range, 18-68 years). There was a statistically significant difference in augmented total volume flow and peak systolic velocity between the KLS and TLS favoring the TLS: median total volume flow was 357.54 mL/min for the KLS vs 668.21 mL/min for the TLS (P < .0001), and median peak systolic velocity was 47.70 cm/s for the KLS vs 58.47 cm/s for the TLS (P = .0019). CONCLUSIONS This trial suggests that the improved hemodynamic effects of a thigh-length IPC system may provide superior thromboprophylaxis to a knee-length IPC.

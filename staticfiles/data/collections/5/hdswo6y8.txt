In a recent paper, the authors Jamal et al reviewed various guidelines published by dental societies of the world for the prevention of transmission of COVID‐19 virus in the dental care setting during the current pandemic(Jamal et al., 2020). While this review is very interesting, I have a genuine apprehension that these guidelines may not be valid for a long time and very soon new guidelines will be required in the unfortunate event of COVID‐19 becoming endemic.

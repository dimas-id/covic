We describe the use of an endoscopy face mask with a perforated membrane, which allows a nasogastric tube for continuous noninvasive ventilation in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, in 2 patients who developed gastric distention. This interface was able to avoid most nonintentional leaks through the mask, as compared with a conventional approach, improving ventilation efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an endoscopy face mask used in noninvasive ventilation for this specific side effect.

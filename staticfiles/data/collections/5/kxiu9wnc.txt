The SARS-CoV-2 infection has as a clinical manifestation the disease known as COVID-19. Although knowledge of the nature of the disease is dynamic, with dozens of scientific articles being published every day about new features of COVID-19, the typical presentation is that of interstitial pneumonia. Despite the large amount of information that has been developed in recent weeks, it has been estimated that this disease can have up to 72% underdiagnosis, which requires clinical tools that are simple, easily accessible, and increase the detection of cases in a feasible way and that yield information with prognostic value. Given this need, some proposals have emerged to be able to diagnose, monitor and respond to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, such as pulmonary ultrasound (USP). It is worth mentioning that the USP has proven to be an efficient and easily reproducible technique for diagnosing heart failure and pleuro-pulmonary pathologies, especially in critically ill patients. Evidence of the usefulness of USP in COVID-19 is still scarce, although preliminary, it seems to be a sensitive technique whose findings have a high gold standard. In this brief review we will emphasize its technical aspects, the advantages and disadvantages, and finally a proposal for the approach in this type of patient.

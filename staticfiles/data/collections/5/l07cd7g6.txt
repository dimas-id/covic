Epidemic diarrhoea was observed in approximately 2,000 of 6,700 sheep on 9 farms. The disease, called weaner colitis, caused mortality of 1 %, while morbidity varied from 20 to 75%. Colon contents from affected sheep were inoculated into 17 sheep, 13 of which developed diarrhoea 5 to 7 days after inoculation. Naturally and experimentally infected sheep had mild, erosive typhlitis and colitis. Microscopic examination of washed scrapings of colonic mucosa from all affected sheep revealed masses of curved bacteria that were not seen in controls. Electron microscopic examination showed similar bacteria adherent to colonic epithelium of an experimentally infected sheep. Curved, motile bacteria were isolated from 2 naturally occurring cases. One isolate was inoculated into 9 sheep, 2 of which developed diarrhoea. The other isolate was given to 4 sheep without observable effect. The curved bacteria grew only on media containing blood, in an atmosphere of approximately 10% air, 10% CO(2) and 80% H(2). They were Gram‚Äênegative, with a polar flagellum at one or both ends, they did not ferment glucose or give a positive catalase reaction. It is suggested that these bacteria are a new Campylobacter species and that they play a major role in the aetiology of weaner colitis.

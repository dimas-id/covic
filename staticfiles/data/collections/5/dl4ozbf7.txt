Viral respiratory infections are very common and they are frequently eliminated from the body without any detrimental consequences. Secondary serious bacterial infection has been an apprehension expressed by health care providers, and this fear has been exacerbated in the era of Covid-19. Several published studies have shown an association between Covid-19 illness and secondary bacterial infection. However, the proposed mechanism by which a virus can develop a secondary bacterial infection is not well delineated. The aim of this commentary is to update the current evidence of the risk of bacterial infection in patients with Covid-19. We present several clinical studies related to the topic as well as a brief review of the potential pathophysiology of secondary infections that could present with Covid-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

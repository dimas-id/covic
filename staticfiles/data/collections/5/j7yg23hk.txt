BACKGROUND/AIMS Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LSPDP) is expected to be less invasive than laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. However, there are few reports regarding the details of the procedure for LSPDP, and its safety remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of LSPDP. METHODOLOGY Six patients underwent LSPDP from March 2009 to February 2013 in our center, and their clinical data and outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of six laparoscopic distal pancreatic resections were attempted in four female and two male patients. All of the operations were successful, with an average operative time of 290.7 min (range: 211-377 min) and an average blood loss of 43.5 g (range: 0-142 g). The mean hospital stay was 11.8 days (range: 9-17days). No obvious pancreatic fistulas occurred, although pseudocysts at the stump of the pancreas were recognized in three patients on CT scans performed at 7 days postoperatively. Postoperative pathological examinations revealed two cases of serous cystadenoma in the body and tail of the pancreas, one case of serous oligocystic adenoma, one case of mucinous cystadenoma, one case of neuroendocrine tumor, and one case of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS LSPDP is minimally invasive, safe, and feasible for the management of benign pancreatic tail tumors, with the advantages of earlier recovery and less morbidity from complications.

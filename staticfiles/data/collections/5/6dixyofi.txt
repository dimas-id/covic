Feline calicivirus (FCV) is 1 of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract disease in cats. Other disease syndromes associated with FCV infection have been reported. Recently, calicivirus infection associated with a hemorrhagic-like disease leading to significant mortality in cats has been reported. The clinical signs are similar to those observed with the calicivirus of rabbit hemorrhagic disease. This study characterized 2 FCV isolates associated with hemorrhagic-like disease. Nucleotide sequencing of the complete genome has been done for these 2 isolates as well as for 4 additional isolates representing other disease syndromes. Previously reported sequence data for the entire genome of classical FCV (6 isolates) and a portion of the capsid gene for hemorrhagic-like FCV (3 isolates), isolated in different regions of United States were used in the genetic analysis. Sequence data were used to determine relationships among the isolates and any correlation with phenotype. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the entire genome and individual open reading frames revealed high homology among all isolates. Data suggest that the virulence may have genetic determinants on the basis of phylogenetic clustering of the isolates associated with hemorrhagic-like disease.

BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are challenging. It is not known whether and how various disease modifying therapies, especially immunosuppressive drugs, affect COVID-19 risk and disease course. METHODS: Case report RESULTS: We report a fingolimod-treated MS patient who developed severe COVID-19 but recovered after treatment with tocilizumab. CONCLUSION: This report suggests that a brief course of tocilizumab for the treatment of severe COVID-19 may be effective while not aggravating pre-existing MS.

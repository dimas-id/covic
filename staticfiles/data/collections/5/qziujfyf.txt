The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for people of all ages but particularly devastating to adults 65 and older, which has highlighted the critical need for ensuring that all social workers gain the knowledge and skills necessary to work with this population. While there is a critical shortage of gerontological social workers and we must continue to increase that number, we cannot wait for this to occur. In this commentary, the authors call for infusing the current social work curricula with aging content; providing current social workers with trainings on aging practice; and all social work practitioners, faculty, and researchers to address four specific areas that have gained prominence due to the impact of COVID-19: ageism, loneliness and social isolation, technology, and interprofessional practice, in their respective areas.

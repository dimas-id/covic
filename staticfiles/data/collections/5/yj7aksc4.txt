The purpose of this study was to determine aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonatal calves and to investigate virulence gene markers of Escherichia coli strains isolated from calves by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eighty‐two diarrhoeic calves and 18 healthy calves were used as subjects. Faeces were taken from the rectums of all the calves and were subjected to bacterial culture. Antigen enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to detect rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli K99 in faeces of all the calves. A multiplex PCR was used to characterize E. coli strains in all the calves. Escherichia coli was isolated from 37 faeces samples, Enterococcus ssp. was isolated from 22 faeces samples and Salmonella was isolated from one faeces sample in diarrhoeic calves. Furthermore, only E. coli was isolated from all 18 faeces samples of healthy calves. Of the 37 E. coli isolated from diarrhoeic calves, K99 (18.9%), F41 (18.9%), heat‐stable enterotoxin a (STa) (18.9%), Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1; 13.5%) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2; 5.4%) and intimin (8.1%) genes were identified by multiplex PCR. Of the 18 E. coli isolated from healthy calves, K99 (16.6%) and intimin (55.5%) genes were identified by PCR. A total of 15 rotavirus, 11 coronavirus and 11 E. coli K99 were detected in diarrhoeic calves by the antigen ELISA. As a result, this study shows that rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli and Enterococcus ssp. were determined to play a role in the aetiology of diarrhoea in the neonatal calves. K99, F41, STa, Stx1 and Stx2 were found as the most common virulence gene markers of E. coli strains isolated from calves with diarrhoea. Multiplex PCR may be useful for characterization of E. coli isolated from calves.

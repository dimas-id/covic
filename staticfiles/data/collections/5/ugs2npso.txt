The presentation of the nutritional problems of HIV-infected children is changing over time with improved antiretroviral regimens. Early reports of HIV infection in the 1980s, included such problems as malnutrition and wasting. However, as treatment and prophylactic regimens improve, the current nutritional problems of HIV-infected children in developed countries include truncal obesity and insulin resistance in addition to malnutrition. Background data on the wasting syndrome, etiology of malnutrition, nutritional effects of highly active antiretroviral therapies, and nutritional intervention strategies for HIV-infected children will be presented.

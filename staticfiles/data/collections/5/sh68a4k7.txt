The COVID-19 outbreak is putting tremendous strain on the US healthcare system, with a direct impact on medical professionals, hospital systems, and physical resources. While comprehensive public health and regulatory efforts are essential to overcome this crisis, it is important to recognize this moment as an opportunity to provide more intelligent and more efficient care in spite of increasing patient volumes and fewer resources. Specifically, we must limit unnecessary and wasteful medical practices and improve the delivery of those services which enhance the quality of patient care. In doing so, we will increase availability of the critical resources required for the provision of high-quality care to those in greatest need both now and in the future.

The management of patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome focuses on identifying the causes for respiratory failure and on following best practices for supportive care with oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation. In this patient population, appropriate measures need to be taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Nearly 90% of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU need mechanical ventilation and most of these develop severe ARDS, which causes high morbidity and mortality. These patients need to be managed according to guidelines for the low-tidal-volume lung-protective ventilation. Practitioners also need to evaluate for other potential causes of respiratory failure.

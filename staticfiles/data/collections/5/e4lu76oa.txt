Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disease and loss of life worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes respiratory infection with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure in a significant number of patients. The pathophysiology of this disease is still unknown. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are mesh-like structures composed of DNA and covered with histones and proteinaceous enzymes released by neutrophils during a specialized type of cell death called “NETosis.” The primary function of NETs is to trap and kill microbes; however, dysregulation of neutrophils with excessive production of NETs can culminate in disease. Interestingly, higher levels of NETs have been observed in the serum samples of COVID-19 patients, which is correlated with the severity of this disease. This paper describes the role of excessive NET release in acute lung injury, as seen in COVID-19 patients.

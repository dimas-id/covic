INTRODUCTION Traditional balloon assisted coil embolization techniques for intracranial aneurysms require a single lumen balloon to remodel the aneurysm neck and a separate microcatheter to place coils. Here we report utilization of a single coaxial dual balloon microcatheter to achieve both coil placement and neck remodeling in a series of intracranial and cervical arterial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A series of five patients, including two with subarachnoid hemorrhage, presented to our institution with wide necked oblong aneurysms (8-30 mm maximum diameter). Coil embolization in four of these aneurysms was performed by advancing the tip of either a 4×10 mm Scepter C or a 4×11 mm Scepter XC balloon microcatheter (Microvention, Tustin, USA) into the aneurysm, inflating the balloon at the aneurysm neck, and placing the coils through the same microcatheter. In the fifth patient, who had a giant aneurysm at the top of the basilar artery, two Scepter XC balloon microcatheters were placed side by side and inflated simultaneously at the neck of the aneurysm; coil embolization was then successfully performed through both Scepter XC microcatheters. RESULTS Coil embolization was successfully performed with this technique in all five aneurysms. There was no instance of aneurysm rupture, thromboembolic complications, occlusion of branch vessels near the aneurysm neck, or prolapse of coil loops into the parent vessel. CONCLUSIONS Aneurysmal neck remodeling and coil embolization can both be achieved using a single coaxial dual lumen balloon microcatheter in selected oblong intracranial and cervical arterial aneurysms.

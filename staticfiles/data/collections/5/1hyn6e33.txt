PURPOSE Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedures performed worldwide. Although surgical technology is advancing rapidly in this era, surgeons have a chance to make modifications in laparoscopic surgery by reducing the number and size of incisions. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of a single-incision laparoscopic surgical (SILS) approach for transabdominal preperitoneal mesh hernioplasty (TAPP) of bilateral inguinal hernia. METHODS Ten patients with bilateral inguinal hernia admitted to our department and underwent TAPP were retrospectively evaluated. Data regarding patient demographics, type of hernia, operating time, complications, and postoperative hospitalization were prospectively collected. SILS TAPP was performed using conventional instruments and, surgical techniques similar to standard 3-port TAPP were used, except that it was conducted through a single umbilical port. RESULTS All the patients had a bilateral inguinal hernia. All patients were male, and the mean age of the patients was 45 years (range=28 to 62 y). The mean duration of surgery was 63 minutes (range=55 to 80 min). The procedures were completed successfully on all the patients without requiring conversion to the traditional laparoscopic surgery or the use of additional trocars. There was no evidence of early recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 67 days (range=30 to 105 d). CONCLUSIONS SILS TAPP for bilateral hernia is feasible and seems to be safer. However, follow-up and analysis are required to establish long-term clinical outcomes and recurrence rate.

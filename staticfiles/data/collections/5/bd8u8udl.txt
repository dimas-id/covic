Abstract Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induction, as detected by bioassay and Northern analysis, was examined in vitro in endothelial cells or astrocytes derived from BALB/c (susceptible) or SJL (resistant) mice following exposure to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-4) or UV inactivated MHV-4 (UV-MHV-4). In BALB/c endothelial cells, up to 16-fold more IL-6 (> 640 U/ml) was induced, compared to SJL cells which showed a minimal response (40 U/ml), relative to basal levels (< 20 U/ml). In contrast, both BALB/c and SJL astrocytes showed a substantial IL-6 response to MHV-4 and UV-MHV-4 exposure, although a strain difference persisted. Despite strain and cell specific differences in released IL-6, equivalent levels of IL-6 mRNA were induced in all cell types following exposure to MHV-4 or UV-MHV-4.

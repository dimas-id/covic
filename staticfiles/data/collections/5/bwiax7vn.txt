We detected bovine kobuvirus (BKV) in calves with diarrhea in the United States. The strain identified is related genetically to BKVs detected in other countries. Histopathologic findings also confirmed viral infection in 2 BKV cases. Our data show BKV is a potential causative agent for diarrhea in calves.

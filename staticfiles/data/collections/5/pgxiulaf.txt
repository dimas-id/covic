PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has been performed for patients with gallbladder stones but without acute cholecystitis. We report our experience of performing SILC for patients with cholecystitis requiring percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD). METHODS We performed SILC via an SILS-Port with additional 5-mm forceps through an umbilical incision in ten patients with cholecystitis requiring PTGBD. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully. The mean operative time was 124 min (range 78-169 min) and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.7 days. All patients were satisfied with the cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS Our procedure may represent an alternative to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) for patients who fervently demand the cosmetic advantages, despite cholecystitis requiring PTGBD. SILC should be performed carefully to avoid bile duct injury because the only advantage of SILC over CLC is cosmetic.

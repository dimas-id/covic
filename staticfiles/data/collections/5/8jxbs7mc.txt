Polysaccharides have aroused considerable interest due to their diverse biological activities and low toxicity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of marine polysaccharide sulfated polymannuroguluronate (TGC161) on the leukopenia induced by chemotherapy. It is found that TGC161 ameliorates the leukopenia. Besides, TGC161 would promote CD4(+) T cell differentiation and maturation in the thymus, but does not have a significant effect on precursor cells in bone marrow. Furthermore, TGC161 inhibits CD4(+) T cell apoptosis in vitro. Collectively, our findings offer a natural and harmless polysaccharide to ameliorate leukopenia.

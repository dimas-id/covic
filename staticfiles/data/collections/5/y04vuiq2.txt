Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) conjugates with methyl and ethyl esters of D-amino acids (D-Trp, D-Phe, D-Tyr, D-Val, D-Leu) have been synthesized by the activated esters method using mixtures of N-hydroxybenzotriazole or N-hydroxysuccinimide with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. GA conjugate with D-Trp ethyl ester exhibited antiviral activity against influenza viruses A/H3N2, A/H1N1/pdm09, A/H5N1, B (SI > 10–29), and HRSV (SI > 25). GA conjugate with D-Trp methyl ester inhibited influenza virus A/H1N1/pdm09 (SI > 30).

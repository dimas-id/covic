Current shortages of Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) have created a demand for effective methods for N95 decontamination and reuse. Before implementing any reuse strategy it is important to determine what effects the proposed method has on the physical functioning of the FFR. Here we investigate the effects of two potential methods for decontamination; dry heat at 95 {degrees}C, and autoclave treatments. We test both fit and filtration efficiency for each method. For the dry heat treatment we consider the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M8210+ models. After five cycles of the dry heating method, all three FFR models pass both fit and filtration tests, showing no degradation. For the autoclave tests we consider the 3M 1870, and the 3M 8210+. We find significant degradation of the FFRs following the 121 {degrees}C autoclave cycles. The molded mask tested (3M 8210+) failed fit testing after just 1 cycle in the autoclave. The pleated (3M 1870) mask passed fit testing for 5 cycles, but failed filtration testing. The 95 {degrees}C dry heat cycle is scalable to over a thousand masks per day in a hospital setting, and is above the temperature which has been shown to achieve the requisite 3 log kill of SARS-CoV-2[1], making it a promising method for N95 decontamination and reuse.

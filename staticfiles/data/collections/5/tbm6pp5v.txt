PURPOSE To demonstrate the first use of a novel technology for quantifying suture forces on annuloplasty rings to better understand the mechanisms of ring dehiscence. DESCRIPTION Force transducers were developed, attached to a size 24 Physio ring, and implanted in the mitral annulus of an ovine animal. Ring suture forces were measured after implantation and for cardiac cycles reaching peak left ventricular pressures (LVP) of 100, 125, and 150 mm Hg. EVALUATION After implantation of the undersized ring to the flaccid annulus, the mean suture force was 2.0±0.6 N. During cyclic contraction, the anterior ring suture forces were greater than the posterior ring suture forces at peak LVPs of 100 mm Hg (4.9±2.0 N vs 2.1±1.1 N), 125 mm Hg (5.4±2.3 N vs 2.3±1.2 N), and 150 mm Hg (5.7±2.4 N vs 2.4±1.1 N). The largest force was 7.4 N at 150 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary results demonstrate trends in annuloplasty suture forces and their variation with location and LVP. Future studies will significantly contribute to clinical knowledge by elucidating the mechanisms of ring dehiscence while improving annuloplasty ring design and surgical repair techniques.

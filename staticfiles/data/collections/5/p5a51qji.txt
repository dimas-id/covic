Comparative investigations of Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), mouse encephalomyelitis virus (mouse polio), minute virus of mice (MVM), and reovirus type 3 (Reo 3) infected murine colonies revealed a 30% higher incidence of positive sera when enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed instead of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests. Equivalent sensitivity as in the ELISA was obtained when the same sera were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests. The virus purification techniques described resulted in highly suitable antigens for all indirect ELISA established. Since IIF requires no purified antigens, this test is recommended as an alternative to ELISA as well as to HI and complement fixation (CF) tests for laboratories lacking the necessary equipment for high speed centrifugation. A high incidence of false positive HI reactions was found particularly in Reo 3 routine serology. An updated survey of seromonitoring showed that European murine colonies appeared to be infected far less with Reo 3 if ELISA or IIF tests were employed. During 1982-1984, only 13% of the mouse colonies screened possessed Reo 3 positive sera whereas no natural Reo 3 infection was found in rat colonies. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the coronaviruses of rats exhibited the highest incidence in murine colonies. A total of 60% of mouse and 41% of rat colonies were found to be infected by these viruses. In comparison with earlier serological surveys, the relative incidence of other murine infections was similar. Antibodies against Bacillus piliformis (Tyzzer's disease) were detected by the IIF test in 41% of the rat colonies screened.

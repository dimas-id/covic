The global spread of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, which originated from Wuhan, China, is likely to have an impact on the rheumatological practices due to a dilemma in both continuing and initiating immunosuppressive medications. We reviewed the risk stratification of patients with rheumatological disorders, the safety of various anti-rheumatological drugs, and the role of multiple drugs used by the rheumatologists in managing COVID-19. The score-based risk stratification is helpful in therapeutic decision-making such as self-isolation, continuation, or initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Most of the immunosuppressive therapies need not be discontinued unless there is an overwhelming infection. The treatment interruption should not be made in fear, and there should be shared decision-making in consultation with the patient. The proposed role of different anti-rheumatic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19 based on some initial uncontrolled trials and case reports will become clearer when the results of various ongoing well-planned studies become available.

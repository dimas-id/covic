Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described and highly contagious respiratory infection. Many adult patients will develop progressive hypoxia, and a large proportion will develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), possibly related to massive and uncontrolled activation of the immune system. The mortality has been reported to be quite high, especially in the elderly with comorbid conditions. The causative agent has been identified as a novel coronavirus, and children appear to acquire the infection by close‐contact household exposure to an infected adult. However, the severity is much milder and the clinical progression much less aggressive in young children. The exact pathophysiology of SARS is still unclear, and the medical treatment of SARS remains controversial. The main treatment regime used in Hong Kong is a combination of ribavirin and steroid. To date, there have been no reported case fatalities in children with this disease. The success of reducing the burden of this infection in children will depend on proper isolation of infected adults early in the course of illness. Strict public health policy and quarantine measures are the key in controlling the infection in the community. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2003; 36:261–266. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

This paper addresses a mathematical model of the boiling of subcooled liquid in an annular channel. The model is presented by a mixed system of ordinary differential equations, algebraic relations and a single partial differential equation, which, written together, can be viewed as an underdetermined differential algebraic equation with a partial differential equation attached. Using the tools of the differential algebraic equation theory, we reveal some important qualitative properties of this system, such as its existence domain, and propose a numerical method for its solution. The numerical experiments demonstrated that within the found existence domain the mathematical model adequately represents real-life boiling processes that occur in the experimental setup.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the conflicting duties of a practicing surgeon who is at high risk for morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 infection. Should he opt out of the care of these patients or does his duty to care override other considerations? SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Older adults and those with serious medical conditions are at much greater risk for severe disease and death from Covid-19 infection. As a practicing frontline surgeon in a high risk group, the hospital offered the author, and other health care providers at high risk, the option to opt out of the care Covid-19 suspected or infected patients before an anticipated surge. What should the surgeon and other health care providers do? This is a question many are asking and having to answer. METHODS: In this article, the author describes how difficult the situation of having any choice at all was and then how difficult it was to arrive at a decision. The duty to care and its limits, as well as obligations to society, family, co-workers, and to self, are examined. The author considers how he and others can contribute in other ways to patients and providers. CONCLUSION: The author arrives at a morally permissible and a rational decision to opt out. Health care workers at high risk can contribute in other ways to patients and providers. It still may not feel right.

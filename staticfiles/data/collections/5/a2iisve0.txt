Over several decades, production and inventory systems have been widely studied in different aspects, but only a few studies have considered the production disruption problem. In production systems, the production may be disrupted by priorly unknown disturbance and the entire manufacturing plan can be distorted. This research introduces a production-disruption model for a multi-product single-stage production-inventory system. First, a mathematical model for the multi-item production-inventory system is developed to maximize the total profit for a single-disruption recovery-time window. The main objective of the proposed model is to obtain the optimal manufacturing batch size for multi-item in the recovery time window so that the total profit is maximized. To maintain the matter of multi-product, budget and space constraints are used. A genetic algorithm and pattern search techniques are employed to solve this model and all randomly generated test results are compared. Some numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are given to explain the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model. This proposed model offers a recovery plan for managers and decision-makers to make accurate and effective decisions in real time during the production disruption problems.

In this study, we investigated the effect of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined chemotherapy on middle and late period non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In total, 85 cases of middle and late period NSCLC patients were selected, and were randomly divided into the RFA combined chemotherapy group, RFA treatment group and chemotherapy group. After treatment, the three groups were followed up for computed tomography (CT) scan, and were analyzed for the effect of RFA combined chemotherapy on middle and late period NSCLC. It was found that CT value of RFA combined chemotherapy group decreased significantly compared to before surgery (P<0.05). The CT value of the RFA group decreased significantly compared to before surgery (P<0.05). The CT value of chemotherapy group was not significantly changed compared to before surgery (P>0.05). The postoperative CT value of the RFA combined chemotherapy group and RFA group was smaller compared to that of the chemotherapy group (P<0.05). Effective rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] of RFA combined chemotherapy group was significantly higher than that of the EFA and chemotherapy groups (P<0.05). Effective rate (CR+PR) of the RFA group was significantly higher than that of the chemotherapy group (P<0.05). By contrast, the progressive rate (P) of RFA combined chemotherapy group was significantly lower than that of the RFA and chemotherapy groups (P<0.05). In conclusion, RFA combined chemotherapy has obvious effect on middle and late period NSCLC, and is safe and feasible.

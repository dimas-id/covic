OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to describe a technique for uterine-sparing hysteropexy. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old multiparous woman with pelvic organ prolapse underwent laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy utilizing polypropylene mesh with good clinical result. CONCLUSIONS Placement of mesh arms medial to the uterine vessels during a laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy can be facilitated by using blunt needles to introduce the mesh arms.

Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound global impact. Its rapid transmissibility has forced whole countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. As part of necessary pandemic planning, the majority of Canadian cardiac surgical programs have prioritized and delayed elective procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the health care system and to mobilize resources in the event of a pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, new cases have begun to decline in many jurisdictions. This “flattening of the curve” has inevitably prompted discussions around re-opening of the economy, relaxing some public health restrictions and resuming non-urgent health care delivery.

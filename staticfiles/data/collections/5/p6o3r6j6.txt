Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is an important cause of morbidity, mortality and economic losses in cattle worldwide. Humoral immunity to BVDV plays a major role in the protection against infection and disease. In vitro serum neutralization tests can quantify humoral responses, but standard protocols are time-consuming and labour-intensive. The objective of this study was to develop a highly sensitive assay based on high-content cell-by-cell screening that is faster and less subjective than the conventional protocols. It can detect a neutralizing antibody response within the first week after infection of an animal, takes less than 24h to complete and excludes operator bias by automated data acquisition and analysis.

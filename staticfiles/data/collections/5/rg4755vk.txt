Surgical outcomes and costs of laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma were compared in a centre with lengthy experience with laparoscopic surgery. The robotic cohort (n = 67) had a longer operative time than the laparoscopic cohort (n = 150) (p < 0.0001). Lymph node yields were similar for both surgical modalities, but the median of estimated blood loss was lower in the robotic group (50 ml vs 100 ml; p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with hospital stay > 2 days and rate of overall complications were similar in both groups. Operative costs were (Euros) €1,680 and €3,860 for the laparoscopic and robotic procedure, respectively. We conclude that robotic technology is feasible but does not provide short-term benefits for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma in a centre where laparoscopy has been established as the standardised minimally invasive surgical method.

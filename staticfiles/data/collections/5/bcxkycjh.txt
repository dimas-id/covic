BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported outbreaks due to human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in long-term care facilities (LTCF) for the elderly. However, most of these reports are epidemiological studies and do not investigate the clinical features of hMPV pneumonia. METHODS: Three independent outbreaks of hMPV occurred at separate LTCF for intellectually challenged and elderly residents. A retrospective evaluation of hMPV pneumonia and its clinical and radiological features was conducted using available medical records and data. RESULTS: In 105 hMPV infections, 49% of patients developed pneumonia. The median age of pneumonia cases was significantly higher than non-pneumonia cases (P < .001). Clinical manifestations of hMPV pneumonia included high fever, wheezing in 43%, and respiratory failure in 31% of patients. An elevated number of white blood cells as well as increased levels of C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase, and both aspartate and alanine transaminases was also observed among pneumonia cases. Evaluation of chest imaging revealed proximal bronchial wall thickenings radiating outward from the hilum in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: The aforementioned characteristics should be considered as representative of hMPV pneumonia. Patients presenting with these features should have laboratory testing performed for prompt diagnosis.

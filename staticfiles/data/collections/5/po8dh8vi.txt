BACKGROUND Human enteroviruses (HEVs) have been recognized to cause a significant number of respiratory tract infections in many regions. Previous studies conducted to analyse enteroviral respiratory tract infections focused on outbreaks. Data in the Southeast Asian region is still rather limited to date. OBJECTIVES We conducted a prospective analysis to understand the epidemiological characteristics of enteroviral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) among paediatric patients admitted to Hospital Ampang, a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. METHODOLOGY Nasopharyngeal aspirates for common respiratory viruses and throat swabs for enteroviruses were obtained for rtPCR analyses. All positive enteroviral results were then cultured for species identification. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Of the total 211 recruited patients, enteroviral LRTIs made up 8%. The clinical features of enteroviral infections are mostly clinically indistinguishable from that of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. However, RSV appears to be more lymphocytosis causing than enteroviruses (EV). We found a higher asthma incidence within the enteroviral group compared to RSV group. Enteroviral infections continue to play an important role in LRTIs in children beyond infancy and up to school age. Among the enteroviral strains, EV71 contributes a major role in enteroviral LRTIs in our center. Routine testing for enterovirus would certainly help identify a significant proportion of unexplained viral LRTIs among paediatric patients. However, further cost analyses studies would be helpful to determine if incorporating testing for enteroviruses into routine respiratory viruses panel tests is economically feasible.

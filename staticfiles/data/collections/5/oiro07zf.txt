Background: The (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in sudden disruption of routine clinical care necessitating rapid transformation to maintain clinical care while safely reducing virus contagion. Introduction: Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) experienced a rapid evolution from delivery of in-person cessation counseling services to virtual telehealth treatments for our tobacco-dependent cancer patients. Aim: To examine the effect of rapid scaling of tobacco treatment telehealth on patient engagement, as measured by attendance rates for in-person counseling visits versus remote telehealth counseling visits. We also describe the patient, clinician, and health care system challenges encountered in rapid expansion of individual and group tobacco telehealth services. Methods: Data collected from the electronic medical record during the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were examined for tobacco treatment counseling. Results: From January 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020, markedly improved patient engagement was observed in ambulatory tobacco treatment services with greater attendance at scheduled telehealth visits than in-person visits, 75% versus 60.3%, odds ratio 1.84 (confidence interval: 1.26-2.71; p < 0.001). In addition, bedside hospital counseling visits were transformed into inpatient telephone visits with high levels of sustained patient engagement. Lastly, group telehealth services were launched rapidly to increase capacity and provide greater psychosocial support for cancer patients struggling with tobacco dependence. Discussion: Clinical, Information Technology (IT), and hospital system barriers were successfully addressed for most cancer patients seeking individual telehealth treatment. Group telehealth services were found to be feasible and acceptable. Conclusions: MSK's rapid leap into virtual care delivery mitigated disruption of tobacco treatment services and demonstrated strong feasibility and acceptance for managing complex tobacco-dependent patients.

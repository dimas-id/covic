Abstract The coronavirus disease (covid19) pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the greatest healthcare challenge in a generation. Clinicians are modifying the way they approach day-to-day procedures. Safety and reduction transmission risk is paramount. Surgical tracheostomies in covid19 patients are aerosol generating procedures linked with a significant risk of viral contamination. Here, we describe our local approach for these procedures, introducing the “5Ts” of safe tracheostomy practice: Theatre set-up, Team Briefing, Transfer of patient, Tracheostomy Procedure, Team Doffing and de-brief. We identify the critical steps of the procedure and explain how we overcome the risks linked with breaking the transfer circuit to link the patient to the theatre ventilator. We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea. We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer. We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this. We summarise the steps in our protocol in an “easy to reproduce” way. Finally, we emphasise the importance of communication in a constantly changing environment and challenging circumstances.

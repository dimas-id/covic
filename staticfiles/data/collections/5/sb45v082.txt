Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had immediate impact on the practice of medicine and orthopaedic education. As the practice of social distancing has been put into place to help slow the spread of disease as well as to conserve medical supplies and equipment, elective surgery has come to a grinding halt. This dramatic change has forced our leaders to critically evaluate the delivery of education and skills training for our residents, fellows as well as all orthopaedic surgeons. We must continue to develop technologies such as virtual meeting platforms, distance learning, simulation-based training, virtual reality andaugmented reality to augment the new world of orthopaedic education.

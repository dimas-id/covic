CONTEXT The influence of the gonadal hormones on some aspects of the human physiology has been studied with uncertain results. Still a confusion exists in relation to the real effects of the female hormones on the perception of pain. The existing data refer mainly to experimental studies and have provided results not always useful in the clinical practice. DATA SOURCE This study was designed to detect whether there are differences in the perception of the postoperative pain in women, during two clearly defined phases of hormonal asset: luteal and follicular phases. CONCLUSION The results of this study have demonstrated that in postoperative female patients pain is perceived significantly more in the luteal phase of the menstrual period, than in the follicular phase. This could suggest that female in child-bearing age should be scheduled for elective surgery preferentially during the follicular phase, unless differently necessary. It would guarantee a more comfortable postoperative period, with reduced necessity of analgesics.

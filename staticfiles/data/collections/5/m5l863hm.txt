Over the last 15 years the management of patients admitted in the ICU has changed dramatically. A growing number of well designed randomized controlled studies have been published, resulting in improved medical care and reduction of short-term morbidity and mortality. Despite these important achievements, little attention has been placed on the long-term complications of subjects discharged from the ICU. This review will focus on the most common long-term outcomes post-ICU admission, and will emphasize the importance of developing ICU clinics to provide comprehensive care to ICU survivors. We also describe our experience regarding the organization, functioning, and limitations for the development of our post-ICU clinic.

The underlying reasons for the differences in the virulence of various types of Ebola virus (EBOV) remain unknown. Comparison of the percentage of disorder (PID) in nucleocapsid proteins VP30 and NP reveals high correlation between nucleocapsid PIDs and the case-fatality rates of EBOV. The higher disorder of these proteins is likely to be needed for more efficient multiplication of virus copies via more efficient viral RNA transcription and more promiscuous protein binding potential. This is important for the more efficient assistance of nucleocapsid in viral particle budding and of the assembly and mobility of viral proteins across the host membrane and within the cytoplasm. A more comprehensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of EBOV virulence would also lead to new and more effective strategies in vaccine development.

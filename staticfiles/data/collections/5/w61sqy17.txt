[Image: see text] Peptide stapling is a technique which has been widely employed to constrain the conformation of peptides. One of the effects of such a constraint can be to modulate the interaction of the peptide with a binding partner. Here, a cysteine bis-alkylation stapling technique was applied to generate structurally isomeric peptide variants of a heterodimeric coiled-coil forming peptide. These stapled variants differed in the position and size of the formed macrocycle. C-terminal stapling showed the most significant changes in peptide structure and stability, with calorimetric binding analysis showing a significant reduction of binding entropy for stapled variants. This entropy reduction was dependent on cross-linker size and was accompanied by a change in binding enthalpy, illustrating the effects of preorganization. The stapled peptide, along with its binding partner, were subsequently employed as fusogens in a liposome model system. An increase in both lipid- and content-mixing was observed for one of the stapled peptide variants: this increased fusogenicity was attributed to increased coiled-coil binding but not to membrane affinity, an interaction theorized to be a primary driving force in this fusion system.

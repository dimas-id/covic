We report a case of a 59-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). He had visited a hospital for fever and cough and been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia in the right upper lobe. However, he gradually progressed to dyspnea and consulted our hospital. His chest radiographs showed bilateral pneumonia shadows and his CT showed ground glass opacities and consolidation. Although we treated him with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the pneumonia shadow rapidly progressed and mechanical ventilation was administered. We collected sputum from the bronchus using bronchoscopy to detect microorganisms, and RT-PCR tests confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. He was transferred to a designated hospital. In order to prevent the occurrence of nosocomial infections, close contacts within the hospital and medical staff were suspended from their work for two weeks. No secondary infection with COVID-19 appeared. This was the first case of COVID-19 occurring as community-acquired pneumonia in Hokkaido, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Quantification of polar compounds such as chloroquine by revered-phase LC is a challenge because of poor retention and silanol interactions with stationary phase. Strong ion-pairing reagents added to mobile phases to improve reversed-phase retention and improve peak shape can be harmful for MS. RESULTS: This new approach provides a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of chloroquine using hydrophilic interaction LC coupled to MS/MS (HILICâ€“MS/MS). Ammonium formate and formic acid were added to mobile phase to attain good peak shapes and the salified chloroquine as well retained in an HILIC column. Linearity, intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy, recovery, matrix effect and stability were evaluated during the validation process. CONCLUSION: The validated method has been successfully used in a PK study in miniature pigs, and paves way for future development.

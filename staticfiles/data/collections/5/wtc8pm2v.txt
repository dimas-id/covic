Pharmacomechanical Thrombectomy (PMT) is recognized as a recent advancement in the treatment of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Evidence for the use of this modality is growing rapidly, primarily based on anecdotal experience and large case series. Currently, the majority of patients with lower extremity DVT are treated with anticoagulation or compressive therapy without adjunctive surgical or interventional procedures. This article reviews the current evidence supporting the use of PMT over catheter directed thrombolysis or simple anticoagulation and the expected benefits that can be realized from each modality. In addition the relevant unique characteristics to each device currently available are described focusing on mechanism of action and potential side effects.

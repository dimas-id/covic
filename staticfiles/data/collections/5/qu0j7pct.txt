OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of propofol and sevoflurane on cytokine levels in children with community-acquired pneumonia undergoing flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). METHOD Children with community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive 3-5 mg/kg propofol i.v. or 8% inhaled sevoflurane. Haemodynamic variables, stress hormone responses and serum cytokines were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Out of 50 children aged 2-12 years (propofol, n = 25; sevoflurane, n = 25), there were no significant between-group differences in haemodynamic variables and stress hormones. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 decreased significantly following FFB in both groups. IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the sevoflurane group than propofol group at 4 h and 1 d following FFB (61.3 ± 11.9 versus 82.6 ± 19.7 pg/ml; 52.8 ± 9.7 versus 75.4 ± 13.6 pg/ml, respectively). IL-10 levels in the sevoflurane group were significantly lower than in the propofol group at 1 d following FFB. CONCLUSIONS In children with community-acquired pneumonia, use of sevoflurane was associated with lower circulating IL-6 and IL-10 levels compared with propofol, following FFB. Pneumonia severity is reflected by higher blood cytokine levels, thus, sevoflurane may be more beneficial to recovery from community-acquired pneumonia than propofol, however further studies are required to test this hypothesis.

The development of minimally invasive procedures has rekindled interest in endoluminal techniques for the management of Zenker's diverticulum. Tissue sealers as employed in laparoscopic surgery have not been previously used for Zenker's diverticulum septotomy.Supported by the established safety of linear cutters, bipolar forceps, and ultrasonic scalpels, we have started a procedure using the Ligasure 5â„¢ tissue sealer. Safety and efficacy results in our early clinical experience are shown for a prospective series of 5 consecutive Zenker's diverticulum cases that were perorally managed with tissue sealing.The procedure was quickly and safely performed in the endoscopy room under sedation. Mean number of seals per patient was 2, and mean procedure duration was 33 minutes. No complications developed during or after the procedure, and patients were discharged with immediate dysphagia relief and adequate oral tolerance. No diverticular relapses occurred after a mean follow-up of 21 months (range 18-30). This procedure may be repeated as often as desired with no need for hospital admission. Safety should be prospectively assessed by further studies using a higher number of procedures.

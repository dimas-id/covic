Reviewed are the clinical features and outcome of 12 chronic dialysis patients (six men) who contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) compared with 23 sex- and age-matched nonuremic SARS patients as controls. Eight were on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and four on hemodialysis. Mean age was 58 +/- 12 yr for the dialysis patients, and 57 +/- 12 yr for the controls. The presenting symptoms of dialysis patients were similar to the controls. With appropriate protection measures, hemodialysis was performed in a dedicated area of the SARS isolation ward, while PD was continued as intermittent PD. In all seven patients with PD effluent tested, SARS-related coronavirus (CoV) could not be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture. Three dialysis patients had persistent positive stool PCR after 5 wk, whereas all nondialysis patients had negative stool PCR after 1 wk. Despite dosage adjustment, ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia was more severe in the dialysis patients. Dialysis patients required longer hospitalization than the controls, but the mortality was similar. With appropriate protective measures, dialysis could be safely performed. Dialysis patients with SARS often require prolonged hospitalization. Furthermore, these patients may have an extended period of viral shedding, which should be carefully monitored for the purpose of infection control.

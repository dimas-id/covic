The epithelial barrier of the intestine and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) protects the host against luminal pathogenic micro-organisms. This is important at weaning, when animals are exposed to infectious agents and stresses. We have developed a rat model of intestinal inflammation post weaning, based on the systemic administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB). Since the inflammatory response obtained is mild, the food intake pattern is not affected, which makes this model useful for studies of nutritional therapies for intestinal inflammatory disease. SEB increased T-lymphocytes in Peyer's patches and the number of activated T-lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes (organized GALT). In the lamina propria, SEB increased activated T-lymphocytes as well as cytotoxic and natural killer-cell populations of the diffuse GALT. It also increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in both Peyer's patches and mucosa. Rats given SEB had higher paracellular permeability to macromolecules, which was associated with a reduction in epithelial tightness. This model was used to examine whether dietary supplementation with spray-dried animal plasma proteins affects intestinal inflammation. Results showed that dietary plasma proteins can attenuate the mucosal immune response in both organized and diffuse GALT and that these effects are mediated by a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

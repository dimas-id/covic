COVID-19 is a highly transmittable disease. Until a vaccine is found, social distancing is the only way to prevent the virus from killing millions. Lockdown may also be necessary. Such measures inevitably cause an economic recession, so supplementing individualsâ€™ incomes prove vital. Without income support, employees must go to work and risk contracting and spreading the virus. Instituting protective measures is the role of the government; however, a dysfunctional government causes citizens to seek alternative solutions from either the civic sector or charitable organizations.

A 14-year old domestic shorthair cat was presented because of vomiting, anorexia and an abdominal mass. A diagnosis could not be made preoperative and during surgery the mass was assigned to the gastric part of the pancreas. A partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed using a LigasureÂ® vessel sealing device. No surgery related complications occurred. Histological examination revealed an anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas. The cat was in a good clinical condition 14 days after surgery. After 2 months the cat was euthanized with the suspicion of a bone tumor. Findings of this case demonstrate that pancreatic carcinoma in cats has a poor prognosis but pancreatectomy can be performed using a bipolar vessel sealing device as a safe and fast alternative to standard surgical techniques.

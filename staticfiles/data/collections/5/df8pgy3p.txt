Blood from 30 free-ranging brown hyenas ( Parahyaena brunnea) was collected for biochemical analysis and select serologic screening in Namibia from 1997 to 2010. Age was found to have an influence on several biochemical parameters that may be related to growth, a developing immune system, and differences in diet. Seasonal differences in diet of coastal brown hyenas also had an overall significant effect on lipemia values, and differences in stress due to varying capture methods could be associated with an increase in glucose and creatinine kinase. Comparisons among hyena species from published data were inconclusive, as some samples may have been derived from captive populations and individuals. Sera were tested for antibodies against 18 pathogens. Antibodies were not detected for most pathogens, but the proportion of sera containing antibodies against canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1) and canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) was 65% and 84%, respectively. There was no effect of sex, age, year of sampling, or contact with domestic dogs, indicating that CAV-1 or CAV-2 may be enzootic. The prevalence of antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV) was 43%, and older brown hyenas were 6.9 times more likely to have been exposed to CDV, adjusting for year of sampling and degree of estimated contact with domestic dogs, suggesting epizootic outbreaks. This study is the first to present biochemical reference intervals for wild brown hyenas and provides an indication of disease exposure in this species.

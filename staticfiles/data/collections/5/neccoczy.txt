BACKGROUND To report the feasibility and reproducibility of single-port extraperitoneal para-aortic (PA) lymphadenectomy exclusively using conventional instruments in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) and to evaluate the learning curve. METHODS From January 2011 to January 2013, 52 a total of consecutive patients with LACC were candidates for extraperitoneal PA lymphadenectomy via an original single-port approach that we developed. All patients underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography that indicated no PA uptake. RESULTS Fifty consecutive patients underwent single-port staging surgery. Two patients had peritoneal carcinomatosis and were not submitted to PA lymphadenectomy. Median age and body mass index were, respectively 47 (range 27-68) years and 23 (range 16-37) kg/m(2). In one case, lymphadenectomy was unfeasible because of renal vessel anomalies (a bifurcated left renal vein crossed the aorta at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery), and two nodes were removed. Conventional instruments were used in all cases. The median operative time was 180 (range 110-270) min. The median and mean number of nodes removed were, respectively, 18 (range 2-47) and 19.4. Six (12 %) patients had metastatic PA disease. No conversion to laparotomy or conventional multiport laparoscopy was required. The median postoperative hospital stay and the interval between staging surgery and the beginning of chemoradiation were, respectively, 2 (range 1-26) days and 16.5 (range 1-60) days. The learning curve was evaluated at seven procedures with a decreased median operative time at 160 (range 110-240) min. CONCLUSIONS Extraperitoneal staging via a single-port left iliac approach is feasible with conventional tools, is reproducible and safe, and offers a high degree of cosmetic satisfaction.

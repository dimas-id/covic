OBJECTIVE Even though roughly 90% of all implanted cardiac implantable electronic devices leads can be removed through conventional techniques, presence of large vegetations or thrombi, fractured leads, previous failed extraction, or long duration from implantation often impede classical transvenous extraction. In these cases, laser-assisted procedures represent a highly successful alternative and have a low procedural complication rate with major adverse events in less than 2% of cases. Unfortunately, most encountered complications are potentially fatal, which prompted us to develop a novel approach that adds additional safety measures by allowing for real-time intrathoracic visualization and intervention. METHODS Five consecutive patients classified as high-risk patients received concomitant laser sheet extraction and right-sided uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery for real-time intrathoracic visualization. RESULTS Complete extraction was achieved in all cases without observing major intraoperative events, and on-table extubation was feasible in all cases. No chest tube-associated or incision-related complications were encountered. CONCLUSIONS Concomitant laser sheet extraction and video-assisted thoracoscopy are feasible and may offer benefits in high-risk patients. Further studies to document the actual safety and clinical value of our procedure are warranted.

The built environment (BE) affects ecosystems, ecosystem services and human health and well being. While, formally, the BE ranges from the smallest hut to the largest city, this chapter focuses upon the health effects of urban areas, which increasingly are the preferred human habitat. Urban areas have many attractive and beneficial influences to human well-being. But at the same time, many effects of urban areas are harmful to well-being, and many are not even recognized as such. Most publications about these topics have described the effects of the BE separately, on either ecosystems or on human health. The interconnectivity between these two effects relative to BE is rarely studied. This paper focuses on the mutual influence and interactions between three related aspects of the BE which can impact ecosystems and human health: transportation, land use, and life style. It also explores some of the links between the BE, human health, and human security.

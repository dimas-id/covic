A cross-sectional study was carried out in a dairy goat herd, investigating the presence of rotavirus by means of ELISA, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two latex agglutination tests in feces of 63 goat kids younger than 1 month, with and without diarrhea, and in feces of 19 adult goats during the first few days after parturition. All animals belonged to a herd located in the mountains of the Le√≥n province (NW Spain). Rotaviruses were found in 18 out of 63 goat kid fecal samples but no significant association between shedding of rotavirus and presence of diarrhea could be established. Rotaviruses were found in kids aged 6 to 21 days, and more frequently between 6 and 10 days. No shedding of virus was detected in any of the adults. Considering ELISA as the reference test, PAGE and both latex agglutination tests were less sensitive. One of the latex tests was also highly non-specific. All PAGE-positive samples showed the typical electropherotype of group A rotavirus. Feces were also screened for other pathogens including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of six out of 45 goat kids tested, all six suffering from diarrhea. This paper represents the first description of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain. The possible mechanisms of viral diffusion within the herd and its role as pathogen in goats are discussed.

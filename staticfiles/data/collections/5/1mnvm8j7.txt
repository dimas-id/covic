HYPOTHESIS Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has gained widespread interest as a potentially less invasive alternative to laparoscopic surgery or, else, an evolution as the next-generation surgery. The main objective of this study was to assess the safety of transluminal abdominal wall hernia repair for potential human application by specifically investigating the feasibility and challenges of using a transvaginal approach. DESIGN NOTES ventral hernia repair via a transvaginal approach. SETTING University Hospital (National University Health System, Singapore). PARTICIPANTS The study utilized five female pigs (30-40 kg) between 5 and 7 months of age, which underwent abdominal wall hernia repair using a transvaginal approach. INTERVENTION The procedures were performed using a double-channel endoscope under general endotracheal anesthesia. A mesh was placed and fixed to the abdominal wall using standard laparoscopic and endoscopic equipment. The animals survived for 2 weeks and were then euthanized and a necropsy performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES To assess the safety and feasibility of NOTES ventral hernia repair in a survival experimental model. RESULTS All of the procedures could be safely performed using the standard equipment. At the necropsy, all meshes were well in place and mild adhesions were recorded in one animal with a small abscess in the subcutaneous area. CONCLUSION This novel approach seems technically challenging but feasible using equipment and accessories currently available for conventional laparoscopic and interventional endoscopy with low intra-abdominal contamination and sepsis. New procedure-specific instruments and equipment need to be developed to allow the surgeon safer access and more degrees of instrument freedom.

The human bocavirus is one of the most common respiratory viruses and occurs in all age groups. Because Kochâ€™s postulates have been fulfilled unintendedly, it is currently accepted that the virus is a real pathogen associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections causing clinical symptoms ranging from a mild common cold to life-threatening respiratory diseases. In order to exclude a viremia, serological analysis should be included during laboratory diagnostics, as acute and chronic infections cannot be differentiated by detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory specimen alone due to prolonged viral shedding. Besides its ability to persist, the virus appears to trigger chronic lung disease and increases clinical symptoms by causing fibrotic lung diseases. Due to the lack of an animal model, clinical trials remain the major method for studying the long-term effects of HBoV infections.

Noncytopathic viruses use multiple strategies to evade immune detection, challenging a role for vaccine induced CTL in preventing microbial persistence. Recrudescence of neurotropic coronavirus due to loss of T cell-mediated immune control provided an experimental model to test T cell vaccination efficacy in the absence of Ab. Challenge virus was rapidly controlled in vaccinated Ab-deficient mice coincident with accelerated recruitment of memory CD8+ T cells and enhanced effector function compared with primary CD8+ T cell responses. In contrast to primary effectors, reactivated memory cells persisted in the CNS at higher frequencies and retained ex vivo cytolytic activity. Nevertheless, despite earlier and prolonged T cell-mediated control in the CNS of vaccinated mice, virus ultimately reactivated. Apparent loss of memory CD8+ effector function in vivo was supported by a prominent decline in MHC expression on CNS resident target cells, presumably reflecting diminished IFN-gamma. Severely reduced MHC expression on glial cells at the time of recrudescence suggested that memory T cells, although fully armed to exert antiviral activity upon Ag recognition in vitro, are not responsive in an environment presenting few if any target MHC molecules. Paradoxically, effective clearance of viral Ag thus affords persisting virus a window of opportunity to escape from immune surveillance. These studies demonstrate that vaccine-induced T cell memory alone is unable to control persisting virus in a tissue with strict IFN-dependent MHC regulation, as evident in immune privileged sites.

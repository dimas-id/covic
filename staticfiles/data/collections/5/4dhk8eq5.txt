Abstract Mice containing the activated v-Ha-ras oncogene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter/enhancer produced less tumor necrosis factor (TNF) than genetically identical animals without it. Inbred Oncomice containing the v-Ha-ras oncogene and inbred FVB mice without it were grown for 6 months. Splenocytes were isolated and stimulated in vitro to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Î³-interferon (IFN). TNF production by cells from Oncomice was significantly decreased compared to cells from FBV mice. There was a tendency for decrease, but no significant difference was seen on IFN release. These observations suggest that the oncogene may play a role in the immune system.

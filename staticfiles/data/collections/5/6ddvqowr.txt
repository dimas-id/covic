The COVID pandemic has necessitated modifications to pediatric orthopaedic practice to protect patients, families, and healthcare workers and to minimize viral transmission. It is critical to balance the benefits of alterations to current practice to reduce the chances of COVID infection, with the potential long-term impact on patients. Early experiences of the pandemic from orthopaedic surgeons in China, Singapore, and Italy have provided the opportunity to take proactive and preventive measures to protect all involved in pediatric orthopaedic care. These guidelines, based on expert opinion and best available evidence, provide a framework for the management of pediatric orthopaedic patients during the COVID pandemic. General principles include limiting procedures to urgent cases such as traumatic injuries and deferring outpatient visits during the acute phase of the pandemic. Nonsurgical methods should be considered where possible. For patients with developmental or chronic orthopaedic conditions, it may be possible to delay treatment for 2 to 4 months without substantial detrimental long-term impact.

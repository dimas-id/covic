BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Spontaneous intracranial hypotension can be a therapeutic challenge to the treating physician. In this study, we present our experience with the administration of a large-volume blood patch to multiple sites in the epidural space through a single-catheter access site. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who underwent a large-volume blood patch to multiple sites in the epidural space through a single-catheter access site from 2010 to 2012. Patient demographic data, clinical charts, indications for treatment, radiographic images, procedure notes, and postprocedure hospital course were reviewed. RESULTS Overall, 9 patients were identified who underwent 20 blood patch procedures. Patients were selected to undergo the large-volume procedure either because they had a failed site-directed epidural blood patch or if imaging demonstrated multiple possible leak sites. There were 6 women and 3 men, with an average age of 33.5 years. The mean volume of blood injected per procedure was 54.1 mL (median=55 mL; range=38-70 mL). All patients had an orthostatic headache as one of their presenting symptoms; 22% also presented with neurocognitive decline and behavioral changes; 89% of patients had improvement or resolution of their symptoms; and 80% of patients who had a previously failed site-directed epidural blood or fibrin glue patch improved with a large volume catheter-directed blood patch. CONCLUSIONS Our experience supports the use of a large-volume blood patch to multiple sites in the epidural space through a single-catheter access site for the treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Additionally, our results indicate a role for this procedure in refractory cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

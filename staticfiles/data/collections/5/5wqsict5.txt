This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of coronary arterial profiles from normal dogs (11 animals) and canines (six dogs) with experimental myocardial infarction (MI) induced by ligation of the left coronary artery (LCA). Blood velocity of the LCA and right coronary artery (RCA) were evaluated following transthoracic pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography. The LCA was observed as an infundibular shape, located adjacent to the sinus of Valsalva. The RCA appeared as a tubular structure located 12 o'clock relative to the aorta. In normal dogs, the LCA and RCA mean peak diastolic velocities were 20.84 ± 3.24 and 19.47 ± 2.67 cm/sec, respectively. The LCA and RCA mean diastolic deceleration times were 0.91 ± 0.14 sec and 1.13 ± 0.20 sec, respectively. In dogs with MI, the LCA had significantly (p < 0.01) lower peak velocities (14.82 ± 1.61 cm/sec) than the RCA (31.61 ± 2.34 cm/sec). The RCA had a significantly (p < 0.01) rapid diastolic deceleration time (0.71 ± 0.06 sec) than that found in the LCA (1.02 ± 0.22 sec) of MI dogs. In conclusion, these profiles may serve as a differential factor for evaluating cardiomyopathy in dogs.

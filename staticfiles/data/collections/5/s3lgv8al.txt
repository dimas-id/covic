This chapter describes the use of Cowpea mosaic virus-based vectors for the production of foreign proteins such as antigens and antibodies in plants. The systems include vectors based on both full-length and deleted versions of RNA-2. In both cases, the modified RNA-2 is replicated by coinoculation with RNA-1. The constructs based on full-length RNA-2 retain the ability to spread systemically throughout an inoculated plant and the infection can be passaged. The vector based on a deleted version of RNA-2 can stably incorporate larger inserts but lacks the ability to move systemically. However, it has the added advantage of biocontainment. In both cases, vector constructs modified to contain a foreign gene of interest can be delivered by agroinfiltration to obtain transient expression of the foreign protein. If required, the same constructs can also be used for stable nuclear transformation. Both types of vector have proved effective for the production in plants of a diverse range of proteins including antigens and antibodies.

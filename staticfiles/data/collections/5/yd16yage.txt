INTRODUCTION Antibiotics are frequently prescribed to children in the community and in nosocomial settings, mainly because of lower respiratory tract infections(LRTIs), which include influenza, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, in addition to bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis lung disease. It is important to note, however, that more than 50% of these prescriptions are unnecessary or inappropriate. AREAS COVERED The current choice of antimicrobial therapy for etiological agents of LRTIs is examined and discussed considering each type of LRTI. EXPERT OPINION There is a clear need for the appropriate utilization of antibiotics in children. Therefore, accurate drug selection and choice of best dosage and duration of the antibacterial treatment are important to optimize the treatment of LRTIs. It's fundamental to bear in mind that children differ from adults in how LRTIs manifest and evolve not only because of the diversity in the immunological profiles but also the fundamental age-related differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs. Since comprehensive antibiotic guideline recommendations for the treatment of pediatric LRTIs are generally lacking, there is an undeniable need for the introduction of pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programmes in both community and hospital settings.

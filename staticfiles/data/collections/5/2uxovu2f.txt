Rectal swabs were collected from 147 household dogs and 35 household cats, including healthy animals, animals with gastrointestinal signs and animals with a variety of medical and surgical conditions. A combination of selective culture methods was used to optimise the recovery of Campylobacter species, and a PCR was used to confirm their isolation and to identify the species. The overall prevalence of Campylobacter species was 42.9 per cent in the cats and 41.5 per cent in the dogs. Campylobacter upsaliensis was the species most commonly isolated from the dogs and cats, and Campylobacter jejuni was the second most commonly isolated. Particularly high prevalences were detected in the few cats and dogs with diarrhoea, and in the cats and dogs that were six months old or younger.

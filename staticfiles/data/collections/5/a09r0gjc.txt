During a pandemic, a national government is often considered solely responsible for dealing with the outbreak with local-based policies. A whole-of-society approach to a pandemic is evidence-based and used successfully in countries with a history of pandemic infections. This collaborative approach assumes that no single entity has the capacity to successfully manage the dynamic, complex problems that arise in a pandemic environment. Application of the whole-of-society model globally would provide a more harmonious and concerted response with mutual and synergistic benefits to all affected nations. Central entities within the model include; Civil society, business and government. These are addressed at the community, local government and sub-national level. Nine essential services are also identified including Health, defence, Law & order, Finance, Transport, Telecommunication, Energy, Food and Water. A continuing cycle of readiness, response and recovery of services encapsulates this model. Pandemics affect the whole of the world, a global whole-ofsociety approach is therefore needed to tackle them.

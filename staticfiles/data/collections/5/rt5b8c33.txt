UNLABELLED Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare complication that presents with transient neurologic deficits and is caused by neurotoxicity of intravascular contrast media. The prognosis can be extremely favorable even in comatose patients. We reported a 76-year-old woman admitted for scheduled coronary angiography. The total amount of Optiray contrast media used was 150 mL. Immediately after the procedure, the patient developed consciousness disturbance, global aphasia, cortical blindness and right-sided weakness. CIE was diagnosed by computed tomography and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging. The patient recovered completely within 48 hours without any neurological deficits.

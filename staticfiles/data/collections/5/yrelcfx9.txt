COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 manifests as a range of symptoms. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for immuno-pathogenesis of disease is important for treatment and management of COVID-19. We examined host transcriptomes in moderate and severe COVID-19 cases with a view to identifying pathways that affect its progression. RNA extracted from whole blood of COVID-19 cases was analysed by microarray analysis. Moderate and severe cases were compared with healthy controls and differentially regulated genes (DEGs) categorized into cellular pathways. DEGs in COVID-19 cases were mostly related to host immune activation and cytokine signaling, pathogen uptake, host defenses, blood and vasculature genes, and SARS-CoV-2- and other virus- affected pathways. The DEGs in these pathways were increased in severe compared with moderate cases. In a severe COVID-19 patient with an unfavourable outcome we observed dysregulation of genes in platelet homeostasis and cardiac conduction and fibrin clotting with disease progression.

One of the main neutrino oscillation parameters whose value has not been determined very precisely is the leptonic $\delta_{CP}$ phase. Since neutrinos have a tiny but finite mass they can undergo decay both visibly and invisibly. The effect of invisible decay of the third mass eigen state $\nu_3$ on the sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ is analysed here using atmospheric neutrino and anti-neutrino events. Effects of detector resolutions and systematic uncertainties are studied to identify the optimum resolutions and efficiencies required by a detector to obtain a significant sensitivity even in presence of decay.

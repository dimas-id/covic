Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes watery diarrhea and induces proinflammatory cytokine responses in piglets Our previous research showed that the specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks exhibited mild diarrhea and low fecal viral shedding, along with cecum lesions after PDCoV infection Disturbances in the homeostasis of the gut microbiota have been associated with various diseases We aimed to explore the effects of PDCoV infection on chick gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) production, and inflammatory cytokine expression in chicks, and also to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and SCFAs or inflammatory cytokine expression of the PDCoV-infected chicks Results obtained using 16S rRNA sequencing showed that infection with PDCoV strain HNZK-02 significantly altered the composition of chick gut microbiota, with the reduced abundance of Eisenbergiella and Anaerotruncus genera at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) (P 0 05), and an increased abundance of Alistipes genus at 17 dpi (P 0 05) The production of SCFAs in the cecum of PDCoV HNZK-02-infected chicks, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, decreased in all cases The expression of inflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-10) was increased in the cecum tissue and serum of the PDCoV HNZK-02-infected chicks when detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively Further analysis showed significant correlation between bacterial genera and SCFAs or inflammatory cytokines expression in cecum of the PDCoV infected chicks These findings might provide new insight into the pathology and physiology of PDCoV in chicks

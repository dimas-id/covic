Infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation. It has been estimated that 70% of kidney transplant recipients will experience an infection episode within the first 3 years after transplantation (Dharnidharka et al. 2007). After cardiovascular disease, infection is the second leading cause of death in recipients with allograft function (Snyder et al. 2009). The immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent organ rejection places the kidney transplant recipient at increased risk for donor-derived, nosocomial, and community-acquired infections as well as reactivation of latent pathogens. Pretransplant screening, immunizations, and optimal antibacterial and antiviral prophylaxis can help to reduce the impact of infection. Awareness of the approach to infection in the transplant recipient including diagnostic and management strategies is essential to optimizing outcomes.

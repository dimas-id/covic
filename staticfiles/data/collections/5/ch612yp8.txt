ABSTRACT The set of measures proposed by SEPD, AEEH, GETECCU and AEG are aimed to help departments in their resumption of usual activity. We have prepared a number of practical recommendations regarding patient management and the stepwise resumption of healthcare activity. These recommendations are based on the sparse, changing evidence available, and will be updated in the future according to daily needs and the availability of expendable materials to suit them; in each department they will be implemented depending upon the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in each region, and the burden the pandemic has represented for each hospital. The general objectives of these recommendations include: To protect our patients against the risks of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to provide them with high-quality care. To protect all healthcare professionals against the risks of infection with SARS-CoV-2.To resume normal functioning of our departments in a setting of ongoing risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2.

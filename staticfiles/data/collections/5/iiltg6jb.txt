We present the case of a 20-year-old male patient without previous history of cardiovascular disease who was admitted to our hospital with a new onset febrile sensation and chest pain. Chest computed tomography revealed a subpleural consolidation with a halo of ground-glass opacification. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of markers of myocyte necrosis (troponin I and creatine kinase-MB). Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19. Cardiac MRI showed myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement compatible with myocarditis associated with COVID-19 infection. This case showed that acute myocarditis can be the initial presentation of patients with COVID-19 infection.

An 11-year-old male dog was presented with a 1-week history of inappetence, weight loss and hind limb paralysis. Physical examination revealed weakness, depression, incoordination of the posterior limbs, peripheral lymphadenopathy and pale mucous membranes. Laboratory analysis of blood samples revealed anaemia, thrombocytopenia and low serum albumin concentration. The diagnosis was confirmed microscopically, by demonstrating the presence of Hepatozoon canis gametocytes within neutrophils in Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears and bone marrow smear. Also, schizonts of H. canis were seen in tissue sections of muscles, lymph nodes, spleen and liver. To the best of authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first description of H. canis infection in a dog in Iran.

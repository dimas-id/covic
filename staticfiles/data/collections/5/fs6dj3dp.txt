During the past 20 years, the history and development of infectious disease genomics are tightly associated with the Human Genome Project (HGP). It has been emphasized since the beginning of the HGP that such effort must not be restricted to the human genome and should include other organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm for comparative sequence analyses. A brief history is reviewed in this chapter. Currently, nearly 6000 genome sequencing projects have been reported. The majority of the more than 1000 completed genomes are bacterial sequences (>80%). An important motivation for these efforts is to develop preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies through the analysis of sequenced microorganisms, parasites, and vectors related to human health. A few examples are discussed in this chapter.

COVID-19, the illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the deadliest pandemic to occur in this century. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, myalgia, fever, chest pain, and headache. However, its clinical presentation ranges from completely asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome.[1] Pregnant women are susceptible to community spread of COVID-19 because they cannot postpone interactions with healthcare professionals and other women receiving obstetric care.

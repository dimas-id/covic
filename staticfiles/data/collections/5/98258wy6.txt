The acute and convalescent sera from 14 schoolchildren with acute hepatitis A were tested for antibody changes to 70 viral antigens. Marked decreases were noted in the levels of antibody to cytomegalovirus in 5 of the 14 children and in the levels of antibody to herpesvirus type 1 in 3. No such changes were noted in 9 sex‐ and age‐matched healthy control children from the same classes.

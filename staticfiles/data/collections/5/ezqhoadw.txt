INTRODUCTION Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and ultimately fatal lung disease. One of the risk factors involved in the acquisition of IPF is viral infections, especially respiratory viruses. In the present study, we investigated the detection of respiratory viruses and the possible relationship between these viruses and IPF. METHODS This cross-sectional study was supported by the Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Tehran, Iran. A total of 40 respiratory samples (five nasopharyngeal and 35 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) were obtained from IPF patients referred to IUMS hospitals between April 2015 and December 2016. Assays were performed using the CLART Pneumovir DNA array assay, which made it possible to detect five genera of respiratory viruses simultaneously.Results/Key findings. Altogether, 22 of the 40 participants were male. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, rhino, corona and influenza viruses were found in 2.5 % (1/40), 7.5 % (3/40), 10 % (4/40), 2.5 % (1/40) and 0% (0/40) of cases, respectively. CONCLUSION Determining a correlation between the viruses and IPF is not an easy task, and therefore, this will require more research. In addition, the CLART Pneumovir DNA array can be considered as a useful method for simultaneous detection of several viral respiratory infections.

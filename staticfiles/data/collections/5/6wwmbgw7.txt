Remdesivir is a novel therapeutic with known activity against SARS CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. Remdesivir, as well as convalescent plasma therapy, are currently under investigation as potential therapies for patients with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). In this case report we summarize the use of convalescent plasma therapy and then remdesivir as a late addition in the treatment of a critically ill obstetric patient with COVID-19. The patient subsequently improved, was extubated 5â¯days after initiation of remdesivir, was transitioned to room air 24â¯h later, and discharged at the completion of remdesivir therapy.

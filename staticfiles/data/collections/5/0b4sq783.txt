We used molecular analyses to confirm Mycobacterium avium spp. hominissuis infection in lung granulomas and pyogranulomas in the tracheobronchial lymph node in a wild mule deer in Banff, Canada. These lesions are similar to those found in M. bovis-infected animals, emphasizing the critical need for disease surveillance in wildlife populations.

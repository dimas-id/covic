PURPOSE To assess the safety of intravenously administered gadolinium-based contrast material in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS All pediatric and adult SCD patients evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at our institution between January 1995 and July 2009 were identified. The medical records of SCD patients who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI as well as an equal-sized cohort of SCD patients who underwent unenhanced MRI were reviewed for adverse (vaso-occlusive and hemolytic) events within 1 week following imaging. RESULTS Eight (five mild and three moderate) adverse events were documented within 1 week following contrast-enhanced MRI (38 patients and 61 contrast injections), while six (five mild and one moderate) similar events occurred within 1 week following unenhanced MRI (61 patients and 61 unenhanced MRI examinations). This difference in the number of adverse events was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4, 5.2). No severe adverse event occurred in either patient cohort. CONCLUSION Gadolinium-based contrast materials do not appear to be associated with increased risk of vaso-occlusive or hemolytic adverse events when administered to SCD patients. Larger, prospective studies using multiple gadolinium-based contrast materials would be useful to confirm the results of our investigation.

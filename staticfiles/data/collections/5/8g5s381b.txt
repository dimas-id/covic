Serologic virus neutralization tests, indirect immunofluorescence tests, and ELISA, using tissue culture-adapted feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) or feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) were compared for their ability to distinguish specific virus exposure in cats. Sera of specific-pathogen-free cats inoculated with virulent or modified FIPV or FECV were used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the homologous assays to a heterologous assay that measures antibody reactivity with transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine. The geometric means of the serologic titers in FIPV and FECV assays were higher for FIPV- or FECV-infected specific-pathogen-free cats than the geometric means of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus assays for most groups. None of the assays was specific enough to discern the virus to which a cat had been exposed. However, the FIPV virus neutralization test appeared to be more sensitive for detection of an early response to FIPV infection than did the FIPV immunofluorescence test or FIPV-ELISA.

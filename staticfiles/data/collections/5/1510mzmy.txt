Abstract The clinical presentation and mortality rate in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients with COVID-19 are not well established. Recent data from Italy and Spain suggest that these patients present with wide range of symptoms, with a significant portion being asymptomatic. There is prolonged positivity of pharyngeal swabs in MHD patients. The mortality rates are very high, reaching almost 30%. These data highlight the importance of diligent oversight and care of MHD patients during COVID-19 pandemic.

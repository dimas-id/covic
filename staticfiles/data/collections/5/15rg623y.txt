The synthesis of novel pyrazolylnucleosides 3a–e, 4a–e, 5a–e, and 6a–e are described. The structures of the regioisomers were elucidated by using extensive NMR studies. The pyrazolylnucleosides 5a–e and 6a–e were screened for anticancer activities on sixty human tumor cell lines. The compound 6e showed good activity against 39 cancer cell lines. In particular, it showed significant inhibition against the lung cancer cell line Hop-92 (GI(50) 9.3 µM) and breast cancer cell line HS 578T (GI(50) 3.0 µM).

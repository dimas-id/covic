Purified coronavirus, detergent extracts of purified coronavirus, and virus-infected Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells were evaluated as antigen substrates in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and passive hemagglutination systems. Only detergent-extracted and -unextracted, purified viruses were reactive as antigen substrates in ELISA, whereas all three antigen preparations could be used for sensitization of erythrocytes in the passive hemagglutination assay. The passive hemagglutination system with infected cell extracts exhibited a similar level of sensitivity and specificity to the ELISA system employing purified coronavirus but enabled 300 times more tests to be performed per volume of virus-infected cell culture.

Advanced techniques in the field of diagnostic microbiology have made amazing progress over the past 25 years due largely to a technological revolution in the molecular aspects of microbiology [1, 2]. In particular, rapid molecular methods for nucleic acid amplification and characterization combined with automation in the clinical microbiology laboratory as well as user-friendly software and robust laboratory informatics systems have significantly broadened the diagnostic capabilities of modern clinical microbiology laboratories. Molecular methods such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) rapidly are being developed and introduced in the clinical laboratory setting [3, 4]. Indeed, every section of the clinical microbiology laboratory, including bacteriology, mycology, mycobacteriology, parasitology, and virology, has benefited from these advanced techniques. Because of the rapid development and adaptation of these molecular techniques, the interpretation and relevance of the results produced by such molecular methods continues to lag behind. The purpose of this chapter is to review, update, and discuss the interpretation and relevance of results produced by these advanced molecular techniques.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Prognostication tools that predict good outcome in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions after endovascular therapy are lacking. We aim to develop a tool that incorporates clinical and imaging data to predict outcomes after endovascular therapy. METHODS In a derivation cohort of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke patients treated with endovascular therapy within 8 hours from time last seen well (n=247), we performed logistic regression to identify independent predictors of good outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale, 0-2). Factors were weighted based on β-coefficients to derive the Pittsburgh Outcomes After Stroke Thrombectomy (POST) score. POST was validated in an institutional endovascular database (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, n=393) and the Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study-2 (DEFUSE-2) data set (n=105), as well as in patients treated beyond 8 hours (n=194) and in octogenarians (n=111). RESULTS In the derivation cohort, independent predictors (P<0.1) of good outcome included 24- to 72-hour final infarct volume (in cm(3), P<0.001), age (years, P<0.001), and parenchymal hematoma types 1 and 2 (H, P=0.01). POST was calculated as age+0.5×final infarct volume+15×H. Patients with POST score <60 had a 91% chance of good outcome compared with 4% with POST score ≥120. POST accurately predicted good outcomes in the derivation (area under the curve [AUC]=0.85) and validation cohorts (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, AUC=0.81; DEFUSE-2, AUC=0.86), as well as in patients treated beyond 8 hours (AUC, 0.85) and octogenarians (AUC=0.76). POST had better predictive accuracy for good and poor outcome than the ischemic stroke predictive risk score (iSCORE). CONCLUSIONS POST score is a validated predictor of outcome in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions after endovascular therapy.

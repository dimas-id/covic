BACKGROUND Nearly half of elderly patients with hip fracture were malnourished, indicated with a serum marker of hypoalbuminemia. Malnutrition was a risk factor for poor outcomes in geriatrics after hip replacement. The purpose of this study was to investigate if oral nutritional supplementation after the procedure in geriatrics with hypoalbuminemia was beneficial for outcomes. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of older (≥ 65 years old) patients suffering femoral neck fracture and undergoing hip replacement with hypoalbuminemia was conducted. Outcomes were compared between patients with and without postoperative nutritional supplementation. RESULTS There were 306 geriatric patients met the criteria. Following adjustment for baseline characteristics, patients with nutritional supplementation showed a lower grade of wound effusion with adjusted OR 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36 to 0.91, P < 0.05). And also a lower rate of surgical site infection (5.5% compared with 13.0% [adjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.91, P < 0.05]), periprosthetic joint infection (2.8% compared with 9.9% [adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.79, P < 0.05]), and 30 days readmission (2.1% compared with 8.7% [adjusted OR 0.22, 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.79, P < 0.05]). The average total hospital stay was longer in patients without nutritional supplementation (10.7 ± 2.0 compared with 9.2 ± 1.8 days, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that postoperative nutritional supplementation is a protective factor for surgical site infection, periprosthetic joint infection, and 30-days readmission in geriatric with hypoalbuminemia undergoing a hip replacement. Postoperative nutritional supplementation for these patients should be recommended.

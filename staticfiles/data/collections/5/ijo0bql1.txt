BACKGROUND AND AIMS In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement under sedation often causes apnea or hypoventilation. The aim of the present study was to assess whether unsedated PEG placement in ALS patients using ultrathin endoscopy (UTE) via the transoral route can improve safety. METHODS Between 2003 and 2013, PEG placement was identified and reviewed in 45 patients with ALS. PEG was performed in 14 patients using transoral UTE without sedation (UTE group), 17 patients using conventional normal-diameter esophagogastroduodenoscopy (C-EGD) without sedation (unsedated C-EGD group) and 14 patients using C-EGD with sedation (sedated C-EGD group). We compared the clinical features, cardiopulmonary data before and during PEG placement, and complications related to PEG placement among the three groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age, male/female ratio, forced vital capacity, blood pressure, oxygen saturation before and during PEG, or major complications among the three groups. No minor complications were observed in the UTE group, whereas apnea and/or hypoventilation were observed in the sedated C-EGD group and aspiration pneumonia was observed in the unsedated C-EGD group. CONCLUSIONS Unsedated PEG placement using transoral UTE in ALS patients is a safe method.

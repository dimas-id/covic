We compared the proliferation and differentiation of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cell line on single layer graphene and glass substrates. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cell proliferation and differentiation were performed, considering also the effect of a common adhesion factor, namely polylysine. We observed that on graphene substrates the cells proliferate faster with respect to glass; additionally, the presence of the adhesion factor enhances the difference and, remarkably, boosts the cell differentiation on the graphene-based interface. To understand the mechanism underlying a different cell behavior on the same adhesion coating, we carried out a physicochemical investigation of the studied interfaces (glass and graphene, bare and polylysine coated) by several techniques. In particular, we employed infrared spectroscopy to gain information on polylysine conformation, and atomic force microscopy force-distance curves to study adhesion properties at the surface. The results indicate that polylysine has an enhanced binding affinity for graphene, as well as a different molecular arrangement on graphene with respect to glass. These properties act as surface cues to trigger the cell response.

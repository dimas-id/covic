Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an avian oncogenic retrovirus that has led to severe economic losses in the poultry industry in China in recent years. The pathogenesis of virus infection and virus-host interactions are still not well elucidated. In this paper, we investigated the expression changes for cellular proteins in DF-1 cells infected with ALV-J. Comparative analyses revealed that the majority of the altered proteins in DF-1 cells appeared at 6-12h after ALV-J infection. Mass spectrometry identified 74 altered cellular proteins, including 30 up-regulated proteins and 44 down-regulated proteins. Some of these proteins are involved in cell cytoskeleton, metabolic processes, response to stimulus and immune responses. Other proteins, such as DJ-1, UCHL1, VDAC1 and HMGB1, have some relationship to apoptosis or oncogenesis. The changes in the transcriptional profile of DJ-1, UCHL1, VDAC1 and HMGB1 in infected as compared to uninfected DF-1 cells were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Our work gives some information about differential protein expression in cells infected with ALV-J, which will help us to understand viral pathogenicity.

γδ T cells are a subset of nonconventional T cells that play a critical role in bridging the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. γδ T cells are particularly abundant in ruminant species and may constitute up to 60% of the circulating lymphocyte pool in young cattle. The frequency of circulating γδ T cells is highest in neonatal calves and declines as the animal ages, suggesting these cells may be particularly important in the immune system of the very young. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a significant cause of respiratory infection in calves, and is most severe in animals under one year of age. BRSV is also a significant factor in the development of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is closely related to BRSV and a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children worldwide. BRSV infection in calves shares striking similarities with RSV infection in human infants. To date, there have been few studies defining the role of γδ T cells in the immune response to BRSV or RSV infection in animals or humans, respectively. However, emerging evidence suggests that γδ T cells may play a critical role in the early recognition of infection and in shaping the development of the adaptive immune response through inflammatory chemokine and cytokine production. Further, while it is clear that γδ T cells accumulate in the lungs during BRSV and RSV infection, their role in protection vs. immunopathology remains unclear. This review will summarize what is currently known about the role of γδ T cells in the immune response to BRSV and BRDC in cattle, and where appropriate, draw parallels to the role of γδ T cells in the human response to RSV infection.

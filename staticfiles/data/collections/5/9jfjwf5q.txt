The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered for the first time in Saudi Arabia in 2012. On a global scale 1200 infections have been registered with approximately 50 % resulting in a fatal outcome. It is currently not fully clear how MERS-CoV is transmitted and insufficient research has so far been carried out. Taking the sudden increase of cases in South Korea into consideration, this article discusses which preventive measures should be recommended for international travelers in order to prevent infections. A literature search of the most recent publications indicated that appropriate standard hygiene measures are sufficient and no travel restrictions are therefore necessary.

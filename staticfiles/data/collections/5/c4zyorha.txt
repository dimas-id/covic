Abstract Proteins have highly conserved domains that determine their functionality. Out of the thousands of domains discovered so far across all living forms, some of the predominant clinically-relevant domains include IENR1, HNHc, HELICc, Pro-kuma_activ, Tryp_SPc, Lactamase_B, PbH1, ChtBD3, CBM49, acidPPc, G3P_acyltransf, RPOL8c, KbaA, HAMP, HisKA, Hr1, Dak2, APC2, Citrate_ly_lig, DALR, VKc, YARHG, WR1, PWI, ZnF_BED, TUDOR, MHC_II_beta, Integrin_B_tail, Excalibur, DISIN, Cadherin, ACTIN, PROF, Robl_LC7, MIT, Kelch, GAS2, B41, Cyclin_C, Connexin_CCC, OmpH, Bac_rhodopsin, AAA, Knot1, NH, Galanin, IB, Elicitin, ACTH, Cache_2, CHASE, AgrB, PRP, IGR, and Antimicrobial21. These domains are distributed in nucleases/helicases, proteases, esterases, lipases, glycosylase, GTPases, phosphatases, methyltransferases, acyltransferase, acetyltransferase, polymerase, kinase, ligase, synthetase, oxidoreductase, protease inhibitors, nucleic acid binding proteins, adhesion and immunity-related proteins, cytoskeletal component-manipulating proteins, lipid biosynthesis and metabolism proteins, membrane-associated proteins, hormone-like and signaling proteins, etc. These domains are ubiquitous stretches or folds of the proteins in pathogens and allergens. Pathogenesis alleviation efforts can benefit enormously if the characteristics of these domains are known. Hence, this review catalogs and discusses the role of such pivotal domains, suggesting hypotheses for better understanding of pathogenesis at molecular level.

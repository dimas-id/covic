The anti-virus and anti-bacteria active components were extracted from some Chinese medicine, such as the honeysuckle, forsythia and the licorice. Using a w/o/w emulsion method, the active components were fabricated to uniform particulate microcapsule with sustained-release properties. The polypropylene punched felt was finished with the finishing agent of microcapsule, nano ZnO and TiO(2) and polymer adhesive, and the composite air filter with anti-virus and anti-bacteria properties were formed, staphylococcus aureus, colibacillus and candida albicans were applied to antibacterial experiments. The results indicate that the anti-bacteria rate are all 100%, and the virus inactivation rate also reaches 100% to pandemic influenza A virus.

The mechanisms of calicivirus attachment and internalization are not well understood, mainly due to the lack of a reliable cell-culture system for most of its members. In this study, rabbit vesivirus (RaV) virions were shown to bind annexin A2 (ANXA2) in a membrane protein fraction from HEK293T cells, using a virus overlay protein-binding assay and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. A monoclonal anti-ANXA2 antibody and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ANXA2 expression in HEK293T cells reduced virus infection significantly, further supporting the role of ANXA2 in RaV attachment and/or internalization.

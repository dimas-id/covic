Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) poses a major threat to the chicken industry worldwide. In this study, we developed a recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) vaccine expressing the IBV S1 gene and chicken interleukin-18 gene (IL-18), rFPV-S1/IL18. Recombinant plasmid pSY-S1/IL18 was constructed by cloning chicken IL-18 into fowlpox virus transfer plasmid containing S1 gene and transfected into the chicken embryo fibroblasts cell pre-infected with S-FPV-017 to generate rFPV-S1/IL18. Expression of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by RT-PCR and IFA. We also constructed the recombinant fowlpox virus rFPV-S1 without IL-18. One-day-old chickens were vaccinated by wing-web puncture with the two rFPVs, and the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated. There was a significant difference in ELISA antibody levels (P < 0.05) elicited by either rFPV-S1 or rFPV-S1/IL18. The ratios of CD4(+) to CD8(+) in chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in those immunized with rFPV-S1. All chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were completely protected (20/20) after challenge with the virulent IBV HN99 strain 43 days after immunization, while only 15 out of 20 of the chickens immunized with the rFPV-S1 were protected. Our results show that the protective efficacy of the rFPV-S1 vaccine could be enhanced significantly by simultaneous expression of IL-18.

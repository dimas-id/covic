Abstract: Quantitative microbiological risk assessment has hitherto been predominantly used for risks from exposure to bacteria. This chapter examines the requirements for full quantitative risk assessments for food- and waterborne viruses, and the interpretation and extrapolation of risk assessment outcomes. Future trends in quantitative risk assessment research for viruses are considered.

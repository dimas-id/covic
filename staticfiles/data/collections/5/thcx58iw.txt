Objectives- The prediction of patients at risk for poor clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke remains challenging. An imbalance of coagulation factors may play an important role in progression and prognosis of these patients. In this systematic review, we assessed the current literature on hemostasis biomarkers and the association with poor clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke. Approach and Results- A systematic search of Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed on studies reporting on hemostasis biomarkers and clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke. Studies were considered eligible if blood samples were collected within 72 hours after symptom onset. Additionally, clinical outcome should be assessed using a disability score (Barthel Index or modified Rankin scale). Methodological quality of included studies was assessed with an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies questionnaire. A total of 80 articles were read full text, and 41 studies were considered eligible for inclusion, reporting on 37 different hemostasis biomarkers. No single biomarker appeared to be effective in predicting poor clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients. Conclusions- Based on current literature, no clear recommendations can be provided on which hemostasis biomarkers are a predictor of clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke. However, some biomarkers show promising results and need to be further investigated and validated in large populations with clear defined study designs.

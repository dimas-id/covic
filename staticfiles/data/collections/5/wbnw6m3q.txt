The effects of hypoxic, hyperoxic, and hypoxic-hyperoxic preconditioning were examined in the prospective study on narcotized and artificially ventilated rabbits. Under artificial circulation, acute myocardial ischemia was modeled by ligation of anterior descending coronary artery, which was followed by reperfusion. The degree of ventricular arrhythmias was assessed, and the ischemic area was evaluated in percent of the area at risk. Microscopic characterization of the myocardium was employed to assess the cardioprotective effect of hypoxic and/or hyperoxic preconditioning. According to Kruskal-Wallis test, the greatest resistance of the myocardium to ischemic and reperfusion injury was observed after hypoxic-hyperoxic preconditioning (H=42.459; p=0.009). The rabbits subjected to this type of preconditioning demonstrated the least damaged myocardium in comparison with nonconditioned controls.

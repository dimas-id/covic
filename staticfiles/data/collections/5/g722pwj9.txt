CASE REPORT: Metaphyseal osteopathy (MO) was diagnosed in three Australian Kelpie puppies that were presented for veterinary assessment of lameness. The three puppies were siblings. Each was from a different litter by the same breeding pair. The puppy in case one was seen by the authors, and the puppies in cases two and three were patients at other veterinary hospitals. However, the medical records and radiographs were examined and reviewed for this report. Radiographic investigation of the lameness revealed pathognomonic appearance of MO affecting the metaphyseal region of the long bones in all three puppies. The diagnosis was confirmed on histopathology in one patient. CONCLUSION: MO is considered a disease of large and giant‐breed dogs, being rarely reported in non‐large‐breed dogs, and has not been reported in the Australian Kelpie, which is considered a medium‐breed dog. This case series suggests a previously unreported breed predisposition to MO in the Australian Kelpie.

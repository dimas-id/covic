Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication depends on the translation machinery of the host cell; therefore, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) gene family is a likely candidate for control of viral replication. We hypothesized that differential expression of host genes related to translation and innate immune response could contribute to differential resistance to NDV in inbred Fayoumi and Leghorn lines. The expression of twenty-one genes related to the interferon signaling pathway and the eIF2 family was evaluated at two- and six-days post infection (dpi) in the spleen from both lines, either challenged by NDV or nonchallenged. Higher expression of OASL in NDV challenged versus nonchallenged spleen was observed in Leghorns at 2 dpi. Lower expression of EIF2B5 was found in NDV challenged than nonchallenged Fayoumis and Leghorns at 2 dpi. At 2 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2B5 and EIF2S3 than NDV challenged Leghorns. At 6 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2S3 and EIF2B4 than NDV challenged Leghorns. The genetic line differences in expression of eIF2-related genes may contribute to their differential resistance to NDV and also to understanding the interaction between protein synthesis shut-off and virus control in chickens.

In this chapter, we present two optimization models for optimizing the epidemic-logistics network. In the first one, we formulate the problem of emergency materials distribution with time windows to be a multiple traveling salesman problem. Knowledge of graph theory is used to transform the MTSP to be a TSP, then such TSP route is analyzed and proved to be the optimal Hamilton route theoretically. Besides, a new hybrid genetic algorithm is designed for solving the problem. In the second one, we propose an improved location-allocation model with an emphasis on maximizing the emergency service level. We formulate the problem to be a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and develop an effective algorithm to solve the model.

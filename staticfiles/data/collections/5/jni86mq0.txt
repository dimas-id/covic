Covid-19 represents one of the largest challenges in the recent history of public health. It is fundamental that we strengthen scientific cooperation under a common goal: to protect the health of the population. In this article, we present ideas that need urgent and collaborative efforts. We discuss the estimation of the magnitude of the epidemic through a nationwide seroprevalence panel, as well as new strategies to monitor the epidemic in real time. We also analyze the negative externalities associated to the pandemic. Finally, we present a general framework to develop ideas to come out of the lockdown, highlighting the importance of implementing sustainable and equitable structural interventions. We call for solidarity and cooperation, focusing our efforts and creativity in the resolution of the problems that currently affect Mexico and the world.

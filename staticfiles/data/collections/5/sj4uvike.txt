The spatial separation of DNA replication and gene transcription in the nucleus and protein translation in the cytoplasm is a uniform principle of eukaryotic cells. This compartmentalization imposes a requirement for a transport network of macromolecules to shuttle these components in and out of the nucleus. This nucleo‐cytoplasmic transport of macromolecules is critical for both cell physiology and pathology. Consequently, investigating its regulation and disease‐associated alterations can reveal novel therapeutic approaches to fight human diseases, such as cancer or viral infection. The characterization of the nuclear pore complex, the identification of transport signals and transport receptors, as well as the characterization of the Ran system (providing the energy source for efficient cargo transport) has greatly facilitated our understanding of the components, mechanisms and regulation of the nucleo‐cytoplasmic transport of proteins in our cells. Here we review this knowledge with a specific emphasis on the selection of disease‐relevant molecular targets for potential therapeutic intervention.

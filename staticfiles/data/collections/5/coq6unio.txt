Severe pediatric burns require a multidisciplinary team approach at a specialized pediatric burn center. Special attention must be paid to estimations of total body surface area, fluid resuscitation and metabolic demands, and adequate analgesia and sedation. Long-term effects involve scar management and psychosocial support to the child and their family. Compassionate comprehensive burn care is accomplished by a multidisciplinary team offering healing in the acute setting and preparing the child and family for long-term treatment and care.

Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) had been used for many gynecologic surgeries without pelvic adhesions. We report a 30-year-old female with multiple abdominal adhesions underwent NOTES hysterectomy successfully. A 30-year-old female (para 2, gravida 3, abortus 1) presented with menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. She had multiple abdominal surgical histories. Computed tomography scan revealed multiple adhesions between the abdominal wall and small intestine. On pelvic ultrasonography, an enlarged uterus 8.3 cm Ã— 3.5 cm with adenomyosis was visualized. Because of the extensive intra-abdominal adhesions, we decided to use a transvaginal NOTES approach to perform hysterectomy. We performed the surgery successfully without complication. Pathological examination confirmed adenomyosis of uterus. NOTES hysterectomy may be feasibly and safely performed in gynecologic patients with extensive abdominal adhesions.

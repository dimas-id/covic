A 71-year-old female patient with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 had previously discontinued interferon (IFN)-α plus ribavirin therapy, pegylated IFN-α (pegIFN-α) monotherapy, and natural IFN-α monotherapy because of arrhythmia, interstitial pneumonia, and severe neurovegetative symptoms. She subsequently completed 72 weeks of natural IFN-β plus ribavirin therapy without remarkable adverse effects and achieved a sustained viral response, suggesting differences in the pharmacological properties and biological effects of IFN-α and IFN-β. Thus, natural IFN-β plus ribavirin therapy may be a treatment option for patients with poor tolerance to IFN-α or pegIFN-α treatments.

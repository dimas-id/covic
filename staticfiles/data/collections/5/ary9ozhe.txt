BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES We compared the perioperative outcomes of hysterectomy performed by robotic (RH) versus laparoscopic (LH) routes for benign indications using the Dindo-Clavien scale for classification of the surgical complications. METHODS Retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent robotic (n=288) and laparoscopic (n=257) hysterectomies by minimally invasive surgeons at the University of Michigan from March 2001 until June 2010. RESULTS Age, body mass index, operative time, and estimated blood loss were not statistically different between groups. The RH subgroup had a larger uterine weight (LH 186.4±130.6 g vs RH 234.9±193.9 g, P=.001), higher prevalence of severe adhesions (13.2% vs 23.3%, respectively, P=.003), and stage III-IV endometriosis (4.7% vs 15.3%, respectively, P<.05). There were no differences in the rates of Dindo-Clavien grade I, grade II, and grade III surgical complications between the RH and LH groups (9.7%, 13.2%, and 3.1%, respectively, in the RH group vs 6.2%, 9.3%, and 5.8%, respectively, in the LH group, P>.05). However, the rates of urinary tract infection were higher in the RH group (LH 2.7% vs RH 6.9%, P=.02), whereas the conversion to laparotomy rate was higher in the LH group (LH 6.2% vs RH 1.7%, P=.007). CONCLUSIONS Perioperative outcomes for laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy for benign indications appear to be equivalent.

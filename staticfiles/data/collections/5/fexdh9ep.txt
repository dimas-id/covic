Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the first cause of mortality due to nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit. Its incidence ranges from 9% to 67% of patients on mechanical ventilation. Risk factors are multiple and are associated with prolonged stays in hospital and intensive care units. Additional costs for each episode of VAP range from 9,000 euro to 31,000 euro. Thus, its prevention should be considered as a priority. This prevention could decrease associated morbidity, mortality, costs, and increase patient safety.

BACKGROUND Epidemiological studies have identified obesity as a major risk factor for cancer in humans, and trials have demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of cancer after bariatric surgery. The rapidity of weight loss after bariatric surgery provides an opportunity to identify the molecular changes associated with effective obesity treatment. Indirectly, this may provide some insights into the mechanisms that drive the association between obesity and cancer. We sought to measure circulating cancer-associated proteins before and after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS We prospectively enrolled 15 patients undergoing LSG. Thirty-four plasma protein biomarkers thought to be associated with cancer processes were analyzed at baseline and following successful weight loss at 12 weeks using a multiplex bead-based assay. RESULTS Mean excess body weight loss was 44 % at 12-week follow-up. After LSG, a significant reduction in circulating plasma levels was observed for half (17/34) of the proteins assessed: VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, endoglin, PLGF, sFASL, IGFBP-1, IL-18, prolactin, EGF, TGFα, sCD40L, IL-18, TNFα, IL-6, HB-EGF, and PAI-1. Nonsignificant decreases were found for the remaining proteins. CONCLUSIONS Circulating cancer-related biomarker levels were reduced by surgical weight loss, and this benefit was achieved as early as 3 months after operation. The observed reduction in cancer biomarkers may be related to the reported decrease in cancer incidence following bariatric surgery.

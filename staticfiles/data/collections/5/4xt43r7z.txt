Common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is a known complication of percutaneous vascular access. Treatment options include surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm or endovascular methods such as ultrasound-guided compression and direct thrombin injection into the pseudoaneurysm sac. Treatment of pseudoaneurysm is more challenging when a patient is undergoing concurrent catheter-directed or systemic thrombolytic therapy. This is a case report of endovascular treatment of an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm of common femoral artery in a patient receiving concurrent catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy. This was performed successfully by precise deployment of a MicroVascular Plug into the pseudoaneurysm neck with immediate closure of pseudoaneurysm. Midterm follow-up confirmed sustained exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm sac with continued patency of the treated femoral artery.

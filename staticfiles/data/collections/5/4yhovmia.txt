The Pan African Paediatric Surgery Association (PAPSA) was formed in 1994. The need for an organisation in Africa to voice children’s surgery and the trials and tribulations in forming this organisation was covered in this journal 2 years ago (Heinz R, Kyambi J, Lakhoo K. Surg Int 34(5):499–504, 2018). This article covers the history of the organisation post inception in 1994 to date. The near disbanding of the organisation due to political unrest and wars in Africa, to its success in the recent decade is highlighted in this manuscript.

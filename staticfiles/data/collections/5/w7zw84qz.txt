BACKGROUND Splenectomy is performed frequently for various and primarily hematologic indications in children and adolescents. We analyzed the long-term outcome after splenectomy (median, 8.7 years) focusing on sepsis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT), and retained accessory spleen. METHODS In total, 141 consecutive children after open (n = 89; 63%) or laparoscopic (n = 52; 37%) splenectomy from 1991 to 2010 were followed up through nationwide registries for septic infections, PVT, and causes of death. Sixty-six patients (58% of survivors) answered a structured questionnaire on infections, abdominal symptoms, and general health, and 64 (laparoscopic n = 26, open n = 38) consented to ultrasonography of the portal venous system. RESULTS Median operation age was 8.8 years (range, 1.0-22). Reoperations were required for bleeding after open procedures (n = 1) and retained accessory spleen after laparoscopic procedures (n = 3). Postsplenectomy sepsis occurred after a median of 1.7 years (range, 0.2-5.9) in 11 patients (8%), of whom 10 had an underlying immunodeficiency. No cases of PVT were observed, although the median portal vein flow was 1,130 mL/min (range, 440-2200) and diameter was 9.9 mm (range, 7-15) at a median follow-up of 9.5 years (range, 2.0-22) after splenectomy. Twenty-seven patients (19%) died after 8.7 years (0.03-23.00). The most common cause of death was the underlying malignancy (n = 15), with sepsis being an additional cause of death in 5 patients. CONCLUSION Postsplenectomy sepsis was associated almost exclusively with an underlying immunodeficiency with a high mortality rate. No PVT was observed. The overall risk of retained accessory spleen was around 7%, and was slightly greater after laparoscopic operation.

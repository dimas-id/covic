A series of free radical comb-type acrylic copolymers was prepared in a solution incorporating charged and/or neutral stabilising species on the backbone. The polymer solutions were formulated with cationic biocides to give physically stable formulations with a long shelf life. Furthermore, through the control of polymer architecture of both the side-chain and the backbone, hydrophobicity, a controlled release of a biocide could be achieved. This technology has resulted in the design of temporary coatings demonstrating a sustained surface disinfecting effect. In laboratory trials, coated surfaces with polymeric/biocidal formulations continued to show a disinfection effect after several washes.

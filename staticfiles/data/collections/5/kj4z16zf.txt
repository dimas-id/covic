In 2008, an estimated 33.4 million individuals worldwide were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1]. Only a few years ago, infection with HIV almost invariably culminated in the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), characterized by severe depletion of CD4(+) lymphocytes leading to derangements predominantly affecting cell-mediated immunity, but affecting humoral immunity as well [2]. In the later stages of AIDS, neutropenia and neutrophil functional deficits were common sequelae of HIV infection, other opportunistic infections, or HIV- or opportunistic infection-related treatment [3]. The care of the HIV-infected patient was palliative in nature, and the possibility that use of filgrastim (rHuG-CSF) might extend survival in late-stage AIDS patients with severe neutropenia or severe opportunistic infections, or might be a treatment for HIV infection itself, was explored [4]. Subsequently, however, the development of protease inhibitors and the widespread adoption of their use in multidrug regimens of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) revolutionized the care of HIV-infected patients, and the number of patients dying from HIV decreased dramatically [5].

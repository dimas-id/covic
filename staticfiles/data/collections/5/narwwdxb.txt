INTRODUCTION Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) acts as an exopeptidase and has been studied for decades. In recent years, it has been seen not only as a tumor-related target but also as a potential functional protein in various other physiological or pathological processes, such as analgesia, virus infection and inflammation. AREAS COVERED In this review, APN inhibitors in the patents publicized during 2006 - 2010 are introduced. Readers will gain information on the patent inhibitors, including chemical structures, original sources or synthetic methods, biological assays and application potential. EXPERT OPINION It is difficult to identify compounds that interact with the function not relevant with peptide-hydrolysis of APN in the enzyme activity assay, and such compounds have not been reported in the patents during the past 5 years. The progress of protein-small molecule interaction detecting means, such as surface plasmon resonance, will possibly help develop such compounds for the treatment of relevant diseases or new molecular probes in mechanism investigation.

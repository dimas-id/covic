Introduction: The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic led to temporary closure of routine hospital services. This prompted the initiation of teleconsult follow-up in our department. The study outlines the experience of tele-follow-up at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, and the perspective of neurologists about this novel approach. Methods: The tele-follow-up was started from 26th March 2020. Data of follow up appointments was provided by the medical record section. The faculty and senior residents conducted the tele-follow-up. Communication was made via voice calls. The data for initial ten days was analyzed to find the utility and experience of the new service. Results: In the initial ten working days, data of 968 patients was provided for tele-follow-up. A successful communication was made in 50.3% patients (contact with patients: 27.7% and family members 22.6%). The phone numbers which were not contactable/invalid/not available constituted 36.8% of the data. A total of 35 faculty and residents conducted the tele-follow-up. The utility of tele-follow-up was perceived as good by 71.4% of neurologists. Majority of neurologists (71.4%) observed that [â‰¥]90% of patients were continuing medications. Patients outside the city constituted 50-75% of the list. The survey revealed that all neurologists felt the need to continue tele-follow-up for far off stable patients post lock down and resumption of regular outpatient services. Conclusion: The survey established the feasibility and utility of teleconsult for follow up of patients with neurological diseases who were attending the regular outpatient services before the lock down.

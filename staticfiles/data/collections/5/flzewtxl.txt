Our personal views about the challenges of continuing to deliver peer teaching during a pandemic. We are a group of 4th year medical students who are part of a student society which has delivered structured, highly formulaic peer-led teaching sessions for the past three years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduced access to our normal clinical teaching highlighted the importance of peer-led teaching sessions. We wanted to continue with our peer-taught sessions but knew we would have to devise a new format to make our teaching accessible to our peers wherever they were. Here, we describe the challenges of online peer teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic and our reflections of the future implications to our group.

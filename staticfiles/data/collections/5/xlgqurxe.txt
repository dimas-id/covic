Abstract Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been the gold standard technique for cholecystectomy and has proven more effective than the conventional open technique. The laparoscopic technique utilizes surgical clips for cystic duct occlusion, which come with their own set of complications. With the advent of new vessel and duct sealing technology, alternative energy instruments have been explored for the occlusion of the cystic duct without the use of clips. The Harmonic(Â®) scalpel (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) has become one of the more widely used instruments. In this retrospective study, 208 patients received surgical clip placement or the Harmonic scalpel was used for cystic duct occlusion. The postoperative complications were documented, and rates were calculated for outpatient follow-up, for re-admission, and specifically for the complications of a bile leak. When adjusted for the cause of bile leak (cystic duct versus common bile duct versus accessory duct), the use of the Harmonic scalpel versus clip placement had comparable rates of bile leak at 1.75% and 0.66%, respectively. The use of the Harmonic scalpel is deemed safe and comparable to clip placement at the discretion of the surgeon for cystic duct ligation. Further research with larger homogeneous studies and assessments of cost-effectiveness would further enhance the increasing use of the Harmonic scalpel in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

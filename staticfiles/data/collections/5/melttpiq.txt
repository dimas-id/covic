In order to illuminate the antigenicity of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spike protein B and C antigen sites, the truncated spike gene including B and C antigen sites of Chinese isolate TH-98 was expressed respectively in E.coli, baculovirus and pichia pastoris expression systems. Dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Dot-ELISA) based on these three recombinant proteins were developed preliminarily. Ten sera obtained correspondingly from ten piglets two months old which showed up clinical symptom were used for examination. The study indicates that the assays are rapid, reliable and sensitive and it has the potential for use as serological methods for TGEV diagnosis.

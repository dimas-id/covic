Treatment of subglottic and proximal tracheal stenosis for nonsurgical candidates includes tracheostomy, Montgomery T tubes, and silicone stents. When used in lesions with concomitant malacia, silicone stents have a high incidence of migration. We describe a simple and effective technique of securing endoluminal stents using an Endo Close suturing device (Coviden, Boston, MA) and an external silicone button in 9 consecutive patients.

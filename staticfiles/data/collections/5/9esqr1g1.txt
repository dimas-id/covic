Faeces samples collected from diarrhoeic dairy calves in the first 8 weeks of life were examined for the presence of 5 enteropathogens. The majority of the 108 diarrhoea cases occurred in the first 5 weeks of life and a commercial ELISA kit detected bovine enteric coronavirus (BEC) in 38.9%, serogroup A rotavirus (RV) in 16.7% and K99 (F5) fimbrial adhesin-positiveEscherichia coli (K99 ETEC) in 11.1 per cent. Concurrent infections of these enteropathogens were detected in 14.8% of samples (30.8% of samples positive for these agents). No evidence of cryptosporidial infection was found using a differential staining method on faecal smears nor was salmonella excretion detected. On 2 of the 8 farms only BEC was present; the other 6 farms were positive for all 3 agents. It is concluded that BEC is the major infectious cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea in the Ethiopian dairy herds studied with RV and K99 ETEC also contributing to morbidity, either alone or as mixed infections.

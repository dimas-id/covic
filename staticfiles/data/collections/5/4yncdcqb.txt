Abstract Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by an overwhelming cytokine response. Various treatment strategies have been attempted. Methods and Results A 61-year-old male with heart transplantation in 2017 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and confirmed positive for the SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). Laboratory tests showed significant elevations in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Echocardiogram showed LVEF 58% (with EF 57% 6 months prior). Given the lack of clear management guidelines, the patient was initially managed symptomatically. However, the patient subsequently had a rapid respiratory deterioration with worsening inflammatory markers on day 5 of admission. Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) was in low supply in the hospital. The patient was offered clazakizumab (anti-IL-6) for compassionate use. Patient received 25 mg intravenously x1 dose. Within 24 hours, he noted significant improvement in symptoms, oxygen requirements, radiological findings and inflammatory markers. There was a transient leukopenia which improved in 4 days. He was discharged home on day 11, with negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR as an outpatient on day 35, development of positive serum COVID-19 IgG antibody, and he continued to do well on day 60, with no heart-related symptoms. Conclusion Clazakizumab is a monoclonal antibody against human IL-6, which may be helpful in inhibiting the cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Although not yet FDA approved, it is being investigated for treatment of renal antibody-mediated rejection. Clinical trials of clazakizumab for treatment of COVID-19 are underway worldwide.

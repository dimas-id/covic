Focal tumor ablation--whether applied percutanously, laparoscopically, or by means of open surgery-is an effective therapy for selected liver tumors. The choice of liver ablation as well as the choice between percutaneous and surgical approaches is dependent on tumor factors, patient factors, and other viable treatment options. Currently, the largest cumulative reported experience is with radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal metastases. This document is a position statement of the Interventional Oncology Task Force and the Standards Division of the Society of Interventional Radiology regarding the use of percutaneous RF ablation for the treatment of liver tumors.

A novel circovirus called porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) was recently reported to exist in the USA. This circovirus is associated with porcine dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure. This study reports on the first identification, widely epidemic, different phylogenetic clusters, potential role in sow reproductive failure and possible origins of PCV3 in China.

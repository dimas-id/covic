During the COVID-19 pandemic, radiology practices are reporting a decrease in imaging volumes. We review total imaging volume, CTA head and neck volume, critical results rate, and stroke intervention rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Total imaging volume as well as CTA head and neck imaging fell approximately 60% since the beginning of the pandemic. Critical results fell 60-70% for total imaging as well as for CTA head and neck. Compared to the same time frame a year prior, the number of stroke codes at the early impact of the pandemic had decreased approximately 50%. Proportional reductions in total imaging volume, stroke-related imaging, and associated critical result reports during the COVID-19 pandemic raise concern for missed stroke diagnoses in our population.

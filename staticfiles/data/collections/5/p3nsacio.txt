ABSTRACT: Most recently, an outbreak of severe pneumonia caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, imposes serious threats to public health. Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (nsp) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Therefore, the role and inhibition of nsp12 are indispensable. A cryo-EM structure of RdRp from SARs-CoV-2 was used to identify novel drugs from Northern South African medicinal compounds database (NANPDB) by using computational virtual screening and molecular docking approaches. Considering Remdesivir as the control, 42 compounds were shortlisted to have docking score better than Remdesivir. The top 5 hits were validated by using molecular dynamics simulation approach and free energy calculations possess strong inhibitory properties than the Remdesivir. Thus, this study paved a way for designing novel drugs by decoding the architecture of an important enzyme and its inhibition with compounds from natural resources. This disclosing of necessary knowledge regarding the screening and the identification of top hits could help to design effective therapeutic candidates against the coronaviruses and design robust preventive measurements.

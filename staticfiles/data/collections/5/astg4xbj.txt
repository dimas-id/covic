The role of simulation in formal neuroendovascular training has not been defined. This report details the general principles underlying the use of simulation in training, the critical aspects of the simulation environment which would aid it as a teaching tool specific to the field of neuroendovascular care, summarizes the available evidence to support a milestone-based curriculum, and outlines an example of what such a curriculum would entail. Building on these foundations, we articulate the rationale for the development and widespread adoption of a simulation curriculum for formal neuroendovascular training.

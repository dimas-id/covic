Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are potentially life‐threatening disorders comprising intra‐epidermal/epithelial (pemphigus) and sub‐epidermal/epithelial blistering diseases (pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis). Corticosteroids and non‐steroid immunomodulatory agents are the mainstays of treatment. Treatment can be challenging particularly in pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita which may require more intense immunosuppressive approaches

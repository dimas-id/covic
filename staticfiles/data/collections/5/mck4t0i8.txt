We reported the results of stroke prevention following modified endoscopic procedure for atrial fibrillation. 82 patients underwent modified endoscopic procedure for atrial fibrillation (AF), in whom 47 had paroxysmal, 28 had persistent, and 7 had long-standing atrial fibrillation. CHA2DS2VASC median score was 3 (range from 0 to 8). The procedure was performed on the beating heart, through 3 ports on the left chest wall. Pulmonary vein isolation and ablation of the left atrium were achieved by bipolar radiofrequency ablation. Left atrial appendage (LAA) was excluded by stapler. Brain CT, cardiac CT and 24-h Holter monitoring were performed following the procedure. The procedure was successfully completed for all patients. The mean duration was 122 ± 40.1 min. LAA was excluded after appendectomy and checked by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. The mean follow-up duration was 24.3 ± 3.5 months. No patients showed signs and symptoms of transient ischemic attack or stroke. No new positive findings were demonstrated by recurring brain CT scan performed after the procedure. Cardiac CT confirmed the absence of LAA and thrombosis in the left atrium. 87.8 % (72/82) of all patients were in sinus rhythm. Our results demonstrate that the modified endoscopic procedure is a safe, effective, and appropriate treatment for AF, which restores sinus rhythm and may be associated with the prevention of AF-related stroke.

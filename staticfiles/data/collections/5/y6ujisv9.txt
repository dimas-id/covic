OBJECTIVE To develop an automated model based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to detect patients within 4.5 hours after stroke onset and compare this method to the visual DWI-FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) mismatch. METHODS We performed a subanalysis of the "DWI-FLAIR mismatch for the identification of patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset" (PRE-FLAIR) and the "AX200 for ischemic stroke" (AXIS 2) trials. We developed a prediction model with data from the PRE-FLAIR study by backward logistic regression with the 4.5-hour time window as dependent variable and the following explanatory variables: age and median relative DWI (rDWI) signal intensity, interquartile range (IQR) rDWI signal intensity, and volume of the core. We obtained the accuracy of the model to predict the 4.5-hour time window and validated our findings in an independent cohort from the AXIS 2 trial. We compared the receiver operating characteristic curve to the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch. RESULTS In the derivation cohort of 118 patients, we retained the IQR rDWI as explanatory variable. A threshold of 0.39 was most optimal in selecting patients within 4.5 hours after stroke onset resulting in a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 63%. The accuracy was validated in an independent cohort of 200 patients. The predictive value of the area under the curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.64-0.80) was similar to the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch (area under the curve = 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.72; p for difference = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS An automated analysis of DWI performs at least as good as the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch in selecting patients within the 4.5-hour time window.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to compare gasless single-port access (SPA) laparoscopy using a J-shaped retractor and conventional SPA laparoscopy in patients undergoing adnexal surgery. Study design The medical records of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic adnexal surgery between May 2017 and April 2019 were reviewed. Of the 80 patients, 40 patients underwent gasless SPA laparoscopy using a J-shaped retractor and 40 underwent conventional SPA laparoscopy. All surgeries were performed by one laparoscopic surgeon. Surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There are no significant differences in age, body mass index, parity, previous abdominal surgery, tumor marker, and tumor diameter between the gasless and conventional groups. The median retraction setup time from skin incision was 7 min (range 5-12 min) in gasless SPA laparoscopic adnexal surgery. The median total operation times were 55.5 min (range 30-155 min) in the gasless group and 55 min (range 30-165 min) in the conventional group without a significant difference. Additionally, there were no differences in operation type, conversion rate of laparotomy, use of an additional trocar, and pathological outcomes between the two groups. No major complications, such as urologic, bowel, and vessel injuries, were found in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Gasless SPA laparoscopy using a J-shaped retractor appears to offer a better alternative to conventional SPA laparoscopy that avoids the potential negative effects of carbon dioxide gas in selected cases.

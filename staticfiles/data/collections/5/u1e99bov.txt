Abstract Self-binding peptides containing zipper-like sequences, such as the Leu/Ile zipper sequence within the coiled coil regions of proteins and the cross-β spine steric zippers within the amyloid-like fibrils, could bind to the protein-of-origin through homophilic sequence-specific zipper motifs. These self-binding sequences represent opportunities for the development of biochemical tools and/or therapeutics. Here, we report on the identification of a putative self-binding β-zipper-forming peptide within the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike (S) protein and its application in viral detection. Peptide array scanning of overlapping peptides covering the entire length of S protein identified 34 putative self-binding peptides of six clusters, five of which contained octapeptide core consensus sequences. The Cluster I consensus octapeptide sequence GINITNFR was predicted by the Eisenberg’s 3D profile method to have high amyloid-like fibrillation potential through steric β-zipper formation. Peptide C6 containing the Cluster I consensus sequence was shown to oligomerize and form amyloid-like fibrils. Taking advantage of this, C6 was further applied to detect the S protein expression in vitro by fluorescence staining. Meanwhile, the coiled-coil-forming Leu/Ile heptad repeat sequences within the S protein were under-represented during peptide array scanning, in agreement with that long peptide lengths were required to attain high helix-mediated interaction avidity. The data suggest that short β-zipper-like self-binding peptides within the S protein could be identified through combining the peptide scanning and predictive methods, and could be exploited as biochemical detection reagents for viral infection.

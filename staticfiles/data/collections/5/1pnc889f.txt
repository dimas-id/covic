BACKGROUND Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, the coronavirus has spread all over the world at an unprecedented rate. The transmissibility of coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals has received enormous attention. An important study using the COVID-19 data from the city Ningbo, China, was carried out to estimate and compare the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-squared tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-squared test. OBJECTIVE We reanalyze the data from the city Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. METHODS We exclude the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopt more appropriate statistical methods, including the permutation test and Fisher's exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city Ningbo. RESULTS After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, Fisher's exact test yields p-value=.84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis. The odds ratio of transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval [0.5, 2.8]. CONCLUSIONS Through a more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis of the Ningbo data, we conclude that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Donor selection and viral screening methods combined with pathogen reduction have increased the safety of pooled plasma to a level which makes reintroduction of ABO-universal plasma an important option. RECENT FINDINGS Solvent detergent-treated pooled plasma has proved to be well suited for the production of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. One such product, Bioplasma FDP, was licensed in South Africa in 1994 and has since 1996 been in successful clinical use. A clinical study with this product and two studies with the European product, Uniplas, have confirmed the efficacy and safety of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. SUMMARY Pooling of plasma enables the production of ABO-universal plasma. Pathogen reduction with solvent detergent eliminates lipid-enveloped viruses, whereas neutralizing antibodies in the plasma pool and nucleic acid amplification testing ensures the safety for recognized nonlipid-enveloped viruses. Pooling also eliminates transfusion-associated acute lung injury (the leading cause of plasma transfusion-related death), reduces immunologic/allergic adverse events by 60-80% and standardizes plasma protein content. Thus, in addition to ABO compatibility, pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma has important supplementary benefits that improve the product's cost-effectiveness.

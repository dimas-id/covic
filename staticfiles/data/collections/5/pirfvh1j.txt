Surgical stapling instruments, a revolutionary concept in surgical technique, were introduced in the United States in 1967. Notably absent in the new family of American instruments was the circular stapler (EEA) for end-to-end intestinal anastomosis. This strange omission was corrected a decade later. The EEA is now one of the most widely used stapling instruments in the surgical armamentarium.

Abstract The mechanisms and factors involved in the replication of positive stranded RNA viruses are still unclear. Using poliovirus as a model, we show that a long-range interaction between ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes formed at the ends of the viral genome is necessary for RNA replication. Initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis requires a 3′ poly(A) tail. Strikingly, it also requires a cloverleaf-like RNA structure located at the other end of the genome. An RNP complex formed around the 5′ cloverleaf RNA structure interacts with the poly(A) binding protein bound to the 3′ poly(A) tail, thus linking the ends of the viral RNA and effectively circularizing it. Formation of this circular RNP complex is required for initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis. RNA circularization may be a general replication mechanism for positive stranded RNA viruses.

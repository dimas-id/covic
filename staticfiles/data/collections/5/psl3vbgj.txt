The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) epidemic has spread to virtually every continent in the world. Despite Singapore's efforts, sustained community transmission of the virus has continued. We herein describe several key experiences and lessons learnt during the early course of the outbreak. First, it is critical to evaluate the outbreak objectively based on its own characteristics and not those of past epidemics. Second, the great advancements in speed and power of science and international collaboration have been critical in providing knowledge about the virus and disease. Third, public risk communications and the need to combat false information and rumours are even more crucial in this age of social media and viral information spread. Lastly, outbreak control and mitigation goes beyond the healthcare sector. The many lessons learnt will serve as a blueprint for dealing with future pandemics, but a sustainable new normal is required for the immediate future.

Publisher Summary The achievement of robust and regulated protein production in mammalian cells is a complex process that requires careful consideration of many factors, including transcriptional and translational control elements, RNA processing, gene copy number, mRNA stability, the chromosomal site of gene integration, potential toxicity of recombinant proteins to the host cell, and the genetic properties of the host. Gene transfer into mammalian cells may be effected either by infection with virus that carries the recombinant gene of interest, or by direct transfer of plasmid DNA. This chapter discusses the molecular architecture of non-viral vectors for high-level protein production. Virus-based vectors for gene therapy, protein production, vaccine development and other applications are summarized in a table and described.

BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopy (LESS) utilizes a single, multichannel port in an attempt to decrease postoperative pain, while enhancing cosmesis and minimizing the potential risks and morbidities associated with the multiple ports used in conventional laparoscopy. METHODS We performed a retrospective study examining three tertiary care referral centers. From September 2009 until March 2013, 31 patients with ovarian cystic lesions were treated using the LESS technique. A control group of 57 patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy was included for comparison. RESULTS All patients underwent a technically successful cystectomy. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean operative time or estimated blood loss between the two groups. Narcotic use during the recovery period was reported in less patients in the LESS group than in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The LESS technique can be used to safely perform cystectomies on women with benign ovarian cysts. Additional investigation is needed to evaluate the safety, cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes of this new approach.

Viruses have short replication cycles and produce genomic variants within a host, a process that seems to adapt to their specific host and also enable them to infect new hosts. The recent emergence of viral genomic variants from the circulating pool within the host population and re-emergence of the old ones are posing serious threat to agriculture, animal husbandry and humanity as a whole. This review assesses the potential role of genomic and proteomic tools that can monitor not only the course of infection and pathogenesis, but also predict the pandemic or zoonotic epidemic potential of a virus in a previously exposed or immunologically naive biological population.

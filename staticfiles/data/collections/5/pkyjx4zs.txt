The effects of irradiation were studied on porcine interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) secreting cells (IFN-alpha SC). IFN-alpha SC were characterized by an ELISPOT assay on non-adherent PBMC following incubation with the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. In vitro irradiation of PBMC was followed by a decrease in the number of IFN-alpha SC while IFN-gamma production and cell viability were not affected. These data indicate that porcine IFN-alpha SC are relatively radiosensitive. Indeed, the frequency of blood IFN-alpha SC decreased markedly and rapidly after in vivo whole body or partial lymphoid irradiation. In addition, within several days of compatible bone-marrow engraftment in the irradiated animals, the number of blood IFN-alpha SC returned to normal values. These data demonstrate that circulating porcine IFN-alpha SC are derived from bone-marrow progenitors.

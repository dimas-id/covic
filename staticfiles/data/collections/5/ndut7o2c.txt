The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic started in the Hubei province of China, but is rapidly spreading all over the world. Much of the information and literature have been centered on the adult population while a few reports pertaining to COVID-19 and neonates have been published so far. Actual guidelines are based on expert opinion and show significant differences among the official neonatal societies around the world. Recommendations for the care of neonates born to suspected or confirmed COVD-19 positive mothers in low-resource settings are very limited. This perspective aims to provide practical support for the planning of delivery, resuscitating, stabilizing, and providing postnatal care to an infant born to a mother with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in low-resource settings where resources for managing emergency situations are limited.

OBJECTIVE As a bariatric surgery; Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) has gained popularity in recent years. In our study, we aimed to investigate the impact of age on postoperative weight loss at one year after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS In our clinic between May 2011 and July 2013, 55 patients who underwent LSG with the diagnosis of obesity were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups below and over an age of 40. Preoperative and postoperative first year Body Mass Index (BMI), percent of Body Mass Index Lost (% BMIL) and Excess Body Mass Index Lost (% EBMIL) were recorded. RESULTS A total of 55 patients with a mean age of 37.2 ± 8.6 years were included in the study. 37 were women. Patients divided into the age below 40 years old (group 1, n = 29) and over 40 years old (group 2, n = 26). The average age of the groups was 29.9 ± 4.63 and 45.3 ± 7.02, respectively. Characteristics of patients among groups were similar. The preoperative average BMI of groups were 49.34 ± 5.87 kg/m² and 49.73 ± 5.38 kg/m², postoperative first year mean BMI of groups were 30.05 ± 5.78 kg/m² and 36.15 ± 6.64 kg/m², respectively. Percentage loss in BMI was 19.29 ± 3.14% and 13.58 ± 2.96%, respectively; and % EBMIL was 82.95 ± 21.88% and 56.75 ± 15.90%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that age might be as a major determining factor for weight loss and patients over forty years old undergoing LSG for bariatric surgery should be informed about that they will have a lower weight lost.

Giant (juvenile or cellular) fibroadenoma of the breast is the most common tumor that present in adolescent girls. As benign tumors that can exceed 10 cm in diameter, giant fibroadenomas have historically necessitated large incisions to remove these masses, resulting in large unsightly scars. We describe the novel use of an endoscopic specimen pouch to facilitate the removal of these large tumors through minimal incisions in 3 patients. In follow-up, all 3 patients have had excellent cosmetic outcomes, no recurrences, and no postoperative complications.

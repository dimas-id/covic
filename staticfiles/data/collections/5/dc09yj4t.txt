Abstract In a previous study, we have shown that highly-pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) antagonizes type I IFN expression induced by poly(I:C). Here, we demonstrated that the mutation of Aspartic acid 185 (Asp185) impaired the ability of nsp4 to inhibit IFN-I production induced by poly(I:C). Subsequently, we verified that all the mutants at the residue 185, regardless of amino acid size (including Cys and Ser) and charge (including Glu and Lys), impaired nsp4 catalytic activity. However, when Asp185 in nsp4 was replaced by a similar structure amino acid Asparagine 185 (Asn185), nsp4 stayed but with a decreased protease activity. Importantly, the recombinant virus with Asn185 mutation in HP-PRRSV-nsp4 exhibited slower replication rate and higher ability to induce IFN-I expression compared with wild-type (wt) HP-PRRSV.

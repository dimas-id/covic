Cerebral venous sinus thrombosisis an uncommon entity and its clinical presentations are highly variable. We present the case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Although it was medical refractory, successfully treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire FR device. A 27-year-old man who presented with venous infarction accompanied by petechial hemorrhage secondary to the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis. Due to rapid deterioration despite of anticoagulation therapy, the patient was taken for endovascular treatment. We deployed the Solitaire FR device (4×20 mm) in the anterior portion of the thrombosed SSS, and it was left for ten minutes before the retraction. Thus, we removed a small amount of thrombus. But the sinus remained occluded. We therefore performed the thrombectomy using the same methods using the Solitaire FR (6×20 mm). Thus, we were successful in removing larger clots. Our case highlights not only that the mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire FR is effective in achieving revascularization both rapidly and efficiently available, but also that it might be another option in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis who concurrently had rapid clinical deterioration with devastating consequences.

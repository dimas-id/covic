BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has been recently proposed as a sole bariatric procedure because of the resulting considerable weight loss in morbidly obese patients. Traditionally, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy requires 5-6 skin incisions to allow for placement of multiple trocars. With the introduction of single-incision laparoscopic surgery, multiple abdominal procedures have been performed using a sole umbilical incision, with good cosmetic outcomes. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic single incision sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. METHODS A total of 8 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic single-incision sleeve gastrectomy at the Operative Unit of Bariatric Surgery of the University of Rome Tor Vergata from March 2009 to June 2009. RESULTS Of the 8 patients, 5 were women and 3 were men, with a mean age of 44.4 years. The mean preoperative body mass index was 56.2 kg/m(2). The mean operative time was 128 minutes. The mean postoperative stay was 2.4 days. The mean postoperative body mass index was 49.3 kg/m(2) at a mean follow-up period of 3.6 months. The mean percentage of excess weight loss was 33% for the same period. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic single-incision sleeve gastrectomy seems to be safe, technically feasible, and reproducible. A randomized trial comparing single-incision sleeve gastrectomy and conventional sleeve gastrectomy might be needed to evaluate the postoperative results in relation to the development of abdominal wall complications.

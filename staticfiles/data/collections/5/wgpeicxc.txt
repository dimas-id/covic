Objective Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard method for evaluating whether a treatment works in healthcare, but can be difficult to find and make use of. We describe the development and evaluation of a system to automatically find and categorize all new RCT reports. Materials and Methods Trialstreamer, continuously monitors PubMed and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), looking for new RCTs in humans using a validated classifier. We combine machine learning and rule-based methods to extract information from the RCT abstracts, including free-text descriptions of trial populations, interventions and outcomes (the 'PICO') and map these snippets to normalised MeSH vocabulary terms. We additionally identify sample sizes, predict the risk of bias, and extract text conveying key findings. We store all extracted data in a database which we make freely available for download, and via a search portal, which allows users to enter structured clinical queries. Results are ranked automatically to prioritize larger and higher-quality studies. Results As of May 2020, we have indexed 669,895 publications of RCTs, of which 18,485 were published in the first four months of 2020 (144/day). We additionally include 303,319 trial registrations from ICTRP. The median trial sample size in the RCTs was 66. Conclusions We present an automated system for finding and categorising RCTs. This yields a novel resource: A database of structured information automatically extracted for all published RCTs in humans. We make daily updates of this database available on our website (trialstreamer.robotreviewer.net).

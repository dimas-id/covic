Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) is an emerging treatment option for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This may obviate the need for systemic or catheter-directed thrombolysis. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database search of PMT in acute and chronic symptomatic DVT was undertaken. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, procedural details, DVT characteristics, and procedural and clinical outcomes are presented. A total of 8 case series (n = 2528; 1998-2009) qualified for inclusion. Lower extremity symptomatic DVTs constituted the majority of the cases (>80%). Both acute (<14 days) and chronic (>14 days) DVTs were included. Procedural success was 59% to 100% and catheter-directed thrombolysis was used as an adjunct in 16% to 53%. No deaths or major bleeding complications were reported. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis leads to the immediate resolution of clinical symptoms of DVT in the majority of patients. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis may be a safe and novel method, when appropriate expertise and resources are available, for the treatment of symptomatic acute and chronic DVT.

A recently introduced operation of geometrical closure on formal languages is investigated. It is proved that the geometrical closure of a language from the positive variety [Formula: see text], the level 3/2 of the Straubing-Th√©rien hierarchy of star-free languages, always falls into the variety [Formula: see text], which is a new variety consisting of specific R-trivial languages. As a consequence, each class of regular languages lying between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is geometrically closed.

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major public health concern in China. The most predominant enteroviruses that cause HFMD have traditionally been attributed to enterovirus A71 (EVA71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Since its first large outbreak in 2008, the dominant HFMD pathogens are constantly changing. In 2013 and 2015, CVA6 exceeded both EVA71 and CVA16 to become the leading cause of HFMD in some provinces. However, there still lacks a comprehensive overview on the molecular epidemiology and evolution of HFMD-related enteroviruses at the national level. In this study, we performed systematic epidemiological analyses of HFMD-related enteroviruses using the data of 64 published papers that met the inclusion criteria, and conducted phylogenetic analyses based on 12,080 partial VP1 sequences identified in China before 31st June 2018. We found that EVA71 prevalence has decreased sharply but other enteroviruses have increased rapidly from 2008 to 2016 and that one subtype of each enterovirus is represented during the epidemic. In addition, four genotypes EVA71_C4, CVA16_B1, CVA6_D and CVA10_C are the most predominant enterovirus strains and collectively they cause over 90% of all HFMD cases in China according to the phylogenetic trees using representative partial VP1 sequences. These four major enterovirus genotypes have different geographical distributions, and they may co-circulate with other genotypes and serotypes. These results suggest that more molecular epidemiological studies should be performed on several enteroviruses simultaneously, and such information should have implications for virological surveillance, disease management, vaccine development and policy-making on the prevention and control of HFMD.

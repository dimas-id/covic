A field-based case-control study was conducted to assess the strength of association of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and some major swine viruses with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Cases were defined as individual pigs with a clinical history of progressive weight loss and histopathological lesions characteristic of PMWS. Controls were pigs without clinical signs and histopathological lesions typical of PMWS. A total of 31 cases and 56 controls was identified from diagnostic submissions. Serum and various tissues were collected from all animals and assayed for PCV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine parvovirus, porcine enterovirus types 1-3, swine influenza virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine endogenous retrovirus, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus type 1, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. The proportion of case and control pigs positive for each virus was determined and statistically compared for determining the strength of the association that each virus had with PMWS individually or in combinations. Porcine circovirus type 2 had the strongest association (OR = 9.3, P = 0.006) with PMWS among the viruses tested for. Risk for PWMS was much higher (OR = 31.2, P = 0.0009) if the animal was concurrently infected with PCV2 and PRRSV, suggesting that development of PMWS may be enhanced by cofactor(s). Because PCV2 was also found in 62.5% of the controls, PCV2 from 5 cases and 4 controls were selected and genetically compared. No significant genetic difference was observed between PCV2 from PMWS and control pigs.

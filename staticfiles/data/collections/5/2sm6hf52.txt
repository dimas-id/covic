Novel bombesin (BBN) antagonists were synthesized by coupling the chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) to H-d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (JMV594) through linkers of increasing number of (βAla)x residues (x = 1-3). Labeling with (111)In afforded the respective radiotracers in high purity and high specific activity. Bioconjugate affinity for the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) as determined against [(125)I-Tyr(4)]BBN was high (IC50 values in the lower nanomolar range). Radioligands poorly internalized in PC-3 cells at 37 °C. Radiopeptides remained >60% intact 5 min after entering the bloodstream of healthy mice. After injection in SCID mice bearing human PC-3 xenografts all analogues showed high tumor uptake and rapid background clearance via the kidneys into urine. Interestingly, pancreatic uptake, albeit GRPR-specific, declined rapidly with time. (111)In-DOTA-(βAla)2-JMV594 achieved the highest tumor values among the group (17.0 ± 2.8%ID/g vs. 8-10%ID/g, respectively, at 4 h pi) indicating that the (βAla)2-linker favors in vivo interaction of radiopeptides with the GRPR.

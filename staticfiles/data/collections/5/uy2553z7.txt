Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) sense the extracellular microenvironment and transmit signals to the intracellular compartment. In this investigation, we addressed the mechanism of signal generation by ectodomains of single-pass transmembrane homophilic CAMs. We analyzed the structure and homophilic interactions of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)–related CAM 1 (CEACAM1), which regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, morphogenesis, and microbial responses. Soluble and membrane-attached CEACAM1 ectodomains were investigated by surface plasmon resonance–based biosensor analysis, molecular electron tomography, and chemical cross-linking. The CEACAM1 ectodomain, which is composed of four glycosylated immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, is highly flexible and participates in both antiparallel (trans) and parallel (cis) homophilic binding. Membrane-attached CEACAM1 ectodomains form microclusters in which all four Ig domains participate. Trans-binding between the N-terminal Ig domains increases formation of CEACAM1 cis-dimers and changes CEACAM1 interactions within the microclusters. These data suggest that CEACAM1 transmembrane signaling is initiated by adhesion-regulated changes of cis-interactions that are transmitted to the inner phase of the plasma membrane.

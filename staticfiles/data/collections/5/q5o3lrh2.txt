Infectious disease outbreaks occurred many times in the past and are more likely to happen in the future. In this paper the problem of allocating and scheduling limited multiple, identical or non-identical, resources employed in parallel, when there are several infected areas, is considered. A heuristic algorithm, based on Shih’s (1974) and Pappis and Rachaniotis’ (2010) algorithms, is proposed as the solution methodology. A numerical example implementing the proposed methodology in the context of a specific disease outbreak, namely influenza, is presented. The proposed methodology could be of significant value to those drafting contingency plans and healthcare policy agendas.

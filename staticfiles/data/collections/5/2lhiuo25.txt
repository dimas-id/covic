A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that involves creating an opening and inserting a tube in the trachea to enable air transit from the external atmosphere to the lungs. The insertion of a tracheostomy is a common procedure used to wean patients from mechanical ventilation and to manage patients with upper respiratory tract complications. Furthermore, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in many patients requiring a tracheostomy as part of respiratory management. The two most commonly used tracheostomy insertion procedures are the open surgical tracheostomy and the percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy, both of which are associated with a range of complications. This article outlines the indications, benefits and complications of tracheostomy insertion, as well as the various types of tracheostomy tube that may be used. It also explains the role of the nurse in caring for patients before, during and after tracheostomy insertion, including the management of tracheostomy-related complications and emergencies.

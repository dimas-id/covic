BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intra-arterial therapy (IAT) is most effective when performed rapidly after ischemic stroke onset. However, there are limited performance benchmarks in IAT and there is a scarcity of information on how to structure an effective IAT protocol and its impact on time to treatment. The objective of our study was to detail a standardized IAT protocol, and to assess its influence on time to treatment in ischemic stroke. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study over 4 years at a comprehensive stroke center. A standardized IAT protocol was implemented in June 2013 that included pre-notifying the stroke team before hospital arrival, defining clinician roles, processing tasks in parallel, and standardizing IAT procedures. Three time metrics were examined and reported as median (IQR) minutes: arrival to CT imaging, CT to groin puncture, and puncture to recanalization. We compared these metrics in patients admitted before implementation (January 2012-May 2013) to patients admitted after (June 2013-December 2015) using Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS 380 patients were included. After the protocol was implemented, there were significant reductions in time from arrival to CT (17 (14-21) vs 13 (11-19) min, p<0.001), CT to puncture (46 (30-82) vs 31 (23-54) min, p<0.001), and puncture to recanalization (65 (33-90) vs 37 (22-65) min, p<0.001). 60% of time was saved during puncture to recanalization. Significant reductions in time were observed during both normal working hours and off-hours. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a standardized protocol resulted in a significant reduction in time to recanalization for patients with an ischemic stroke. A standardized IAT protocol decreases time to recanalization when team roles are clearly defined, tasks are processed in parallel, and procedures are standardized.

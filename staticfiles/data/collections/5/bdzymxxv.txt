BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy is being performed increasingly in Europe. Data on long-term outcome would be helpful in defining the role of sleeve gastrectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of sleeve gastrectomy as a primary bariatric procedure. METHODS Medical charts of all patients who underwent a primary sleeve gastrectomy at the authors' institution between August 2006 and December 2012 were reviewed retrospectively using a prospective online data registry. For evolution of weight loss and co-morbidity, only patients with follow-up of at least 1 year were included. A subgroup analysis was done to compare patients with an intended stand-alone procedure and those with an intended two-stage procedure. RESULTS A total of 1041 primary sleeve gastrectomies were performed in the study period. Median duration of surgery was 47 min, and median hospital stay was 2 days. Intra-abdominal bleeding occurred in 27 patients (2Â·6 per cent) and staple-line leakage in 24 (2.3 per cent). Some 866 patients had at least 1 year of follow-up. Mean excess weight loss was 68.4 per cent after 1 year (P < 0.001) and 67.4 per cent after 2 years. Smaller groups of patients achieved a mean excess weight loss of 69.3 per cent (163 patients), 70.5 per cent (62) and 58.3 per cent (19) after 3, 4 and 5 years respectively. No difference in postoperative complications was found between the subgroups. Seventy-one (8.2 per cent) of 866 patients had a revision of the sleeve gastrectomy; reflux or dysphagia was the indication in 34 (48 per cent) of these patients. CONCLUSION Sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective bariatric procedure. Maximum weight loss was achieved after 4 years. Long-term results regarding weight loss and co-morbidities were satisfactory.

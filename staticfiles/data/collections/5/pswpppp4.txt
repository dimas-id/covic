Objective: The present systematic review aims to establish an effective range of low-level laser therapy wavelengths to accelerate tooth movement in orthodontic treatments. Materials and methods: The electronic literature search was carried out in the following databases: PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The protocol (CRD42019117648) was registered in PROSPERO. Results: According to PRISMA guidelines and after applying the inclusion criteria, nine RCTs were included. Three blind reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality and evidence level of selected articles. Evidence level classification was established according to the recommendations of SIGN 50 (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2012) and was high quality being ++, acceptable +, low quality -, unacceptable -, reject 0. Conclusions: The majority of RCTs related to accelerating the tooth movement in orthodontic treatments are ideally between 780 and 830 nm wavelengths. The average increase in speed movement calculated as a percentage of the control group in nine studies is 24%. Further studies are necessary to establish the exact dosimeter in photobiomodulation during orthodontic movement.

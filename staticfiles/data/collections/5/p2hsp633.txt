Two of the most common types of congenital thoracic malformations are congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) and bronchopulmonary sequestrations (BPS). Here we present the first known case of a hybrid lesion, with coexisting features of an extralobar sequestration (ELS) and CPAM type 2, with arterial inflow from the celiac trunk and venous outflow to the portal vein. The clinical presentation, investigative imaging and timing of surgery are discussed.

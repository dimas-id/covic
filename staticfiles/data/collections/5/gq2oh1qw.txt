In this Invited Commentary, the author considers the February 2020 announcement that scoring on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 will change to pass/fail no sooner than January 2022 and its effects on the transition to residency process in the context of both the recommendations of the Invitational Conference on USMLE Scoring (InCUS) held in March 2019 and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. The author suggests that the medical education community must embrace any positive changes that come about as a result of the pandemic while continuing to systematically review the strengths and areas for improvement in the current transition to residency process.In its recommendations, InCUS provided a thoughtful set of action priorities and an effective process to work together, which can inform and guide the work ahead. The COVID-19 pandemic is dominating the educational and clinical environments and is now the biggest disruptor in all aspects of life, not just medical education. It is the responsibility of leaders in medical education to have a vision for and then implement an improved continuum of education that maintains the core values of the field and fits the health care delivery needs of today and the future.

Four plants having known medicinal properties were screened for inhibition of goatpox virus (GTPV) replication in vitro. Of the 4 plants, extract of Acacia arabica (Babul) and Eugenia jambolana (Jamun) leaves had inhibition (%) 99.70 and 99.92 at their maximum non toxic concentrations, 99.93 +/- 0.38 and 1999.73 +/- 0.50 microg/ml, respectively in all cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays. Inhibition of GTPV virus replication was further confirmed by PCR and SYBR Green based quantitative real-time QPCR assays specific for GTPV. Results indicated that the extract of Acacia arabica and Eugenia jambolana leaves inhibited GTPV replication in vitro.

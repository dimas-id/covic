Cholesterol efflux is the key process protecting the vascular system from the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Various extracellular and intracellular events affect the ability of the cell to efflux excess cholesterol. To explore the possible pathways and processes that promote or inhibit cholesterol efflux, we applied a combined cheminformatic and bioinformatic approach. We performed a comprehensive analysis of published data on the various substances influencing cholesterol efflux and found 153 low molecular weight substances that are included in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. Pathway enrichment was performed for substances identified within the Reactome database, and 45 substances were selected in 93 significant pathways. The most common pathways included the energy-dependent processes related to active cholesterol transport from the cell, lipoprotein metabolism and lipid transport, and signaling pathways. The activators and inhibitors of cholesterol efflux were non-uniformly distributed among the different pathways: the substances influencing ‘biological oxidations’ activate cholesterol efflux and the substances influencing ‘Signaling by GPCR and PTK6’ inhibit efflux. This analysis may be used in the search and design of efflux effectors for therapies targeting structural and functional high-density lipoprotein deficiency.

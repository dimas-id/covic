Abstract A 60 year-old man born in Central America died suddenly in the hallway of his residence on the grounds of a resort hotel where he worked as a dishwasher. The dishwashing station was in a large, poorly ventilated area where a substantial number of food service workers (cooks, wait staff, bus persons, dishwashers, supervisors, etc.) shared air space with the index patient. Several social contacts of the patient reported that he had been coughing for many months before his death. The County Department Of Health conducted a contact investigation, which identified 171 individuals in need of follow-up. Thirty-six percent of those tested in the first round were tuberculin skin test-positive; a second round of testing yielded a 15% (8 of 52) conversion rate.

Our objective was to determine if vaccination with killed avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) causes epididymal calcium stones in the rooster as is seen following vaccination with live attenuated AIBV. Specific-pathogen-free roosters were divided into three groups: nonvaccinated (NONVAC), live attenuated AIBV-vaccinated (LVAC), and killed AIBV-vaccinated (KVAC) groups. Roosters were vaccinated at 2, 6, 10, and 14 wk of age and the epididymal region was observed at 27 wk of age. Epididymal stones were present in 13% of NONVAC, 50% of KVAC, and 64% of LVAC roosters. Histologically, immune cells were seen in the interstitium of efferent ductules containing stones. We conclude that use of a killed vaccine does not reduce the incidence of epididymal stones.

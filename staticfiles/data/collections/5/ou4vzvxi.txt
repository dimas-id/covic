The China-US Cooperation-Global AIDS Program (GAP) was a strategic technical collaboration program jointly implemented by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This program developed, piloted, launched, and evaluated a broad range of projects supporting national and local HIV prevention and control programs; evidence-based decision-making; strengthening systems and capacity at national, provincial, and local levels; prioritizing high-risk geographic areas and populations; developing innovative approaches for scale-up; answering important scientific questions that can be most effectively answered in China but also with global implications for the HIV response; and increasing Chinaâ€™s engagement with the global public health community and sharing critical lessons learned. A productive working relationship with well-conceived models, a results-based activity implementation plan, and proper linkage to the domestic policy process has made a significant contribution to HIV control and prevention in China.

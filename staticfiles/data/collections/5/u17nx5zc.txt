Background Cerebral emboli is a rare complication of endovascular procedures and foreign bodies in the cerebrovascular system can lead to stroke. When an intravascular foreign body is identified, endovascular retrieval should be attempted due to its high success rate and minimal morbidity. Case Description A 59-year-old male patient underwent cine-coronario-graphy through a trans-radial approach because of angina. During the study, a 6Fr catheter fragment ruptured, detached and migrated to a right middle cerebral artery branch. We recovered it with a coronary balloon. Conclusion A coronary angioplasty balloon is an option for retrieving foreign objects or device fragments that have migrated into cerebral vasculature.

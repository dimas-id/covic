Pediatric intraoperative transfusion therapy, particularly the approach to massive blood transfusion (blood loss > or =one blood volume) can be quite complex because of the unique relationship between the patient's blood volume and the volume of the individual blood product transfused. This paper is divided into two parts: part 1 presents an overview of the physiologic and hematologic differences between children and adults as well as an overview of the metabolic consequences of blood transfusions, risks of disease transmission, and blood compatibility issues.

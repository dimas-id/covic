OBJECTIVE To determine the influence of preoperative septic peritonitis (PSP) and stapled versus hand-sewn anastomoses on the dehiscence of intestinal resection and anastomosis (IRA). We hypothesized that the incidence of IRA dehiscence would be greater (1) when performed with PSP and (2) for hand-sewn anastomoses. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective. ANIMAL POPULATIONS Client-owned dogs at Michigan State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. METHODS Records of dogs surviving 72 hours after IRAs between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed for age, gender, neuter status, weight, presence of PSP, preoperative albumin, IRA indication and location, anastomotic technique, suture type, postoperative dehiscence and timing, duration of hospitalization, last follow-up, and other complications. Univariate logistic regression and chi-square analysis were used to screen prognostic factors; factors with P < .3 were included in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS Two hundred and ten IRAs in 198 dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Dehiscence was diagnosed in 11.4% cases, 6.6% without PSP, and 21.1% with PSP (P = .01). Indication for IRA did not influence the risk of dehiscence. No association was detected between anastomotic technique and IRA dehiscence in dogs without PSP (stapled 4.2%, hand-sewn 8.1%); however, stapled anastomoses were less likely to dehisce in dogs with PSP (stapled 9.7%, hand-sewn 28.9%). Risk factors for dehiscence included PSP (P = .005) and hand-sewn technique (P = .02). CONCLUSION Our results confirmed that PSP is a risk factor for dehiscence of IRA and suggest that patients with PSP may be a unique surgical population, in which stapling may be preferred over hand-sewn anastomoses after enterectomies.

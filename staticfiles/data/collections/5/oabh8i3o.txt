Numerous published articles have shown the safety and efficacy of robotic anatomic pulmonary resection, including lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. Several techniques have been described to perform a lung lobectomy robotically. Since the beginning of our experience, we adopted a four-arm robotic approach with the da Vinci Si System. More recently we have used the newer Xi model, that offers a simplified and "quicker" set-up and docking time. This article emphases specifically on the technical aspects of how to complete the hilar dissection during four-arm robotic lobectomy.

Injury, both intentional and accidental, is the most common cause of death in children throughout the world. Many injury patterns that are seen in children are similar to those in adult populations; however, others differ, reflecting the age, stature, and development of children. This chapter focuses on differences in injury patterns of children across the spectrum of childhood development and growth, including injuries and fatalities that primarily occur in infancy and early childhood. Risk factors for injury and death are identified within the context of childhood development. Topics covered include deaths associated with motorized and nonmotorized vehicles including pedestrian, occupant, and operator fatalities; farming and ranching deaths; drowning, boating, and diving deaths; fires and burns, including electrical deaths; animal-related deaths; falls; and airway-associated deaths. There are significant disparities in childhood injury and death among racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups. A brief consideration of these differences is provided to assist in forensic case examination.

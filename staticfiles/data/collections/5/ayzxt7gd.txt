The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected several millions and killed more than quarter of a million worldwide to date. Important questions have remained unanswered: why some patients develop severe disease, while others do not; and what roles do genetic variabilities play in the individual immune response to this viral infection. Here, we discuss the critical role T cells play in the orchestration of the antiviral response underlying the pathogenesis of the disease, COVID-19. We highlight the scientific rationale for comprehensive and longitudinal TCR analyses in COVID-19 and reason that analyzing TCR repertoire in COVID-19 patients would reveal important findings that may explain the outcome disparity observed in these patients. Finally, we provide a framework describing the different strategies, the advantages, and the challenges involved in obtaining useful TCR repertoire data to advance our fight against COVID-19.

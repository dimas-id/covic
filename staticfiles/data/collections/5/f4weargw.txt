Fæcal specimens from 628 newborn babies in the nurseries of six metropolitan hospitals were examined by electron microscopy for rotaviruses. 304 babies (49%) were found to be excreting virus. All those infected were in five nurseries; viruses were not detected in specimens from the sixth nursery. Two nurseries were studied for 9 mo and another for 11 mo and rotaviruses were found consistently in 40-50% of stools examined. There was no seasonal variation. None of the neonates under the age of one day were infected but by the age of three to four days approximately 50% were excreting virus. Most of those shedding virus were symptom-free but 84 (28%) had diarrhœa. Persisting endemic rotavirus infection is apparently common in hospital nurseries in Sydney. The virus is probably transmitted by environmental spread from neonate to neonate.

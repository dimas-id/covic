Penile prosthesis surgery for erectile dysfunction has the highest satisfaction rates among all treatment options but is often associated with subjective and objective loss of penile length and girth following surgery. To present a novel technique using a subcutaneous soft silicone implant for reversal of penile shortening and narrowing after prosthesis surgery, with additional gains in overall penile length and girth. Nine patients were treated with the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant. All patients had previously reported a loss in penile length (0.5-2 cm), and seven of nine patients also reported a loss in penile girth (0.5-2.6 cm) after penile prosthesis surgery. During a follow-up period of 4-24 months, penile length and girth measurements showed a mean increase in length of 2.4 cm (±0.75 cm) and a mean increase in girth of 3.4 cm (±0.94 cm). The additional insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone implant in patients with decreased penile length and girth after penile prosthesis surgery is an effective treatment option that provides reversal of lost penile length and girth.

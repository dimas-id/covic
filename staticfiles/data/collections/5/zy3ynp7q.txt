Viruses co-evolve with their hosts, and many viruses have developed mechanisms to suppress or modify the host cell apoptotic response for their own benefit. Recently, evidence has emerged for the opposite strategy. Some viruses have developed the ability to co-opt apoptotic caspase activity to facilitate their own proliferation. In these strategies, viral proteins are cleaved by host caspases to create cleavage products with novel activities which facilitate viral replication. This represents a novel and interesting class of viralâ€“host interactions, and also represents a new group of non-apoptotic roles for caspases. Here we review the evidence for such strategies, and discuss their origins and their implications for our understanding of the relationship between viral pathogenesis and programmed cell death.

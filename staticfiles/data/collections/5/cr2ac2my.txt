BACKGROUND: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, tracheostomy may be required for COVID-19 patients requiring long-term ventilation in addition to other conditions such as airway compromise from head and neck cancer. As an aerosol-generating procedure, tracheostomy increases the exposure of health care workers to COVID-19 infection. Performing surgical tracheostomy and tracheostomy care requires a strategy that mitigates these risks and maintains the quality of patient care. METHODS: This study is a multidisciplinary review of institutional tracheostomy guidelines and clinical pathways. Modifications to support clinical decision making in the context of COVID-19 were derived by consensus and available evidence. RESULTS: Modified guidelines for all phases of tracheostomy care at an academic tertiary care center in the setting of COVID-19 are presented. DISCUSSION: During the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians must carefully consider the indications, procedural precautions, and postoperative care for tracheostomies. We present guidelines to mitigate risk to health care workers while preserving the quality of care.

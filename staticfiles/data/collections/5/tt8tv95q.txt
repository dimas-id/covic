Within the last decade, running has become one of the most popular physical activities in the world. Although the benefits of running are numerous, there is a risk of Running Related Injuries (RRI) of the lower extremities. Electromyography (EMG) techniques have previously been used to study causes of RRIs, but the complexity of this technology limits its use to a laboratory setting. As running is primarily an outdoors activity, this lack of technology acts as a barrier to the study of RRIs in natural environments. This study presents a minimally invasive wearable muscle sensing device consisting of jogging leggings with embroidered surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes capable of recording muscle activity data of the quadriceps group. To test the use of the device, a proof of concept study consisting of $N=2$ runners performing a set of $5km$ running trials is presented in which the effect of running surfaces on muscle fatigue, a potential cause of RRIs, is evaluated. Results show that muscle fatigue can be analysed from the sEMG data obtained through the wearable device, and that running on soft surfaces (such as sand) may increase the likelihood of suffering from RRIs.

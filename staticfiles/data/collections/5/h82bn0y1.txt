BACKGROUND Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is emerging as an alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery. Quality of life (QOL) and functional outcome are important aspects when valuing a new technique. The aim of this prospective study was to assess both functional outcome and QOL after TAMIS. METHODS From 2011 to 2013, patients were prospectively studied prior to and at least 6 months after TAMIS for rectal adenomas and low-risk T1 carcinomas using a single-site laparoscopy port. Functional outcome was determined using the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). Quality of life was measured using functional [Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL)] and generic (EuroQol EQ-5D) questionnaires. RESULTS The study population consisted of 24 patients 13 men, median age 59 (range 42-83) with 24 tumours [median distance from the dentate line 8 cm (range 2-17 cm); median tumour size 6 cm(2) (range 0.25-51 cm(2)); 20 adenomas; 4 low-risk T1 carcinomas]. Post-operative complications occurred in one patient (4 %; grade IIIb according to Clavien Dindo classification). Compared to baseline, FISI remained unaffected (9.8 vs 7.3; P = 0.26), FIQL remained unaffected, and EuroQol EQ-5D improved (EQ-VAS: 77 vs 83; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION There was no detrimental effect of TAMIS on anorectal function. Overall QOL was improved after TAMIS, probably due to removal of the tumour, and at 6 months was equal to the general population.

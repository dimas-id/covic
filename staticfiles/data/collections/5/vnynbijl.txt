The ability to genetically manipulate viruses has led to extraordinary advances in understanding virus biology and to the establishment of useful vector systems. Initially confined to DNA viruses and retroviruses, RNA viruses have more recently become attractive candidates for expression of heterologous genes and offer promising perspectives for biomedical applications.

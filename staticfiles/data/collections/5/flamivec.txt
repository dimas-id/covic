The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is one of the most devastating in this century. It originated in China in December 2019 caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, and in less than a month it had been classified as an "International Public Health Emergency". To date there are nearly 3 million people infected and more than 250,000 deaths caused by the disease worldwide. Initially it affects the respiratory tract with atypical pneumonia and in severe cases it produces systemic inflammation with cytokine storm that can cause rapid deterioration with circulatory and respiratory failure, coagulopathy and a lethality rate of approximately 7%. In Mexico, the first case was detected in February 2020, and to date there are 26,616 confirmed cases and 2,961 deaths throughout the country. The low number of diagnostic tests conducted in our country clearly underestimates the real incidence and impact of the disease. The most affected groups are those with risk factors such as age over 60, presence of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Of the confirmed cases, 15% are healthcare workers. There is no specific treatment or vaccine yet, so it is important to have hygiene, social isolation and personal protection measures. Health, social and economic consequences could have great impact in the near future.

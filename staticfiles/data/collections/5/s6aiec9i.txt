BACKGROUND Tigertriever (Rapid Medical, Yoqneam, Israel) is a new design of stent retriever. PURPOSE To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the Tigertriever in patients with acute ischemic stroke who have undergone mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two different techniques-namely, standard unsheathing (SUT) and repetitive inflation-deflation (RID) techniques, were used. Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scores of 2b and 3 were considered as successful recanalization. RESULTS A total of 61 thrombectomy procedures with Tigertriever were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age of patients was 60.7 years and their National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 14.7. Overall, the percentage of patients with a mTICI score of 0, 2b, and 3 was 24.6, 26.2, and 49.2, respectively. Successful recanalization and first-pass success rates were 75.4% and 37.7%, respectively. There were no statistical differences between the results of the SUT and RID techniques. No vessel rupture, dissection, or device detachment was observed. The number of patients with a good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) was 17 (27.9%). CONCLUSION Our results showed that the Tigertriever device is safe and efficient for mechanical thrombectomy.

Still it was not absolutely the plague; the use of the word was prohibited, it was a pestilential fever, the adjective was preferred to the substantive, - then, not the true plague, - that is to say, the plague, but only in a certain sense, - and further, combined with poison and witchcraft. Such is the absurd trifling with which men seek to blind themselves, wilfully abstaining from a sound exercise of judgment to arrive at the truth. Alessandro Manzoni, The Betrothed.

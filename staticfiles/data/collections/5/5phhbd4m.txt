BACKGROUND Mounting evidence indicate patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have an accelerated fracture healing. The healing process of bone fractures is greatly dependent on infiltrated macrophages. The macrophages are categorized into M1 or M2 phenotypes with different functions. This study is aimed to address the potential role of subtypes of macrophages in the process of fracture healing in patients with TBI. METHODS Twenty-five cases of clavicle fracture alone (CF group) and 22 cases of clavicle fracture concomitant with TBI (CFT group) were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Callus tissues were harvested during operations. The expressions of COX-2, CD206, and CD68 were measured with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The percentages of M2 macrophages in total macrophages increased after bone fracture in both groups, while the percentages of M1-type macrophages are decreased. Interestingly, the increased percentages of M2 macrophages are significantly higher in CFT group than in CF group. Compared to CF group, the fracture callus volume was much larger (21.9 vs 8.5 cm3) and the fracture healing time was much shorter (82.2 vs 127.0 days) in CFT group. The percentage of M2 macrophages was negatively correlated with fracture healing time in patients (r = - 0.575, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that the percentages of M2 macrophages in callus tissues increased dramatically during the repairing stage in both CF and CFT group. Percentages of M2 macrophages are associated with accelerated fracture healing in patients with TBI. M2 macrophage polarization during the stage of bone regeneration may play a vital role in promoting bone fracture healing.

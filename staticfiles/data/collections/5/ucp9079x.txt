Enteroviruses are members of Pichornaviridae family consisting of human enterovirus group A, B, C, and D as well as nonhuman enteroviruses. Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a serious disease which is usually seen in the Asia‐Pacific region in children. Enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 are two important viruses responsible for HFMD which are members of group A enterovirus. IFN α and β are two cytokines, which have a major activity in the innate immune system against viral infections. Most of the viruses have some weapons against these cytokines. EV71 has two main proteases called 2A and 3C, which are important for polyprotein processing and virus maturation. Several studies have indicated that they have a significant effect on different cellular pathways such as interferon production and signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the latest findings about the interaction of 2A and 3C protease of EV71 and IFN production/signaling pathway and their inhibitory effects on this pathway.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that primarily affects the respiratory system, but it may cause cardiovascular complications such as thromboembolism. Rarely, pulmonary embolism may be encountered in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, especially in intensive care units. An asymptomatic young case of COVID-19 presenting with sudden death due to acute massive pulmonary embolism has not been previously described. We report a 41-year-old woman presented to emergency department with sudden death during physical activity. She had only history of diabetes mellitus and she was asymptomatic until sudden death. CT pulmonary angiography and chest CT scans revealed acute massive embolism and typical imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. Interestingly, the patient had no symptoms or signs of infection and also had no risk factors for thromboembolism. COVID-19 infection appears to induce venous thromboembolism, especially pulmonary embolism. The case is remarkable in terms of showing how insidious and life-threatening COVID-19 infection can be.

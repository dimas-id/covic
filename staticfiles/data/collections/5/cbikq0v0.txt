There are several concepts whose interpretation and meaning is defined through their binary opposition with other opposite concepts. To this end, in this paper we elaborate on the idea of leveraging the available antonyms of the original query terms for eventually producing an answer which provides a better overview of the related conceptual and information space. Specifically, we sketch a method in which antonyms are used for producing dual queries, which can in turn be exploited for defining a multi-dimensional topical relevance based on the antonyms. We motivate this direction by providing examples and by conducting a preliminary evaluation that shows its importance to specific users.

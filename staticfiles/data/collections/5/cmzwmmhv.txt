INTRODUCTION Whilst the prime role of a gynaecologic oncologist is the comprehensive management of women with a gynaecologic cancer, their surgical skills are increasingly utilised for general gynaecological and obstetric surgery. Within tertiary centres, there is increasing provision of support by gynaecologic oncologists for both emergency and complex elective cases. AIM The aim of the study was to investigate and define the expanding role of the gynaecologic oncologist within obstetrics and gynaecology. METHOD A retrospective analysis of all nongynaecological oncology unit cases from 2006 to 2012 which required the presence of a gynaecologic oncologist in the operating theatre. RESULTS A wide variety of cases that required the involvement of a gynaecologic oncologist were identified. These ranged from complications such as bowel injuries and haemorrhage to gynaecological surgeries in complicated patients, and obstetric patients with placenta accreta and intra-operative diagnosis of unexpected malignancy. CONCLUSION The role of the gynaecologic oncologist within a tertiary centre is expanding to include the provision of support to general gynaecologists and obstetricians. There is increasing utilisation of the gynaecologic oncologist whereby their attendance is often pre-arranged prior to the surgery. However, emergency cases requiring their assistance are not uncommon.

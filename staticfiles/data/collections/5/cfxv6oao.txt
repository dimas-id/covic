Abstract With the extensive competition in a network economy environment the quotation of different orders should be various to increase the customersâ€™ satisfaction in terms of properties of products and complexity of manufacturing processes. The enterprises employ the customization production paradigm, where the products have similar functions and structures, and adapt to such environment. However, for this mode, the mechanism is lack of making a quotation rapidly due to the complex of product and changeable demands. Formulating the relationship between factors and quotation of an order becomes an issue concerned by academia and entrepreneurs. We present control metrics to connect with those factors and existing quotation of a product. Since a quotation of product needs a large number of parameters to represent, the control metrics can be alternative of those parameters of quotation. Then, we propose a model of quoting. The correlation between the control metrics and a quotation of product is explored. Finally, a reduction approach of crucial metrics is developed by rough set on incomplete data. The case study is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method of reduction. The outcomes show that the multiple reducts can be obtained to facilitate the enterprises to make viable quotation decision from the multiple schemes in terms of their characteristics and different demands of the customers.

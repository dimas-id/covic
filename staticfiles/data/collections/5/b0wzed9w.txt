Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) have recently emerged in several swine producing countries. Our survey found that in addition to porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), PDCoV has also been a causative enteric pathogen of diarrhoeic outbreaks occurring at swine farms around Japan since late 2013. Phylogenetic analysis using the complete genomes of PDCoVs detected in Japan in 2014 demonstrated that the PDCoVs from Japan may be closely related to the PDCoVs from the U.S. and Korea during 2013 to 2014 but not the PDCoVs from China and Hong Kong during 2004 to 2016 and from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos during 2015 to 2016. To investigate the pathogenicity of a representative Japanese PDCoV, we performed an experimental infection using hysterectomy-produced colostrum-deprived piglets. The PDCoV-inoculated piglets showed acute, watery diarrhoea, but all recovered and survived. In addition, all piglets inoculated with the Japanese PDCoV exhibited virus shedding at high level in faeces and viremia corresponding to their clinical symptoms. In the PDCoV-inoculated group, viruses were mainly detected from jejunums to colons by a quantitative PDCoV-specific PCR and microscopic observation. These findings would provide useful information for establishing a diagnostic methodology for distinguishing diarrhoea caused by PDCoV from that caused by other enteric pathogens, such as PEDV.

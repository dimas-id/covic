An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) epidemic spreads rapidly worldwide. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection caused mildly to seriously and fatally respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In this study, we detected and analyzed the main laboratory indicators related to heart injury, creatine kinase isoenzyme‐MB (CK‐MB), myohemoglobin (MYO), cardiac troponin I (ultra‐TnI), and N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), in 273 patients with COVID‐19 and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease. It was found that higher concentration in venous blood of CK‐MB, MYO, ultra‐TnI, and NT‐proBNP were associated with the severity and case fatality rate of COVID‐19. Careful monitoring of the myocardiac enzyme profiles is of great importance in reducing the complications and mortality in patients with COVID‐19.

A series of phosphinic compounds mimicking the transition state of substrates hydrolysed by aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) were synthesized. These new compounds have potent inhibitory activities with Ki values in the nanomolar range. These derivatives behave as the most potent APN inhibitors designed to date.

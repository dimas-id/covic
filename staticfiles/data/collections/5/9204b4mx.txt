Timely detection and diagnosis are urgently needed to guide epidemiological measures, infection control, antiviral treatment, and vaccine research. In this review, biomarkers/indicators for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the environment are summarized and discussed. It is concluded that the detection methods targeting antibodies are not suitable for screening of early and asymptomatic cases since most patients had an antibody response at about 10 days after onset of symptoms. However, antibody detection methods can be combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, and boost vaccine research. Fast, sensitive and accurate detection methods targeting antigens need to be developed urgently. Various specimens for diagnosis or detection are compared and analyzed. Among them, deep throat saliva and induced sputum are desired for RT-qPCR test or other early detection technologies. Chest computerized tomography (CT) scan, RT-qPCR, lateral flow immunochromatographic strip (LFICS) for diagnosis of COVID-19 are summarized and compared. Specially, potential electrochemical biosensor, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensor, and artificial intelligence (AI) assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 are emphasized. Finally, some commercialized portable detection device, current challenges and future directions are discussed.

An outbreak of dual infection in dogs with canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV‐1) and canine coronavirus (CCV) infection is reported in an animal shelter that comprised approximately 200 adults stray dogs and 30 puppies. Twenty puppies died 7–8 days after the onset of the clinical signs (severe enteritis, leucopoenia, respiratory distress and dehydration). Both CAV‐1 and CCV were isolated from tissue or swab samples. Antibodies to CCV and, at high levels, to CAV‐1 also were detected in several puppies. The principal histological findings were atrophy of small intestinal villi, lymphoid depletion, hepatitis and bronchopneumonia. The persistence of CCV in the faeces, observed by the polymerase chain reaction assay, was longer than previously reported. Results demonstrated the serious consequences which may occur with dual infections by CAV‐1 and CCV in assembled groups of dogs that are housed in poorly managed kennels with inadequate vaccination programmes.

Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium was selected as a transgenic vehicle for the development of live mucosal vaccines against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). A 2.2 kb DNA fragment, encoding for N-terminal domain glycoprotein S of TGEV, was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX-S was transformed by electroporation into attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, the expression and translation of the pVAX-S delivered by recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-S) was detected in vitro and in vivo respectively. BALB/c mice were inoculated orally with SL7207 (pVAX-S) at different dosages, the bacterium was safe to mice at dosage of 2 × 10(9) CFU and eventually eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization. Mice immunized with different dosages of SL7207 (pVAX-S) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses as measured by indirect ELISA assay. Moreover, the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine was highly dependent on the dosage of the attenuated bacteria used for oral administration, 10(9) CFU dosage group showed higher antibody response than 10(8) CFU and 10(7) CFU dosages groups during week 4–8 post-immunization. The results indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of TGEV DNA vaccine.

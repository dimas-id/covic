The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our ability to provide timely surgical care for our patients. In response, the American College of Surgeons, U.S. Surgeon General, and other surgical professional specialties have recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges are particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand. The purpose of this white paper is to highlight all phases of gynecologic cancer surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate when it is best to operate, to pause, and re-integrate surgery. Triage and prioritization of surgical cases, preoperative COVID-19 testing, peri-operative safety principles, surgical training, and preparations for the post-COVID-19 peak and surgical re-integration are reviewed.

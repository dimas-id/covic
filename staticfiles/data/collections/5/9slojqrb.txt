An investigation of the presence of influenza A virus has been conducted in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at the Possession Island in the Crozet Archipelago, Antarctica, using a rapid molecular diagnostic method based on real-time polymerase chain reaction. No evidence of outbreak or positive viral infection of influenza A virus was found in this study. We however recommend the implementation of long-term surveillance in seabird populations of polar ecosystems to detect the potential introduction of exotic strains and potential existence of a local epidemiological cycle for avian influenza viruses.

Human rotavirus is the most important cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide. We describe the aetiology of viral diarrhoea and the characteristics of rotavirus infection in Shahrekord, Iran. Two hundred and fifty nine children <5 years old admitted to Hajar Hospital, 245 children with acute diarrhoea attending primary health centres in Shahrekord, and 114 children hospitalised for elective surgery were selected from October 2001 to August 2002. Stool samples were screened for enteric viruses using EM. Rotaviruses were characterised using ELISA, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), and electropherotyping. One hundred and eighty six viruses were identified, of which 146 (78%) were rotavirus. The second most frequent virus was coronavirus, followed by calicivirus. Rotaviruses exhibited a marked seasonal variation, being most frequently isolated from November to February (50% of rotavirus recovered) and affected mostly children <2 years old. The RT‐PCR successfully typed 139 of the 146 (95%) rotavirus G types and 124 (85%) P types. The most frequent P type was, P[8] in 108 (74%), P[4] in 16 (11%), and was P non‐typeable in 22 (15%). Among the G types, G1 was identified in 120 (82%), G2 in 19 (13%), and was G‐non‐typeable in 7 (5%). Our results are the first report of rotavirus genotypes affecting Iranian children. The most frequent G and P types (G1, G2, P[8], and P[4]) are similar to those reported from around the world and will be covered by existing rotavirus vaccines targeting G types G1–G4. J. Med.

We describe a rare case of cervical necrotising fasciitis caused by mastoiditis and Bezold's abscess. This case was complicated by a tracheostomy delaying wound healing. A novel strategy to repair the tracheotomy defect using Permacolâ„¢, an acellular porcine dermal substitute, and a local muscle flap not previously reported in the literature is described to allow the use of negative pressure wound therapy dressing. This technique may be employed in similar applications for non-healing tracheotomy wounds.

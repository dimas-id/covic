The recent increase of immunopeptidomic data, obtained by mass spectrometry (MS) or binding assays, opens unprecedented possibilities for investigating endogenous antigen presentation by the highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) protein. We introduce a flexible and easily interpretable peptide presentation prediction method. We validate its performance as a predictor of cancer neoantigens and viral epitopes and use it to reconstruct peptide motifs presented on specific HLA-I molecules.

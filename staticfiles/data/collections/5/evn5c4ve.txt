Abstract Human infectious disease is classified into five etiologies: bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal, and prion. Viral infections are unique in that they recruit human cellular machinery to replicate themselves and spread infection. The number of viruses causing human disease is vast, and viruses can be broadly categorized by their structures. Many viruses, such as influenza, appear to be amorphous particles, whereas others, such as herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, dengue virus, and adenovirus, have roughly symmetric structural components. Icosahedral viruses have been a target of electron microscopists for years, and they were some of the first objects to be reconstructed three-dimensionally from electron micrographs. The ease with which highly purified and conformationally uniform virus samples can be produced makes them an ideal target structural studies. Apart from their biological significance, these virus samples have played a pivotal role in the development of new methodologies in the field of molecular biology as well as in cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography.

BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy with lymphadenectomy is considered one of the most effective treatments for early non-small cell lung cancer. We developed a novel approach for lobectomy in patients with right upper lung cancer through simplified synchronous disconnection of pulmonary arteries and veins. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of this minimally invasive technique in managing right upper lobectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS From March 2016 to September 2017, 62 patients with right upper lung cancer underwent lobectomy via simplified synchronous disconnection of pulmonary arteriovenous by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. All patients were followed up for 6-12 months after the procedure through clinic visits or telephone/e-mail interviews. RESULTS Of the 62 patients (mean age, 57.2 ± 8.7 years), 28 were men (45.2%) and 34 (54.8%) were women. All procedures were successfully performed by thoracoscopy, with a mean operating time of 66.2 ± 9.0 min. The mean blood loss was 40.3 ± 19.5 mL. Only 1 (1.61%) patient required blood transfusion. The mean number of endoscopic linear stapling devices used was 2.6 ± 0.7. The mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 16.0 ± 1.6. Postoperative pneumonia was encountered in 4 (6.45%) patients. There was no postoperative mortality. The mean length of hospital stay was 5.3 ± 1.3 days. Six-month follow-up revealed an excellent clinical result and degree of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS Simplified synchronous disconnection of pulmonary arteries and veins is a feasible, economical, safe, and effective therapeutic procedure for right upper lung carcinoma. This novel procedure shows promise as a viable surgical approach for right upper lobectomy.

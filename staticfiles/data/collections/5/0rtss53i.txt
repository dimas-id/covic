This paper addresses the problem of mapping equivalent items between two databases based on their textual descriptions. Specifically, we will apply this technique to link the elements of two food composition databases by calculating the most likely match of each item in another given database. A number of experiments have been carried by employing different distance metrics, some of them involving Fuzzy Logic. The experiments show that the mappings are highly accurate and Fuzzy Logic improves the precision of the model.

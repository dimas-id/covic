Our dental knowledge of rodents is still patchy but their increasing popularity and advances in technology allow us to make good strides toward better understanding. Cutting incisors with nail clippers and treating incisor problems without examining cheek teeth is no longer acceptable. Good practice dictates that a thorough examination is performed, a diagnosis is made, and treatment is planned and executed appropriately. Dentistry is expanding at a tremendous rate; the next few years should provide plenty of opportunities to solve most of the remaining problems with dental disease in rodents.

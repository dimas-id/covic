The spread of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, discovered in China in January 2020, led to a pandemic as early as March 2020, forcing every health care system in the affected countries to adapt quickly. In order to better address this major health crisis, which has given rise to numerous scientific publications, we have synthesized the main original clinical studies to facilitate the day-to-day management of patients with COVID-19. We detail the early signs and progression of the disease as well as the different clinical forms, including extra-pulmonary, as known at the beginning of this pandemic. We focus on clinical, biological and CT markers predictive of severity or mortality. Finally, we discuss the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in populations suspected to be at high risk of severe forms.

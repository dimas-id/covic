This is one of the few examples in which the diverse products have been synthesized just by changing the applied potential. The synthesis of sulfonyl derivatives of p-methylaminophenol were carried out by reaction of the electrogenerated p-methylquinoneimine with sulfinic acids. Various types of mono (MSP), bis (BSP) and tris (TSP) sulfonyl p-methyl aminophenols were obtained by changing the electrode potential, in one pot under green conditions. The mono sulfonyl-p-(methylamino)phenol derivatives (MSP) were assessed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against the gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative (Escherichia coli) strains. It was found that the tested compounds were more active against Staphylococcus aureus than Escherichia coli. We also found that the antimicrobial activity of MSP derivatives to vary in the order MSP(4) (R = CH(3)) > MSP(1) (R = p-tolyl) â‰ˆ MSP(2) (R = phenyl) > MSP(3) (R = p-ClC(6)H(4)). Moreover, the observed homogeneous rate constants (k (obs)) of the reaction of p-methyl quinoneimine with sulfinic acids were estimated in various pH values, based on the EC and ECEC mechanisms, by comparing the simulated cyclic voltammograms with the experimental ones.

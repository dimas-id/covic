Positive-stranded genomic RNA of coronavirus MHV and its six subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The mRNAs are composed of leader and body sequences which are non-contiguous on the genome and are fused together in the cytoplasm by a mechanism which appears to involve an unusual and specific 'polymerase jumping' event.

AIM This study aimed to develop a novel procedure for treating long-gap pure esophageal atresia. This procedure, which entails the combined use of laparoscopy and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), would enable primary repair without cervical and thoracic incisions and prevent postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS Nonsurvival experiments were conducted in 9 pigs to study the technical feasibility. The procedure comprised the following: (1) creation of the disease model by laparoscopic resection of the lower esophagus; (2) laparoscopic fundoplication, complete mobilization of the stomach, and enlargement of the esophageal hiatus; (3) formation of a peroral transesophageal entry site into either the postmediastinum or the right thoracic cavity followed by fashioning a tunnel to the peritoneal cavity; (4) gastric pull-up by using both laparoscopy and NOTES; (5) esophagoesophageal anastomosis using BraceBarâ„¢, a prototype of the double T-bar suturing device (Olympus Medical Systems Co., Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS Laparoscopic procedures were performed without complications. The postmediastinal tunnel was successfully created three times with a complication of pleural injury. However, gastric pull-up via this route could not be completed due to porcine anatomical reasons. Gastric pull-up through the right thoracic route was achieved five times in six attempts. Two disorientations and a hemorrhagic death occurred during the procedures. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that combined use of laparoscopy and NOTES enabled gastric pull-up without cervical and thoracic incisions. Our method has the potential of lowering the incidence of GERD and enabling primary repair of this disease.

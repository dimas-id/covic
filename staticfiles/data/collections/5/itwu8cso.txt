BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is an emerging bariatric procedure that typically necessitates five to seven small skin incisions to place five to seven trocars. The senior author (Saber) has developed a single umbilical incision approach to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Seven patients underwent single access transumbilical laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between March 2008 and July 2008. The same surgeon performed all surgical interventions. The umbilicus was the sole point of entry for all patients, and the same operative technique and perioperative protocol were used in all patients. RESULTS A total of seven single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies were performed. The procedure was successfully performed in all patients. Mean operating time was 125 min. None of the patients required conversion to an open procedure. There were no mortalities or postoperative complications noted during the mean follow-up period of 3.4 months. CONCLUSION Single-incision transumbilical laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is safe, technically feasible, and reproducible.

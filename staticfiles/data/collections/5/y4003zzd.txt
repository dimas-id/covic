Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, in the span of weeks, immobilized entire countries and mobilized leading institutions worldwide in a race towards treatments and preventions. While several solutions such as telemedicine and online education platforms have been implemented to reduce human contact and further transmission, countries need to favour collectivism both within and beyond their borders. Inspired by experiences of previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003 and Ebola in 2014â€“2015, global solidarity is a must in order to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Examples in leadership and collaborations ranging from research funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to mask donations by the Jack Ma Foundation should be celebrated as examples to follow. Open communication and transparency will be crucial in monitoring the evolution of the disease in the global effort of flattening the curve. This crisis will challenge the integrity and fuel innovation of health systems worldwide, whilst posing a new quality chasm that warrants increased recognition.

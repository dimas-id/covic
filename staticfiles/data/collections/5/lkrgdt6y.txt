Retroviruses integrate into the host cell's chromosome. Accordingly, many aspects of the life cycle of retroviruses like HIV-1 are intimately linked to the functions of cellular proteins and RNAs. In this review, we discuss in brief recent genomewide screens for the identification of cellular proteins that assist HIV-1 replication in human cells. We also review findings for other cellular moieties that help or restrict the viral life cycle.

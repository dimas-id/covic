The aim of this study was to solicit opinions from healthcare workers (HCWs) as to their attitude to working during a pandemic. A cross-sectional survey of HCWs using a self-administered, anonymous survey was conducted between February 2007 and April 2007. The setting was a large Victorian metropolitan health service, employing over 10 000 staff. Sixty-seven percent of HCWs stated they would be available to work during a pandemic, 26% stated they would stay at home to care for their children, whereas 10% admitted they would stay away because of fear of catching influenza. The majority of employees expected to be provided with personal protective equipment, antivirals and vaccine (92%, 90% and 89%, respectively). HCWs also believed that family members should be supplied with antivirals and vaccine (64% and 63%, respectively), 20% believed they needed a place of residence while working, 45% were prepared to be relocated to another site, and 36% were prepared to change to another duty. The survey highlights several areas that need attention in preparing for a pandemic. Targeted education is required now for all those HCWs who will be expected to work during a pandemic. How we cope with the next inevitable pandemic depends on the depth of our preparation.

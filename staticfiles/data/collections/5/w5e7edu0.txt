Concanavalin A, a phytagglutinin, binds to the envelope of hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, a Coronavirus. Concanavalin A treated virus suspensions lose their hemagglutination properties and there is a transient interference with infectivity. Electron micrographs show the Concanavalin A as a granular deposit adhering to the viral envelope and there is aggregation of the virus. Concanavalin A does not bind to virions stripped of their envelopes.

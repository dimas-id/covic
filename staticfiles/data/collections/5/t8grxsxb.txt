Abstract Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis (EVA), a respiratory and reproductive disease of equids, which is notifiable in some countries including the Great Britain (GB) and to the OIE. Herein, we present the case of a persistently infected stallion and the phylogenetic tracing of the virus strain isolated. Discussing EAV occurrence and phylogenetic analysis we review features, which may aid to harmonise and enhance the classification of EAV.

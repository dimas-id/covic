The possibility of characterizing fluorescent immunoglobulins using spectrophotometric analysis as a testing method is considered. The comparative analysis of optical properties of fluorescent immunoglobulin preparations and their components—immunoglobulins and fluorochrome—is carried out. The obtained results testify that the proposed methodological approach of optical detection of labeled immunoglobulin molecules can be promising for tests on obtaining conjugates used in immunological tests on revealing specific antigens of causative agents of especially dangerous infections.

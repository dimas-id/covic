The novel coronavirus disease 2019, a pandemic of global concern, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has severely revealed the need for public monitoring and efficient screening techniques. Despite the various advancements made in the medical and research field, containment of this virus has proven to be difficult on several levels. As such, it is a necessary requirement to identify possible hotspots in the early stages of any disease. Based on previous studies carried out on coronaviruses, there is a high likelihood that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may also survive in wastewater. Hence, we propose the use of nanofiber filters as a wastewater pretreatment routine and upgradation of existing wastewater evaluation and treatment systems to serve as a beneficial surveillance tool.

CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) constitute a major portion of immune responses to foreign and self antigens. CTL recognize class I major histocompatibility complex molecules complexed to peptides of 8â€“10 residues derived from cytosolic proteins. To understand CTL responses to these antigens to manipulate CTL responses optimally, it is necessary to identify the specific peptides recognized by CTL. The methods currently used for this purpose have significant drawbacks. We describe a plasmid transfection method that results in significant lysis of histocompatible target cells. Influenza virus-specific CTLs specifically lysed target cells that were transfected with plasmids bearing cDNAs encoding full length gene products, fragments containing the region that encodes the CTL epitope, or even a ten residue peptide. This significantly lessens the time and effort required todefine genes, and gene segments that contain CTL epitopes.

Since 1969, the incidence of acute respiratory diseases (ARD) in the Czech Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia has been monitored by a special programme based on reports from 85 district epidemiological centres. In this paper, the incidence of ARD in three age groups, together with the incidence of complications and death rates, are presented for each season during the period 1969-1974. The significance of epidemiological observations and laboratory investigations relating to influenza and other ARD agents, such as parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, RS virus, coronaviruses, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, is discussed.

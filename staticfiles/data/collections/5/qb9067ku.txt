Novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, has caused pandemic of highly contagious disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with epicenters in China, Italy, Spain, and the USA. Primarily affecting the human respiratory system, SARS-CoV2 has some impact on the human brain, but apparently minimal on the cerebellum, at least so far. Neurological involvement in the acute phase appears to manifest with confusion, dizziness, impaired consciousness, propensity to develop acute strokes, anosmia, hypogeusia, ataxia, epilepsy, and neuralgia. Cerebellar scholars are facing a time of uncertainty. Telemedicine has suddenly emerged as an alternative to follow patients. There is an urgent need to develop novel platforms to assess and follow ataxic patients remotely, especially because cerebellar patients often require ambulatory care to maintain their autonomy.

The current research standards in robotics demand general approaches to robots' controllers development. In the assistive robotics domain, the human-machine interaction plays a~substantial role. Especially, the humans generate intents that affect robot control system. In the article an approach is presented for creating control systems for assistive robots, which reacts to users' intents delivered by voice commands, buttons, or an operator console. The whole approach was applied to the real system consisting of customised \tiago{} robot and additional hardware components. The exemplary experiments performed on the platform illustrate the motivation for diversification of human-machine interfaces in assistive robots.

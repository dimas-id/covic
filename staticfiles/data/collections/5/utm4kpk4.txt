Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new coronavirus that has been causing severe and fatal acute respiratory illnesses in humans since its outbreak in 2012, has raised public fear worldwide. The development of prophylactics and therapeutics is urgently needed to prevent and control MERS-CoV infections. In this study, a bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) vaccine displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed, and gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles were used as substrates to externally bind to the MERS-CoV RBD through a protein anchor (PA). The designs included different numbers of lysin motif (LysM) repeats in the PAs linked by linkers (RBD-linker-PA2 (RLP(2)), RBD-linker-PA3 (RLP(3)) and RBD-PA3 (RP(3))), and three LysM repeats and a linker in the fusion proteins increased the binding activity to the RBD. The specific immune responses were tested by intranasally immunizing mice with RLP(3)-GEM with or without the adjuvant GEL01. The results showed that GEL01-adjuvanted RLP(3)-GEM increased the systemic humoral, cellular and local mucosal immune responses in the mouse model, especially in the intestinal tract. The above results indicate that the MERS-CoV BLP product has the potential to be developed into a promising mucosal candidate vaccine to protect against MERS-CoV infections.

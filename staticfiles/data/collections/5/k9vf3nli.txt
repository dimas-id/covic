According to our recent proposal, an information system is a combination of a process model captured as a Petri Net with Identifiers, an information model specified in the first-order logic over finite sets with equality, and a specification of how the transitions in the net manipulate information facts. The Information Systems Modeling (ISM) Suite is an integrated environment for developing, simulating, and analyzing models of information systems, released under an open-source license. This paper presents the basic features of the ISM Suite.

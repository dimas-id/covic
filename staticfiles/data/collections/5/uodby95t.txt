Keyphrase extraction has been a popular research topic in the field of natural language processing in recent years. But how to extract keyphrases precisely and effectively is still a challenge. The mainstream methods are supervised learning methods and graph-based methods. Generally, the effects of supervised methods are better than unsupervised methods. However, there are many problems in supervised methods such as the difficulty in obtaining training data, the cost of labeling and the limitation of the classification function trained by training data. In recent years, the development of the graph-based method has made great progress and its performance of extraction is getting closer and closer to the supervised method, so the graph-based method of keyphrase extraction has got a wide concern from researchers. In this paper, we propose a new model that applies the three-way decision theory to graph-based keyphrase extraction model. In our model, we propose algorithms dividing the set of candidate phrases into the positive domain, the boundary domain and the negative domain depending on graph-based attributes, and combining candidate phrases in the positive domain and the boundary domain qualified by graph-based attributes and non- graph-based attributes to get keyphrases. Experimental results show that our model can effectively improve the extraction precision compared with baseline methods.

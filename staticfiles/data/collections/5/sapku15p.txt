On 1 March 2020, the amendments to the German Protection Against Infection Act that were introduced by the act to protect against measles and strengthen vaccination prevention (Measles Protection Act) entered into force.

To protect public health, the Measles Protection Act has implemented regulations requiring that persons in certain institutions must either have adequate protection against measles or have immunity to measles. In this article the current legal situation with regard to health care facilities is presented.

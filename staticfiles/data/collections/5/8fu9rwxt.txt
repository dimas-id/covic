Recent evidence examining adults infected with COVID-19 has indicated a significant impact of malnutrition on health outcomes. Individuals who have multiple comorbidities, are older adults, or who are malnourished are at increased risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit and of mortality from COVID-19 infections. Hence, nutrition care to identify and address malnutrition is critical in treating and preventing further adverse health outcomes from COVID-19 infection. This document provides guidance and practice considerations for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) providing nutrition care for adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection in the hospital, outpatient, or homecare settings. In addition, this document discusses and provides considerations for RDNs working with individuals at risk of malnutrition secondary to food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

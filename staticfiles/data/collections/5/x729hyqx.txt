Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis, Mafa) have emerged as important animal models for biomedical research, necessitating a more extensive characterization of their major histocompatibility complex polymorphic regions. The current information on the polymorphism or diversity of the polygenetic Mafa class I A loci is limited in comparison to the more commonly studied rhesus macaque Mafa class I A loci. Therefore, in this paper, to better elucidate the degree and types of polymorphisms and genetic differences of Mafa-A1 among three native Southeast Asian populations (Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Filipino) and to investigate how the allele differences between macaques and humans might have evolved to affect their respective immune responses, we identified 83 Mafa-A loci-derived alleles by DNA sequencing of which 66 are newly described. Most alleles are unique to each population, but seven of the most frequent alleles were identical in sequence to some alleles in other macaque species. We also revealed (1) the large and dynamic genetic and structural differences and similarities in allelic variation by analyzing the population allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg's equilibrium, heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity profiles, and phylogeny, (2) the difference in genetic structure of populations by Wright's FST statistic and hierarchical analysis of molecular variance, and (3) the different demographic and selection pressures on the three populations by performing Tajima's D test of neutrality. The large level of diversity and polymorphism at the Mafa-A1 was less evident in the Filipino than in the Vietnam or the Indonesian populations, which may have important implications in animal capture, selection, and breeding for medical research.

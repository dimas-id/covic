BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE When percutaneous image-guided biopsies are not possible for retroperitoneal tumor of unknown origin (RTUO), surgical tissue diagnosis becomes necessary. Laparotomy and laparoscopic surgery are current standard treatments; however, the laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) approach offers many potential benefits. We describe our technique for LESS biopsy of RTUO. PATIENTS AND METHODS Five patients underwent LESS biopsy for diagnosis of RTUO. A multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space through a 3-cm skin incision, which adequately exposed the retroperitoneal tumor. The specimen was grasped and isolated circumferentially from the surrounding tissue. RESULTS LESS surgery was performed successfully without any complications such as open conversion. Mean operative time was 183 min and estimated blood loss was negligible. The diagnoses were IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis (n = 4) and lymphoma (n = 1). Sufficient specimens were safely obtained not only for pathological diagnosis but also for further examinations such as immunophenotyping or DNA analysis. Convalescence was satisfactory. All patients were treated appropriately according to the resulting diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS LESS biopsy for RTUO is a safe and effective alternative to open surgical and standard laparoscopic biopsies. Further studies of clinical experiences are needed to confirm the benefits of this new technique.

OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility of applying a postoperative clinical pathway after robotic nephroureterectomy (RNU) targeting safe omission of a pelvic drain and removal of the bladder catheter on the day after surgery with hospital discharge on postoperative day 1 (POD#1). METHODS We reviewed a prospectively collected database of all RNUs performed by a single surgeon (R.A.) since institution of our clinical pathway in 2008 that includes pelvic drain omission, bladder catheter removal the morning after surgery, and discharge on POD#1. Patient demographics, and perioperative and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Ability to adhere to the pathway and achieving the described parameters and whether any resulting complications occurred were determined. RESULTS RNU was performed in 29 patients with mean age and body mass index of 69 years (50-90 years) and 30 kg/m(2) (19-41 kg/m(2)), respectively. No patient required a pelvic drain, and 2 were discharged with a catheter. All but 2 patients (93%) were discharged on POD#1. Overall, successful pathway application was achieved in 26 of 29 patients (90%) including no drain, catheter removal on the morning after surgery, and discharge on POD#1. No patient developed urine leak or other complications related to early catheter removal. CONCLUSION Our clinical pathway after RNU allows safe omission of a pelvic drain with early discontinuation of the bladder catheter and discharge on the POD#1 in most patients. To our knowledge, similar pathways have not been previously achieved with nephroureterectomy by any approach, but should be considered by surgeons treating urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract.

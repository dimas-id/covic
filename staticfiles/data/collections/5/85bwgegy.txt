The goal of this submission is to describe how and when to best use hemostats, sealants, and adhesives as well as to compare their characteristics and to update the surgical toolbox with respect to any new products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of this date (November 2009). The materials will be presented in 3 major groups each containing specific categories: (1) hemostats; mechanical, active, flowable, and fibrin sealant, (2) sealants; fibrin sealant, polyethylene glycol polymer, and albumin and glutaraldehyde, (3) adhesives; cyanoacrylate, albumin and glutaraldehyde, and fibrin sealant. The categories will be used for comparisons based on safety, efficacy, usability, and cost. Recommendations with respect to how and when to best use these materials will be presented. A review of the recent literature is also provided with respect to the most recent uses of these materials in specific surgical specialties.

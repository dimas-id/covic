BACKGROUND This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of total laparoscopic sigmoid and rectal surgery without abdominal incision in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). METHODS From May 2010 to October 2011, 34 patients with colon and rectal tumors were treated by total laparoscopic surgery without abdominal incision, and the clinical data of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS All operations could be successfully accomplished without conversion to open surgery. No diverting ileostomy was created. The average operative time was 151.60 (range, 125-185) minutes. The average blood loss was 200.20 (range, 55-450) ml. All resection margins were negative. Six patients developed postoperative anastomotic leakage. There were no reports of other complications in all patients. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study indicated that total laparoscopic sigmoid and rectal surgery in combination with TEM was a safe, feasible, and minimally invasive technique. This advanced surgical technique was developed by combining laparoscopy with the concept of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery.

Biological aging represents the major risk factor for the development of heart failure (HF), malignancies, and neurodegenerative diseases. While risk factors such as lifestyle patterns, genetic traits, blood lipid levels, and diabetes can contribute to its development, advancing age remains the most determinant predictor of cardiac disease. Several parameters of left ventricular function may be affected with aging, including increased duration of systole, decreased sympathetic stimulation, and increased left ventricle ejection time, while compliance decreases. In addition, changes in cardiac phenotype with diastolic dysfunction, reduced contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy, and HF, all increase in incidence with age. Given the limited capacity that the heart has for regeneration, reversing or slowing the progression of these abnormalities poses a major challenge. In this chapter, we present a discussion on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies and HF in aging and the potential involvement of specific genes identified as primary mediators of these diseases.

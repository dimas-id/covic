Aims: The coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19) global outbreak has resulted in unprecedented pressures on health services, the need to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and the need for health experts to utilize their knowledge and expertise to fight this virus. The simulation training objective of this study was to enhance the neonatal, maternity, and anesthetics teams' preparedness for the management of the emergency delivery of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.Methods: Three clinical simulation training sessions were conducted in March 2020 at the University Hospital Plymouth, Plymouth, UK. The neonatal, maternity, and anesthetics clinical teams participated in these joint training sessions in the obstetric emergency theater.Results: Each session lasted for around an hour. Suggestions were discussed and recommendations made. The key changes were: first, floor plan adjustment, increase of the clinical area by converting some offices to clinical spaces, and standard operating procedures for transporting patients; second, enhancement of the efficiency of the communication and coordination between the clinical teams; third, availability of extra support for the staff in the Central Delivery Suite (CDS); and fourth, introduction of a neonatal care pathway to manage neonatal resuscitation in such an emergency.Conclusions: Collaboration and joint training between the different clinical teams involved in the care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients was proven to be one of the most effective ways of improving performance.

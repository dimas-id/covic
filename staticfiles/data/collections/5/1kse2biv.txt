OBJECTIVES This study aimed to identify the causes of recurrent pneumothorax and to evaluate the results of repeated video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for recurrent pneumothorax after VATS wedge resection for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). METHODS A retrospective review was conducted on 188 patients with recurrent PSP, of a population of 1414 patients who underwent VATS wedge resection for PSP. Reoperations were performed when an air leak persisted longer than 3 days after closed thoracostomy, when a visible bulla of greater than 1 cm on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was observed and when rerecurrence took place after other treatments. The HRCT findings before and after recurrence were compared to evaluate the type of the new bulla. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the additional procedure performed during the first operation; in Group I, a coverage procedure was performed, and in Group II, mechanical pleurodesis was performed after VATS wedge resection. RESULTS During a median follow-up period of 27.7 months, 76 patients underwent repeated VATS for ipsilateral recurrent PSP after VATS. The indications for repeated VATS were the presence of a bulla on HRCT in 41 patients and a persistent air leak in 35 patients. Group I comprised 36 patients and Group II comprised 40 patients. The HRCT findings showed no bulla in 3 (4%) patients, were suspicious for a bulla in 11 (15%) patients, showed a bulla at the staple line in 26 (34%) patients and showed a new bulla in a location other than on the staple line in 36 (47%) patients. The frequency of new bullae was not different between the 2 groups, but Group I showed a lesser tendency for bullae to occur at the staple line than Group II. Dense fibrosis around the staple line was also found intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Repeated VATS was a feasible method to treat recurrent PSP after VATS for PSP.

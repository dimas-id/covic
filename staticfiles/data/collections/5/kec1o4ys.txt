Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which invades a cell through binding to the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 priming. Patients with severe disease predominantly present with pneumonia-related symptoms. However, evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection also has implications for the urogenital tract. Thus, urogenital organs should be considered when treating COVID-19.

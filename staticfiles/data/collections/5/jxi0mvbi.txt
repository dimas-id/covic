RESULTS The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a primary challenging public health issue for not only China but also the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the pandemic of COVID-19 had become a public health emergency of global concern. As of May 12, 2020 COVID-19 has been reported in over 180 countries/regions, with a total of 4,178,156 confirmed cases and over 280,000 deaths. The risk of cross-infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be elevated between dental specialists and patients due to the peculiarity of dental practice. Therefore, detailed and effective infection control measures are imminently needed to prevent nosocomial coronavirus infection. This paper, based on proven effective experience, relevant guidelines, and research, not only presents the fundamental knowledge about the name, etiologic characteristics, epidemiologic characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, transmission routes and risk points of SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics but also provides recommended protective measures for dental professionals to interdict the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics. Classification schemes as well as color identification according to the results of the questionnaire survey and temperature measurement in precheck and triages are innovations proposed in this paper.

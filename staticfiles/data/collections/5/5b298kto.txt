The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a serious issue affecting thousands of people worldwide. It is known that a substantial proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 have abnormal liver function tests; however, the consequences of this information is still not clear. Here we present the first case report of a patient with liver cirrhosis and COVID-19 in our centre. Resolution of COVID-19 symptoms was observed after six days of fever onset. We observed only slight fluctuations of liver enzymes, bilirubin levels and INR without clinical consequences in our case. We suggest testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus on any cirrhotic patient on initial presentation, even without symptoms of COVID-19 in areas where the epidemic was prevalent.

Abstract A digoxigenin-labeled gene probe for yellow head virus (YHV) was used to detect gill-associated virus (GAV) in Penaeus monodon from Australia via in situ hybridization. In GAV-infected shrimp, positively reacting tissues included: lymphoid organ, gills, antennal gland, and cuticular epithelium of the stomach. This demonstrates that a YHV probe can be used as a diagnostic tool for GAV and supports previous suggestions that these two viruses are closely related.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to audit our results after implementation of a standardized operative approach to laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer within a fast-track recovery program. METHODS From January 2009 to February 2011, 100 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic surgery on an intention-to-treat basis for rectal cancer. The results were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively collected database. Operative steps and instrumentation for the procedure were standardized. A standard perioperative care plan was used. RESULTS The following procedures were performed: low anterior resection (n = 26), low anterior resection with loop-ileostomy (n = 39), Hartmann's operation (n = 14), and abdominoperineal resection (n = 21). The median length of hospital stay was 7 days; 9 patients were readmitted There were 9 cases of conversion to open surgery. The overall complication rate was 35%, including 6 cases (90/%) of anastomotic leakages requiring reoperation. The 30-day mortality was 5%. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 15 (range, 2 to 48). There were 6 cases of positive circumferential resection margins. The median follow-up was 9 (range, 1 to 27) months. One patient with disseminated cancer developed port-site metastasis. CONCLUSIONS The results confirm the safety of a standardized approach, and the oncological outcomes are comparable to those of similar studies.

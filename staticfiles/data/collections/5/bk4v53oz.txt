Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification technique performed under isothermal conditions. The output of this amplification technique includes multiple different sizes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structures which are identified by a banding pattern on gel electrophoresis plots. Although this is a specific amplification technique, the complexity of the primer design and amplification still lead to the issue of obtaining false‐positive results, especially when a positive reading is determined solely by whether there is any banding pattern in the gel electrophoresis plot. Here, we first performed extensive LAMP experiments and evaluated the DNA structures using microchip electrophoresis. We then developed a mathematical model derived from the various components that make up an entire LAMP structure to predict the full LAMP structure size in base pairs. This model can be implemented by users to make predictions for specific, DNA size dependent, banding patterns on their gel electrophoresis plots. Each prediction is specific to the target sequence and primers used and therefore reduces incorrect diagnosis errors through identifying true‐positive and false‐positive results. This model was accurately tested with multiple primer sets in house and was also translatable to different DNA and RNA types in previously published literature. The mathematical model can ultimately be used to reduce false‐positive LAMP diagnosis errors for applications ranging from tuberculosis diagnostics to E. coli to numerous other infectious diseases.

Since the beginning of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 2 lopinavir/ritonavir was selected for treatment. The recent publication of Cao et al in the NEJM[1] showed that lopinavir/ritonavir treatment did not accelerate clinical improvement compared with standard of care. This raised the question if we in retrospect could have known this. The aim of this paper is to gather all the available evidence and to comprehensively discuss this issue.

The earliest possible diagnosis and understanding of the infection mechanisms play a crucial role in the outcome of fighting viral diseases. Thus, we designed and developed for the first time, novel bioconjugates made of Ag-In-S@ZnS (ZAIS) fluorescent quantum dots coupled with ZIKA virus via covalent amide bond with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) biopolymer for labeling and bioimaging the virus-host cell interactions mechanisms through confocal laser scanning microscopy. This work offers relevant insights regarding the profile of the ZIKA virus-nanoparticle conjugates interactions with VERO cells, which can be applied as a nanoplatform to elucidate the infection mechanisms caused by this viral disease.

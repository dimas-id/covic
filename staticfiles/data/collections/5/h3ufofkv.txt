INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly grown into a public health emergency that has placed the national health systems as well as scientific research communities under enormous pressures. Drug repurposing or repositioning is a well-known strategy that seeks to deploy existing licensed drugs for newer indications and provides the quickest possible transition from bench to clinics for unmet therapeutic needs. Given the current, urgent, and dire need for effective therapies against novel coronavirus-19, this approach is particularly appealing. AREAS COVERED: Here, we review the significant anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties of minocycline as potential mechanisms for efficacy against the novel coronavirus and highlight the promises and pitfalls of this approach. EXPERT OPINION: As compared to other agents being investigated for COVID-19, minocycline offers distinct advantages in terms of potential efficacy in patients with life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and myocardial injury, well-known safety and interaction profile, relatively low costs, and widespread availability. We call upon public and private funders to facilitate urgent and rigorous research efforts before evidence-based recommendations for its widespread use can be made.

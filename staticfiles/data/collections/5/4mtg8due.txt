COVID-19 is the illness caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Although myalgia is common in adults, it has not been noted as a common symptom in children. There have been a few reported cases of COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis in adults. This case report describes a 16-year-old boy who presented with fever, myalgias, mild shortness of breath with exertion, and dark-colored urine. COVID-19 PCR was positive. His initial creatinine kinase (CK) level was 427,656 U/L. Serum creatinine was normal for age. He was treated with isotonic intravenous fluids containing sodium bicarbonate to maintain urine output of 100â€“200 mL/h and urine pH > 7.0. His serum creatinine remained normal throughout the hospital stay and he was discharged on hospital day 12 with a CK of 6526 U/L. To our knowledge, no pediatric cases of COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis have been previously reported. Adult cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported and a few reports have noted patients with elevated CK levels without rhabdomyolysis. Given this pediatric case of COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis, pediatric clinicians should be aware of this complication and manage fluids appropriately in order to prevent acute kidney injury.

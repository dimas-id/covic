The respiratory and the female reproductive systems are not embryologically or functionally related. However, the reproductive system can exert significant effects on the respiratory system as a result of the various hormonal changes that occur during a womanâ€™s menstrual cycle and especially during pregnancy. In addition, there are several unique gynecologic and/or obstetric conditions that can directly affect the respiratory system. The following chapter reviews the effects of pregnancy on the respiratory system, as well as the special issues concerning the management of common respiratory conditions (e.g., pneumonia, asthma) during pregnancy. In addition it reviews several gynecologic disorders with unique pulmonary complications.

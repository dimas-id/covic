Embolization of wide-necked and/or giant aneurysms may fail due to the inability to pass across the aneurysm neck. We describe the rapid bull-back technique used in four patients in which a small diameter microcatheter with the aid of a hydrophilic microguidewire was navigated along the inner surface of the aneurysm, making a loop in the dome, exiting the neck to reach distal intracranial vessels. After withdrawal of microguidewire, the microcatheter is pulled back rapidly up to a predetermined length. This maneuver results in elimination of the loop, straightening the microcatheter to allow an exchange procedure for another device to cross the neck distally and continue the embolization procedure. The rapid pull-back technique is useful during the endovascular treatment of wide-necked and/or giant aneurysms as it helps to achieve reliable access to the distal parent vessel with the microcatheter. This is of increasing importance since an increasing number of aneurysms will be treated in the future with refinements in various intracranial stents.

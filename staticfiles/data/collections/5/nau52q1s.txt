INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in China. There are no available vaccines or antiviral drugs for COVID-19 patients. Herein, we represented possible therapeutic agents that may stand as a potential therapy against COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov for relevant papers. We showed some agents with potentially favorable efficacy, acceptable safety as well as good pharmacokinetic profiles. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID-19. However, some drugs were withdrawn due to their side effects after demonstrating some clinical efficacy. Indeed, the most effective therapies could be organ function support, convalescent plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies, especially anti-influenza drugs due to the similarities between respiratory viruses regarding viral entry, uncoating, and replication. We encourage giving more attention to favipiravir, remdesivir, and measles vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: A combination, at least dual or even triple therapy, of the aforementioned efficacious and safe therapies is greatly recommended for COVID-19. Further, patients should have a routine assessment for their coagulation and bleeding profiles as well as their inflammatory and cytokine concentrations.

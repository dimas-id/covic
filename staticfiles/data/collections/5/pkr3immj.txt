We report dynamics of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 infections detected by IgG ELISA in 177 individuals diagnosed by RT-PCR. Longitudinal analysis identifies 2-7% of individuals who do not seroconvert even weeks after infection. They are younger and less severely affected than seroconverters. Higher antibody responses are associated with symptomatic disease, older age, ethnicity, increased co-morbidity and higher inflammatory markers such as C Reactive Protein. Antibody responses do not decline during follow up almost to 2 months. Serological assays increase understanding of disease severity. Their application in regular surveillance will clarify the duration and protective nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV.

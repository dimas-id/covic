Influenza viruses cause a significant public health burden each year despite the availability of anti-influenza drugs and vaccines. Therefore, new anti-influenza virus agents are needed. Rhamnan sulfate (RS) is a sulfated polysaccharide derived from the green alga Monostroma nitidum. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the antiviral activity of RS, especially against influenza A virus (IFV) infection, in vitro and in vivo. RS showed inhibitory effects on viral proliferation of enveloped viruses in vitro. Evaluation of the anti-IFV activity of RS in vitro showed that it inhibited both virus adsorption and entry steps. The oral administration of RS in IFV-infected immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice suppressed viral proliferation in both mouse types. The oral administration of RS also had stimulatory effects on neutralizing antibody production. Fluorescent analysis showed that RS colocalized with M cells in Peyer’s patches, suggesting that RS bound to the M cells and may be incorporated into the Peyer’s patches, which are essential to intestinal immunity. In summary, RS inhibits influenza virus infection and promotes antibody production, suggesting that RS is a potential candidate for the treatment of influenza virus infections.

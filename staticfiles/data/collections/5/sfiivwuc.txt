AIMS: COVID-19 is a global pandemic that as of the 4th May has registered over 3 585 711 confirmed cases and 248 780 deaths. This review aims to estimate the prevalence of both cardiometabolic and other co-morbidities in patients with COVID-19 infection, and to estimate the increased risk of severity and mortality in people with co-morbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, Scopus and the World Health Organisation (WHO) website for Global research on COVID-19 were searched from January 2019 up to April 23, 2020. Study inclusion was restricted to English language publications, original articles that reported prevalence of co-morbidities in individuals with COVID-19 disease, and case-series >10 patients. 18 studies were selected for inclusion. Data were analysed using random effects meta-analysis models. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with a total of 14 558 individuals were identified. The pooled prevalence for co-morbidities in patients with COVID-19 disease was 22.9% (95% CI: 15.8 to 29.9) for hypertension; 11.5% (9.7 to 13.4) for diabetes; and 9.7% (6.8 to 12.6) for cardiovascular disease (CVD). For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebrovascular disease, and cancer, the pooled prevalences were all less than 4%. With the exception of cerebrovascular disease, all other co-morbidities had a significantly increased risk for having severe COVID-19. In addition, the risk of mortality was significantly increased in individuals with CVD, COPD, CKD, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with COVID-19, the presence of co-morbidities (both cardiometabolic and other) is associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. These findings have important implications for the public health with regards to risk stratification and future planning. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

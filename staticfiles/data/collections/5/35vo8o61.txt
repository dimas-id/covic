The Covid-19 pandemic creates a need to protect healthcare workers from patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures which may transmit the SARS CoV-2 virus. Existing personal containment devices (PCDs) may protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from respiratory droplets but not from potentially dangerous respiratory-generated aerosols. We describe a new PCD and its aerosol containment capabilities. The device ships flat and folds into a chamber. With its torso drape and protective arm sleeves mounted, it provides contact, droplet, and aerosol isolation during intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Significantly improved ergonomics, single-use workflow, and ease of removal distinguish this device from previously published designs.

The spectrum of lung diseases associated with HIV is broad, and many infectious and noninfectious complications of HIV infection have been recognized. The nature and prevalence of lung complications have not been fully characterized since the Pulmonary Complications of HIV Infection Study more than 15 years ago, before antiretroviral therapy (ART) increased life expectancy. Our understanding of the global epidemiology of these diseases in the current ART era is limited, and the mechanisms for the increases in the noninfectious conditions, in particular, are not well understood. The Longitudinal Studies of HIV-Associated Lung Infections and Complications (Lung HIV) Study (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00933595) is a collaborative multi-R01 consortium of research projects established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to examine a diverse range of infectious and noninfectious pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected persons. This article reviews our current state of knowledge of the impact of HIV on lung health and the development of pulmonary diseases, and highlights ongoing research within the Lung HIV Study.

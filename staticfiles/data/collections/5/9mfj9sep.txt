COVID-19, a new viral disease affecting primarily the respiratory system and the lung, has caused a pandemic posing serious challenges to healthcare systems around the world. In about 20% of patients, severe symptoms occur after a mean incubation period of 5 – 6 days; 5% of patients need intensive care therapy. Mortality is about 1 – 2%. Protecting healthcare workers is of paramount importance in order to prevent hospital-acquired infections. Therefore, during all procedures associated with aerosol production, personal protective equipment consisting of a FFP2/FFP3 (N95) respiratory mask, gloves, safety glasses and a waterproof overall should be used. Therapy is based on established recommendations issued for patients with acute lung injury (ARDS). Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and adequate management of organ failure are the mainstays of therapy. In case of fulminant lung failure, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a rescue in experienced centres. New, experimental therapies are evolving with ever increasing frequency; currently, however, no evidence-based recommendation is possible. If off-label and compassionate use of these drugs is considered, an individual benefit-risk assessment is necessary, since serious side effects have been reported.

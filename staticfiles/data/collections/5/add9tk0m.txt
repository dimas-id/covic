Abstract The use of specific care bundles to control infection has been demonstrated to be effective, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, the proposal of VAP rates as a quality indicator has generated debate due a lack of a gold standard definition. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) replaced surveillance definitions from VAP to other preventable conditions related to mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated events: VAE), which may predict outcomes. This represents a new opportunity to overcome many of the weaknesses of traditional VAP surveillance and broadens the focus of surveillance encompassing other preventable conditions related to mechanical ventilation.

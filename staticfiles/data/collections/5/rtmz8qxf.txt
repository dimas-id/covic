In the past 30 years, composite microvascular free tissue transfer has become a popular and highly successful option for the reconstruction of defects in the head and neck region. However, inherent shortcomings exist with free tissue transfer in that the imported tissue often fails to adequately replicate the characteristics of the native tissues. This can lead to difficulties when attempting reconstruction from a surgical and prosthetic standpoint. Endosseous implants are often required to adequately retain prostheses, and management of the peri-implant soft tissues represents a critical challenge for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. This report describes a novel technique for controlling the implant-abutment-soft tissue interface and the advantages of this technique as it pertains to orofacial reconstruction.

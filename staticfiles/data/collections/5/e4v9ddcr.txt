The purpose of this study was to assess the value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for the diagnosis of severe respiratory diseases based on interpretation of sequencing results. BALF samples were harvested and used for mNGS as well as microbiological detection. Infectious bacteria or fungi were defined according to relative abundance and number of unique reads. We performed mNGS on 35 BALF samples from 32 patients. The positive rate reached 100% in the mNGS analysis of nine immunocompromised patients. Compared with the culture method, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 88.89% and a specificity of 74.07% with an agreement rate of 77.78% between these two methods. Compared with the smear method and PCR, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 77.78% and a specificity of 70.00%. In 13 cases, detection results were positive by mNGS but negative by culture/smear and PCR. The mNGS findings in 11/32 (34.4%) cases led to changes in treatment strategies. Linear regression analysis showed that diversity was significantly correlated with interval between disease onset and sampling. Dynamic changes in reads could indirectly reflect therapeutic effectiveness. BALF mNGS improves sensitivity of pathogen detection and provides guidance in clinical practice. Potential pathogens can be identified based on relative abundance and number of unique reads.

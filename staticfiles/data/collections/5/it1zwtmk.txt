Acute family stress in this article is defined as the sudden or unexpected onset of moderate to severe discomfort or disequilibrium and feeling of inadequacy among family members in light of perceived insufficient available resources. Historically, there has been some ambivalence about stress—especially acute stress—and family life education. More recently, authors have suggested that the important issue determining appropriateness is not the topic but the approach used by the professionals. Several approaches are presented here that have been used by professionals to help children and families dealing with acute stress. They include care for self, identify acute stress, support caregivers and central figures in social networks, help families understand stress and coping, help adults talk with children, connect families with the familiar, collaborate with other professionals, and advocate for families.

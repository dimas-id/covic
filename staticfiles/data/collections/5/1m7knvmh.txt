Several network growth models have been proposed in the literature that attempt to incorporate properties of citation networks. Generally, these models aim at retaining the degree distribution observed in real-world networks. In this work, we explore whether existing network growth models can realize the diversity in citation growth exhibited by individual papers â€“ a new node-centric property observed recently in citation networks across multiple domains of research. We theoretically and empirically show that the network growth models which are solely based on degree and/or intrinsic fitness cannot realize certain temporal growth behaviors that are observed in real-world citation networks. To this end, we propose two new growth models that localize the influence of papers through an appropriate attachment mechanism. Experimental results on the real-world citation networks of Computer Science and Physics domains show that our proposed models can better explain the temporal behavior of citation networks than existing models.

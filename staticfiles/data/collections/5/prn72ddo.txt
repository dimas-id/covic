Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms from the past decade are in the continuous efforts of changing the impact of sequencing on our current knowledge about plant genes, genomes, and their regulation. Holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum L. or sanctum L.) genome sequencing has also paved the path for deeper exploration of the medicinal properties of this beneficial herb making it a true ‘elixir of life.’ The draft genome sequence of the holy basil has not only opened the avenues for the drug discovery but has also widened the prospects of the molecular breeding for development of new improved plant varieties.

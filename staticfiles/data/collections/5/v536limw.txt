Abstract This prospective observational cohort study is based on the first 500 patients who requested emergency teleconsultation during the initial days of the COVID-19 lockdown in Paris, France between 20 March and 10 April 2020. It is the first study to assess the utility of emergency teleophthalmology with a simple smartphone application or web browser and a webcam to manage emergency eye care in a population with sudden restricted access to ophthalmologists. In this study, every patient who asked for an ophthalmic emergency consultation in a single specialized center in Paris (‘SOS Œil’) first had to undergo a teleconsultation appointment to evaluate the indication for a physical consultation to preserve lockdown. Under medical advice only, a physical appointment was given within a day (if necessary). The aim of the study was to describe the population and diagnoses and evaluate the main judgment criteria, defined as the ‘ability of teleconsultation to properly indicate a physical consultation for fair diagnosis and treatment in eye emergencies’. This organization has permitted physicians and patients to preserve social distancing while avoiding 3 or 4 physical consultations per person. Notably, 27% of teleconsultations were followed by a physical appointment. There was a mean 4.12-day delay between symptom apparition and consultation, and less than 1 day for traumas, superficial corneal foreign body and neuro-ophthalmological emergencies. There was a 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity to properly evaluate the indication of a physical consultation and only 1.0% misdiagnoses that lead to delayed care. Hence, teleconsultation maintained satisfactory healthcare access to patients with severe ophthalmological disorders while preserving social distancing and sanitary precautions. Therefore, teleconsultation may be seriously considered as a way to efficiently regulate ophthalmic emergencies, especially for patients with limited access to a specialist.

Sonographers need to be familiar with and prepared to implement strategies for reducing the risk of exposure to and transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Strategies to employ can be grouped into three broad categories: (1) whom to scan, (2) where to scan, and (3) how to scan. Whom to scan addresses sonographer strategies for determining essential and emergent scan status. Where to scan addresses sonographer practice strategies for selecting equipment, use of rooms, portable examinations, and training personnel. How to scan addresses the topics of scanning techniques (tailored protocols, right-handed scanning, use of barrier devices) and equipment cleaning and disinfecting.

Abstract Medical waste is a source of generation of hazardous biomedical waste. Medical waste generation and disposal is an important aspect, especially in countries with poor hygiene and high population. Medical centers including hospitals, clinics, and places where diagnosis and treatment are conducted generate wastes that are highly hazardous and put people under risk of fatal diseases. Policies should be framed to avoid spread of infections by providing specification for handling waste for generation, segregation, collection, storage, transportation, and treatment. Awareness should be created at all levels of society through various means of communication and education, so that the risks of spreading the health hazards could be minimized. This chapter deals with medical waste, principles of waste management program, categories of health-care waste, parameters to be monitored in health-care waste, finances to be managed, and national plans for health-care waste.

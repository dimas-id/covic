BACKGROUND In contrast to laparoscopic left pancreatic resection, laparoscopic total duodenopancreatectomy is a procedure that has not been standardized until now. It is not only the complexity that limits such a procedure but also its rare indication. The following article demonstrates the technical aspects of laparoscopic pylorus- and spleen-preserving duodenopancreatectomy. CASE REPORT The indication for intervention in the underlying case was a patient diagnosed with a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I syndrome and a multifocal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) infiltrating the duodenum and the pancreas. The patient was post median laparotomy which was necessary after jejunal perforation due to a peptic ulcer. The resection was carried out entirely laparoscopically, and the reconstruction, which included a biliodigestive anastomosis and a gastroenterostomy, was carried out by means of a median upper abdomen laparotomy of 7 cm in length through which the resected specimen was also removed. The total operative time was 391 min. The blood loss accounted for 250 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the eighth postoperative day. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic pancreatectomy is a treatment option in carefully selected indications. The complexity of the operation demands a high level of expertise in the surgical team.

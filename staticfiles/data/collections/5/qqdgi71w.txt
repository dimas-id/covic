We report here the continued determination and analysis of the nucleotide sequence of both wild type (wt) and cell culture adapted (ca) porcine epidemic diarrhoea coronavirus (PEDV). These studies were undertaken with two objectives in mind: the identification of common and divergent features in the genomic sequences of wt and ca PEDV which can explain the differences in virulence of these isolates and the further exploration of the relationship of PEDV to other coronaviruses.

Challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic require fast and efficient adaptations of the healthcare system. It is vital that every patient has access to nutritional care as a part of primary healthcare services, even if social distancing measures are adopted. Therefore, we propose a simple remote nutritional screening tool and practical guidance for nutritional care in primary practice, and their implementation into telemedicine processes and digital platforms suitable for healthcare providers. The acronym for the tool is R-MAPP, as for Remote – Malnutrition APP, while the tool will be available also as an app. This protocol consists of two simple validated clinical tools for identifying nutritional risk and loss of muscle mass and function –Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (‘MUST’) and SARC-F (5-item questionnaire: Strength, Assistance with walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs and Falls) - and additional practical guidance on nutritional interventions for family physicians.

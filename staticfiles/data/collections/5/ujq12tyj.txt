BACKGROUND This study aims to report glycolipid changes after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in the setting of a prospective randomized clinical trial. METHODS One hundred patients were randomly assigned to RYGB (n = 45) and SG (n = 55). Fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), triglycerides, and serum cholesterol (total, HDL, and LDL) were evaluated at inclusion and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and Î² cell function (HOMA-B) were assessed. RESULTS Mean postoperative 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month excess weight loss was 25.39, 43.47, 63.75, and 80.38 % after RYGB and 25.25, 51.32, 64.67, and 82.97 % after SG, respectively. Mean fasting glucose and fasting serum insulin were similarly and statistically significantly reduced in both RYGB and SG. Mean HOMA-IR improved in both groups, particularly in case of high preoperative values, and mean HOMA-B improved at 1 year after RYGB. HbA1c% dropped from 5.66 % (SD = 0.61) to 5.57 % (SD = 0.32) after RYGB and from 5.64 % (SD = 0.43) to 5.44 % (SD = 0.43) after SG. Total cholesterol was significantly higher at 1 month (p = 0.04), 3 months (p = 0.03), and 1 year (p = 0.005) after SG as compared to RYGB. LDL cholesterol decreased significantly after RYGB at 1 month (p = 0.03), 3 months (p = 0.0001), and 1 year (p = 0.0004) as compared to SG. HDL cholesterol was increased at 1 year in the RYGB group but not in the SG group. Triglycerides decreased similarly in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Short-term glycemic control was comparable after SG and RYGB. An improved lipid profile was noted after RYGB in patients with abnormal preoperative values.

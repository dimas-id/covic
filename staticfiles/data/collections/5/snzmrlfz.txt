BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) allows better cosmesis and decreased pain when compared with traditional laparoscopy (TL). Instrument crowding and diminished triangulation are limitations. This study evaluates a novel single-port surgical platform (NSP) designed to facilitate the transition from TL to LESS (TransEnterix SPIDER, Durham, NC). METHODS NSP and TL were compared using standardized dry lab tasks. Feasibility of NSP in gynecology was assessed using the porcine model. RESULTS Completion times with NSP were longer for ring transfer (P = .025) and trended longer for disc cutting (P = .074). Disc cutting accuracy was lower with NSP versus TL (P = .008). NSP operative times for hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic node dissection were 22.3, 13.3, and 26 minutes, respectively, without complications. Fatigue and lack of integrated bipolar cautery were limitations of NSP. CONCLUSION While application of NSP to gynecology appears feasible, lower performance when compared with TL underscores the need for caution when applying NSP to humans.

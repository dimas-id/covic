Abstract Nearly half of Veterans have obesity, fueling chronic diseases. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers an evidence-based behavioral weight management intervention called MOVE!, mostly delivered through in-person group sessions. Few eligible Veterans participate due to factors like distance and preferences, mirroring barriers in the general population. Practical alternatives to standard in-person programs are needed to improve access and engagement. A self-directed lifestyle intervention called D-ELITE—delivered through pre-recorded videos by DVD or online streaming—previously efficacious in a general primary care population, may provide such an alternative. This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate whether D-ELITE improves weight and general health status among Veterans with obesity, relative to VA usual care. The yearlong intervention includes one orientation by phone, supplemental lifestyle coaching primarily via technology-based messages, 12 DVD or online streaming sessions over 3 months, and continued self-directed weight management for months 4–12. Participants use MyFitnessPal.com or paper booklets for self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity. Follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 months are administered by mail or phone. The study hypothesis is that compared with usual care, D-ELITE will lead to greater improvements in 12-month weight loss, per VA electronic health records, and general physical health status, assessed using the self-reported SF-12 physical composite score. We will also explore D-ELITE's effects on secondary biometric (e.g., HbA1c) and intermediate (e.g., diet) outcomes, reach, and budget impact. If effective, D-ELITE will offer a potentially scalable, low-cost alternative to VA's existing weight loss interventions by mitigating barriers presented by distance and technology.

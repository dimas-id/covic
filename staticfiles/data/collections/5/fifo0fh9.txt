AIM To describe our 13-year experience in laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma. METHOD We performed a retrospective analysis of case notes of 29 patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma between 2000 and 2013. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients (16 female), aged 16 to 67 years, underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma. All patients were treated preoperatively with alpha-blocking agents. 80% were prescribed additional preoperative antihypertensive agents. 90% received antihypertensive agents intraoperatively. All patients received intraoperative magnesium sulphate for haemodynamic stabilisation. The mean operative time was 160 minutes. Nearly all of the patients experienced haemodynamic stability during surgery. Two patients required conversion to open adrenalectomy, due to severe intraoperative hypertension during tumour handling, and due to extensive intra-abdominal adhesions. Postoperative complications were minimal, and included blood loss, superior epigastric artery damage, and cellulitis at the laparoscopic port site. There was no perioperative mortality. The median length of stay postoperatively was 4 days. 24% were prescribed antihypertensive medication on discharge. CONCLUSION In our experience, favourable perioperative outcomes were achieved, demonstrating that laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma is a safe and effective procedure in the setting of experienced and skilled surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams delivering the perioperative care.

Thoracoscopic pulmonary lobectomy (TPL) techniques in infants and children are presented practically with concise descriptions and numerous illustrations. TPL is the treatment of choice for congenital pulmonary airway malformation and intralobar pulmonary sequestration, both now commonly diagnosed prenatally. Timing of surgery is somewhat controversial in asymptomatic cases with small isolated lesions. Incomplete fissures and history of chest infections are most problematic. Thorough understanding of anatomic relations preoperatively is vital for successful outcome and thin-slice computed tomography with 3D reconstruction of vessels is valuable. Judicious placement of trocars and switching instruments between trocars improves visualization and safety. Specific techniques for all commonly performed TPL are included.

Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on non-HIV antiviral agents. The development of antiviral agents to treat non-HIV infections is largely focused on therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis infections B and C. Nucleoside analog continue to be the mainstay of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) therapeutics. The first small molecule inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the NS3 protease inhibitor BILN-2061, entered phase 2 clinical trials, producing a striking reduction in viral load in treated individuals. The development of the HCV replicon system and its application to screening for antiviral agents provided tangible benefit with the disclosure of mechanistically and structurally diverse HCV inhibitors. Adefovir dipivoxil has been approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of HBV, providing a second small molecule antiviral to add to lamivudine (3TC) and the injectable protein IFNÎ± as the only approved agents for treating HBV infection. The chapter also provides details of the inhibitors of hepatitis B and C virus, the inhibitors of simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus, the inhibitors of respiratory viruses and the inhibitors of West Nile virus and Papilloma virus.

As new information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly discovered, clinicians are better equipped to make informed decisions for their patients. While current research suggests COVID-19 viral antigen is not found in vaginal secretions, its detectability in the female lower genital tract may have clinical implications for obstetric and gynecologic care for women. We present a case of a woman at 31 weeks' gestation with simultaneous upper respiratory symptoms and vulvovaginitis. She was found to have a vulvar lesion positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-COVID by viral swab. This case shows that COVID-19 is detectable in the vulva. This may have implications for health care workers' exposure and personal protective equipment needs. While vertical transmission has largely not been reported, the presence of detectable virus in the female lower genital tract makes this a continued possibility and area of study. KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 is detectable in the female lower genital tract.. · The detection of COVID-19 in the vulva may have implications for personal protective equipment use.. · The detection of COVID-19 in vulvovaginal lesions makes vertical transmission a continued possibility..

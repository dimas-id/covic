PURPOSE OF REVIEW Due to the exponential growth of international exchange, millions of travelers are exposed to respiratory pathogens in the tropics and may return ill. Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the more prevalent infections. RECENT FINDINGS The acquisition of infections in the tropics, including community-acquired pneumonias, has been described for several centuries. During recent decades some microorganisms have been disclosed as causative of the disease (Legionella pneumophila in 1976 and hantavirus in 1990); other microorganisms are real new pathogens that were not previously demonstrated to have a pathogenic role in humans (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus producing an outbreak in 2003 and H5N1 avian influenza virus producing an increasing number of human cases over the last few years). SUMMARY A number of microorganisms may produce pneumonia in people who live or have traveled to tropical zones. History, including geography and epidemiology, physical exam and complementary workout are precious tools for the diagnosis, therapy and prevention. Exposure to microorganisms in tropical areas may show different patterns. A high index of suspicion, detailed investigation of travel, exposure history of the patient, and a basic understanding of the incubation periods and distribution of the various potential pathogens are imperative for the diagnosis.

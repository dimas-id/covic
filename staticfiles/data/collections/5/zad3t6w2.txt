PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SILC) is an emerging procedure in the field of minimally invasive colon and rectal surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this procedure. METHODS Between July 2009 and April 2010, SILC was performed for 35 patients presenting with pathology of the colon. Surgical procedures included right hemicolectomy, sigmoid resection, and total colectomy. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, and short-term postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Thirty two of the 35 patients (91.4%) underwent successful completion of SILC while 3 patients required laparoscopic modifications. The mean incision length was 3.4 cm with a range of 2-6 cm. The mean total operative time (OT) for right, left, and total colectomies was 158.8 ± 31.8 min, 127.0 ± 37.1 min, and 216.3 ± 72.6 min, respectively. Overall, the OT was not significantly different between patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (147.9 ± 47.9 min) compared to those with a BMI <25 kg/m(2) (123.1 ± 40.9 min). In the subset of patients with malignant disease, the mean lymph node extraction was 23.5 ± 12.0 and all margins were negative. There were no intraoperative complications, and the overall mean length of hospital stay was 2.9 ± 1.0 days (range 2-6 days). The postoperative morbidity rate was 11.4%. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is a safe and feasible procedure for benign and malignant diseases of the colon. This modality can be successfully applied for various colorectal procedures without conversion to open surgery, resulting in a short length of hospital stay and a minimal short-term complication rate.

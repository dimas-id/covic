AIMS Stapled transanal mucosectomy is widely used by a lot of surgeon and in RCT, when compared to other haemorrhoidectomy techniques, it didn't show a real primacy. We describe results obtained with a new device, the EEA™ 33-mm Hemorrhoid and Prolapse Stapler Set con DST Series™ (Covidien™), used on 65 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-five patients underwent a stapled transanal mucosectomy for grade III (n° 20), IV (n° 15) haemorrhois and rectal prolapse (n° 30). The operation were performed by two surgeons. Results. Resected tissue had a mean width of 4.2 cm (3.3-6.1 cm) and a mean weight of 11 g (8-21 g). Surgical time were 22 min (15-35 min). Bleeding of the suture line were observed in 5 cases (7.7%) and they required a mean of 2 haemostatic stitch (1-5) in adsorbable suture 2/0. Mucoprolapsectomy was considered excellent in 55 patients (84.7%), good in 8 patients (12.3%), bad in 2 patients (3%) by surgeons. There were no early and late complications like bleeding, abscesses, anastomotic dehiscence. We report two case of perianal haematoma that don't need any treatment and one case of anal stenosis treated with dilatation therapy. Post-operative pain, estimated with VAS, emphasized an excellent response to NSAIDs in first postoperative day, in 10 cases (15.4%) we prolonged analgesic therapy for 3 days, in one case (1.5%) for one week. After 6 month all patients were revaluated with physical examination and anoscopy. Only one patient (1.5%) had an asymptomatic recurrence of rectal prolapse. CONCLUSION We conclude that the new device makes easy and standardized surgery. The new device reduce a lot of difficult in patients with tight pelvis and a small distance between ischiatic tubers.

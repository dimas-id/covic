With a few exceptions, all secretory and plasma membrane proteins studied to date are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Then, they are transported by successive vesicle budding and fusion from the ER through the Golgi stacks to the plasma membrane following the general intracellular transport route referred to as secretory pathway (originally reviewed in 1). Gap junction connexins have been shown to follow this pathway.

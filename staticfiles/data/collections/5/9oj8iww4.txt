BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a rapidly emerging approach to gallbladder disease. METHODS From February 2009 to September 2010, 60 patients were subjected to single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In all the patients, a 12-mm incision was made in the umbilicus and a 2-trocar technique was applied. Gallbladder was suspended with 2 sutures and the procedure was accomplished with standard partly reusable laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS In all, 41 women (68.3%) and 19 men (31.7%) were enrolled in this study. Mean age was 50.7 years (range = 17-72 years), mean body mass index was 26.2 kg/m(2) (range = 18.3-37.7 kg/m(2)) and mean operative time was 52.6 minutes (range = 30-120 minutes). No mortality or morbidity was recorded and hospital stay was less than 24 hours. At follow-up visits, no complications were recorded and cosmesis was excellent. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be safely performed with conventional instrumentation with minimal cost.

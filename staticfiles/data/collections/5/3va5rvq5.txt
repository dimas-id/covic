Abstract The infection of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is initiated by the binding of the spike glycoprotein S to sialic acids on the chicken host cell. In this study we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike of the prototype IBV strain M41. By analyzing the ability of recombinantly expressed chimeric and truncated spike proteins to bind to chicken tissues, we demonstrate that the N-terminal 253 amino acids of the spike are both required and sufficient for binding to chicken respiratory tract in an α-2,3-sialic acid-dependent manner. Critical amino acids for attachment of M41 spike are present within the N-terminal residues 19–69, which overlap with a hypervariable region in the S1 gene. Our results may help to understand the differences between IBV S1 genotypes and the ultimate pathogenesis of IBV in chickens.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this article is to compare the results of endovascular treatment of ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms with ruptured aneurysms of other anatomic locations. METHODS Fifty consecutive ruptured aneurysms of the MCA and 209 aneurysms at other anatomical locations were selected retrospectively. We compared epidemiological, clinical and radiological variables, prognosis and complications. RESULTS The MCA aneurysms had a greater size and a poor dome/neck ratio. There were no significant differences in endovascular technique complications, occlusion rate or rebleeding between the two groups (p > 0.1). There were no significant differences in the mortality and number of dependent patients after one month. CONCLUSION The endovascular treatment of ruptured MCA aneurysms without hematoma is as safe and effective as other aneurysm localizations. Complication rates, occlusion rates and rebleeding of ruptured MCA aneurysms are comparable to other locations.

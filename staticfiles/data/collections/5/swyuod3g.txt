In COVID-19, lung manifestations present as a slowly evolving pneumonia with insidious early onset interstitial pulmonary edema that undergoes acute exacerbation in the late stages and microvascular thrombosis. Currently, these manifestations are considered to be only consequences of pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. We are proposing a new hypothesis that neurogenic insult may also play a major role in the pathogenesis of these manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) may play a role in the acute exacerbation of pulmonary edema and microvascular clotting in COVID-19 patients.

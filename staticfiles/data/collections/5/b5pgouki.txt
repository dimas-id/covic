BACKGROUND Endoscopic ultrasound training has a learning curve greater than the other endoscopic therapeutic techniques. One of the preclinical teaching methods is the use of ex vivo porcine models. AIM To describe five ex vivo porcine models for training in therapeutic echoendoscopic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using porcine digestive tract containing esophagus, stomach, duodenum, spleen, liver and gallbladder, five models for therapeutic echoendoscopy training were described. With other segments of the porcine pieces (such as the bladder, spleen segment and omentum segment) and with easily accessible materials (such as grape and ultrasound gel), lesions were simulated to be treated. These models were applied in the Hands on course at the IRCAD (Institut de recherche contre les cancers de l'appareil digestif) Barretos of 2017. Endoscopic equipment and instruments are the same as those used in clinical practice. RESULT The models are easily reproducible and do not require exchange during the hands on course period. Endoscopic and echographic imaging and tactile sensitivity are similar to the real one. CONCLUSION The models described in this study demonstrated to be realistic, easy to reproduce and allow repetition during the same session. However, comparative studies are necessary to verify the real impact on teaching.

INTRODUCTION Endometriomas are present in up to 44% of all women with endometriosis and have a detrimental effect on fertility. However, it is controversial whether endometriomas should be surgically removed before assisted reproduction technology. Our purpose was to evaluate whether surgical stripping of endometriomas in subfertile women improves the chance of a live birth. Secondary outcomes were impact on ovarian reserve and pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with results reported in accordance to the PRISMA guidelines. A summary of findings table was developed using GRADE. We searched Medline and Embase. Two reviewers performed the screening. RESULTS Of 686 manuscripts, we included one randomized controlled trial and nine retrospective cohort studies, mostly of low quality. The odds ratio for live birth after surgery [compared with conservative management before in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] was 0.87 (95% CI 0.64-1.18, six studies, I2 = 3%; ⨁◯◯◯, VERY LOW quality). The mean difference of antral follicle count was -2.09 (95% CI -4.84 to 0.67, four studies). No difference was observed regarding antral follicle count between the two groups (MD -2.09, 95% CI -4.84 to 0.67, four studies, ⨁◯◯◯, VERY LOW quality). Pain outcome was not reported in the included studies. CONCLUSION The very low quality evidence suggests no difference in odds ratio of live birth between women who underwent surgery for endometriomas before IVF/ICSI compared with conservative management. Further high quality studies are needed, but due to a lack of convincing evidence favoring surgery, we recommend considering conservative treatment if the only indication is subfertility.

BACKGROUND Primary laparoscopic repair of unilateral inguinal hernias has not achieved widespread recognition mainly because of concerns over safety. METHODS Prospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program between 2005 and 2010. Complications in patients undergoing unilateral first-time, elective laparoscopic unilateral inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) were compared with open inguinal hernia repair (OIHR). RESULTS Of 37,645 identified patients, 6,356 (16.9%) underwent LIHR and 31,289 (83.1%) underwent OIHR. Both groups had similar 30-day overall complications, major complications, and mortality rates: 62 (1.0%) vs 307 (1.0%), P = 1.00; 31 (.5%) vs 173 (.5%), P = .57; and 1 (.02%) vs 16 (.05%), P = .34, respectively. Using multivariable logistic regression, overall complications showed no difference, OR 1.01 (95% CI .76 to 1.34; P = .94), as did major complications, OR .90 (95% CI .61 to 1.34; P = .62), although favoring the LIHR group, where OR and CI represent the odss ratio and confidence intervals. CONCLUSION These data demonstrate no significant difference between elective unilateral LIHR and OIHR with regard to 30-day morbidity and mortality.

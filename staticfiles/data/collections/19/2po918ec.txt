The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the world from its origin in Wuhan, China in late 2019. The resultant disease (COVID-19) has placed an enormous burden on healthcare systems because of the high transmission rates, prevalence of severe disease and mortality [1]. The risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers has been a concern since the start of the outbreak and the first person to raise concerns about the illness to the international community was Dr Li Wen-Liang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan who sadly died of the disease that he likely contracted whilst at work [2].

Field trials were conducted using an inactivated rotavirus vaccine for prevention of calf neonatal diarrhea. For the trials, 458 pregnant cows from 26 herds were involved. In each herd, cows which had been inseminated within a period of two months were selected and randomly subdivided in two groups. Cows in one group (248 head in total) were vaccinated 6 weeks before calving and again 4 weeks later; cows in the other group (210 head in total) were left as unvaccinated controls. At calving, colostrum was collected from each cow and stored at -30°C until used for feeding calves. The newborn calves, beginning the second day of life and for the next 7–10 consecutive days, each was fed a daily supplement of 400 ml of colostrum from its dam. The diarrhea occurred in 86 (40.9%) calves that had received colostrum from unvaccinated dams (normal colostrum), and in 7 (2.8%) calves which were fed colostrum from vaccinated dams (immune colostrum). The disease was very severe in the normal colostrum-fed calves and 52 of them died. Those calves which survived the disease underwent a significant loss of condition. By contrast, the 7 immune colostrum-fed calves displayed a rather mild enteric condition, and all recovered without any sequela being observed.

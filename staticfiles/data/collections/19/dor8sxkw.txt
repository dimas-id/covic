OBJECTIVE To describe a hospital outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and summarize the clinical features and therapeutic approaches. METHODS Clinical data in this cohort were collected prospectively as they were identified. RESULTS The outbreak started with a SARS patient from the community on 30 January 2003, followed by a total of 96 people [76 women and 20 men; mean age (29.5 +/- 10.3) years; 93.8% of whom were health care workers] infected in a short period of time after their exposure to this source patient. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 20 days, with a mean of (5.9 +/- 3.5) days. The initial temperature was (38.3 +/- 0.6) degrees C, while the highest was (39.2 +/- 0.6) degrees C (P < 0.001), with a mean fever duration of (9.0 +/- 4.2) days. Other common symptoms included fatigue, cough, mild sputum production, chills, headache, general malaise and myalgia. The radiographic changes were predominantly bilateral and in the middle or lower lung zones. Leukopenia was observed in 67.7% of this cohort. The mean lowest oxygen saturation was (94.8 +/- 3.1)% with supplementary oxygen through a nasal cannula. 68.8% of the patients were treated with methylprednisolone for a mean period l of (4.9 +/- 2.4) days. The initial dose was (67.3 +/- 28.2) mg/d and the maximal dose was (82.4 +/- 30.5) mg/d. Ninety-five patients (99.0%) had a complete clinical recovery, and 1 patient died of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome. The mean hospitalized duration was (17.2 +/- 8.0) days. CONCLUSION SARS appears to be highly contagious and potentially lethal among health care workers, characterized by acute onset and rapid progression. Corticosteroids, antibiotics, human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, and antiviral drugs, although used empirically, might be of some benefits in shortening the clinical course.

The COVID-19 epidemic was listed as a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO on January 30, 2020. To curb the secondary spread of the epidemic, many public places were equipped with thermal imagers to check the body temperature. However, the COVID-19 pneumonia has concealed symptoms: the first symptom may not be fever, and can be shortness of breath. During epidemic prevention, many people tend to wear masks. Therefore, in this demo paper, we proposed a portable non-contact healthy screening system for people wearing masks, which can simultaneously obtain body temperature and respiration state. This system consists of three modules viz. thermal image collection module, health indicator calculation module and health assessment module. In this system, the thermal video of human faces is first captured through a portable thermal imaging camera. Then, body temperature and respiration state are extracted from the video and are imported into the following health assessment module. Finally, the screening result can be obtained. The results of preliminary experiments show that this syetem can give an accurate screening result within 15 seconds. This system can be applied to many application scenarios such as community and campus.

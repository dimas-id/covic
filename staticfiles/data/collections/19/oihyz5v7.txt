BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged and caused the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide. METHODS: We did a retrospective study and included COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 29, 2020. Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen. RESULTS: 112 patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhoea. All patients underwent antibody tests. Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both IgM and IgG, 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG. IgM antibody appeared within a week post disease onset, and lasted for one month and gradually decreased, while IgG antibody was produced 10 days after infection, and lasted for a longer time. However, no significant difference in level of IgM and IgG antibody between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that serological tests could be powerful approach for the early diagnosis of COVID-19.

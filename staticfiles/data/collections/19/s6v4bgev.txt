Abstract A key goal to controlling COVID-19 is developing an effective vaccine. Development of a vaccine requires knowledge of what constitutes a protective immune response and also features that might be pathogenic. Protective and pathogenic aspects of the response to SARS-CoV-2 are not well understood, partly because the virus has infected humans for only 6 months. However, insight into coronavirus immunity can be informed by previous studies of immune responses to non-human coronaviruses, to common cold coronaviruses, and to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we review the literature describing these responses and discuss their relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.

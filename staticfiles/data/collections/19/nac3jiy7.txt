OBJECTIVE To present the initial clinical experience in children undergoing unilateral and bilateral laparoendoscopic single-site nephrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed our experience with pediatric patients who had undergone single-port nephrectomy (SPN) at our institution since August of 2009. Access was obtained by using the Hassan technique to place a 2-cm SILSâ„¢ Port (Covidien Surgical Devices, Norwalk, CT), which contains a gas insufflation channel and three individual cannulas that can readily accommodate laparoscopic instruments up to 12 mm in diameter. Nephrectomy was performed using a standard set of laparoscopic instruments and a rigid 5 mm 30 degree laparoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) with an end-on light source. Patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative treatment parameters were collected and recorded. RESULTS SPN was successfully performed in three consecutive pediatric patients (one female and two male patients: aged 11, 10, and 13 years, respectively) without placement of additional trocars or conversion to open surgery. The operative time for the unilateral SPN was 188 minutes, whereas bilateral SPNs required 214 and 300 minutes, respectively. Estimated blood loss for the unilateral and bilateral SPNs was 25, 20, and 30 mL; whereas patients were discharged on postoperative days 1, 3, and 12, respectively. The prolonged hospital stay was secondary to fever and pseudomembranous colitis in a patient with dialysis who also required a blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS Laparoendoscopic single-site simple nephrectomy is a technically demanding yet feasible procedure in children. Further studies are necessary to define the indications, advantages, and limitations of this technique as compared with standard laparoscopy.

Polyclonal antibodies have a century-old history of being effective against some viruses and, recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown some clinical success. Human mAbs to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike glycoprotein have been developed by several research groups at an amazing pace. These antibodies potently neutralize infectious virus in tissue cultures and animal models, and, alone or in combination with vaccines and other drugs, may have potential for the prevention and treatment of SARS.

In this work, we explored the acid-induced unfolding pathway of non-porin outer membrane protein (OMP), an immunogenic protein from Salmonella Typhi, by monitoring the conformational changes over a pH range of 1.0–7.0 by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, ANS binding, acrylamide quenching, and dynamic light scattering. The spectroscopic measurements showed that OMP in its native state at pH 7.0 exists in more stable and compact conformation. In contrast, at pH 2.0, OMP retains substantial amount of secondary structure, disrupted side chain interactions, increased hydrodynamic radii, and nearly four-fold increase in ANS fluorescence with respect to the native state, indicating that MG state exists at pH 2.0. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by acrylamide further confirmed the accumulation of a partially unfolded state between native and unfolded state. The effect of pH on the conformation and thermostability of OMP points towards its heat resistance at neutral pH (T (m) ~ 69 °C at pH 7.0, monitored by change in MRE(222 nm)). Acid unfolded state was also characterized by the lack of a cooperative thermal transition. All these results suggested that acid-induced unfolded state of OMP at pH 2.0 represented the molten globule state. The chemical denaturation studies with GuHCl and urea as denaturants showed dissimilar results. The chemical unfolding experiments showed that in both far-UV CD and fluorescence measurements, GuHCl is more efficient than urea. GuHCl is characterized by low C (m) (~1 M), while urea is characterized by high C (m) (~3 M). The fully unfolded states were reached at 2 M GuHCl and 4 M urea concentration, respectively. This study adds to several key considerations of importance in the development of therapeutic agents against typhoid fever for clinical purposes.

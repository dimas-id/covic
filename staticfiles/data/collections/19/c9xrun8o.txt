Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute enteric disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). In China, variant PEDV causes severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets, leading to very high morbidity and mortality. However, the pathogenesis of PEDV is still not fully understood. In our study, we analyzed the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression profiles of PEDV GDgh16 in infected Vero cells at 60 h postinfection. A total of 61,790 annotated mRNAs, 14,247 annotated lncRNAs and 1290 novel lncRNAs were identified. A total of 227 annotated lncRNAs and 13 novel lncRNAs were significantly and differentially expressed after viral infection. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases were used to identify genes adjacent to the lncRNAs, and it was found that these lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to immune and antiviral responses. Next, we selected candidate lncRNAs and their predicted target genes for study. RT-qPCR demonstrated that these lncRNAs and genes were differentially expressed after PEDV infection. Our study investigated the function of lncRNAs involved in PEDV infection, providing new insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV.

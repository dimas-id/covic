Reduced port laparoscopic surgery has been used increasingly. It is a concept that has grown out of the various efforts aimed at minimally invasive surgery, with SILS being the ultimate reduced port technique. Reduced port laparoscopic surgery has been used to perform sleeve gastrectomy in bariatric surgery and excision of benign gastric submucosal tumor, applications that generally do not require lymph node dissection or complicated reconstruction. It can be done safely, result in a permanent cure, and offer good cosmetic outcomes. Reduced port laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer has a short history, and its usefulness has not yet been fully established. This review describes the present situation and challenges faced as well as standardized procedures and the future prospects of reduced port laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer, which my team performs almost daily. These aspects of reduced port laparoscopic surgery are presented in light of the literature.

INTRODUCTION This systematic review examines the excess cost of chronic conditions on the economic burden of cancer survivorship among adults in the US. Areas covered: Twelve published studies were identified. Although studies varied substantially in populations, comorbidities examined, methods, and types of cost reported, costs for cancer survivors with comorbidities generally increased with greater numbers of comorbidities or an increase in comorbidity index score. Survivors with comorbidities incurred significantly more in total medical costs, out-of-pocket costs, and costs by service type compared to cancer survivors without additional comorbidities. Expert commentary: Cancer survivors with comorbidities bear significant excess out-of-pocket costs and their care is also more expensive to the healthcare system. On-going evaluation of different payment models, care coordination, and disease management programs for cancer survivors with comorbidities will be important in monitoring impact on healthcare costs.

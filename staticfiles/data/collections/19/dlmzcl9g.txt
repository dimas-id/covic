McIntosh, K. A. Z. Kapikian, H. C Turner, J. W. Hartley, R. H. Parrott and R. M. Chanock. (Lab. of Infectious Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, Md. 20014) Sero-epidemiologic studies of coronavirus infection in adults and children. Amer. J. Epid., 1970, 97: 585–592-A seroepidemiologic study of infection by coronavirus strains 229E, OC38, OC43, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A-59, is described. In adults with upper respiratory disease, two “outbreaks” of coronavirus infection occurred, one during the winter of 1965–1966 associated with complement fixing (CF) antibody responses to OC38, OC43 and MHV, and the other during the following winter associated with CF antibody responses to 229E. In hospitalized children, infection with 229E was rare; infection with OC38, OC43, and MHV occurred less often in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract disease (3.5%) than in a control group with non-respiratory tract disease (8.2%). The limitations of the CF test using available coronavirus antigens are discussed.

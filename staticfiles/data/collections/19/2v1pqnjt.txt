The enduring outbreak of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) originated from China illustrates global concerns owing to their infective nature and time-consuming incubation. Even though diagnostic tools based on RT-PCR are being extensively employed at present, well-timed and precise diagnostics are still restricted because of the long-period and exhaustive man-power requirement. To tackle this problem, we herewith report the fabrication of the surface functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (MNP’s) and viral RNA-extraction protocol for potential detection of COVID-19. The zinc ferrite nanoparticles were prepared by combustion synthesis and its surface was functionalised by silica and carboxyl-modified polyvinyl alcohol. The MNP’s were characterized to confirm the nano-scale appearance and functionalization. The proposed model may provide the ability to extract the viral RNA from several specimens through automation process. In light of ease and proficiency, this protocol may significantly lessen the operation period and necessities for the present molecular-level diagnostic of COVID-19.

UNLABELLED Hypertension is a major public health concern that is increasing in prevalence. Lifestyle and pharmacological management are not always sufficient to control blood pressure and treatment-resistant hypertension is a recognized clinical challenge. Renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) represents a new frontier in the treatment of resistant hypertension. RESULTS from the Symplicity HTN-1 and HTN-2 trials have demonstrated evidence that suggests RSD can safely reduce blood pressure in patients with this condition. More research is needed to verify these data, clarify unanswered questions and assess future applications of RSD. This review provides a detailed overview on the history of hypertension, treatment-resistant hypertension, the rationale behind RSD, current evidence and potential future applications of RSD. An overview of current and upcoming RSD devices is also included.

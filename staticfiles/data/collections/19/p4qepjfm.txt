Influenza virus continues to be a major cause of respiratory infection and is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in at-risk populations, including those with underlying pulmonary conditions such as asthma. Vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine remains the most popular method in controlling influenza through prevention. Current guidelines recommend the administration of the influenza vaccine to all patients with asthma. However, a third or fewer of those patients with asthma are currently receiving this vaccine. In this review, the risk-versus-benefit of influenza vaccination in children and adults with asthma is evaluated, based on the current evidence.

We report a case of extensive acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) presenting with severe diffuse abdominal pain and impending small bowel infarction. The patient was successfully treated with ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis (EKOS endowave system; Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts), which resulted in prompt recanalization of his portal vein (PV) and its tributaries. The patient eventually had ischemic stricture that necessitated bowel resection. However, we believe that our technique was successful in rapidly restoring the patency of the PV and its tributaries, and therefore, avoiding a life-threatening complication of more extensive bowel infarction. To our knowledge, the use of ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis in treatment of PVT has not been previously described in the literature.

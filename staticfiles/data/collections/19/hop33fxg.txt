In a previous note we made an analysis of the spreading of the COVID disease in Italy. We used a model based on the logistic and Hubbert functions, the analysis we exploited has shown limited usefulness in terms of predictions and failed in fixing fundamental indications like the point of inflection of the disease growth. In this note we elaborate on the previous model, using multi-logistic models and attempt a more realistic analysis.

In the last moths the world was faced with the pandemic of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the majority of the Nations have yet to come out of it. Numerous assays have emerged to meet SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic needs. A clear knowledge of these assays parameters is essential to choose the proper test by clinical microbiologists. Unfortunately, the latter cannot be the unique criterion that guides test selection as - given the great demand - shortcomings of commercial kits is also a great issue. Aimed by the intention of overcoming both difficulties we have developed a new qualitative RT-PCR probe based for COVID-19 detection. The system detects three genes of SARS-CoV-2: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) and {beta}-actin gene used as endogenous internal control. The results of our assay show a total agreement with those obtained using a commercially available kit, with the exception of two specimens which did not pass the endogenous internal control. Moreover, our kit was designed to be open either for nucleic acid extraction step or on the RT-PCR assay to be carried out on several instruments. Thus, it is free from the industrial production logics of closed systems and conversely it is hypothetically available for distribution on large numbers in any microbiological laboratories. Presently, the kit is currently distributed worldwide

Microarray data from SARS CoV2 patients helps to construct a gene network relating to this disease. Analysis of these genes, present in network, highlights their biological functions and related cellular pathways. With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal cells with p= 1.37eâˆ’05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix. So, small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease. Understanding the human host response against this virus is very important to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV 2.

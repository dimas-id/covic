Abstract Pulmonary complications are a major cause of perioperative morbidity in the pediatric population. Although preexisting pulmonary pathologic processes in children can present significant challenges to anesthetic delivery, a thorough assessment of the problem combined with meticulous anesthetic management allows most children to undergo surgical interventions without long-term adverse sequelae. Asthma, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease continue to pose challenges during anesthesiology. Consultation with a pediatric pulmonologist is indicated when appropriate for specific problems as outlined in this chapter; a team approach may markedly improve operative and postoperative outcomes.

Acute kidney injury (AKI), albuminuria and hematuria are common in Covid-19 and have been shown to increase mortality. Assessment with a urinary dipstick and creatinine at admission should be completed with a urinary sediment and quantification of albuminuria if positive. SARS-Cov-2 seems to enter and infect the endothelium and kidney cells, and contributes to damage in addition to hypercoagulability, multi organ failure and hyperinflammation. Underhydration and rhabdomyolysis can contribute to acute tubular necrosis. Anti-inflammatory treatment may be considered and discussed with a nephrologist. Treatment with ACEi/ARBs should be continued if possible.

Phenomenon of RNA-induced gene silencing is a highly conservative mechanism among eukaryotic organisms. Several classes of small RNAs (siRNAs and miRNAs) 21-25 nt in length, which play a significant role in the processes of development of an organism, occurred important components of antiviral defence in animals and plants. This review shortly describes the main stages of gene silencing mechanism, features of antiviral RNA silencing in plants, invertebrates, mammals, ways of suppression of RNA-interference by viruses, as well as possible approaches of utilization of abovementioned phenomenon for struggling against viral infections.

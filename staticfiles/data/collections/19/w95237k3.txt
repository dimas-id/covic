There has been a rapid increase in the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in most Western countries over the past thirty years. Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is a common premalignant lesion of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, although the risk of developing cancer in BE remains low. Therefore, screening is not recommended in the general population. Surveillance of BE is recommended to detect high grade dysplasia or carcinoma in an early stage, although there is no clear evidence that surveillance leads to a reduced mortality. This review discusses the several screening and surveillance techniques, including chromoendoscopy, narrow band imaging, autofluorescence imaging and confocal laser endomicroscopy, pointing out the areas that are well established as well as the new techniques that require more research.

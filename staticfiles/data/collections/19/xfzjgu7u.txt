Novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has widely spread all over the world and seriously threatened people's health. This disease is currently diagnosed by clinical features, chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Recently, some studies have suggested parenchymal consolidation and air bronchogram in severe cases. However, the effective treatment for COVID-19 patients with bronchogram has not been discussed. Herein, we report a case of 47-year-old woman who suffered from COVID-19 with bronchogram. These findings revealed that the body temperature and clinical laboratory test all returned to normal after this patient received a prolonged treatment. Furthermore, chest CT showed the bronchogram and consolidation resolved and nucleic acid retest of SARS-CoV-2 was also negative. These results provide an important reference for treatment option of COVID-19 with bronchogram.

In late 2013, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection recurred in South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that isolates from the outbreaks were most closely related to emergent US strains of PEDV. These US strainâ€“like PEDV variants are prevalent in South Korea and responsible for recent outbreaks in the country.

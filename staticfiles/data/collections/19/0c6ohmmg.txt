Pooling experiments date as far back as 1915 and were initially used in dilution studies for estimating the density of organisms in some medium. These early uses of pooling were necessitated by scientific and technical limitations. Today, pooling experiments are driven by the potential cost savings and precision gains that can result, and they are making a substantial impact on blood screening and drug discovery. A general review of pooling experiments is given here, with additional details and discussion of issues and methods for two important application areas, namely, blood testing and drug discovery. The blood testing application is very old, from 1943, yet is still used today, especially for HIV antibody screening. In contrast, the drug discovery application is relatively new, with early uses occurring in the period from the late 1980s to early 1990s. Statistical methods for this latter application are still actively being investigated and developed through both the pharmaceutical industries and academic research. The ability of pooling to investigate synergism offers exciting prospects for the discovery of combination therapies.

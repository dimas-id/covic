[Image: see text] The known methods for synthesis of thioxopyrimidines and their condensed analogs with exocyclic sulfur atom are summarized and discussed. The most popular approaches are based on [3+3], [4+2], [5+1] cyclization processes or domino reactions. The literature data analysis shows that the title compounds possess diverse biological activities, such as antioxidant, radioprotective, analgesic, antiinflammatory, antihypertensive, anxiolytic, anamnestic, anticonvulsant, antimicrobial, fungicidal, herbicidal, antiviral, and anticancer.

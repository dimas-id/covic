Publisher Summary The cell surface is covered with protein molecules that are held in the membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane segments or glycosyl–phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Antigens found on cell surfaces comprise not only those encoded by the cell itself but also the products of intracellular parasites. Soluble ligands may be bound to receptor structures on the cell membrane or lectin-like molecules bound to cell-surface carbohydrate structures. The molecules that form an integral part of the cell surface may be proteins, glycoproteins, or glycolipids. They subserve one of three major functions: adhesion, antigen recognition, or receptors for soluble mediators. However, many cell-surface molecules possess more than one function—for example, molecules involved in cell–cell or cell–extracellular matrix adhesion can also themselves be involved in signal transduction. The cell-surface antigens of leukocytes have been intensively studied because of ease of access to this cellular compartment.

Peritonitis is the established term for infective inflammation of the peritoneum, while serositis generally refers to nonorganismal inflammation in any serous cavity, including the peritoneum. In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) literature, however, culture-negative peritoneal inflammation is referred to as "sterile" or "chemical" peritonitis. These terms not only imply unwarranted etiologic assumptions, but may also deflect attention from the existence of medical conditions to which the peritoneum is subject. This is evident in CAPD literature where there is little recognition that the peritoneum, as a member of the serosa and a secretor of lamellar bodies, is prey to a wide range of disorders. Thus before, during, and after CAPD, the membrane is liable to fall victim to disease states unconnected with the process of dialysis. Significant peritoneal pathology occurs as part of a pan-serositis, which may be metabolic (uremia, cholesterolosis), autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid disease, acute rheumatism, endocrinopathies), genetic (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), allergic (eosinophilic serositis), and granulomatous in nature. This paper presents a comparative analysis of histopathological presentation and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in all forms of peritoneal serositis. It incorporates recent advances in molecular biology of the membrane into a holistic reappraisal of peritoneal pathology, revealing hitherto unrecognized homologies in peritoneal reaction to diverse disorders.

BACKGROUND Herein, we report our initial experience with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for partial nephrectomy (LESSPN) using a microwave tissue coagulator (MTC). METHODS Two patients with small and exophytic renal tumors underwent LESSPN. A multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space through a 3-cm skin incision. After tumor exposure, the surgeon introduced a laparoscopic MTC instrument through a 5-mm port and the tumor margin was coagulated circumferentially. After coagulation, the tumor was resected without renal pedicle clamping. RESULTS These procedures were successfully performed without any conversions to standard laparoscopy or need for placement of additional trocars. The operative times were 183 and 160 minutes, respectively. The estimated blood loss was <150 mL in both cases. The final length of the LESS wound was 3 cm. Using the transumbilical approach, the operative scar receded into the umbilicus and was hardly visible. CONCLUSIONS This novel surgical technique is feasible and enables the bloodless resection of a renal tumor without renal pedicle clamping. Further clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to define the benefits of this new technique.

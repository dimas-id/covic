The importance of CTL induced apoptosis as a vital part of the protection of host organisms from pathogenic viruses cannot be overstated. Conversely, the ability of a virus to evade CTL induced apoptosis is equally important to its survival. Important insights in viral pathogenesis and host immunology have been discovered through observations of this constantly evolving interchange. This mini review will build upon previously published comprehensive reviews by reorganizing the anti-apoptotic strategies specific for CTL induced apoptosis and integrating recent discoveries in viral evasion of Fas/FasL and perforin/granzyme mediated apoptosis. This updated look at viral evasion in the context of the CTL response should generate dialogue and provide impetus for research to illuminate interactions between the best defense against viruses and the viral adaptations to evade this defense.

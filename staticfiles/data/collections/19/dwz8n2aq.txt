The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to unprecedented challenges in medical school assessments. Final year high‐stakes assessments have classically used closed book examinations (CBEs). Alternative methods of assessment such as open book examinations (OBEs) are emerging but are not routinely used in final year medical school exams. OBEs encourage the use of problem‐solving skills more akin to those used in real‐life. There is currently limited data comparing OBEs with CBEs. A systematic review showed there was insufficient evidence to support the exclusive use of either CBEs or OBEs in assessment, however the studies conducted to date have rarely looked at high‐stakes assessments due to concerns about the validity of OBEs(1).

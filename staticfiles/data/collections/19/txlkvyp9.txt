Abstract The aim of this study was to examine the influence of dietary flaxseed on the endocrine and ovarian functions of weanling gilts challenged with E. coli and Coronavirus infections treated with dietary probiotic cheeses and to understand the possible mechanisms of its effects on ovarian function. Probiotics were used as a natural substitution for antibiotics and 10% dietary flaxseed is an effective prebiotic which supports the action of probiotics and has other beneficial effects on the organism. Probiotics with or without flaxseed were fed to weanling gilts starting 10 days before and lasting up until 14 days after weaning. The ovaries were measured and histologically analysed. The blood samples for the levels of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were assessed using immunoassays and the levels of fatty acids were assessed using gas chromatography. All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic acid and IGF-I was associated with higher body weight. The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic acid. The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles. These data suggest that flaxseed may suppress the follicle development in weanlings via the stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation via the modulation of the metabolism of selected fatty acids.

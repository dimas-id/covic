Researchers reflect on sociocultural aspects of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and critically analyze the epidemic's effects on pregnant mothers and their babies. We address structural inequalities contributing to poor maternal health in lower-income countries, while reflecting on how the Ebola outbreak highlights the still-marginalized role of pregnant women. Drawing on prior research in West and East Africa, we discuss health care providers' responses to risk of infection during maternity work under normal circumstances and in times of crisis. We end with recommendations for preventing such detrimental effects on the health of pregnant women in the case of another epidemic.

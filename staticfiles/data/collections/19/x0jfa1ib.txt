Abstract Background The prognostic significance of diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) remains unknown. Objectives To assess the risk of ICU admission and morality risk in diabetic COVID-19 patients. Study desing A database search was conducted to identify studies comparing diabetic COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) and those reporting the overall mortality of these patients published up to March 25, 2020 within MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. The main outcome was the risk of ICU admission in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection while the second was the mortality risk in overall diabetic COVID-19 patients. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) as the effect measure with the related 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic. Results Among 1382 patients (mean age 51.5 years, 798 males), DM resulted to be the second more frequent comorbidities. Diabetic patients resulted to have a significant increased risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.79, 95 % CI 1.85–4.22, p < 0.0001, I2 = 46 %). In 471 patients (mean age 56.6 years, 294 males) analysed for the secondary outcome diabetic subjects resulted to be at higher mortality risk (OR 3.21, 95 % CI 1.82–5.64, p < 0.0001, I2 = 16 %). Conclusions Diabetic patients with COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of ICU admission and show an higher mortality risk.

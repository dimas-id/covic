Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and effectiveness of endovenous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for elderly patients. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 140 patients (194 limbs) who underwent RFA for varicose veins of lower extremities. Patients were divided into two groups; elderly patients (more than 75 years old, E-group, n=36) and young patients (under 75 years old, Y-group, n=104), and perioperative data were analyzed and compared between two groups. Results: In E-group, there were more than patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, malignant tumor, and cerebrovascular disease. A partial recanalization was observed in only one limb (0.6%) in Y-group. Endovenous heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) was identified four limbs (2.8%) in Y-group and two limbs (4.1%) in E-group. All EHITs were class 1 by Kabnick classification, and they disappeared within one month after interventions, without antithrombotic therapy. No other major complications were observed. There were no significantly differences for preoperative mean venous clinical severity scores (VCSS) (Y : E=4.84 : 4.47) and postoperative VCSS (Y : E=1.16 : 1.19, 0.35 : 0.58, 0.15 : 0.06, 0.05 : 0.06 at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after) in both groups. Conclusion: RFA for elderly patients is a safe and effective strategy for varicose veins of lower extremities.

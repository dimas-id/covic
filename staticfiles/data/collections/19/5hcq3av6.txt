To study the possible codon usage and base composition variation in the bacteriophages, fourteen mycobacteriophages were used as a model system here and both the parameters in all these phages and their plating bacteria, M. smegmatis had been determined and compared. As all the organisms are GC-rich, the GC contents at third codon positions were found in fact higher than the second codon positions as well as the first + second codon positions in all the organisms indicating that directional mutational pressure is strongly operative at the synonymous third codon positions. Nc plot indicates that codon usage variation in all these organisms are governed by the forces other than compositional constraints. Correspondence analysis suggests that: (i) there are codon usage variation among the genes and genomes of the fourteen mycobacteriophages and M. smegmatis, i.e., codon usage patterns in the mycobacteriophages is phage-specific but not the M. smegmatis-specific; (ii) synonymous codon usage patterns of Barnyard, Che8, Che9d, and Omega are more similar than the rest mycobacteriophages and M. smegmatis; (iii) codon usage bias in the mycobacteriophages are mainly determined by mutational pressure; and (iv) the genes of comparatively GC rich genomes are more biased than the GC poor genomes. Translational selection in determining the codon usage variation in highly expressed genes can be invoked from the predominant occurrences of C ending codons in the highly expressed genes. Cluster analysis based on codon usage data also shows that there are two distinct branches for the fourteen mycobacteriophages and there is codon usage variation even among the phages of each branch.

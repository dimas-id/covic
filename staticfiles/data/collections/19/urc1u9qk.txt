Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), a coronavirus, is an excellent model for the study of thymic and extrathymic T-cell subpopulation disorders induced during viral hepatitis. It was recently reported that, in addition to the intrathymic T-cell differentiation pathway, an extrathymic differentiation pathway of alpha beta-T-cell receptor (TCR) T lymphocytes exists in the liver, and becomes important under pathological situations such as autoimmune diseases, malignancies or hepatic bacterial infections. In the present study, we compared the phenotypes of resident hepatic, splenic or thymic T-cell subpopulations during the acute viral hepatitis induced by HMV3 in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. The number of liver-resident mononuclear cells (MNC) increased during the viral infection, while cellularity decreased. Single positive (SP) CD4+ cells strongly increased in both the liver and thymus, while double positive (DP) (CD4+ CD8+) cells, present in the liver and thymus of mock-infected mice, decreased in C57BL/6 mice during the viral infection. A shift of alpha beta-TCRintermediate T cells toward alpha beta-TCRhigh was evidenced in the liver and thymus of infected mice, but not in the spleen. The few alpha beta-TCRint double negative (DN) (CD4-CD8-) cells also decreased following viral infection. alpha beta-TCRint or high lymphocytes expressing high levels of leucocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) increased in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. In addition, liver-resident T cells expressed strongly the CD44 (Pgp-1) activation marker, suggesting that they were either activated or antigen experienced during the viral infection. No significant change in T-cell subpopulations was detected in the spleen, suggesting that MHV3 infection could induce an early in situ differentiation of resident hepatic T cells rather than a recruitment of lymphocytes from peripheral lymphoid organs.

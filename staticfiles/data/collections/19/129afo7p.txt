Airway hyperreactivity is a hallmark feature of asthma and can be precipitated by airway insults, such as ozone exposure or viral infection. A proposed mechanism linking airway insults to airway hyperreactivity is augmented cholinergic transmission. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that acute potentiation of cholinergic transmission is sufficient to induce airway hyperreactivity. We atomized the cholinergic agonist bethanechol to neonatal piglets and forty-eight hours later measured airway resistance. Bethanechol-treated piglets displayed increased airway resistance in response to intravenous methacholine compared to saline-treated controls. In the absence of an airway insult, we expected to find no evidence of airway inflammation; however, transcripts for several asthma-associated cytokines, including IL17A, IL1A, and IL8, were elevated in the tracheas of bethanechol-treated piglets. In the lungs, prior bethanechol treatment increased transcripts for IFNÎ³ and its downstream target CXCL10. These findings suggest that augmented cholinergic transmission is sufficient to induce airway hyperreactivity, and raise the possibility that cholinergic-mediated regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways might contribute.

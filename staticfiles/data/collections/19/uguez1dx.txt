PURPOSE This study aims to validate the effect of autoclaved autogenous bone (AAB), incorporating Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (ErhBMP-2), on critical-sized, segmental radius defects in rabbits. Delivery systems using absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) and fibrin glue (FG) were also evaluated. METHODS Radius defects were made in 12 New Zealand white rabbits. After autoclaving, the resected bone was reinserted and fixed. The animals were classified into three groups: only AAB reinserted (group 1, control), and AAB and ErhBMP-2 inserted using an ACS (group 2) or FG (group 3) as a carrier. Animals were sacrificed six or 12 weeks after surgery. Specimens were evaluated using radiology and histology. RESULTS Micro-computed tomography images showed the best bony union in group 2 at six and 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative analysis showed all indices except trabecular thickness were the highest in group 2 and the lowest in group 1 at twelve weeks. Histologic results showed the greatest bony union between AAB and radial bone at twelve weeks, indicating the highest degree of engraftment. CONCLUSION ErhBMP-2 increases bony healing when applied on AAB graft sites. In addition, the ACS was reconfirmed as a useful delivery system for ErhBMP-2.

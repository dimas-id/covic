BACKGROUND: Complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) has become a common surgical procedure both in non-elderly and elderly patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the outcomes of the elderly compared to nonelderly undergoing CAWR using propensity score matching. METHODS: All patients who underwent CAWR using porcine-derived, non-crosslinked acellular dermal matrix (ADM) (Strattice™) between January 2014 and July 2017 were studied retrospectively. Propensity matched analysis was performed for risk adjustment in multivariable analysis and for one-to-one matching. The outcomes were analyzed for differences in postoperative complications, reoperations, mortality, hospital length of stay and adverse discharge disposition. RESULTS: One hundred-thirty-six patients were identified during the study period. Non-elderly (aged 18–64 years) constituted 70% (n = 95) and elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) comprised 30% of the overall patient population (n = 41). Seventy-three (56.7%) were females. After adjustment through the propensity score, which included 35 pairs, the surgical site infection (p = 1.000), wound necrosis (p = 1.000), the need for mechanical ventilation (p = 0.259), mortality (p = 0.083), reoperation rate (p = 0.141), hospital length of stay (p = 0.206), and discharge disposition (p = 0.795) were similar. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients undergoing CAWR with biological mesh have comparable outcomes with non-elderly patients when using propensity matching score.

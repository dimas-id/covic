Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a CNS neuroinflammatory disorder, mediated by the pathogenic autoantibody aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG). Current treatment includes long-term use of immunomodulatory therapies, leading to increased rates of infections among this population. It is of interest therefore, to study how the COVID-19 pandemic affects NMOSD patients in terms of their disease activity. A 15-point questionnaire was administered to 33 participants living in Northern California with NMOSD, MS and other related disorders. Although none of the participants were diagnosed with COVID-19, our results show that 2 participants with NMOSD experienced new onset of neurological symptoms and 2 experienced worsening of previous neurological symptoms - suggesting a possible effect of pandemic-related stress on this CNS autoimmune disorder.

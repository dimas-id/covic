Abstract Given the apparent limitation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes to about 30 kb, together with the complexity of DNA synthesis, it appears difficult for a dsRNA genome to encode all the information required before the transition from an RNA to a DNA genome. Ribonucleotide reductase itself, which synthesises deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides, requires complex protein radical chemistry, and RNA world genomes may have reached their limits of coding capacity well before such complex enzymes had evolved. The transition from RNA to DNA thus appears to require intermediate steps, and we suggest that the naturally occurring 2â€²-O-methylated RNA, with chemical properties intermediate between RNA and DNA, is a suitable candidate.

BACKGROUND The safety and feasibility of transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) were demonstrated in the management of rectal cancer. However, its role in the management of patients with diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the rectum (DCHR) has not been evaluated. METHODS A female patient with DCHR was admitted to our hospital. Colonoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abdominal computed tomography (CT) and arteriography were performed. Lesions were detected in mesorectum and rectal wall extending from the dentate line to 5cm proximally. TaTME with a protecting loop ileostomy were performed. The research work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria Agha et al., 2016 [1]. RESULTS TaTME and a protecting loop ileostomy were safely performed, with an intact mesorectal specimen being harvested. The entire procedure took 348min. The estimated blood loss was 100ml. The patient recovered uneventfully. Her symptom of painless rectal bleeding was resolved satisfactorily following the surgery. The histopathological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of DCHR. CONCLUSIONS TaTME appears to be a safe and feasible procedure for patients with DCHR in experienced hands.

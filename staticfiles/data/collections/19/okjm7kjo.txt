One of the main challenges of the measures against the COVID-19 epidemic is to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control its timescale. We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak I Pcan be achieved only at the price of increasing the time t Pof its occurrence and its entire time-span t E. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate α and by increasing the removal rate β by a factor of λ. We show that for a given value of the size (I P, the total, I Eand average I

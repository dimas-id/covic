Purpose There is limited data on the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for large diameter saphenous veins. This study aimed to determine whether the large-diameter great saphenous vein (GSV) affected closure rate, complications, and clinical and quality of life (QoL) improvement. Methods From January 2012 to September 2016, a total of 722 limbs were treated with ClosureFAST RFA in a single center. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the vein diameter measured 3 cm below the saphenofemoral junction (group A ≤ 12 mm, group B > 12 mm). Vein closure was evaluated with duplex scan at 3-5 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The incidence of complications, improvements in symptoms (measured by the Venous Clinical Severity Score [VCSS]) and QoL (measured by the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score [AVSS]) were evaluated. Results Groups consisted of 663 GSVs in group A (mean diameter, 6.00 ± 1.74 mm) and 59 in group B (mean diameter, 13.17 ± 1.28 mm). Vein closure rates at 12 months were 98.9% in group A and 100% in group B (P = 0.428). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications. Both groups showed marked improvements in the VCSS and the AVSS with no significant differences. Conclusion For large-diameter veins, RFA showed comparable outcomes in terms of closure rate, complications, clinical and QoL improvements.

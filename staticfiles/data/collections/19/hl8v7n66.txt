Objective To analyze the risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients infected with COVID-19. Methods We conducted an observational, retrospective study. Patients with severe infection with COVID-19 and suspected PE were included. Results Patients with higher levels of D-dimer and those requiring intubation were at a higher risk of developing PE. Higher D-dimer levels were associated with a greater probability of PE 3, 6, 9 and 12 days after determining D-dimer levels with an OR of 1.7, 2.0, 2.4 and 2.4, respectively. Conclusion In conclusion, patients infected with COVID-19 requiring OTI with higher levels of D-dimer have an increased risk of developing PE.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic that has disrupted supply chains globally. This black swan event is challenging industries from all sectors of the economy including those industries directly needed to produce items that safeguard us from the disease itself, especially personal protection equipment (N95 masks, face shields) and much needed consumables associated with testing and vaccine delivery (swabs, vials and viral transfer medium). Digital manufacturing, especially 3D printing, has been promulgated as an important approach for the rapid development of new products as well as a replacement manufacturing technique for many traditional manufacturing methods, including injection molding, when supply chains are disrupted. Herein we report the use of Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) for the design and large-scale deployment of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for testing of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. NP swabs have been one of society's essential products hardest hit by the supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19. A latticed tip NP swab was designed and fabricated by DLS from a liquid resin previously developed and approved for use to make dental night guard devices. These latticed NP swabs demonstrated non-inferiority in a human clinical study of patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.

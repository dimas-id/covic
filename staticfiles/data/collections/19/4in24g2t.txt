BACKGROUND Conventional laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias is generally performed by using 3 ports. In this study, the authors report their initial experiences of transumbilical single-port transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair of inguinal hernia using a unique "single port." METHODS Since November 2008, transumbilical single-port TAPP was performed in 24 patients with an inguinal hernia. A wound retractor and a surgical glove attached with 5 mm trocar and 2 pipes were inserted through a 1.5 cm-sized transumbilical incision. TAPP procedure was performed similarly compared with conventional laparoscopy. RESULTS Transumbilical single-port TAPP repair of an inguinal hernia was successfully performed in 24 patients (19 male and 5 female; 17 with an indirect hernia and 7 with a recurrent hernia; mean age 54.2 y; mean body mass index 24.2 kg/m). No major or minor intraoperative and postoperative complication was encountered and no conversion to conventional 3-port approach or open surgery was required. Mean operating time was 65.6 minutes and mean hospital stay was 2.1 postoperative days. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical single-port TAPP repair of an inguinal hernia is technically feasible, provides nearly scarless surgery and can be performed safely and effectively in selected patients with an inguinal hernia.

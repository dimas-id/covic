We write at the end of the second week in April, a necessary introduction since anything we say about the Covid-19 pandemic may be relevant only for the next few days. That's about the half-life of perceived wisdom in preventing exposure that may give rise to new cases and in providing medical care to existing cases. At the risk of trying to find lessons for the next pandemic while in the midst of the current one, there is much that we have already learned from this one. Weeks ago, in the early stages of the pandemic, several states and localities were at the same point in the pandemic, but have taken dramatically different paths since then. Why? It is the power of exponentiation in which a couple of days can make a huge difference, a geometric difference in prevalence and outcomes.

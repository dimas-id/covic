In Japan, peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion has been performed by both nephrologists and surgeons. However, nephrologists have fewer opportunities to train in the insertion procedure. We therefore used a PD access simulator to provide training in this operative technique for nephrologists. A PD access simulator developed by Terumo Medical Corporation was used for the training. The simulator uses a mannequin made of acrylic resin. The abdominal wall of a pig is attached to the abdominal area, and a plastic bag represents the abdominal cavity. The simulator enables the surgical procedure to be performed from skin incision to PD catheter insertion. Between October 2011 and December 2013, 3 supervising doctors used the simulator to guide 17 nephrologists with no experience through a PD catheter insertion. One-on-one training was provided in a single 2- or 3-hour session. In a questionnaire survey after the training, trainees gave high marks to the handling of surgical instruments, the environment of the operating room, and the surgical guidance during training. However, the supervising doctors required the ability to respond flexibly, because trainees had individual differences in skills. The PD access simulator might be useful for providing guided training in operative technique for PD catheter insertion.

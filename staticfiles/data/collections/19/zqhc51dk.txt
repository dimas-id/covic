PURPOSE: In-office rhinologic procedures have become popularised in the last decade, especially in North America. Endoscopic nasal polypectomy under local anaesthesia offers instant relief in selected patients with obstructive chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We aimed to analyse patient tolerability during the procedure while measuring its effectiveness. METHODS: A prospective study of patients who underwent in-office microdebrider-assisted polypectomy under local anaesthetic from September 2018 to November 2019 in a Spanish tertiary hospital was performed. The tolerability was measured by monitoring vital signs during the procedure and using a visual analogue scale posteriorly. The effectiveness was calculated through patient-reported outcomes (SNOT-22) and endoscopic evaluation 1 and 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included, with a mean age of 60.7 years. The mean visual analogue scale score was 2.76 out of 10 points. Vital signs were steady overall, with a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.001) in systolic pressure during the procedure. Presyncope and epistaxis were among the few mild complications. However, we registered one major complication that required intensive care admission. There was a 64% reduction in the SNOT-22 score in the first month, with a maintained effect after 6 months. Patients with asthma and a higher polyp load were the subgroups that required more time to achieve significant improvement. CONCLUSIONS: In-office polypectomy is a very effective technique that alleviates obstructive symptoms in patients with nasal polyposis, and it is generally safe and well tolerated when performed by an expert. However, rhinologists must be aware of potentially severe complications.

The role that rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses and human bocavirus play in pediatric pneumonia is insufficiently studied. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study 9 virus groups, including 16 different viruses or viral strains, in 56 ambulatory children with radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The same tests were carried out on 474 apparently healthy control children of the same age and sex. The mean age of children with CAP was 6.5 years (SD 4.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found in 19.6 % of 56 cases and in 2.1 % of 474 controls. Adenoviruses were present in 12.5 % of cases (0.2 % controls) and metapneumovirus and influenza A virus each in 10.7 % of cases (0.2 % controls). Interestingly, rhinoviruses were less common in cases (10.7 %) than in controls (22.4 %): odds ratio 0.36 (95%CI) 0.15â€“0.87) in conditional logistic regression including 56 cases and 280 controls matched for age, sex and sampling month. The prevalence of parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses and human bocavirus were similar in both groups. Conclusion: We conclude that the role of rhinoviruses as an etiology of pediatric CAP has been over-estimated, mainly due to the non-controlled designs of previous studies.

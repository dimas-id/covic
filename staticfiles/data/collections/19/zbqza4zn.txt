INTRODUCTION: Burkholderia cepacia complex is a ubiquitous organism with a high virulence potential. It is found most commonly in moist environments. Hospital outbreaks have been reported from diverse sources such as contaminated faucets, nebulizers, disinfectant solutions, multidose antibiotic vials, tap water, bottled water, nasal sprays, and ultrasound gels. In this article, we present our experience in investigating and successfully managing an outbreak of nosocomial transmission of Burkholderia cepacia sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit at SGT Hospital, Haryana, India. CASE PRESENTATION: During the month of March, multiple Burkholderia cepacia complex isolates were recovered from blood cultures of Caucasian babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital. The organisms were multidrug-resistant, with in vitro sensitivity to meropenem alone (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 Î¼g/ml). An outbreak was suspected, and the neonatal intensive care unit in-charge and hospital infection control teams were alerted. Outbreak investigation was initiated, and surveillance samples were collected. Burkholderia cepacia complex was successfully isolated from suction apparatus. The isolates were phenotypically typed (biotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and found to be identical. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the index case might have been exposed to infection due to a physiological state of low immunity (preterm, low birth weight, and mechanical ventilation). The rest of the cases might have been exposed to this organism due to inadequate hand hygiene/improper cleaning and disinfection practices. Timely reporting and implementation of infection control measures played a significant role in curtailing this outbreak.

This article is written to provide differential diagnostic help for the practitioner who suspects respiratory disease in rodents or rabbits. The authors are laboratory animal veterinarians who work with rodents and rabbits on a herd health basis but also have considerable experience dealing with individual mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils, and rabbits. The article presents descriptions of the presentation, pathology, treatment, and control of the primary respiratory pathogens of these species, along with an explanation of conditions that may confuse the diagnostic efforts. The article also mentions reported pathogens of secondary importance and provides extensive references.

PURPOSE To update the clinical activity of the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP). MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of our clinic database from January 2004 until July 2008. The number of patients referred to the RRRP, relevant demographic data, diagnosis and treatment dispositions were recorded. Time interval between referral to consultation and consultation to simulation were also calculated. RESULTS During the study period, 3,267 patients were seen in the RRRP. Forty-five percent (1,494) of the patients were new to the clinic. Of the 3,267 patients seen, 1,548 (47.4%) were female and 1,719 (52.6%) were male. The median age was 69.2 years (range, 22-101 years). The most common primary sites were lung (34.2%), breast (21.2%) and prostate (17.0%). The majority of patients were referred for palliative treatment of bone metastases (52.4%) or treatment for brain metastases (20.7%). Of the patients referred, 2,311 (70.5%) patients received palliative radiotherapy. The median duration from referral to consultation was 4 days. The majority (82.3%) of patients were simulated and treated within the first 7 days following consultation. CONCLUSION The number of patients referred to the RRRP from January 2004-July 2008 remains comparable to our previous report (1996-2003). The overall median interval from referral to consultation for the analysed time period was 4 days. Therefore, we are continuing to meet our goal of providing rapid access to palliative radiation treatment for symptomatic cancer patients. Further information relating to progression and advancements within the clinic aimed at improving our patients' quality of life are explored.

BACKGROUND Esophagogastrostomy after proximal gastrectomy (PG) is a simple and safe reconstruction, but it leads to a high incidence of reflux esophagitis and impairs postoperative quality of life. We have already reported gastric tube (GT) reconstruction after PG and performed it on more than 100 patients. No studies have reported long-term outcomes after PG-GT. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes, including nutrition indices, such as body weight, serum albumin, total protein, hemoglobin, and ferritin after PG, and observe recovery of upper gastrointestinal tract motility. METHODS We analyzed body weight loss and laboratory findings at our outpatient clinic at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months postoperatively. Manometric recording was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery. RESULTS The percentage change in body weight in the PG-GT group was significantly larger than that in the PG-JI and TG-RY groups at 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery. The levels of hemoglobin and ferritin in the PG-GT and PG-JI groups were significantly higher than those in the TG-RY group at all time points except 6 months after surgery. In the fasted state, the phase III originated at the gastric tube was propagated to the duodenum 3 years after surgery. In the fed state, phasic contractions of the duodenum were in harmony with gastric tube contractions 3 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS PG-GT is the least invasive procedure, and restoration of gastrointestinal motilities in the gastric tube and duodenum may ameliorate body weight loss and nutritional status, including anemia, in patients after PG.

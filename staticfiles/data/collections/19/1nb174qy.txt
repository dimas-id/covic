Abstract Infectious diseases occur based on the interrelationship of the capabilities of the host and the virulence of the microorganism. Each person has a terrain that determines the susceptibility to infection and response to an infection. According to the theory of endobiogeny, the majority of symptoms related to an infectious disease are related to the patientâ€™s response to the infector and not the intrinsic agent itself. This chapter discusses common infectious maladies: rhinopharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, tonsillitis, and bronchitis. For each of these disorders, the neuroendocrine and emunctory elements in the precritical and critical terrain are discussed. Treatment options are discussed based on treating the patient rather than the microorganism.

The thioredoxin (Trx) system is an important enzyme family that regulates cellular redox homeostasis. Protein expression of Trx system family members has been assessed in various cancers and linked to various clinicopathological variables, disease progression, treatment response and survival outcomes but information is lacking in brain tumours. Expression of the system was therefore examined, by immunohistochemistry in different brain tumour types, adult and paediatric cases, to determine if expression was of importance to clinical outcome. Trx system proteins were expressed, to variable levels, across all brain tumour types with significant variations in expression between different tumour types/grades/regions. High Trx reductase (TrxR) expression was linked to worse prognosis across all cohorts. High cytoplasmic TrxR expression was significantly associated with adverse overall survival (OS) in adult glioblastoma (P = 0.027) and paediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) patients (P = 0.012). High expression of nuclear TrxR, cytoplasmic and nuclear Trx and Trx-interacting protein (TxNIP) was associated with improved OS in paediatric LGGs (P = 0.031, P < 0.001, P = 0.044 and P = 0.018, respectively). For patients with high-grade gliomas, both high cytoplasmic TrxR and Trx expression were associated with poor OS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively). In medulloblastoma, high expression of cytoplasmic TrxR and Trx and nuclear Trx was associated with worse prognosis (P = 0.013, P = 0.033 and P = 0.007, respectively); with cytoplasmic TrxR and nuclear Trx remaining so in multivariate analysis (P = 0.009 and P = 0.013, respectively). The consistent finding that high levels of cytoplasmic TrxR are associated with a worse prognosis across all cohorts suggests that TrxR is an important therapeutic target in brain cancers.

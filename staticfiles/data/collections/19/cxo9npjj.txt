Bone-marrow (BM) derived macrophages are sensitive target cells for replication of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3). These cells can be grown in large numbers and the percentage of defined macrophages increased until day 10 when 100% of the cells represented macrophages. MHV3 replicated within these cells to high titers and caused the formation of multi-nucleated giant cells. This effect was seen with very low virus inocula in BM macrophages of C57BL/6 mice that are highly susceptible to in vivo infection with MHV3 whereas macrophages from resistant A/J mice did not show a cytopathic effect at these virus doses. 1000-fold higher virus doses, however, caused the cytopathic effect in macrophages of both C57BL/6 and A/J mice.

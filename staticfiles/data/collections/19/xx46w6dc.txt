Droplet-based microfluidic technologies have proved themselves to be of significant utility in the performance of high-throughput chemical and biological experiments. By encapsulating and isolating reagents within femtoliterâ€“nanoliter droplet, millions of (bio) chemical reactions can be processed in a parallel fashion and on ultra-short timescales. Recent applications of such technologies to genetic analysis have suggested significant utility in low-cost, efficient and rapid workflows for DNA amplification, rare mutation detection, antibody screening and next-generation sequencing. To this end, we describe and highlight some of the most interesting recent developments and applications of droplet-based microfluidics in the broad area of nucleic acid analysis. In addition, we also present a cursory description of some of the most essential functional components, which allow the creation of integrated and complex workflows based on flowing streams of droplets.

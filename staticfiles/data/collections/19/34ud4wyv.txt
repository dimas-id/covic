The development of pleural effusions is a common occurrence in patients with neoplastic disease. In one postmortem study, 15 % of patients who died with malignancies were found to have malignant pleural effusions, and the annual incidence of malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in the United States is estimated to be >150,000 cases. The presence of a MPE often portends a poor prognosis; the mean survival after the diagnosis of a MPE ranges from 3 to 12 months, depending on the underlying tumor (lung cancer is generally associated with the shortest average survival time). Patients with MPE often have symptoms that impair their quality of life, such as dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, and chest discomfort, some or all of which can be improved with palliative therapeutic measures.

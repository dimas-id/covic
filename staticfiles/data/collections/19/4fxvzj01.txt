Abstract In the past decade, Asia has been actively engaged in human genomic studies and has made great contributions to the field. There is an increase in the number of genomics institutes, consortiums, and initiatives across the continent to study the association between genetic variation and disease. Despite these laudable efforts, Asia faces tremendous challenges in terms of funding, regulation, collaboration, and ethical, legal, and social issues related to genomics. These need to be addressed in the near future to promote the development of genomic medicine.

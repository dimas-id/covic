There has been growing interest in the last 10 years in the study of innate immunity, in particular because of the possible role that toll-like receptors (TLR) may play in the pathogenesis of some respiratory disease such as for example, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infections. TLR are a family of type 1 transmembrane proteins, responsible for recognizing molecular patterns associated with pathogens (PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns), and expressed by a broad spectrum of infectious agents. This recognition leads to quick production of cytokines and chemokines which provides a long-lasting adaptive response to the pathogen. Currently, it is considered that the administration of drugs which modulate the activity of these receptors upwards or downwards may represent major therapeutic progress for handling these diseases. The aim of this review is to describe the different TLS, define their possible role in the pathogenesis of the main respiratory diseases and finally, speculate over the therapeutic possibilities which their modulation, agonist or antagonist, offers as possible therapeutic targets.

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a strain of unprecedented scale on health systems around the world. In order to reliably protect medical personnel, and thus to contain the spread of the pandemic, it is essential to provide N95 or N99 (European FFP2 or FFP3) respiratory masks (FFRs). Such masks are currently in extreme shortage: To guarantee their supply sufficiently and for all cases, it would absolutely necessary to reuse them. In recent years, the scientific literature has laid out various possibilities to disinfect the FFRs for their reuse several times. We identify the most promising disinfection methods for the current critical situation (internationally) and project further methods and modifications beyond these.

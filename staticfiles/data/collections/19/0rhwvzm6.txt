ABSTRACT The European Union of Medical Specialities (UEMS) Section of Infectious Diseases agreed on an infectious disease training programme in 1999, which was updated in 2002. Although the provision of infection services throughout Europe is not uniform, with variation in the roles of infectious disease physicians and microbiologists, there are, nonetheles, physicians with a predominant responsibility for clinical infectious diseases (and tropical medicine) in most countries. However, infectious diseases is formally recognised as a specific discipline by most, but not yet all, European countries. There has been consensus from national representatives to the UEMS on the content of the published curriculum. There are clear areas of overlap in training between different infection disciplines, and exploration of possible areas for closer liaison and collaboration between them has been initiated. The increased movement of medical staff within Europe will place greater demands on those responsible for training, monitoring and quality assurance. The Board and Section of Infectious Diseases have established core training programmes with a generic logbook to assist those countries without a written curriculum or record book and facilitate the development of common standards of training. The duration of training varies across Europe; 4 years is the UEMS standard, or longer if the training is combined with general internal medicine. The numbers of infection specialists (infectious diseases and microbiology) per million population show considerable variation. The UEMS Sections have recognised the importance of working closely with European specialist societies involved with training. The Section for Infectious Diseases has, in partnership with the ESCMID, established a Board for the accreditation of continuing medical education/continuing professional development.

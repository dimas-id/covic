BACKGROUND Chyluria is a rare disease in Japan. Lymphatic disconnection is the most effective treatment for patients with Chyluria, and laparoscopic approach is performed as a minimally invasive technique. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of a 40-year-old man who referred to our hospital because of recurrence of chyluria. Chyluria had continued for 20 years, and the patient had received retrograde instillations of silver nitrate three times. The patient underwent retroperitoneoscopic nephrolympholysis, and the chyluria disappeared immediately. One year after surgery, chyluria has not recurred. CONCLUSION We treated a patient with chyluria by performing retroperitoneoscopic lymphatic disconnection and this procedure is less invasive and easy to perform.

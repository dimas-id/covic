BACKGROUND Apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV) has been shown to be involved in obesity and diabetes pathogenesis in animal studies, but its role in humans is uncertain. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to determine the relation of ApoA-IV with changes in glucose metabolism and weight after bariatric surgery. SETTING University Hospital. METHODS The patients (n = 49) included lean controls (n = 8) and patients before and after a mean of 7 months after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n = 12), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 22), or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n = 11). ApoA-IV and other hormone assays were performed in the fasting and the postprandial state. Pearson's correlation analyses controlled for baseline BMI and percent excess weight loss (EWL) were used to determine relationships between ApoA-IV levels and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). RESULTS With all bariatric procedures combined, the change in ApoA-IV [533 versus 518 microg/L, P = .813] or ApoA-IV area under the curve (AUC - 1072 versus 1042, P = .939) was not significant. None of the surgeries individually affected levels of fasting or ApoA-IV AUC. Bariatric surgery resulted in a decrease in HOMA-IR (5.3 versus 2.0, P<.001). In the RYGB group, higher baseline ApoA-IV levels correlated with decrease in HOMA-IR [r = -.6, P = .008]. This relationship was independent of EWL and was not observed in the LAGB or SG group. There was no association of ApoA-IV levels with EWL, insulin secretion, Peptide-YY, or leptin levels. CONCLUSION Preoperative ApoA-IV levels, rather than changes in levels, positively correlate with improvements in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss after RYGB.

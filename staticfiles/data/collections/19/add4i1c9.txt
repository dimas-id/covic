Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has spread worldwide to become a pandemic. Multiple skin manifestations related to the infection have been described progressively. Recalcati(1) asserted that 20.4% of infected patients developed cutaneous manifestations and Galván‐Casas et al(2) have recently proposed 5 clinical patterns (pseudo‐chilblain, vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular and livedo/necrosis). We report a case of COVID‐19 with retiform purpura and its histopathological correlation.

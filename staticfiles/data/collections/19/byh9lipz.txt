The pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has driven efforts to address the global threat to public health and there is increasing pressure to exploit interventions to manage the pneumonic inflammation manifested in this disease. Ultra-shortwave diathermy (USWD) is proposed by some rehabilitation professions in China, purportedly to minimise pneumonic inflammation. However, treatment of any symptomatic pneumonia should be evidence-based. There is no valid evidence, published in English, which establishes any benefit of USWD in pulmonary conditions, let alone COVID-19. The need for rigorous research and evidence-based practice is discussed in this article. Novel interventions require a solid physiological basis and must undergo rigorous testing prior to clinical adoption even during a pandemic. We are of the view that deployment of USWD in patients with COVID-19 must be prudent and supported by a logical scientific basis.

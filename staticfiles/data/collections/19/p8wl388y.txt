Crisis leadership is a very important part of leading in today’s world. Every organization goes through some form of crisis on a fairly regular basis. This chapter is intended to define what a crisis is and what its impact may be on the organization. Additionally, a distinction between crisis management and crisis leadership will be made and an overview of crisis leadership research will be provided. The Bible provides us guidance on how we should view the various crises we experience. We are told, “For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope” (Jeremiah 29:11, NIV). These words tell us that the Lord already knows the trouble we will have to endure and that we should have faith that we can overcome them. While this is very comforting news, this does not mean that we can sit idly by and hope that things work out. Rather, we are to do as instructed in 1 Peter and in other parts of scripture and serve as leaders and examples for others during tough times.

The influence of different antiproteinase agents on alphavirus replication was examined. Sindbis virus multicycle replication in cultured cells was suppressed by N-tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteinases, and by aprotinin, an inhibitor of a wide spectrum of proteinases. Antiviral activity of TPCK was also demonstrated in Sindbis virus-infected animals. Parenteral injections of TPCK in infected mice reduced virus titers in brain and blood. The possible mechanism(s) of antiviral action of the antiproteinase agents are discussed.

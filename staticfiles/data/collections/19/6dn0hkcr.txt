We conducted a blinded, case‐control, retrospective study in pediatric patients hospitalized at The Children’s Hospital, Denver, Colorado, to determine whether human coronavirus (HCoV)–NL63 infection is associated with Kawasaki syndrome (KS). Over the course of a 7‐month period, nasopharyngeal‐wash samples from 2 (7.7%) of 26 consecutive children with KS and 4 (7.7%) of 52 matched control subjects tested positive for HCoV‐NL63 by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. These data suggest that, although HCoV‐NL63 was circulating in children in our community during the time of the study, the prevalence of infection with HCoV‐NL63 was not greater in patients with KS than in control subjects.

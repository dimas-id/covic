Abstract Residents of congregate care settings have been severely impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this report, we describe the methods our home-based primary care (HBPC) practice has developed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in assisted living facilities (ALFs) and we present an initial evaluation of this innovation. Shortly after the first COVID-19 case was reported in the U.S., our organization assembled an outbreak committee, designed to support the 1,794 ALF residents and the 101 communities in which they reside. The committee led the development and deployment of a comprehensive COVID-19 prevention and suppression strategy. The average age of the cohort was 83 + 11 years and 74% were female. Seven individuals (0.4% of census) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive individuals were located in three ALFs, representing 3% of our total number of ALFs. There has been one death. HBPC-led outbreak mitigation may be an enabler to suppress COVID-19 in ALFs.

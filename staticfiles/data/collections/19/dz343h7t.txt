This special issue of IJERPH has published a range of studies in this developing field of Global Community Child Health research. A number of manuscripts submitted in response to our invitation describing ‘community-based interventions which impact on child health and wellbeing around the globe. In addition to rural community-based initiatives given that most children now live in cities we are also interested to hear about urban initiatives….’ We hope this issue will of great interest to the researchers and practitioners as well as academia from the fields of Global Health as well as Global Child Health because it comprised of 14 articles representing all five continents. Physical activity appears a key component of the scientific community’s current conception of child well-being judging from the four papers published addressing this area. This issue also has papers on childhood obesity to rubella vaccination. Despite of the journal’s strive for reaching out to a wider global child health community, this issue missed contributions relating to child safeguarding and social determinants of urban health.

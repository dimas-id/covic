BACKGROUND We postulated that a surgical shunt between the portal and hepatic veins (portohepatic shunt) could improve the function and regeneration of the liver remnant after extensive hepatic resection. Using a canine model, we designed a survival study to test the feasibility of 90% hepatectomy with a portohepatic shunt. Of eight mixed-hound canines, it was necessary to sacrifice two animals for postmortem study of hepatic anatomy; we used the results to design a procedure for removing all of the liver except portions of two lobes. We tested this 90% hepatectomy procedure under general anesthesia in the remaining animals, with (N=3) or without (N=3) a portohepatic shunt. We monitored animals postoperatively with serial liver biochemical testing, and sacrificed on postoperative day 48. Assessment of liver regeneration was by weight after complete postmortem hepatectomy. Extended hepatectomy removed four complete lobes and portions of the right lateral and caudate lobes. For the portohepatic shunt, we anastomosed the left portal vein branch to the left hepatic vein branch. All procedures were performed successfully. One no-shunt animal expired on the second postoperative day. We thus confirmed the feasibility of 90% hepatectomy with portohepatic shunt in the canine model. If the efficacy of shunting is validated in a larger study population, it may increase the indications for extensive resection in patients with advanced hepatic malignancy.

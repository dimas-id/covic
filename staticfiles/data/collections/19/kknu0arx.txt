In this paper we critically review the work "Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality" (Ogen, 2020), stressing the fact that we think there are flaws in the published methodology. We do this as we think it is important, given the current deluge of 'COVID-19 related' publications, to clearly define what can be stated and what on the contrary, cannot be stated, due to limitations in terms of data quality and/or methodology.

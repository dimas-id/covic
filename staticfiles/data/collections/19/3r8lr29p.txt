The resection of oesophageal cancer offers the only chance of cure. The introduction of minimally invasive oesophagectomy has gained wide acceptance for the surgical treatment of oesophago-gastric cancers. The most commonly reported late complications of minimally invasive oesophagectomy are anastamotic stricture, chylothorax, chronic diarrhoea and delayed gastric emptying. Symptomatic hiatus hernia presenting as a late complication of laparoscopic cardio-oesophagectomy is not a widely reported complication. We have encountered three such cases, two of which were treated laparoscopically.

Background: There is concern about susceptibility of psoriatic patients on biologics to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its clinical course.Purpose: The aims of present review were to determine whether the biologic treatment of psoriasis increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and if biologics affect the clinical course of COVID-19 in these patients.Methods: We searched database of MEDLINE (PubMed) for key term of psoriasis biologic and COVID-19 until June 9, 2020 and all published 14 papers and an experience from Iran (10509 cases) related to the psoriatic patients on biologics and COVID-19 along with relevant papers were summarized. In spite of limitation in some reports, due to some of strengths that will be discussed, all papers were included in this review.Results: According to 8769 medical reports around 0.3% of psoriatic patients had COVID-19 and the rate of hospitalization was 0.1%. No death due to COVID-19 was reported among 10509 patients. Reports indicated psoriatic patients on biologics were not more susceptible to COVID-19 and the severe clinical course of disease.Conclusion: While there is not definitive controlled trial data, the available evidence suggests that patients with psoriasis without COVID-19 can continue the biologic therapy for psoriasis.

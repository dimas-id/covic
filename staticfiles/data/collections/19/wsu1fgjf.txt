OBJECTIVE To design and pilot a survey of UK blood donors to assess, on a large scale, their understanding of and compliance with the donor selection guidelines (DSG). BACKGROUND Compliance with the DSG is important for maintaining blood safety, however, little is currently known about the extent of this among UK donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS The online, unlinked survey was based on the donor health check form with a focus on behaviours associated with blood borne infections, sexual contact, drug use and travel. The survey materials were reviewed by a donor focus group and the survey was piloted among 2982 UK donors. Percentage responses were calculated, complaints monitored and answers to questions reviewed. The survey went live in 2013; 225 091 donors were invited via email to participate followed by two reminders. RESULTS The survey was well received by the focus group, with little concern about the sensitive and personal questions. Their feedback led to important refinement in the survey materials. In the pilots, 21Â·0% (627/2982) responded, a reminder was necessary to achieve this. Among responders, there was evidence of non-compliance and test seeking behaviour, and no evidence that intention to donate again was affected. In the live survey, 29% (65 439) responded; responders were generally representative of donors overall. CONCLUSION A large scale survey of donor compliances is feasible, acceptable and effective in ascertaining appropriate information; involving donors and the blood services in the development stages through a focus group and pilots was important to achieve this.

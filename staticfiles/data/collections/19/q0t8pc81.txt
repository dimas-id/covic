A 13-year-old boy contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The clinical course was mild, and no specific treatment was given. His recovery was spontaneous and complete. SARS in children can be a mild and self-limiting disease. The use of the World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions may not be adequate for the diagnosis of SARS in children.

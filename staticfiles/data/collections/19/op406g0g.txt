Introduction of synthetic mesh was a landmark breakthrough in the management of hernia repair and has significantly reduced recurrence rates. But in addition to the benefits, some more problems have come in picture major being 'mesh infection'. Prolene mesh has shown promise when used in abdominal and inguinal hernia repair, especially when used in planned surgeries. This material, derived from monofilament polypropelene, is found to be biologically inert in almost every person. Being a foreign material, a slightest breach in asepsis can lead to favourable environment for bacterial proliferation and form a 'biofilm'. This phenomenon especially after laparoscopic surgeries gives rise to chronic discharging sinus at the port site, abscess formation around mesh and even sepsis. It appears that laparoscopic hernia repair is a promising method but having chances of mesh infection owing to difficult approach and lack of uniformity in sterilization of laparoscopic instruments. Slightest breach in sterility or protocols might lead to such a large ventral wall sinus, increasing morbidity and cost of treatment. Treatment of infected mesh is possible by local debridement, irrigation, mesh removal and systemic antibiotics culminating in increased morbidity over duration of disease, but still it would be worth emphasizing-'Prevention is better than cure'.

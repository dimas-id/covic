This paper stresses its base contribution on a new SIR-type model for COVID-19 including direct and fomite transmission as well as the effect of distinct household structures. To what extent increasing the physical-distancing-related contact radius and enhancing mass control (public curfew, lockdown, workplace clearance, and school closure) reduce the number of predicted active cases is studied via parameter estimation.

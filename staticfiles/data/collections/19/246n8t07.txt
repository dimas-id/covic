Flavonoids have shown beneficial effects in various disease conditions as reported by various previous studies. Biochanin-A is a flavonoid present in various plants in nature. Present investigation was done to assess the vasorelaxant potential of biochanin-A on isolated coronary artery of goat and its possible mechanism of action. Vascular reactivity experiments were done on circumflex coronary artery of goats using the tension experiments. Goat coronary arterial rings were relaxed with biochanin-A in concentration (0.1-100 μM)-dependent manner. Endothelium had no effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. Maximum relaxation induced by biochanin-A was 116.54 ± 12.21% in endothelium-intact artery and it was not significantly different with maximal relaxation (108.22 ± 1.88%) of endothelium-denuded vessel. L-NAME (100 μM) did not show any effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. TEA (BKCa channel blocker), and BaCl2 (KIR blocker) had no effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. However, biochanin-A-induced maximal relaxation (71.72 ± 4.50%) was reduced significantly (P < .001) in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (KV channel blocker, 3 mM) in comparison with control (114.07 ± 4.33%). Glibenclaminde (KATP channel blocker), H89 (PKA inhibitor), ICI182780 (estrogen receptor antagonist) showed partial attenuation in the biochanin-A-induced relaxation. ODQ (sGC blocker) and HC067047 (TRPV4 channel blocker) had no effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation. In K+-depolarized endothelium-denuded arterial rings, biochanin-A (30 μM) significantly (P < .05; P < .001) decreased CaCl2-induced contractions (0.02 ± 0.01 g vs. control 0.73 ± 0.30 g). Biochanin-A did not influence the fasudil (rho kinase inhibitor) and SNP (NO-donor)-induced relaxation in this vessel. Biochanin-A showed relaxation in goat coronary artery in endothelium-independent pathways and showed the partial involvement of KATP, protein kinase A and estrogen receptors and full involvement of Cav1.2 channels.

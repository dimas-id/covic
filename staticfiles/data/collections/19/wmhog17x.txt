Postoperative cognitive dysfunction, a subtle deterioration of cognitive function after exposure to anesthetics, is reported in 10% to 50% of surgical cases. Delivery of excessive inhalation anesthetics based on minimum alveolar concentration produces greater deep hypnotic times, which may contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study tested the impact on cognitive function of balanced anesthetic using electroencephalographic (EEG) guidance vs usual anesthesia. We studied 88 surgical patients: 45 randomly assigned to balanced anesthetic technique with EEG guidance and 43 to standard treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery-Mild Cognitive Impairment at 3 intervals (preoperatively, 3-5 days postoperatively, and 3-5 months postoperatively). Additionally, 37 age- and sex-matched individuals not undergoing surgery or anesthesia were evaluated at the same intervals. Better outcomes were seen in the intervention group compared with usual care in the short-term/visual memory cognitive domain (P = .02) at 3 to 5 days, but not at 3 to 5 months. Delivery of anesthesia using EEG monitoring systems can reduce cumulative deep hypnotic time without negatively affecting patient physiologic stress, surgical conditions, or cognitive function. Our findings provide data to support optimal anesthetic approaches to improve cognitive function after anesthesia with volatile anesthetics.

An outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus transmission in our neonatal intensive care unit persisted despite strict contact precautions and cohorting of colonized neonates and their caregivers. After terminal cleaning was performed, incubators were found to harbor the neonates' clone of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Transmission ceased after cohorting of incubators, suggesting the effectiveness of infection control measures targeting environmental contamination.

The New York City Department of Health has projected that 15,000 methadone patients, out of a total of 30,000, are going to be quarantined due to exposure to or coming down with coronavirus, according to Allegra Schorr, president of the Coalition of Medication‐Assisted Treatment Providers and Advocates. She told ADAW that the system is just not set up to deliver medication to all of these people. One methadone van is not going to be able to do it — even if they had one. “We're going to need the National Guard,” she said.

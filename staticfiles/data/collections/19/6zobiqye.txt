The role of apoptosis in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection is still controversial. To better assess the role of apoptosis in MHV infection, we used three different biologic phenotypes of MHV to examine their differential effect on the induction of apoptosis. MHV-A59 produces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and chronic demyelination. MHV-2 causes only acute hepatitis and meningitis, whereas Penn98-1 produces acute hepatitis and meningoencephalitis without demyelination. We detected TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in the livers and meninges of MHV-A59-, MHV-2-, and Penn98-1-infected mice. TUNEL staining in brain parenchyma was only detected in MHV-A59- and Penn98-1-infected mice. We detected apoptosis by electron-microscopy in olfactory neurons during acute infection with MHV-A59. The kinetics and distribution of TUNEL staining correlated with the pathologic damage and colocalized with viral antigen in some cells. At 1 month, TUNEL staining was found exclusively in areas of demyelination in the spinal cord of MHV-A59-infected mice; however, it was not found in nondemyelinated mice infected with MHV-2 or Penn98-1, or in mock-infected mice. TUNEL-positive cells were identified as macrophage/microglial cells, some astrocytes, and some oligodendrocytes, by colabeling with cell-specific markers. The presence of TUNEL staining in oligodendrocytes suggests that apoptosis may play an important role in MHV-induced demyelination.

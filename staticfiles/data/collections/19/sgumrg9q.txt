OBJECTIVE. Nosocomial transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to frontline health care workers is well known, and health care workers may inadvertently become vectors for onward transmission. Ultrasound (US) service providers are at significant risk because scanning usually requires prolonged close patient contact. The bulky US equipment may also facilitate fomite transmission of disease. With increasing use of point-of-care and portable diagnostic US services, the risk is substantial. CONCLUSION. Our experience and protocols may help service providers with their own effective response against COVID-19.

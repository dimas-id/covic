We investigated the dependence of Covid-19 attack rates on demographic and socioeconomic factors for the communities in Suffolk County (Long Island, New York State), presently the 5th most-affected county in the United States. Confirming the previous observations that minorities are disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 disease, we found that the attack rate is strongly correlated with the minority population proportion, with an alarmingly high $\sim4$-fold attack rate increase for Black and Hispanic populations.

Clinical features of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection have not been well documented for adults. We investigated clinical and radiologic features of HMPV infection in 849 adults in a tertiary hospital in South Korea. We classified patients into groups on the basis of underlying diseases: immunocompetent patients, solid tumor patients, solid organ transplantation recipients, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, hematologic malignancy patients, and patients receiving long-term steroid treatment. Of 849 HMPV-infected patients, 756 had community-acquired infections, 579 had pneumonia, and 203 had infections with other pathogens. Mortality rates were highest in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients (22% at 30 days). Older age, current smoking, and underlying disease were associated with HMPV pneumonia. Body mass index and an immunocompromised state were associated with 30-day mortality rates in HMPV-infected patients. Bronchial wall thickening, ground-glass opacity, and ill-defined centrilobular nodules were common computed tomography findings for HMPV pneumonia. Macronodules and consolidation were observed in <50% of patients.

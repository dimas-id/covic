The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the cellular receptor used by SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. Both coronavirus use the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of their viral spike protein to interact with ACE2. The structural basis of these interactions are already known, forming a dimer of ACE2 with a trimer of the spike protein, opening the door to target them to prevent the infection. Here we present PepI-Cov19 database, a repository of peptides designed to target the interaction between the RDB of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 as well as the dimerization of ACE2 monomers. The peptides were modelled using our method PiPreD that uses native elements of the interaction between the targeted protein and cognate partner that are subsequently included in the designed peptides. These peptides recapitulate stretches of residues present in the native interface plus novel and highly diverse conformations that preserve the key interactions on the interface. PepI-Covid19 database provides an easy and convenient access to this wealth of information to the scientific community with the view of maximizing its potential impact in the development of novel therapeutic agents.

Pimelodidae harbors several species and is widely distributed throughout the Neotropical region. Pimelodus is the genus with the largest number of species, however it is a polyphyletic group. Cytogenetic analyzes of the valid species still covers less than half of them. Herein, seven Pimelodus species from three Brazilian hydrographic systems were analyzed through basic (Giemsa, AgNORs and C banding) and molecular (5S and 18S rDNA-FISH) cytogenetic methods. All species had 2n=56 chromosomes with different karyotype formulas observed among the species. AgNORs were corresponding to 18S rDNA and localized on long arm of one chromosome pair in all species. Heterochromatin distribution follows the pattern commonly verified in the family and allows to identify each one of the studied species. 5S rDNA marker was interspecifically variable in number and position of cistrons. Pimelodus ortmanni had B chromosomes varying intra and inter-individually. We performed a discussion on our own and available cytogenetic data for Pimelodidae, and the associating of them with available phylogeny enable us identifying features that distinguish subgroups within Pimelodidae, such as NORs location (terminal/long arm for species belonging to "Iheringichthys-Parapimelodus" and "Pimelodus maculatus" subclades) and location of 5S rDNA sites (pericentromeric/interstitial/ long arm for species belonging to Pimelodus group).(AU)

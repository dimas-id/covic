Cutaneous manifestations, a well-known effect of viral infections, are beginning to be reported in patients with COVID-19 disease. These manifestations most often are morbilliform rash, urticaria, vesicular eruptions, acral lesions, and livedoid eruptions. Some of these cutaneous manifestations arise before the signs and symptoms more commonly associated with COVID-19, suggesting that they could be presenting signs of COVID-19. utaneous manifestations are well known to occur in the setting of viral illnesses, and occasionally these manifestations have diagnostic or prognostic value. With COVID-19, although we are at a relatively early point in the pandemic, cutaneous manifestations in infected patients are beginning to emerge from around the world.

This study is anchored on the use of an eco-friendly effective plasma technique and cationization treatment to improve the hydrophobic nature of polyester (PET) fabric by incorporating hydrophilic functional groups onto the PET surface. The PET surface was initially treated with three different plasma gases prior to cationization treatment with quaternary ammonium salt (Quat 188). Madder roots were used, to produce natural dyes for the green coloration of PET fabrics in both dyeing and printing processes. The color strength (K/S) was measured to study the influence of both plasma gases and the cationization treatment on the coloration of PET fabric. Exposure to nitrogen plasma gases prior to the cationization treatment showed promising results for efficient PET coloration, resulting in the selection of nitrogen as a working gas at a flow rate of 3 l/min. The results also demonstrated that by combining the nitrogen plasma technique and cationization treatment, PET fabric with a highly effective surface was obtained, resulting in improved coloration, wettability, tensile strength, and roughness properties.

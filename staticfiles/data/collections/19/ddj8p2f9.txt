Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTr) with COVID-19 are expected to have poorer outcomes compared to non-transplant patients due to immunosuppression and comorbidities. The clinical characteristics of 47 SOTr (38 kidneys and 9 non-kidney organs) were compared to 100 consecutive hospitalized non-transplant controls. 12/47 SOTr managed as outpatients were subsequently excluded from the outcome analyses to avoid potential selection bias. Chronic kidney disease (89% vs. 57% p=0.0007), diabetes (66% vs. 33% p=0.0007), and hypertension (94% vs. 72% p=0.006) were more common in the 35 hospitalized SOTr compared to controls. Diarrhea (54% vs. 17%, p<0.0001) was more frequent in SOTr. Primary composite outcome (escalation to ICU, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital all-cause mortality) was comparable between SOTr and controls (40% vs. 48%, OR 0.72 CI [0.33-1.58] p=0.42), despite more comorbidities in SOTr. Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy occurred in 20% of SOTr compared to 4% of controls (OR 6 CI [1.64-22] p=0.007). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that increasing age and clinical severity was associated with mortality. Transplant status itself was not associated with mortality.

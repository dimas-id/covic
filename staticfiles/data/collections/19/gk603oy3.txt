Spleen cells from a calf hyperimmunized with bovine enteric coronavirus were fused with nonproducer mouse plasmacytoma cells. Stable hybridoma lines secreting bovine immunoglobulins were obtained. One line secreted monoclonal bovine immunoglobulin G2, which reacted specifically with bovine enteric coronavirus in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, inhibited virus hemagglutination, and precipitated a structural polypeptide with a molecular weight of 26,000 daltons.

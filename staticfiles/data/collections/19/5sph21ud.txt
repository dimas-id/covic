This study was conducted to clarify the potential mechanisms of Troxerutin neuroprotection against Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation through targeting the SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. To establish a model, a single dose of LPS (500μg/kg body weight) was injected to male Wistar rats intraperitoneally. Troxerutin (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally for 5 days after induction of the model. Cognitive and behavioral evaluations were performed using Y-maze, single-trial passive avoidance, and novel object recognition tests. The expression of inflammatory mediators, SIRT1/SIRT3, and P53 was measured using the ELISA assay. Likewise, the expression levels of SIRT1/SIRT3 and NF-κB were determined using Western blot assay. Brain acetyl-cholinesterase activity was determined by utilizing the method of Ellman. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using Fluorescent probe 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined. A single intraperitoneal injection of LPS was led to ROS production, acute neuroinflammation, apoptotic cell death, and inactivation of the SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. Likewise, ELISA assay demonstrated that post-treatment with Troxerutin considerably suppressed LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and subsequently memory impairments by targeting SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. Western blot assay confirmed ELISA results about SIRT1/SIRT3 and NF-κB proteins. These results suggest that Troxerutin can be a suitable candidate to treat neuroinflammation caused by neurodegenerative disorders.

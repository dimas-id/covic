BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms pose a significant challenge to the treating clinician. The Contour Neurovascular System embolization device is a novel tool for the treatment of such intracranial aneurysms. We report on our experience with this device. METHODS Prospective clinical and radiological data were collected for all patients treated with the Contour device at our center. All our patients were treated on an elective basis. RESULTS We have treated 11 patients successfully with the Contour device to date. All patients were women with a mean (SD) age of 65.0 (6.4) years. In total, four basilar tip, two internal carotid artery, three middle cerebral artery, one anterior communicating artery, and one superior cerebellar artery aneurysms were treated. At 1-year follow-up, complete occlusion (Raymond Class 1) was seen in 55.56% (5/9) of cases, with 44.44% (4/9) having small neck remnants (Raymond Class 2). One patient declined 1-year catheter angiography and another had no further follow-up due to an unrelated medical condition. For six patients, 2-year radiological follow-up is available and shows stability. At 6 weeks, nine of the 11 patients had a modifed Rankin Scale score of 0, with two patients scoring 1 for headaches. Two patients had thromboembolic events, but there were no complications leading to permanent neurological disability or death. We additionally had three patients where the Contour device was attempted but was unable to be successfully used. CONCLUSION Initial results are promising although larger case numbers and longer follow-up are necessary to draw further conclusions on the utility and risk profile of this new device.

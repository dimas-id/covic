This study aimed to examine the short-term adjustment outcomes including distress, self-esteem, and quality of life among Chinese patients after 1-month recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong and to investigate the predictive abilities of a set of selected variables on the outcomes. At 1-month recovery, 100 SARS survivors (mean age = 37; 66 women) and 184 community subjects completed self-administered questionnaires. In the General Health Questionnaire-28, 61% of the SARS survivors were identified as distressed cases under a conservative cutoff score of 6. Compared with the community sample, SARS survivors had significantly more distress and poor quality of life. Being a healthcare worker, severity of SARS symptoms, steroid dosage, and social support accounted for a portion of variances of different measures. Early psychiatric screening and intervention may be beneficial for the adjustment of SARS survivors after short-term recovery. Future research on the long-term impact of SARS is recommended.

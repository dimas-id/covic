A random population-based telephone survey (n = 301) was conducted among the Hong Kong general population in July 2009. Past history of seasonal influenza vaccination (OR = 2.59–3.13) was associated with intention to take up A/H1N1 vaccination under three hypothetical scenarios (provided at <HK$100, HK$100–200 and >HK$200). Adjusting background variables, other significant factors were identified by stepwise models: perceived side effects (OR = 0.33), family members’ recommendations and friends’ acceptability toward the vaccine (OR = 2.80–4.74). In contrast to other studies on seasonal influenza and A/H1N1 vaccination, perceived susceptibility and perceived severity related to influenza A/H1N1 were non-significant. Cultural differences may therefore exist.

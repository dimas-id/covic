Abstract The viral infection and resistance to the existing antiviral drugs are alarming, which is a serious public health concern. Medicinal plants are valuable resources for treatment of viral infections and can be used for the management of infections like herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, etc. The antiviral screening of plant extracts should be highly selective, specific, and sensitive for bioactivity guided isolation of the active compounds from the plant extracts. The antiviral screening system should be validated for accuracy, reproducibility, simplicity, and cost effectiveness. This chapter highlights on various aspects for screening and evaluation of antiviral natural components including factors affecting antiviral in vivo studies, host cells, organisms, and culture media followed by different virus-specific assays for antiviral screening of natural products.

Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are common among the general population; however, these often mild viral illnesses can lead to serious morbidity and mortality among recipients of hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation. The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic or mild infections to life-threatening lower respiratory tract infection or long-term airflow obstruction syndromes. Progression to lower respiratory tract infection or to respiratory failure is determined by the intrinsic virulence of the specific viral pathogen as well as various host factors, including the type of transplantation, status of the hostâ€™s immune dysfunction, the underlying disease, and other comorbidities. This chapter focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of RVIs in this susceptible population and includes respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, human coronavirus, and human rhinovirus. The optimal management of these infections is limited by the overall paucity of available treatment, highlighting the need for new antiviral drug or immunotherapies.

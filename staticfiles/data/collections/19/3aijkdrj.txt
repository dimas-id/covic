One hundred and twenty healthy Holstein calves were assigned randomly at birth to one of four groups; each group contained 30 calves and the calves were received as follows: group A, 85 ± 5 g of lyophilized colostrum powder dissolved in 3 kg of whole milk; group B, 85 ± 5 g of spray-dried colostrum powder dissolved in 3 kg of whole milk; group C, 750 ml frozen and thawed colostrum in 3 kg of whole milk, and group D, only 3 kg of whole milk without colostrum supplement. Each group was subdivided into 3 sub-groups of 10 calves as follows: calves fed colostrum supplement at 24 or 48 or 72 h after birth. All calves fed fresh colostrum within 6 h after birth at the amount of 5% of BW by bottle. Calves which were fed lyophilized colostrum supplement had a significant lower incidence of diarrhea in comparison to control calves. In addition, calves were received lyophilized colostrum supplement at 24 h after birth showed less incidence of diarrhea than calves fed the supplement at 48 and 72 h. According to the results of present study providing lyophilized colostrum supplement at 24 h after birth might have been preventive effect on calf diarrhea. The spray-dried colostrum supplement had not the same effect.

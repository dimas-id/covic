OBJECTIVES This paper is a follow-up of a previous introduction to systematic reviews and presents a step-by-step approach updated in the light of developments in the field. CONCLUSIONS We describe resources such as bibliographic software, electronic translation and programs to assist in article selection, as well as the need for prospective registration of a protocol with an appropriate register. Lastly, we suggest freeware for meta-analysis and basic techniques.

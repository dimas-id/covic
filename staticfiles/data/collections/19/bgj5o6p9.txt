OBJECTIVE To propose a multidisciplinary protocol to standardize the care of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and evaluate it effectiveness after implementation. METHODS Retrospective evaluation of 95 consecutive patients undergoing THA divided into two groups, one group of 47 patients operated before the protocol implementation and 48 after. RESULTS Assessing the re-admission rate, among 47 patients evaluated prior to implementation of the protocol, seven (14.9%) were re-admitted, and when observing the 48 patients evaluated after implementation, one (2.1%) was re-admitted, showing statistical significance (p < 0.05). The chance of re-admission before the protocol was eight times the chance of hospitalization after implementation (95% CI: 1.01 to 377.7). By comparing the clinical complications among the groups, it was observed that there was a lower rate of complications following implementation of the protocol (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION The introduction of a multidisciplinary protocol to standardize the management of patients undergoing THA decreased the rates of rehospitalization and clinical complications after the procedure.

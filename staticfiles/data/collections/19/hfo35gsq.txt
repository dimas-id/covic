The main atypical pathogens in respiratory tract infections are classified on the basis of their ability to cause atypical pneumonia. This is not a well-defined clinical entity, and it is evident that atypical pathogens can sometimes cause ‘typical’ pneumonias and vice versa. This emphasizes the need for microbiological diagnosis, since it affects the selection of proper treatment, in which β-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides are not effective. Moreover, mixed infections caused by atypical and typical pathogens together are common. At this moment rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are lacking. Besides numerous viruses, the main bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonias are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, two chlamydial species, Chlamydia pneumoniae and C. psittaci, one rickettsia, Coxiella burnetti, and several Legionella species. The majority of these pathogens cause upper respiratory tract infections more often than overt pneumonias. An atypical agent, Chlamydia pneumoniae, has also been associated with chronic inflammatory conditions in the cardiovascular system. The most recently discovered pathogen in atypical pneumonias is a hantavirus causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

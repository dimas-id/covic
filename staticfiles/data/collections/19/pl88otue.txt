Abstract Plant viruses transmitted by invertebrate vectors either reversibly bind to vector mouthparts or are internalized by the vector and later secreted. Viral proteins mediate the binding of plant viruses to vector mouthparts and the transport of virus across vector-cell membranes. Both mechanisms probably involve conformational changes of virus proteins during their association with the vector.

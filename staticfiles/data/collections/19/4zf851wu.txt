The advancement of viral glycomics has paralleled that of the mass spectrometry glycomics toolbox. In some regard the glycoproteins studied have provided the impetus for this advancement. Viral proteins are often highly glycosylated, especially those targeted by the host immune system. Glycosylation tends to be dynamic over time as viruses propagate in host populations leading to increased number of and/or “movement” of glycosylation sites in response to the immune system and other pressures. This relationship can lead to highly glycosylated, difficult to analyze glycoproteins that challenge the capabilities of modern mass spectrometry. In this review, we briefly discuss five general areas where glycosylation is important in the viral niche and how mass spectrometry has been used to reveal key information regarding structure–function relationships between viral glycoproteins and host cells. We describe the recent past and current glycomics toolbox used in these analyses and give examples of how the requirement to analyze these complex glycoproteins has provided the incentive for some advances seen in glycomics mass spectrometry. A general overview of viral glycomics, special cases, mass spectrometry methods and work‐flows, informatics and complementary chemical techniques currently used are discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

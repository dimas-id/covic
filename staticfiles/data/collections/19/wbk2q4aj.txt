COVID-19 leads to mortality of several patients and the cytokine storm is reportedly critical in the patients.

However, researchers and physicians should look for more IL-6R antagonists for the therapy of cytokine storm syndrome severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected persons to enhance the therapeutic options for cytokine storm.

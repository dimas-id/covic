The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) plays an important role in the setting of the cellular response to multiple stress signals. Although the primary function of ubiquitin was initially associated with proteolysis, it is now considered as a key regulator of protein function controlling, among other functions, signalling cascades, transcription, apoptosis or oncogenesis. Failure at any level of the UPS is associated with the development of multiple pathologies including metabolic problems, immune diseases, inflammation and cancer. The successful use of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Velcade) in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) revealed the potential of the UPS as pharmacological target. Ten years later, new inhibitors tackling not only the proteasome but also different subsets of enzymes which conjugate or de-conjugate ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules, have been developed. Most of them are excellent tools to characterize better the emerging molecular mechanisms regulating distinct critical cellular processes. Some of them have been launched already while many others are still in pre-clinical development. This chapter updates some of the most successful efforts to develop and characterize inhibitors of the UPS which tackle mechanisms involved in cancer. Particular attention has been dedicated to updating the status of the clinical trials of these inhibitors.

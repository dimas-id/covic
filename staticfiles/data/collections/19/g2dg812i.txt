After the major exponential phase, the Covid-19 pandemic is on a milder rate of increase globally, and past the peak in many countries. In this phase a marked systematic weekly periodicity in the Covid-19 attack has become clear, the study of which could be useful for the long term strategy to deal with the virus and the pandemic. The most important aspect of this strong weekly modulation is its global nature, phase-coherent over most of globe, independent of the geographical location, with the possible, but unconfirmed, exception of Russia and many countries in Asia and Africa, where the scale of the deaths from the pandemic relative to the population has been small so far. There could be a phase-difference of about a day between the modulations in the daily number of deaths and the daily reported cases.

Objective@#To investigate the clinical experience of patients with novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection after kidney transplantation.@*Method@#Clinical data of two patients with 2019-nCoV infection after renal transplantationin Jan 2020 Renmin Hospital of Wuhan Universiyt were retrospectively analyzed.Case 1 was a 48-year-old male with CMV pneumonia secondary to 2019-nCoV infection at 4 months after transplantation. CT imaging showed multiple patchy ground-glass images of both lungs. Case 2 was a 59-year-old male, who was screened positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid due to fever at 9 days after renal transplantation and showed no clinical manifestations of pneumonia. After diagnosis, case 1 was transferred to a designated hospital for isolation. Treatment regimens: cefoperazone sulbactam sodium + linezolid to resist infection, gamma globulin to enhance immunity function, methylprednisolone to control inflammatory response, antiviral regimens including arbidol tablets + lopina-velitonavir tablets. Case 2 was treated with isolated treatment in a single room. The treatment plan included anti-infection (cefoperazone sulbactam sodium), enhancing immunity function (gamma globulin), antivirus therapy with arbidol and other symptomatic treatment.@*Result@#Follow up with 3 weeks, case 1 recovered with renal dysfunction, nucleic acid test with nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative, and pulmonary imaging improved. Case 2 showed no obvious clinical symptoms, and the nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative for 3 times.@*Conclusion@#Renal transplant recipients should receive fine protection to avoid exposure to high-risk environments. Diagnosis should be defined with combination of clinical manifestations, nucleic acid test and pulmonary imaging. At present, there are no antiviral drugs and symptomatic treatment is the main choice.

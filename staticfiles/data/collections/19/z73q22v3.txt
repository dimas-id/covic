The current emergence of coronavirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) puts the world in threat. 2019-nCoV remains the outbreak of SARS-CoV 2002-2003. The structural research on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV has identified the key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor, also known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It controls both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. In this article, we have considered the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the acute stage. Our aim is to propose and analyse a mathematical model for investigating the effect of CTL responses over the viral mutation to control the viral infection when a post-infection vaccine is administered at regular intervals. Dynamics of the system with and without impulses have been analysed using qualitative theory. Main findings are supported through numerical simulations.

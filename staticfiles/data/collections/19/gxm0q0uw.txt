Abstract 5-Arylcarbamoyl-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates have been synthesised from N-methyl-C-diethoxyphosphorylnitrone and N-arylacrylamides in good yields. cis- and trans-isoxazolidine phosphonates obtained herein were evaluated for activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. Isoxazolidines having phenyl substituted with halogen (Ar=2-F-C6H4; 3-Br-C6H4; and 4-Br-C6H4) have been found to inhibit proliferation of L1210, CEM as well as HeLa cells with IC50 in the 100–170μM range.

We read with great interest the Viewpoint by L. H Henderson et al (1) on the therapeutic approach with Glucocorticoids (GC) to the inflammation and Cytokine Storm phases of SARS.CoV 2 infection. We would like to expand their analysis and discuss the data , so far reported in Children and Autoimmune patients ( Rheumatoid Arthritis , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), about the chance of undergoing a "severe" infection. So far children (and autoimmune patients) , who should be extremely fragile, rarely entered into the third phase "the cytokine release syndrome‐CRS " of COVID‐19, leading only some patients to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs).

Nowadays hospitals have been at the forefront fighting against novel coronavirus pneumonia, with diagnosing and treating of patients as a top priority. In order to ensure the smooth progress of diagnosis and treatment, and prevent the occurrence of nosocomial infection, logistics support needs to make allowances for the isolation ward in time from the perspectives of logistics, facilities and equipment, and to transform the in-and-out double channels of ward access as required, thus setting up the partition of the three zones. Secondly, logistics support needs to optimize the logistics service workflow, including the medical waste management, the environmental disinfection isolation, and to optimize the catering service within hospitals to reduce the gathering and flow of personnel. Thirdly, logistics support needs to increase personnel training, and to eliminate psychological panic as well as to stabilize the logistics support team by putting logistics management cadres on the front line. Meanwhile, the logistics department needs to take over the hospital access screening work, strictly manage those who enter the hospital, maximize the safety and reliability of the logistics support within the hospital, and ensure the smooth progress of the epidemic prevention work.

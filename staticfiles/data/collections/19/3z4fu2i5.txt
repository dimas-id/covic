In writing this chapter we assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts in epidemiology. You will not find any overview of different designs, measure of disease occurrence, standardisations, other ways of adjusting for confounders, or any general discussion on bias, confounding or on measuring effects. If you are not familiar with these topics you should start by reading other parts of the book or turn to one of the many fine available textbooks.

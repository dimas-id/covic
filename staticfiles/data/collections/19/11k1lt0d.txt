In the wake of the COVID-19 virus outbreak, a brief phenomenological (descriptive, comparative) analysis of the dynamics of the disease spread among different countries is presented. Results indicate that the infection spread dynamics is currently the most pronounced in the USA (confirmed cases are currently doubling every 2.16 days, with a decreasing doubling time tendency), while other countries with the most confirmed cases show different values, and tendencies. The reported number of deaths is currently doubled every 2.28 days in Germany, 2.56 days in France, 2.57 days in Switzerland, 2.59 days in France, and 2.62 days in USA, while only France and USA are currently exhibiting further acceleration (diminishing doubling time).

In this paper, we use a deterministic non-Markovian epidemic model to estimate the state of the Covid-19 epidemic in France. This model allows us to consider realistic distributions for the exposed and infectious periods in a SEIR model, contrary to standard ODE models which only consider exponentially distributed exposed and infectious periods. We present theoretical results linking the (unobserved) parameters of the model to various quantities which are more easily measured during the early stages of an epidemic. We also stress the main quantitative differences between the non-Markovian and the Markovian (ODE) model. We then apply these results to estimate the state of the Covid-19 epidemic in France by analyzing three regions: the Paris region, the northeast regions and the rest of the country, based on current knowledge on the infection fatality ratio and the exposed and infectious periods distributions for Covid-19. Our analysis is based on the hospital data published daily by Sante Publique France (daily hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions and hospital deaths).

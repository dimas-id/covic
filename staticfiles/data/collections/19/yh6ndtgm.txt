COVID-19 is an ongoing viral pandemic disease that is caused by SARS-CoV2, inducing severe pneumonia in humans. However, several classes of repurposed drugs have been recommended, no specific vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 are developed till now. Viral dependence on ACE-2, as entry receptors, drove the researchers into RAS impact on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Several evidences have pointed at Neprilysin (NEP) as one of pulmonary RAS components. Considering the protective effect of NEP against pulmonary inflammatory reactions and fibrosis, it is suggested to direct the future efforts towards its potential role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Thus, the review aimed to shed light on the potential beneficial effects of NEP pathways as a novel target for COVID-19 therapy by summarizing its possible molecular mechanisms. Additional experimental and clinical studies explaining more the relationships between NEP and COVID-19 will greatly benefit in designing the future treatment approaches.

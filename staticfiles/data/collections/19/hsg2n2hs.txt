Since 1999, when the author first described the research and potential applications of minimally invasive gastrointestinal surgery in animals, veterinarians have begun to apply some of these techniques in treating client owned animals. Minimally invasive surgery is advocated with diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic intent. There has been a transition from a minimally invasive caseload toward the expansion of diagnostic procedures, adoption of prophylactic procedures (such as lap-assisted gastropexy), and performing more difficult therapeutic procedures. Small animal patients benefit from reduced tissue trauma and experience a rapid recovery. In this article, current research and minimally invasive gastrointestinal procedures in animals are discussed.

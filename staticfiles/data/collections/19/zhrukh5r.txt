The outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has spread from Wuhan to the whole country. After the Spring Festival, workers will return to workplace and students will return to school. There is an increasing risk of 2019-nCoV cases being imported into provinces and cities. In order to promote the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection, reduce the risk of transmission in medical institutions, and ensure medical quality and medical safety, it is necessary to carry out the detection test of 2019-nCoV in biosafety class II laboratory. In order to achieve the goal of zero infection of the laboratory personnel, different preventive measures should be taken to assess the risk of the experimental activities.

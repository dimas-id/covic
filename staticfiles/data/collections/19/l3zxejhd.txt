Background: The aetiology of lower respiratory tract infections is challenging to investigate. Despite the wide array of diagnostic tools, invasive techniques, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), are often required to obtain adequate specimens. PneumoniaCheck(TM) is a new device that collects aerosol particles from cough, allowing microbiological analyses. Up to now it has been tested only for bacteria detection, but no study has investigated its usefulness for virus identification. Methods: In this pilot study we included 12 consecutive patients with pneumonia. After testing cough adequacy via a peak flow meter, a sampling with PneumoniaCheck(TM) was collected and a BAL was performed in each patient. Microbiological analyses for virus identification were performed on each sample and concordance between the two techniques was tested (sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values), taking BAL results as reference. Results: BAL was considered adequate in 10 patients. Among them, a viral pathogen was identified by PneumoniaCheck(TM) 6 times, each on different samples, whereas BAL allowed to detect the presence of a virus on 7 patients (14 positivities). Overall, the specificity for PneumoniaCheck(TM) to detect a virus was 100%, whereas the sensitivity was 66%. When considering only herpes viruses, PneumoniaCheck(TM) showed a lower sensitivity, detecting a virus in 1/4 of infected patients (25%). Conclusions: In this pilot study PneumoniaCheck(TM) showed a good correlation with BAL for non-herpes virologic identification in pneumonia patients, providing excellent specificity. Further studies on larger population are needed to confirm these results and define its place in the panorama of rapid diagnostic tests for lower respiratory tract infections.

UNLABELLED Abstract Background and Purpose: The Single Port Instrument Delivery Extended Reach (SPIDER) surgical system was developed for true continuous instrument triangulation during laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgery. We present our initial preclinical experience with the SPIDER surgical system during renal surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomies were performed in a live adult porcine animal model using the SPIDER device. A standard surgical approach was used via direct video guidance. RESULTS The procedure was successfully performed without surgical error or complication. The SPIDER system proved easy to use with only a minimal learning curve. Intracorporeal surgical knots were tied without difficulty using this single site system. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience with the SPIDER surgical system during renal surgery is promising. SPIDER allows for true single port instrument triangulation offering a superior operative experience to currently available LESS surgical systems.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a highly prevalent disease associated with significant direct and indirect costs. It is paramount that a practitioner can distinguish between acute viral rhinosinusitis and ABRS to avoid unnecessary antibiotic usage. It is also important to understand that establishing a diagnosis of ABRS does not necessitate the prescribing of antibiotics, unless the ABRS patient presents with severe or worsening symptoms or an ABRS complication. Complications include extension of infection to the orbit and central nervous system. Injudicious use of antibiotics imparts societal costs in terms of financial expense as well as contributing to higher levels of bacterial resistance. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of ABRS.

Synchronous assessment of multiple MRI contrast agents in a single scanning session would provide a new "multi-color" imaging capability similar to fluorescence imaging but with high spatiotemporal resolution and unlimited imaging depth. This multi-agent MRI technology would enable a whole new class of basic science and clinical MRI experiments that simultaneously explore multiple physiologic/molecular events in vivo. Unfortunately, conventional MRI acquisition techniques are only capable of detecting and quantifying one paramagnetic MRI contrast agent at a time. Herein, the Dual Contrast - Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (DC-MRF) methodology was extended for in vivo application and evaluated by simultaneously and dynamically mapping the intra-tumoral concentration of two MRI contrast agents (Gd-BOPTA and Dy-DOTA-azide) in a mouse glioma model. Co-registered gadolinium and dysprosium concentration maps were generated with sub-millimeter spatial resolution and acquired dynamically with just over 2-minute temporal resolution. Mean tumor Gd and Dy concentration measurements from both single agent and dual agent DC-MRF studies demonstrated significant correlations with ex vivo mass spectrometry elemental analyses. This initial in vivo study demonstrates the potential for DC-MRF to provide a useful dual-agent MRI platform.

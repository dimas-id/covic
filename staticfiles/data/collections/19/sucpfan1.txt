This review focuses on the anatomy and techniques for endoscopic resection of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA), as well as adjunctive and potential alternative treatments. JNA is a benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor that primarily affects adolescent boys. Traditionally, these tumors have been removed via open surgical approaches. Recent advances in endoscopic equipment and techniques have enabled the endoscopic surgical excision of these tumors with favorable outcomes and decreased morbidity. At our institution as at others, we have achieved successful outcomes with transnasal endoscopic resection of JNA, including tumors with significant extension into adjacent compartments.

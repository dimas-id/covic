Asymptomatic cholelithiasis with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is one of few ideal fields for simultaneous "open" repair. In AAA cases with acute lithiasic cholecystitis, the simultaneous open repair is debatable due to increased possibility for prosthetic graft contamination. We report a case of a 78-year-old, ASA IV patient suffering from acute cholecystitis and concomitant (62 mm) AAA. The patient was treated by simultaneous endovascular AAA repair with a bifurcated prosthesis Endurant and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Operative time was 165 minutes with total blood loss <100 mL. The patient fed and mobilized the second postoperative day, and the course until patients' discharge the sixth day was uneventful. Follow-up imaging at first month confirmed the successful aneurysm's exclusion without endoleak or migration. The simultaneous endovascular AAA repair and laparoscopic cholecystectomy seems to be simple, safe, and effective technique and minimized the possibility of local and systemic postoperative complications.

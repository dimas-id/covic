Abstract A role for viral encoded genome-linked (VPg) proteins in translation has often been suggested because of their covalent attachment to the 5â€² end of the viral RNA, reminiscent of the cap structure normally present on most eukaryotic mRNAs. We tested the effect of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) VPgPro on translation of reporter RNAs in in vitro translation systems. The presence of VPgPro in either wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems lead to inhibition of translation. The inhibition did not appear to be mediated by the interaction of VPg with the eIF(iso)4E translation initiation factor since a VPg mutant that does not interact with eIF(iso)4E still inhibited translation. Monitoring the fate of RNAs revealed that they were degraded as a result of addition of TuMV VPgPro or of Norwalk virus (NV) VPg protein. The RNA degradation was not the result of translation being arrested and was heat labile and partially EDTA sensitive. The capacity of TuMV VPgPro and of (NV) VPg to degrade RNA suggests that these proteins have a ribonucleolytic activity which may contribute to the host RNA translation shutoff associated with many virus infections.

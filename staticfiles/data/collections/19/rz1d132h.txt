In today’s globally interconnected food system, outbreaks of foodborne disease can spread widely and cause considerable impact on public health. Food distribution is a complex system that can be seen as a network of trade flows connecting supply chain actors. Identifying the source of an outbreak of foodborne disease distributed across this network can be solved by considering this network structure and the dimensions of information it contains. The literature on the network source identification problem has grown widely in recent years covering problems in many different contexts, from contagious disease infecting a human population, to computer viruses spreading through the Internet, to rumors or trends diffusing through a social network. Much of this work has focused on studying this problem in analytically tractable frameworks, designing approaches to work on trees and extending to general network structures in an ad hoc manner. These simplified frameworks lack many features of real-world networks and problem contexts that can dramatically impact transmission dynamics, and therefore, backwards inference of the transmission process. Moreover, the features that distinguish foodborne disease in the context of source identification have not previously been studied or identified. In this article we identify these features, then provide a review of existing work on the network source identification problem, categorizing approaches according to these features. We conclude that much of the existing work cannot be implemented in the foodborne disease problem because it makes assumptions about the transmission process that are unrealistic in the context of food supply networks—that is, identifying the source of an epidemic contagion whereas foodborne contamination spreads through a transport network-mediated diffusion process, or because it requires data that is not available—complete observations of the contamination status of all nodes in the network.

In this study, anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and IMD-0354 was analyzed, these compounds were chosen based on their antiviral activities against other coronaviruses. Since they also inhibit Dengue virus (DENV) infection, other anti-DENV compounds/drugs were also assessed. Using SARS-CoV-2-infected VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, MPA and IMD-0354, but not other anti-DENV compounds/drugs, showed significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Although MPA reduced the viral RNA level by only ~100-fold, its EC50 was as low as 0.87ÂµM, which is easily achievable at therapeutic doses of mycophenolate mofetil. MPA targets coronaviral papain-like protease and its study would be useful in the development of novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

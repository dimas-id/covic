Two-hundred bovine sera from western Zaire were screened for antibodies to 8 viruses: BHV-1, BHV-2, BHV-4, BVD-MD virus, bovine adenovirus A and B, bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus. Positive sera were found to all these viruses. For animals whose origin was undoubted, the main features were the high prevalence of infections by rotavirus and BHV-4 and the low prevalence of infections by coronavirus and BVD-MD virus.

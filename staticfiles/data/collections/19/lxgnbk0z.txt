Background Onyx® is a liquid embolic agent, which is approved for the treatment of cerebral vascular lesions but still rarely used in peripheral interventional radiology. The goal of this study is to report the feasibility and safety of embolization with Onyx® for peripheral hemostatic and non-hemostatic endovascular procedures. Methods Retrospective study of all consecutive patients who underwent visceral or peripheral embolization with Onyx® for hemostatic or non-hemostatic purpose in our department between May 2014 and November 2016. Demographic data, clinical presentation, underlying etiology, culprit vessel, endovascular procedure, pain during embolization, outcomes, and follow-up data were collected. Results Fifty patients (males, 34; females, 16; mean age, 56±18 years; range, 15-89 years) were included. Twenty-nine (58%) of patients underwent hemostatic embolization for arterial (n=22, 44%) or venous (n=7, 14%) bleeding lesions, whereas 21 (42%) of patients underwent non-hemostatic embolization for arterial aneurysms (n=8, 16%), preoperative portal vein deprivation (n=6, 12%) or other indications (n=7, 14%). Onyx-18 was used in 37 (74%) patients, Onyx-34 in 9 (18%) patients, and a combination of both in 4 (8%) patients. Onyx was used alone in 25 (50%) patients and in combination with other agent in 25 (50%) patients. Mean number of Onyx® vials used was 3.7 (range, 1-17). Immediate technical success rate was 100%. Primary clinical success was achieved in all patients. Recurrent bleeding occurred in two patients. Significant pain (pain score ≥3) was noted during injection in 10 (20%) patients. No major complication or side effects were noted within 1 month. Conclusions Transcatheter embolization with Onyx® is feasible and safe in the peripheral arterial or venous vasculature for both bleeding and non-bleeding patients whatever the anatomic site.

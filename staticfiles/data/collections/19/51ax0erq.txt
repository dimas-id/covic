The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) has many real-world applications and practical values. The objective of DVRP is to find the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to service the given customer requests, without violating the vehicle capacity constraint. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed for solving the DVRP with the objective to minimize the total distance of the vehicles. The Brain Storm Optimization in objective space (BSO-OS) is applied to guide the choice of different strategies for the periodic reoptimization of routes. In the BSO-OS procedure, Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) and Ant Colony System (ACS) are used to generate new solutions. The experiments on the DVRP benchmark and comparative studies are conducted, from which 12 out of 21 new best solutions are obtained by the proposed algorithm, and the other nine solutions are also very competitive. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective and competitive.

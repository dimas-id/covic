PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review highlights selected studies related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention that were presented at the American College of Cardiology 2020 Virtual Scientific Session (ACC.20)/World Cardiology Congress (WCC). RECENT FINDINGS: The studies reviewed include clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of alirocumab (Study in Participants with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia [ODYSSEY HoFH]) and evinacumab in the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH); Evaluating the Efficacy of E-cigarettes for Smoking Cessation (E3); the use of renal denervation in the treatment of hypertension (SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED PIVOTAL); and the assessment of vericiguat in the treatment of heart failure (A Study of Vericiguat in Participants with Heart Failure with Reduce Ejection Fraction [VICTORIA]). In addition, results from the pooled analysis of phase III trials on inclisiran and secondary analysis examining eicosapentaenoic acid levels and cardiovascular outcomes from the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) were included. Finally, we discuss studies examining the use of polygenic risk score with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) on lifetime cardiovascular risk. SUMMARY: The studies presented at the ACC.20/WCC represent notable contributions in the field of CVD prevention.

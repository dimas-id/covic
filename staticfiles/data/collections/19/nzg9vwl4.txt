There is heated debate surrounding policy reform granting full state-level nurse practitioner (NP) scope of practice (SOP) in all U.S. states. NP SOP policy is argued to impact access to care; however, a synthesis of empirical studies assessing this relationship has yet to be performed. Our study fills this critical gap by systematically reviewing studies that examine this relationship. We apply Aday and Andersen's Access Framework to operationalize access to care. We also use this framework to map components of access to care that may relate to NP SOP through concepts identified in this review. Our findings suggest that full state-level NP SOP policy is associated with increases in various components of access to care, but additional work is needed to evaluate causality and underlying mechanisms behind this policy's effect on access. This work is necessary to align research, practice, and policy efforts surrounding NP SOP with healthcare accessibility.

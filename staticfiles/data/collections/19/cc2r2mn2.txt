OBJECTIVES Laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) is widely used although its clinical indications are often debated. The aim of this study was to retrospectively describe the experience of our surgical centre in order to establish the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of LIVHR using PARIETEX(™) Composite mesh (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2007 and November 2010, 87 patients were admitted to the Division of General Surgery of Aosta, with the diagnosis of abdominal wall hernia and underwent laparoscopic repair using PARIETEX(™) Composite mesh. The type and size of surgical defects, mean operative time, morbidity, mortality and rate of recurrence at one-year follow-up were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS We performed 87 LIVHR: 51.7% for incisional hernia and 48.3% for epigastric or umbilical hernias. Mean operative time was 100 min., conversion rate was 3.4%. The mean size of abdominal defect was 6 cm (range: 2-15); in relation to umbilical hernias, mean size was 5.4 cm (range: 2-8). The mortality rate was 0%; overall morbidity was 16%. At one-year follow-up, we observed two cases of hernia recurrences. CONCLUSIONS LIVHR using PARIETEX(™) Composite mesh is an effective and safe procedure with very low morbidity and low rates of postoperative pain and recurrence, especially in hernias with diameter of between 5 and 15 cm and in obese patients without previous laparotomies.

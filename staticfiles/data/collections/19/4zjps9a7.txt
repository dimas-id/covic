INTRODUCTION Appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency. The treatment is surgical and single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) involves performing laparoscopic surgery through a single transumbilical point, in an attempt to improve the results of laparoscopic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 73 patients with suspected acute appendicitis were operated on using the SILS technique between June 2009 and August 2010. All patients were operated on by the same surgical team, and the navel was the only point of entrance. Post-surgical pain was assessed using a numerical scale at the time of discharge. RESULTS None of the patients required conversion to conventional laparoscopy. The mean surgical time was 40±14 (16-80) minutes. There were no complications during or after the surgery. The mean post-surgical pain score was 3±1 (1-7) and the mean hospital stay was 18±7 (9-42) hours. CONCLUSION SILS is a safe and effective technique for appendicitis. In the future, the most common surgical procedures could be performed through the navel. This would be by surgeons, highly experienced in advance laparoscopic surgery in order to introduce this new technique safely without increasing morbidity and mortality.

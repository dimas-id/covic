Between 1950 and 1980, Japan eliminated several major parasitic diseases. In 1998, the Japanese Hashimoto Initiative was the first global programme to target parasitic diseases. Thereafter, Japan expanded its international cooperation to cover infectious diseases through integrated development programmes to improve health, to alleviate poverty and to help to achieve the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. Parasite control remains a major component of all subsequent operations. Opportunities to build upon past successes in order to improve the situation in the developing world – in addition to tackling emerging national threats – are promising. Substantial challenges remain and Japan has introduced major national reforms to try to overcome them.

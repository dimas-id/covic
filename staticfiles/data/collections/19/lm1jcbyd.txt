Abstract Apart from its enormous health and economic impact, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way of practicing medicine and medical education. It is likely that this effect may accelerate the transformation that both activities are experiencing. The present article, written at the peak of the crisis, sets out some thoughts on four topics: 1) the publication of false and sensationalist news; 2) risks of taking medical decisions not based on the evidence; 3) the bioethical implications when there are sufficient resources available for everybody and; 4) the possible effects of the crisis on the teaching of medicine. This crisis should enable doctors, teachers and, students of medicine to draw conclusions and be better prepared for the future. Firstly, it is essential to maintain critical thinking that may protect against the “infodemic”. Furthermore, the scientific and ethical standards learned in the faculty, should not be lowered, but remain intact. Lastly, it should be remembered that, in a devastating pandemic like the current one, apart from scientific medicine, which is practised with the brain, that other medicine that is practiced with the heart must also be practised.

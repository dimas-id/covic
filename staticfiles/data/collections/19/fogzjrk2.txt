Background There is variability among clinicians in their ability to detect murmurs during cardiac auscultation and identify the underlying pathology. Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. Objective The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform. Methods Using over 34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 373 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the four primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by three expert cardiologists. Results Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1, sensitivity increases to 90.0%. The algorithm detects moderate-to-severe or greater aortic stenosis with sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 77.7% and detects moderate-to-severe or greater mitral regurgitation with sensitivity of 64.0% and specificity of 90.5%. Conclusion The deep learning algorithm ability to detect murmurs and clinically significant aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation is comparable to expert cardiologists. The research findings attest to the reliability and utility of such algorithms as front-line clinical support tools to aid clinicians in screening for cardiac murmurs caused by valvular heart disease.

This paper presents an exploratory approach for the governance of Society in the context of Smarter Life. By answering the challenges of the era of Digitalisation, facing profound societal changes, benefiting from multiple innovations, information systems and services play an outstanding role in improving and enhancing life of humans and contribute to the progress in Smarter Life. This exploratory approach is based on information, whilst information systems and services contribute to developing new practices, creating new situations, generating new added value. In this perspective, information and knowledge can be viewed as information common good, which is in the heart of service design. It is essential that services are designed in an exploratory way, by involving multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, even multi-national actors, whose active participation would lead to the development of new value-added services. This can be done thanks to a protected place adapted to co-construction of information services, Tiers-Lieu for Services (TLS). To assist the dynamics of the servitised Society and support its governing in a sustainable way, an institutional instrument, called people-public-private-partnerships for services (4PS), is presented.

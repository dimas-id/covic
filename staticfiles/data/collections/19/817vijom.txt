The categorical ethos of artificial intelligence is influenced by its basic structure, which defines its due purpose as a legal personality, challenging the conventional standards of law and justice in a globalized world. Recent developments show a precedential growth in the need-perspective of the AI industry, thereby influencing governance and corporate operations and their legal side in cross-cultural avenues. The determinant outlining of artificial intelligence as a legal personality rests on its probabilistic nature, which yet can be limited to the jurisprudential scope of AI-based on the ethos of the utilitarian approach involving the anthropocentric innovations for artificial intelligence. The dynamic nature of AI, however, in the proposition, is capable of a full-fledged and anthropomorphic legal representation and interpretation, which is hard to find in D9 and certain developing countries, which poses special risks to the generic legal infrastructure of a democratic polity to understand the dynamic and self-transformative nature of artificial intelligence in the age of globalization. The paper is thus based on the proposition that the ethos involving the legal infrastructure and persona of artificial intelligence is traceable and easier in deterministic mechanisms by regarding and extending stable & constitutive approaches to dissect the legal challenges connected with the redemptions implicated with the lack of a full-fledged regard and scope of the legal personality of AI. The approaches in due proposition are (a) anthropomorphisation; (b) naturalization; (c) techno-socialization; and (d) enculturation. Further, the paper analyses on the challenges to determine the problematic implications awaited by the influence of populism, protectionism, data-centred digital colonialism and technology distancing and proposes suggestions based on the four approaches to counter the minimal effects of the implications. The conclusions of the paper rest on the argument that in the case of a post-liberal order, the ethos of AI can be protected and diversified by adapting with the appreciation of the ethos of globalization, giving adequate, constitutive and reasonable space to the identity-led implications of national identity & diluting the monopolistic influence of the utilitarian approach to artificial intelligence.

Objective To investigate the psychological status of clinical nurses in a class A hospital facing the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), in order to provide effective psychological and social intervention. Methods A total of 867 clinical nurses were randomly selected from the Mianyang Central Hospital. The general information questionnaire, standard self-assessment anxiety scale (SAS) and crisis intervention classification assessment scale (TAF) were used to conduct self-assessment questionnaire survey. Then the data were analyzed by the SPSS22.0 software. Results 38.8% of the nurses had a low risk of infection, 18.0% of them had a medium risk, 29.6% had a medium high risk, and 13.6% had a high risk. The SAS scores of clinical nurses in this hospital were statistically significant different, compared with the Chinese norm value ( P <0.05). The difference between TAF score and the degree of crisis response of nursing students in SARS period was statistically significant ( P <0.05). The majority of clinical nurses had less crisis response to NCP, with 80.7% of them suffered mild cognitive, emotional and behavioral damage, and only 2.0% suffered severe damage. Analysis of related factors showed that department, self-test risk of infection, length of service had significant influence on SAS and TAF scores of clinical nurses ( P <0.05). Conclusion During the period of NCP prevalence, no obvious anxiety and crisis reaction among clinical nurses is found in the third grade hospital. However, the psychological changes of clinical nurses with middle-age, from key epidemic prevention departments and in high risk of self-test infection are more likely to produce anxiety and crisis reaction. Therefore, appropriate and timely psychological intervention should be given.

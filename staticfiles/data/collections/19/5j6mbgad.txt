An essential effect of environmental stiffness on biological processes in cells at present is generally accepted. An increase in arterial stiffness with advanced age has been reported in many publications. The aim of the present review is to summarize current information about possible chemical reactions and physical processes that lead to tissue stiffening and result in age-related diseases in order to find methods that can prevent or retard time-dependent tissue stiffening. The analysis of published data shows that bound water acts as a plasticizer of biological tissues, a decrease in bound water content results in an increase in biological tissue stiffness, and increased tissue stiffness leads to NF-kB activation and triggered actin polymerization-NF-kB activation is associated with age-related diseases. It can be suggested that changes in bound water content through changing tissue stiffness can affect cellular processes and the development of pathologies related to aging. Both age-related diseases and COVID-19 may be associated with tight-junction disruption and increased tissue stiffness and permeability.

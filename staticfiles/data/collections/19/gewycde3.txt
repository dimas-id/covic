Abstract As a physiotherapist student, I was asked by the ARS to reinforce the care team of a nursing home welcoming residents affected by Covid-19. I had to acquire the specific hygiene and protection rules for this situation in addition to nursing work. Whenever necessary, I applied my physiotherapist knowledgeâ€™s to serve residents and carers. This disease is exhausting for the patients; their respiratory and general condition can fluctuate quickly. Without treatment to cure them, we have to accompany them as comfortably as possible.

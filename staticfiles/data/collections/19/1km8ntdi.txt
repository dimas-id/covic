BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare outcome measures between conventional transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy and single-incision laparoscopic adrenalectomy (SILA). METHODS Between January 2006 and April 2010, a total of 96 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Of these, 74 (77.1%) underwent conventional transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (group 1) and 22 (32.9%) underwent SILA (group 2). Age, sex ratio, tumor size, operating time, blood loss, postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores, and duration of hospitalization were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The mean ages of the patients in groups 1 and 2 were 43.4 ± 12.3 and 43.3 ± 10 years, respectively (P = 0.7). The female:male ratios in groups 1 and 2 were 1.6:1 and 4.5:1, respectively (P < 0.0001). The mean tumor size was significantly larger in group 1 than in group 2 (4.7 ± 1.5 vs. 3.34 ± 1.06 cm, respectively; P = 0.093). No significant difference was found between group 1 and group 2 with respect to the mean operating time (68.4 ± 20.8 vs. 63.9 ± 16.9 min, respectively; P = 0.36) or the level of intraoperative blood loss (38 ± 26.5 vs. 48.4 ± 62.4 ml, respectively; P = 0.26). The postoperative VAS score was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (2.05 ± 0.57 and 3.28 ± 0.63, respectively; P < 0.0001). The length of hospital stay was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (3.04 ± 1.2 and 2.45 ± 0.96 days, respectively; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION The findings of the present study suggest that SILA is as safe as conventional transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Furthermore, SILA is associated with less pain and better cosmesis than the conventional laparoscopic procedure.

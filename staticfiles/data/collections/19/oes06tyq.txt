X-ray microtomography (micro-CT), one of the most resourceful instruments for high resolution 3D analysis, can provide qualitative and quantitative accurate structural and compositional information for a broad range of materials. Yet its contribution to the field of biopolymeric materials science is often limited by low imaging contrast due to scarce X-ray attenuation features, particularly for sponges and foam-like structures. This limitation can be overcome to some extent by adjusting the working parameters of micro-CT equipment. However, such approach also facilitates noise and artefacts, and solving the signal-to-noise trade-off has been always problematic. Searching for alternatives turns one's attention towards the improvement of X-ray attenuation features. While several studies report the use of contrast agents for biological materials, studies to integrate multiple micro-CT approaches for biopolymers were not conducted so far. This method paper is thus aimed to serve as a platform for micro-CT analysis of low X-ray absorptive polymers. Here, several contrast enhancing artifices were developed and trialled on gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol) biopolymer composites (GP). Accordingly, GP were modified with iodine, barium, silver-based chemicals and hexa(methyl disilazane) by two different methods, i.e. addition of high atomic number chemicals during materials synthesis and post-synthesis staining, respectively. Consequently, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy emerged as complementary characterization, aimed to confirm the reproducibility of samples morphological features. The most versatile methods were barium chloride additive incorporation and iodine staining coupled with hexa(methyl disilazane) chemical drying. Both methods significantly improved the X-ray absorbance of our polymeric samples, providing better contrast of micro-CT tomograms.

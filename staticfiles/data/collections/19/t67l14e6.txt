Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for both COVID-19 and secondary cardiovascular outcomes. Their increased cardiovascular risk may be mitigated through physical activity, but public health measures implemented for COVID-19 can make physical activity challenging. We objectively measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, continuously measured by Fitbit step counts, in children with CHD. Step counts were markedly lower in late March and early April 2020, compared with 2019 and early March 2020. It is vital to understand how precautions for COVID-19 will affect the health of children with CHD, especially if they persist long term.

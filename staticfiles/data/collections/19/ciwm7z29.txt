Cathodoluminescence (CL) has evolved into a standard analytical technique in (scanning) transmission electron microscopy. CL utilizes light excited due to the interactions between the electron-beam and the sample. In the present study we focus on CËerenkov radiation. We make use of the fact that the electron transparent specimen acts as a Fabry-Pérot interferometer for coherently emitted radiation. From the wavelength dependent interference pattern of thickness dependent measurements we calculate the refractive index of the studied material. We describe the limits of this approach and compare it with the determination of the refractive index by using valence electron energy loss spectrometry (VEELS).

It has been proposed that magnocellular and parvocellular sensitivity in schizophrenic individuals can be assessed using steady-state visually evoked potentials (VEPs) to either low-contrast stimuli or stimuli whose contrast is modulated around a high contrast "pedestal" (Green MF, Butler PD, Chen Y, et al. Schizophr Bull. 2009;35:163-181). This suggestion faces 2 difficulties: (1) To use low-contrast stimuli to activate the magnocellular system is inconsistent with lesion studies that have shown that under many conditions, the parvocellular system responds to the lowest contrasts and (2) To rely on contrast-response relationships to identify magnocellular and parvocellular responses is difficult because other neurons exist in the visual system that have contrast-response relationships similar to those of magnocellular and parvocellular cells.

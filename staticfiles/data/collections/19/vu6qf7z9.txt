BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the outbreak, the disease has caused more than 60,502 deaths worldwide. Lian-Hua Qing-Wen Granule (LHQWG) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. However, there is no evidence that LHQWG is effective for COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive literature search will be conducted. Two methodological trained researchers will read the title, abstract and full texts and independently select the qualified literature according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After assessment of the risk of bias and data extraction, we will conduct meta-analyses for outcomes related to COVID-19. The heterogeneity of data will be investigated by Cochrane X and I tests. Publication bias assessment will be conducted by funnel plot analysis and Egger test. RESULTS: The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: Our study aims to systematically present the clinical evidence of LHQWG in treating COVID-19, which will be of significant meaning for further research and clinical practice.

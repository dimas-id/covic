Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which initially occurred in Wuhan, China in late 2019, is now rapidly spreading globally. Epilepsy, a disease characterized by a spontaneous recurrence of unprovoked seizures, is a common chronic neurological condition. Associations between epilepsy and COVID-19 have not been reported. Here, we discuss the important considerations for epilepsy patients by reviewing known facts of COVID-19 and suggestions from medical societies associated with epilepsy, as well as inferences from past experiences of infectious diseases. We discuss the risk of COVID-19 for epilepsy patients, the effect of COVID-19 on epilepsy patients, and the importance of maintaining seizure control. We also consider suggestions for epilepsy monitoring units or surgery, what caregivers should know, and the importance of public awareness. The effect of COVID-19 on individuals with epilepsy remains unclear due to the lack of enough evidence. Clinicians and researchers need to share case information, continue investigations, and provide known facts to epilepsy patients and their families.

Abstract Background Nucleic acid (NA) amplification techniques are now commonly used to diagnose and manage patients with infectious diseases. The growth in the number of Food and Drug Administrationâ€“approved test kits and analyte-specific reagents has facilitated the use of this technology in clinical laboratories. Technological advances in NA amplification techniques, automation, NA sequencing, and multiplex analysis have reinvigorated the field and created new opportunities for growth. Simple, sample-in, answer-out molecular test systems are now widely available that can be deployed in a variety of laboratory and clinical settings. Molecular microbiology remains the leading area in molecular pathology in terms of both the numbers of tests performed and clinical relevance. NA-based tests have reduced the dependency of the clinical microbiology laboratory on more traditional antigen detection and culture methods and created new opportunities for the laboratory to impact patient care. Content This chapter reviews NA testing as it applies to specific pathogens or infectious disease syndromes, with a focus on those diseases for which NA testing is now considered the standard of care and highlights the unique challenges and opportunities that these tests present for clinical laboratories.

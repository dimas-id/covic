OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to provide the anatomic rationale for a transnasal approach to the orbital apex and cavernous sinus, and to evaluate its applicability and efficiency. METHODS One hundred patients with lesions of the orbital apex, cavernous sinus, optic nerve, clivus, parapharyngeal space, infratemporal fossa, or pterygopalatine fossa were reviewed over a 10-year period. All patients underwent an endoscopic transnasal approach to the orbital apex and cavernous sinus. The surgical technique required a standard endoscopic sinus surgery set. The possible complications were recorded and classified as intraoperative or postoperative. RESULTS There were complications in 8 cases: 4 intraoperative and 4 postoperative. The intraoperative complications included rupture of the internal carotid artery in 1 patient and cerebrospinal fluid leak in 3 patients. All intraoperative complications were resolved during surgery. The postoperative complications were transitory eyelid ptosis in 2 patients (resolved in 6 months) and transitory diplopia with immediate deficit of the medial rectus muscle in 2 patients (completely resolved in 1 month). CONCLUSIONS With the use of this technique, the surgeon can precisely identify the position of the surgical instrument without losing his or her way, thereby significantly reducing the rate of complications.

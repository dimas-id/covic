Abstract Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a member of the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae and is an important pathogen of viral myocarditis, which accounts for more than 50% viral myocarditis cases. VP1 is major capsid protein that this region has a low homology in both amino acid and nucleotide sequences among Enteroviruses. Therefore we have chosen this region for designed a set of RT-LAMP primers for CVB3 detection. For this the total RNA was extracted from 24-h post infected-HeLa cells with complete cytopathic effect (CPE), and applied to a one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction (RT-LAMP) using CVB3-specific primers. The optimization of RT-LAMP reaction was carried out with three variables factors including MgSO4 concentration, temperature and time of incubation. Amplification was analyzed by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide and SYBR Green staining. Our results were shown the ladder-like pattern of the VP1 gene amplification. The LAMP reaction mix was optimized and the best result observed at 4mM MgSO4 and 60Â°C for 90min incubation. RT-LAMP had high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CVB3 infection. This method can be used as a rapid and easy diagnostic test for detection of CVB3 in clinical laboratories.

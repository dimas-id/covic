Abstract Click chemistry involves reactions that were originally introduced and used in organic chemistry to generate substances by joining small units together with heteroatom linkages (C-X-C). Over the last few decades, click chemistry has been widely used in virus-related research. Using click chemistry, the virus particle as well as viral protein and nucleic acids can be labeled. Subsequently, the labeled virions or molecules can be tracked in real time. Here, we reviewed the recent applications of click reactions in virus-related research, including viral tracking, the design of antiviral agents, the diagnosis of viral infection, and virus-based delivery systems. This review provides an overview of the general principles and applications of click chemistry in virus-related research.

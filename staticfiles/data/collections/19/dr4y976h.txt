We report the identification and genome characterization of a novel bocavirus, feline bocavirus (FBoV), and novel bocaviruses closely related to canine bocavirus (CBoV) strain Con-161 in stray cats and dogs in Hong Kong, respectively. FBoV was detected by PCR in 7.2, 0.3, 1.6, 2.0 and 0.8% of faecal, nasal, urine, kidney and blood samples, respectively, from 364 cats, while CBoV was detected in 4.6, 5.1, 6.3 and 0.3% of faecal, nasal, urine and blood samples, respectively, from 351 dogs. Three FBoV genomes sequenced revealed the presence of three ORFs characteristic of bocaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that FBoVs were related only distantly to other bocaviruses, forming a distinct cluster within the genus, with â‰¤ 5.7% nucleotide identities to the genome of minute virus of canines. The four CBoV genomes sequenced shared 87.4-89.2% nucleotide identities with that of CBoV strain Con-161. In addition to the three bocavirus ORFs, they encoded an additional ORF, ORF4, immediately downstream of the ORF for non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which was not found in other bocaviruses including CBoV strain Con-161. They also possessed a putative second exon encoding the C-terminal region of NS1 and conserved RNA-splicing signals, previously described in human bocaviruses. Partial VP1/VP2 sequence analysis of 23 FBoV and 25 CBoV strains demonstrated inter-host genetic diversity, with two potential genetic groups of FBoV and a novel CBoV group, CBoV-HK, distinct from the three groups, CBoV-A to -C, found in the USA. Although the pathogenicity of FBoV and CBoV remains to be determined, their presence in different host tissues suggested wide tissue tropism.

The objective of this study was to assess the risk of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) of ultrasound (US)-guided cannulation of the brachiocephalic vein (BCV) compared to standard epicutaneous cava catheters (ECCs) in preterm infants. This was a retrospective cohort study in preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g. Each BCV catheter was matched 1:3 with ECCs according to sex, birth weight, and year of insertion. The main outcome was the CLABSI density rate per 1000 days. Secondary outcomes included CLABSI episodes, CLABSI episodes per infant, and CLABSI/death. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether the type of catheter (ECC vs. BCV) was associated with CLABSI risk. Ninety-six catheters (21 BCVs and 75 ECCs) in 79 infants were included (993 catheter days). BCV catheters were associated with a reduced CLABSI density rate compared to ECCs (3.05/1000 days vs 21.1/1000 days; p < 0.001). ECCs were associated with increased CLABSI risk compared to BCV catheters in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 36; (95% CI, 2.5–511); p = 0.008). Conclusion: US-guided supraclavicular cannulation of the BCV was associated with a reduced risk of CLABSI compared to ECCs. This finding deserves further multicenter research.

So far, the debate on the BRI has mostly been dominated by scholars in international relations and geopolitics and economists. More recently, lawyers tried to enter into this interdisciplinary debate. Western scholars frequently refer to the initiative as mere propaganda while the Eastern contributions on the topic are above all descriptive (however, germs of a proper and critical legal approach can be found in recent articles). This volume aims to overcome this divide, taking into consideration the different Eastern and Western perspectives.

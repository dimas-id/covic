Abstract We describe normal pregnancy outcome in a case of first trimester exposure to injectable ribavirin in a 36-year-old pregnant woman who received three intramuscular injections of ribavirin for suspected SARS. She delivered at 40 weeks of gestation a healthy baby girl. In pediatric follow up at 8 month of age, physical examination and neurodevelopmental milestones were normal.

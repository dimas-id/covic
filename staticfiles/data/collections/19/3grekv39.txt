We developed a patient-based survey to evaluate the impact of a respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette implementation strategy on infection control practices in the emergency department. The frequency of self-reported mask use by coughing patients was low (27%) and often inconsistent. The frequency of use was highest among patients who presented with myalgia (odds ratio, 14.7; P = .02) and among patients who visited the emergency department during January (odds ratio, 4.1; P = .04).

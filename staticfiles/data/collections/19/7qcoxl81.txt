Viral infections of laboratory mice have considerable impact on research results, and prevention of such infections is therefore of crucial importance. This chapter covers infections of mice with the following viruses: herpesviruses, mousepox virus, murine adenoviruses, polyomaviruses, parvoviruses, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mammalian orthoreovirus serotype 3, murine hepatitis virus, murine norovirus, murine pneumonia virus, murine rotavirus, Sendai virus, and Theilerâ€™s murine encephalomyelitis virus. For each virus, there is a description of the agent, epizootiology, clinical symptoms, pathology, methods of diagnosis and control, and its impact on research.

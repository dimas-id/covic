Objective@#To summarize the clinical characteristics of 141 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and the imaging characteristics of High Resolution CT(HRCT) in the chest.@*Methods@#From January 20, 2020 to 28, 141 NCP patients, 77 males and 64 females, with a median age of 49 (9,87), were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT findings of 141 NCP patients were analyzed.@*Results@#In 141 NCP patients, 38 (26.95%) had a decrease in leukocyte count and 71 (50.35%) had a decrease in lymphocyte ratio. Among 141 NCP patients, 139 (98.58%) had fever (over 37.5 Â° C), 106 (75.18%) coughed, 11 (7.80%) had headache, 41 (29.08%) coughed up sputum, 93 (65.96%) had chest distress, and 4 (2.84%) had diarrhea. HRCT of 141 NCP patients were abnormal, 52 (36.88%) showed ground glass shadow (GGO) and patchy shadow, mainly subpleural distribution; 23 (16.31%) showed GGO with focal consolidation; 27 (19.15%) had small patchy blur; 20 (14.18%) had large patchy consolidation; 48 (34.04%) had bronchovascular bundle thickening and vascular perforator sign; 5 (3.55%) had Air bronchus sign; small nodule shadow in 7 cases (4.96%); fibrosis, grid shadow or strip shadow in 5 cases (3.55%); bilateral pleural effusion in 7 cases (4.96%); mediastinal or bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy in 4 cases (2.84%).@*Conclusions@#The clinical features and HRCT images of NCP are various. Under the specific epidemiological background of NCP, HRCT scan of chest should be carried out in time to make early warning of disease.

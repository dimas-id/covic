Bioactive copper nanomaterials are an emerging class of nano-antimicrobials providing complimentary effects and characteristics, as compared to other nano-sized metals, such as silver or zinc oxide nanoparticles. In this chapter, copper nano-antimicrobials are reviewed and classified firstly as a function of the preparation methods, and secondly as a function of the target microorganism used for testing their antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of copper-based nanostructures depends on the microbial species and on the experimental set-up. As a consequence, in this chapter details are provided on methods, as well as on experimental details such as contact time, microorganism strain, concentration of the interacting species, etc. Finally, real-life applications of copper-based nanoantimicrobials are briefly discussed.

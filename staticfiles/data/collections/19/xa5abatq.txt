When treating migraine patients in the current era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19), many institutions have moved away from face‐to‐face procedures like onabotulinumtoxinA injections,(1) sometimes transitioning to the newer CGRP antibodies for migraine prevention. However, despite our best efforts to mitigate viral transmission, many of our migraine patients may eventually be exposed to SARS‐CoV2. While most patients will have mild to moderate symptoms, a subset will become severely ill, with possible complications including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Given the possibility of this level of severe respiratory illness, we should consider what effect blocking calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) might have on these patients.

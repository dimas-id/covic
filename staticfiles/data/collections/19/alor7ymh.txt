Pollution represents a leading threat to global health and ecosystems. Systems-based initiatives, including Planetary Health, EcoHealth, and One Health, require theoretical and translational platforms to address chemical pollution. Comparative and predictive toxicology are providing integrative approaches for identifying problematic contaminants, designing less hazardous alternatives, and reducing the impacts of chemical pollution.

Faecal samples from 434 calves under 1 year of age (307 diarrhoeal and 127 normal) were collected from three dairy farms and one village in selected areas of Bangladesh. The samples were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the presence of rotavirus antigen. Of 402 dairy calves tested, 28 (7.0%) were positive, of which 21 (7.2%) were from diarrhoeic calves and 7 (6.3%) from non-diarrhoeic calves. Rotavirus infection varied from farm to farm (2.7–9.2%) and there was no positive response from any of the 32 village calves. Rotavirus was most commonly found in calves of 1 week of age or less (up to 22.2% in one group) but was not found in any calves later than 6 months of age. More than 80% of rotavirus-positive samples from diarrhoeic calves exhibited a titre of 128 or more (geometric mean 345±4.5), whereas non-diarrhoeal calves had titres less than or equal to 128 (geometric mean=29±1.9), suggesting that rotavirus infection in calves in Bangladesh was mostly associated with diarrhoea.

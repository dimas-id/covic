Introduction: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently in epidemic stage. After large-scale interpersonal infection, asymptomatic patients appear. Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts.Areas covered: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers. The patients were treated with four combinations of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, arbidol tablets, Lianhuaqingwen granules, and recombinant human interferon-&#945;2b (IFN-&#945;2b) injection via aerosol. Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed.Expert opinion: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious. They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown. It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients. IFN-&#945;2b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection. Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vivo. The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.

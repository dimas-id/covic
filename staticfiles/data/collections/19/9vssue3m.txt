Abstract The tylophorine analog rac-cryptopleurine exhibited potent anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity through allosteric regulation of ATPase activity of heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70). We evaluated the impact of modifications on the E-ring of rac-cryptopleurine to the inhibitory activity against HCV replication and regulation of ATPase activity of Hsc70. Cryptopleurine analog YXM-110 with a 13Î±-hydroxyl group maintained activity against HCV and promoted ATP/ADP turnover of Hsc70; however, compounds with hydroxyl groups at other positions or with other orientations (YXM-109, YXM-139, and YXM-140) did not exhibit similar activities. Size modification or heteroatom incorporation of the E-ring led to loss of anti-HCV activity. Promotion of the chaperone activity of Hsc70 with carboxyl terminus Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) further enhanced the anti-HCV activity of rac-cryptopleurine and XYM-110. This structure-activity relationship (SAR) study refined structural design and optimization for developing rac-crytopleurine analogs as potent anti-HCV agents targeted against the host factor involved in HCV replication.

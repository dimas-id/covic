Two coronaviruses causing severe respiratory disease and high mortality rates emerging within the past dozen years reinforces the need for clinically efficacious antivirals targeting coronaviruses. Alternative screening approaches for antivirals against the recently emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may provide lead compounds to address this need. Two Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (AAC) papers screened libraries of approved compounds that may potentially be repurposed as MERS-CoV antivirals. A third AAC paper showed that a previously described severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) helicase inhibitor also has activity against MERS-CoV.

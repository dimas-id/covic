AIM To evaluate the effects of a prolonged lockdown due to Coronavirus (COVID-19) on adoption of newer technologies and changes in glycemic control on patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in India. METHODS The study population included a random list of 3000 individuals with T2D derived from 30,748 individuals who had visited a large tertiary diabetes centre during the past year. The survey was carried out through telephonic interview. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on changes in lifestyle, access and challenges to diabetes care and use of technologies such as telemedicine facilities and use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) etc. Results: Of the 2510 individuals successfully interviewed(83.7% response rate), 382 (15.2%) reported having attempted to consult their healthcare providers during the lockdown, of whom only 30.6% utilized telemedicine facility. However, 96 (82%) of those who utilized telemedicine facility(n=117) were happy with their experience and 68 (58.1%) were willing to continue to use the facility in the future. Only 11.4% of participants utilized online support for management of diabetes. Use of self-monitoring of blood glucose(SMBG) increased significantly from 15.5% to 51.3% during the lockdown. There was an improvement in glycemic control during the lockdown [HbA1c:Before vs. during lockdown:8.2±1.9% vs.7.7±1.7%, p<0.001] in a non-randomly selected subset of subjects (n= 205). CONCLUSIONS Acceptance of telemedicine facilities remains suboptimal in this Asian Indian population, in spite of high levels of satisfaction among those who utilized it. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have not adversely affected metabolic control in our patients, and indeed there appears to be an improvement in HbA1c levels. Greater accessibility and acceptance of technology could help individuals with diabetes to maintain better contact with their physicians and ensure better metabolic control in the future.

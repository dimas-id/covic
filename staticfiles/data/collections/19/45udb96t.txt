Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV‐2) is an aetiological agent that causes acute haemorrhagic enteritis and fatal myocarditis in dogs. Since CPV‐2 first emerged in the late 1970s, its rapid evolution has resulted in three antigenic variants: CPV‐2a, CPV‐2b and CPV‐2c. Here, we report, for the first time in Korea, two cases of CPV‐2c infection in two dogs with severe diarrhoea. The complete open reading frame (4,269nt) of CPV‐2, encoding both non‐structural (NS) and structural (VP) proteins, was sequenced. Based on the amino acid Gln present at residue 426 of the VP2 gene, these strains were typed as CPV‐2c, and were named Korea CPV‐2c_1 and Korea CPV‐2c_2. These strains shared 99.48% reciprocal nucleotide sequence identity and had the highest nucleotide identity (99.77%–99.34%) with Asian CPV strains isolated in China, Italy (found in a dog imported from Thailand), and Vietnam from 2013 to 2017. Phylogenetic analysis based on the non‐structural (NS1) and capsid (VP2) genes revealed that Korean CPV‐2c strains clustered closely to Asian CPV strains, and separately from strains isolated in Europe, South America and North America. Amino acid changes never reported before were observed in NS1 (Thr70Pro, Cys287Tyr), VP1 (Lys17Arg, Phe33Leu) and VP2 (Gln365His, Ala516Val). Additional observed mutations, including Phe267Tyr, Tyr324Ile and Gln370Arg, have been previously reported in the recent CPV‐2c strains with Asian origins. These results suggest that the Korean CPV‐2c strains were potentially introduced via neighbouring Asian countries.

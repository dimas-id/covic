BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy is a recent, purely restrictive procedure in bariatric surgery that has shown results similar to gastric bypass over the short and middle term. At the same time, single-port access surgery has fostered the development of new techniques and methods seeking better cosmetic results and less postoperative pain, while maintaining the satisfactory results obtained by the standard laparoscopic approach. One of the problems associated to single-access surgery is the lack of traction and the difficulties to retract the liver. The authors' aim was to try to avoid additional trocars or sutures in order to perform pure single-incision surgery, using 2 magnetic forceps. METHODS The authors present the case of a 51-year-old morbidly obese female (body mass index = 44.82) who underwent a pure single-access laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with no additional trocars or sutures and assisted by 2 neodymium magnetic forceps: one to retract the liver and the other to retract the stomach in order to provide sufficient triangulation for adequate exposure of the surgical field during dissection. RESULTS The procedure was completed in 120 minutes. No preoperative or postoperative complications were recorded, and the patient was discharged 2 days after surgery. CONCLUSION Single-port access sleeve gastrectomy assisted by magnetic forceps is feasible and safe in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, solving one of the problems associated to this type of surgery, that is, the need for an additional trocar and needles or sutures to retract the liver and stomach in order to perform the operation.

RNA processing events modulate final productivity of a given transgene. We have evaluated a series of RNA elements for their ability to enhance Î±1-antitrypsin production in mammary cells. Our results indicate the need for a case-by-case assessment of each construct design and the occurrence of gene silencing events in vivo.

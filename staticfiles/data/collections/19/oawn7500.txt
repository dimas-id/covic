BACKGROUND Although the vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) is effective in achieving weight loss without metabolic side effects during the first few years, late failures cause weight regain in about 20% of the patients. The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the procedure of choice to convert a failed VBG. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between August 2014 and June 2016, 37 patients (23 females and 14 males) underwent revisional LRYGBs after failed VBGs. Thirty-four patients had open VBGs and two patients had laparoscopic butterfly gastroplasties. These patients completed follow-ups of at least 1 year. RESULTS The median operating time was 164 min (range 132-246), and the mean length of the hospital stay was 2.4 days (range 2-7). The mean body mass index (BMI) of the study group was 42.5 kg/m2, while the mean BMI and the percentage of excess body weight loss (%EBWL) for the patients 6 months after the operation were 31.7 kg/m2 and 52.1%, respectively. The mean BMI and %EBWL for the patients 1 year after the operation were 29.5 kg/m2 and 67.7%, respectively. There were neither intraoperative complications nor postoperative mortalities, but the overall complication rate was 22% (eight patients). CONCLUSION An LRYGB following a VBG is technically challenging, but safe, with low morbidity and mortality rates. Moreover, a revisional LRYGB provides excellent weight loss results.

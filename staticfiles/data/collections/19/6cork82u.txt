Imported parasitoses are an uncommon condition in our setting, although recently, the increase of migratory flow has been leading to an increase in the detected cases of these diseases. This fundamentally occurs in immigrants from tropical zones where these conditions are generally endemic. However, imported parasitoses are being increasingly diagnosed in Western persons who have lived in the tropics for different reasons. When examining a subject with cardiovascular syndromes with a possible parasitic origin, it could be useful to classify the possible geographic zone of origin in order to perform disease screening. Then, if the problem is mainly respiratory, it would be well to first rule out the existence of tuberculosis in the case of long stays and to individual the diagnosis according to the geographic area, season of the year, type of exposure and symptoms presented, in the case of shorter stays.

Some nations have the option of pursuing a policy of complete elimination of covid-19 instead of a policy of "flattening the curve" so that the load the dis- ease places on medical facilities is bearable. A policy of elimination requires a rather onerous "lockdown". As the goal of elimination is approached, it is therefore important that there be an informed trade-off between the risk of disease re-emergence and the duration of the "lockdown". Here it is shown that an important factor in assessing this trade-off, is the distribution of secondary cases, not just the expected value of this distribution, R0 . It is shown that a distribution in which "super-spreaders" are more prominent in the epidemiology, allows for an earlier release from "lockdown" with reasonable safety despite some probability of asymptomatic cases. There is some evidence to support such a distribution for covid-19. Analytical calculations and simulations show that once there is only one recognised case in some subregion, release from "lockdown" will be reasonably safe after just one or two further incubation periods.

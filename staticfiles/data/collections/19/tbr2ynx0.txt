The reliable detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) or total antibodies directed against the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is important for clinical diagnostics and epidemiological studies. Here, we compare the diagnostic accuracy of six commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG; Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/2 IgG; Epitope EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA Kit; Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG); Mikrogen recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG) or total SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays (Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2). The test sensitivities were analyzed with a set of 34 sera obtained from 26 patients after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and varied from 76.9% (Euroimmun) to 96.2% (Abbott). The majority of assay results were confirmed in a laboratory-developed plaque reduction neutralization test and by a SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific line assay including measurement of generally low IgG avidities (Mikrogen recomLine Coronavirus IgG [Aviditaet], prototype). Moreover, 100 stored sera collected during summer 2018 (N = 50) and winter season 2018/2019 (N = 50) were included to demonstrate test specificities. These varied from 96.0% (DiaSorin) to 100% (Epitope EDI). A subset of sera were retested with a lateral flow test (STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Duo) and a considerably lower sensitivity was noted. Overall, the diagnostic accuracy of the six SARS-CoV-2 IgG/total antibody assays was good and varied from 92.9% (Euroimmun) to 98.4% (Abbott). Due to the different specificities, results of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests should be interpreted with caution. A high proportion of antibody-positive patient sera demonstrated neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2.

Uterine leiomyosarcoma is an uncommon pathology, predominantly found in aged population. Patients with metastatic disease have poor survival and therapy mainly consists of palliative systemic chemotherapy. However, more aggressive strategies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may benefit patients with limited secondary disease. RFA is considered a simple and safe modality for treatment of hepatic lesions. The benefits related to RFA include low morbidity, short hospital stay and the possibility to repeat the procedure when necessary due to recurrences. However, minor and major complications related to mechanical and thermal damage may occur, especially in cases of tumors adjacent to extrahepatic organs and those at subcapsular position. This case report shows a successful RFA of two hepatic subcapsular leiomyosarcoma metastases neighbouring the gallbladder, without a safe cleavage plane from it. Combined hydrodissection, percutaneous cholecystostomy and continuous irrigation were performed as effective techniques to prevent thermal injury. Clinical and radiological follow up demonstrates no local complication.

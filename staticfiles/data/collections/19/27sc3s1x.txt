Blockchain is a rich and attractive domain for researchers since it is independent of “third party” such as Bank or government. This “open” phenomenon does not respect all the security criteria such as private data protection and confidentiality; hence, we cannot trust this approach despite its contributions. Blockchain technology has gained considerable progress in recent years in fields such as e-health. The medical data contains personal and sensitive information that must be preserved. The current Blockchain systems suffer from serious practical limitations, e.g. poor performance, high-energy consumption and lack of confidentiality. On the other hand, Trust Execution Environment TEE is imperfect; it is based on the centralization of data. To avoid data centralization and its limitations, an approach based on collecting the necessary data from distributed database is presented in this paper. Our goals are to protect the user’s privacy and to execute it in TEE combined with Multi-party computation MPC. We proof by security analysis that our new solution meets the fundamental criteria of security such as confidentiality and privacy.

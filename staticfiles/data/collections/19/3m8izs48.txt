Essure is a popular method of permanent sterilization that offers a minimally invasive approach that avoids the risks of traditional sterilization procedures in the operating room. Despite the rarity of complications, there has been concern in the popular media over the safety of Essure. We describe the third reported case of systemic contact dermatitis due to the nickel component of the device, with a resolution of symptoms following surgical removal of the inserts. Despite these cases, we believe that extremely rare complications such as this should not dissuade patients from choosing this safe, effective method of sterilization.

Existing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) largely depend on the availability of structured patient data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to aid caregivers. However, in case of hospitals in developing countries, structured patient data formats are not widely adopted, where medical professionals still rely on clinical notes in the form of unstructured text. Such unstructured clinical notes recorded by medical personnel can also be a potential source of rich patient-specific information which can be leveraged to build CDSSs, even for hospitals in developing countries. If such unstructured clinical text can be used, the manual and time-consuming process of EHR generation will no longer be required, with huge person-hours and cost savings. In this article, we propose a generic ICD9 disease group prediction CDSS built on unstructured physician notes modeled using hybrid word embeddings. These word embeddings are used to train a deep neural network for effectively predicting ICD9 disease groups. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art disease group prediction model built on structured EHRs by 15% in terms of AUROC and 40% in terms of AUPRC, thus proving our hypothesis and eliminating dependency on availability of structured patient data.

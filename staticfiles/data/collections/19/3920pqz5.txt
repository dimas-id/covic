Removed from classrooms and clinics amid the COVID-19 pandemic, health professions students have answered the call to serve alternate roles by rapidly mobilizing to address health system and community-identified needs in innovative ways. Many institutions, including the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), have formally recognized student roles by adding service learning requirements to adapted curricula. Although the crisis has spurred an explosion of student-led volunteer initiatives, many risk operating beyond the protection of their academic institution and could bolster their efficacy by harnessing institutional resources.

This report demonstrates that a rapid decrease of peripheral T cell subsets is a unique characteristic in patients with SARS during acute infection, although total white blood cell counts, red blood cell counts, and platelet counts remain relatively normal. In recovering patients, a rapid and dramatic restoration of peripheral T cell subsets was seen in the periphery. Although the underlying mechanism of the acute decrease of peripheral T cell subsets observed in patients with SARS during the acute stage remains unknown, this clinical characteristic can facilitate an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of SARS.

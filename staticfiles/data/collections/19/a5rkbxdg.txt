In this research, we have established a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform based on the influenza A virus (IAV) vRNA promoter. Using this HTS platform, we selected 35 medicinal plants out of 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and found that 7 examples had not been reported. After examining many previous reports, we found that Vaccinium angustifolium Ait., Vitis vinifera L, and Cinnamomum cassia Presl had a common active compound, procyanidin, and then determined the anti-IAV effect of procyanidin and explored its mechanism of action. With a plaque inhibition assay and a time-of-addition experiment, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the IAV replication at several stages of the life cycle. In the Western blot and EGFP-LC3 localization assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the accumulation of LC3II and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. In the RT-PCR and Western blot assays, we found procyanidin could inhibit the expression of Atg7, Atg5, and Atg12. Finally, by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation-fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer and the dissociation of the beclin1/bcl2 heterodimer. In conclusion, we have established an HTS platform and identified procyanidin as a novel and promising anti-IAV agent.

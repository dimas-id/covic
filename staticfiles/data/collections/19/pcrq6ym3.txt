Mucosal surfaces represent important routes of entry into the human body for the majority of pathogens, and they constitute unique sites for targeted vaccine delivery. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems are emerging technologies for delivering and improving the efficacy of mucosal vaccines. Recent studies have provided new insights into formulation and delivery aspects of importance for the design of safe and efficacious mucosal subunit vaccines based on nanoparticles. These include novel nanomaterials, their physicochemical properties and formulation approaches, nanoparticle interaction with immune cells in the mucosa, and mucosal immunization and delivery strategies. Here, we present recent progress in the application of nanoparticle-based approaches for mucosal vaccine delivery and discuss future research challenges and opportunities in the field.

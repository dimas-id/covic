Numerous published articles have shown the safety and efficacy of robotic lung resection, including lobectomy. Several techniques have been described by different authors to perform a robot assisted lung lobectomy. We adopted four arms robotic procedure. We usually perform three ports (10-15 mm) and an anterior 3 to 4 cm utility incision. This technique allows to safely proceed with an anterior to posterior approach to the hilum. In this study, we present in clear and sequential steps, the procedure to perform a right upper lobectomy for early stage lung cancer. We also supply a high-quality video, operative tips and a preference cards.

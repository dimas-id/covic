We tested the ability of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine to induce neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice. The inactivated vaccine was prepared by SARS-CoV virus propagation in Vero cells, with subsequent beta-propiolactone inactivation and Sepharose 4FF column chromatography purification. One hundred forty BALB/c female mice were divided into seven groups of 20 mice each. Of the seven groups, three groups were inoculated with 0.1, 1, and 3 microg of the vaccine without adjuvant while three other groups were inoculated at the same three dosages of vaccine with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, respectively. The remaining group was set up as a blank control. Each mouse was inoculated twice at an interval of 3 weeks. One week after the second immunization, mice sera were collected to detect serum neutralizing antibodies. An assay for determining neutralizing antibody titers was developed. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) higher dosages of vaccine induced higher levels of neutralizing antibody titer; (2) the level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the inoculation with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was slightly higher than that without adjuvant, but the difference was not statistically significant.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) quickly become a global public health emergency. G-quadruplex, one of the non-canonical secondary structures, has shown potential antiviral values. However, little is known about G-quadruplexes on the emerging SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we characterized the potential G-quadruplexes both in the positive and negative-sense viral stands. The identified potential G-quadruplexes exhibits similar features to the G-quadruplexes detected in the human transcriptome. Within some bat and pangolin related beta coronaviruses, the G-quartets rather than the loops are under heightened selective constraints. We also found that the SUD-like sequence is retained in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, while some other coronaviruses that can infect humans are depleted. Further analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 SUD-like sequence is almost conserved among 16,466 SARS-CoV-2 samples. And the SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like dimer displayed similar electrostatic potential pattern to the SUD dimer. Considering the potential value of G-quadruplexes to serve as targets in antiviral strategy, we hope our fundamental research could provide new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.

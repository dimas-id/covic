The accumulation of refuse in urban and agricultural areas provides parasitic vermin with new feeding sources and also creates for them partly entirely new biotopes. Vermin transmit both mechanically and biologically the most varied species of pathogens to man, domestic animals and work animals. With respect to the spread of pathogens by vermin via the refuse route, we must distinguish between vermin infesting either the human body, the houses, communities or our environment. Among the human vermin and house species, cockroaches, house gnats and house flies are the most important genera for the spread of pathogens via refuse. Cockroaches transmit bacteria (e.g. Salmonella), viruses (e.g. enterovirus, rota and corona viruses), fungi (e.g. Trichophyton and Candida) and worm eggs (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides). House flies and house gnats take up all infection carriers from refuse and transmit the pathogens, as a rule, purely mechanically. Rats and mice are the most important species among community vermin. These rodents act both as mechanical and biological vehicles of infectious diseases. A case in point is lymphocytic chorio-meningitis and three different types of hemorrhagic fever in man. Among the vermin infesting our environment, the diptera are the most important carriers. Gnats, especially, often act as intermediate hosts (biological transmission) and, as a result, represent an inexhaustible reservoir of pathogen transmitters. More than 50 diseases caused by arbovirus in man and animal are known. Beside the viruses, the field diptera transmit bacteria (e.g. Rickettsiosis) and protozoa (e.g. Leishmaniasis, Trypanosomiasis).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

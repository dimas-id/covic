In previous studies we have demonstrated molecular mimicry between the S peplomer protein of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and Fc gamma Receptor (Fc gamma R) of IgG. Rabbit IgG, but not its F(ab')2 fragments, monoclonal rat and mouse IgG and the rat 2.4G2 anti-mouse Fc gamma R monoclonal antibody (mab) immunoprecipitated natural and recombinant MHV S protein. On the basis of a number of criteria, MHV S peplomer protein exhibits Fc IgG binding ability. We report here a molecular mimicry between the S peplomer protein of Bovine Coronavirus (BCV) and Fc gamma R. BCV S peplomer protein which belongs to the same antigenic subgroup as MHV also binds Fc portion of rabbit IgG and is immunoprecipitated by the 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R mab. In contrast, Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus (TGEV) and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) S peplomer proteins which represent two distinct antigenic subgroups of Coronaviridae do not bind rabbit IgG and do not react with anti-Fc gamma R mab. However, homologous swine IgG, but not its F(ab')2 fragments, immunoprecipitated from TGEV-infected cells a polypeptide chain with molecular mass of 195 kDa, identical to that immunoprecipitated by the T36 mab anti-TGEV S peplomer protein.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism displayed by most eukaryotic cells to rid themselves of foreign double‚Äêstranded RNA molecules. RNAi has now been demonstrated to function in mammalian cells to alter gene expression, and has been used as a means for genetic discovery as well as a possible strategy for genetic correction. RNAi was first described in animal cells by Fire and colleagues in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Knowledge of RNAi mechanism in mammalian cell in 2001 brought a storm in the field of drug discovery. During the past few years scientists all over the world are focusing on exploiting the therapeutic potential of RNAi for identifying a new class of therapeutics. The applications of RNAi in medicine are unlimited because all cells possess RNAi machinery and hence all genes can be potential targets for therapy. RNAi can be developed as an endogenous host defense mechanism against many infections and diseases. Several studies have demonstrated therapeutic benefits of small interfering RNAs and micro RNAs in animal models. This has led to the rapid advancement of the technique from research discovery to clinical trials.

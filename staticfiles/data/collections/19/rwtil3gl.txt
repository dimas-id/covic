Since intersphincteric resection (ISR) for rectal cancer was established in the 1990 s, this technique has been applied to very low rectal cancer. This procedure requires advanced techniques for anorectal surgery. However, it is indicated only for early lesions and should be as minimally invasive as possible. We describe a minimally invasive ISR with a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port. Our case involves a 59-year-old man with hemorrhage from the rectum. Pathologic examination of the transanally resected specimen revealed that the tumor had invaded into the deeper submucosa. To minimize surgical incisions, a SILS port was utilized in place of a 10- and a 5-mm trocar. The SILS port was inserted through a 2.5 cm transverse incision in the right lower abdomen, where a diverting stoma would be created. Two flexible or straight forceps introduced through this port afforded an easier dissection of the rectum to the levator ani muscle, and transanal dissection of the internal sphincter was performed in the standard manner to connect with the abdominal dissection. The only postoperative incision other than a stoma and surgical drain was one 10-mm incision above the umbilicus. Our technique of ISR with the SILS port is a useful clinical application of minimally invasive surgery.

In the early two-thousands, Recursive Petri nets (RPN) have been introduced in order to model distributed planning of multi-agent systems for which counters and recursivity were necessary. While having a great expressive power, RPN suffer two limitations: (1) they do not include more general features for transitions like reset arcs, transfer arcs, etc. (2) the initial marking associated with the recursive “call” only depends on the calling transition and not on the current marking of the caller. Here we introduce Dynamic Recursive Petri nets (DRPN) which address these issues. We show that the standard extensions of Petri nets for which decidability of the coverability problem is preserved are particular cases of DPRN. Then we establish that w.r.t. coverability languages, DRPN are strictly more expressive than RPN. Finally we prove that the coverability problem is still decidable for DRPN.

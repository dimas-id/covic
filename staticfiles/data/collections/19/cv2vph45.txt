Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) connect the real world to software systems through a network of sensors and actuators: physical and discrete components interact in complex ways by involving different spatial and temporal scales. One of the most common architectures for CPSs is a discrete software controller which interacts with its physical environment in a closed-loop schema where input from sensors is processed and output is generated and communicated to actuators. We are concerned with the construction and verification of the correctness of such discrete controller using a correct by construction approach, which requires correct integration of discrete and continuous models.

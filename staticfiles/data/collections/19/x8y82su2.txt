PURPOSE To assess the effectiveness, technical aspects, handling, and safety of the micromesh Roadsaver Carotid Artery Stent in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis and tandem lesions in ischemic stroke patients. METHODS Seven patients (5 men; mean age 75±11.4 years, range 53-86) suffering from symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (mean 76% diameter reduction) were treated with the dual layer closed-cell stent without embolic protection. Postdilation was performed in 6 of 7 patients. Two patients were treated in the context of ischemic stroke and concurrent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission was 12.8±5. RESULTS All devices were deployed satisfactorily. One wall-adherent thromboembolus in a proximal ICA was covered with the Roadsaver stent in a tandem lesion setting. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) declined from 3.7±0.7 to 2.4±0.8 in hospital, showing an improvement in clinical symptoms. No complications were detected during or after the procedure. The 30-day mRS was 1.7±1.1. At 6 months, ultrasound examination demonstrated patency of stents and the external carotid arteries. CONCLUSION The Roadsaver double layer micromesh stent seems to be safe and effective in the treatment of extracranial ICA stenosis and in the context of tandem lesions in ischemic stroke. Further studies with larger populations are warranted.

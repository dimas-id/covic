The bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin protein gp140 is composed of disulfide-linked subunits of 65 kDa. This protein was further characterized with regard to its glycosylation. The glycosylated subunits of the protein are polypeptides having a molecular mass of 42.5 kDa. Both subunits appear to be processed to the same extent by the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides. Each subunit on the mature virion has 6-7 high mannose and 3-4 complex type carbohydrate chains attached to it.

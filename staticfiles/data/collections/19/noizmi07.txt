BACKGROUND: The routine use of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is not recommended for parathyroid carcinoma (PC). However, case series have demonstrated a potential benefit in preventing local recurrence with EBRT. We aimed to characterize the patient population treated with EBRT and identify any impact of EBRT on overall survival (OS) in parathyroid carcinoma. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for PC from 2004 to 2016 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Clinicopathologic variables and OS were compared between patients based on treatment with EBRT. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were performed with propensity scores and inverse-probability-weighting (IPW) adjustment to reduce treatment-selection bias in the OS analysis. RESULTS: A total of 885 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 126 (14.2%) undergoing EBRT. Demographics were similar between the two cohorts (EBRT vs. no EBRT). However, patients treated with EBRT had a higher frequency of regionally extensive disease, nodal metastases, and residual microscopic disease (all p < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, Black race, regional tumor extension, nodal metastasis, and treatment at an urban facility were independently associated with EBRT. The 5-year OS was 85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. EBRT was not associated with a difference in OS in crude, multivariable, or IPW models. More importantly, 10.5% of patients with completely resected localized disease (M0, N0 or Nx) underwent EBRT without a benefit in OS (p = 0.183). CONCLUSIONS: EBRT is not associated with any survival benefit in the treatment of PC. Therefore, it may be overutilized, particularly in patients with localized disease and complete surgical resection.

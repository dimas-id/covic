We identified 1219 articles published in 2006 that described work performed using commercial optical biosensor platforms. It is interesting to witness how the biosensor market is maturing with an increased number of instrument manufacturers offering a wider variety of platforms. However, it is clear from a review of the results presented that the advances in technology are outpacing the skill level of the average biosensor user. While we can track a gradual improvement in the quality of the published work, we clearly have a long way to go before we capitalize on the full potential of biosensor technology. To illustrate what is right with the biosensor literature, we highlight the work of 10 groups who have their eye on the ball. To help out the rest of us who have the lights on but nobody home, we use the literature to address common myths about biosensor technology.

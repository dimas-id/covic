Abstract Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of data has invaded our lives, and the conflicting findings have caused us to be frantic about the correct course action. Strict isolation and social distancing measures can flatten the coronavirus infectious curve, and the use of facemask needs to be encouraged and facilitated in crowded places, particularly in hospitals where the 6-feet social distancing cannot be adopted because of physical barriers.

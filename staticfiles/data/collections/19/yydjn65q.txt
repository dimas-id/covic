Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered an important therapeutic target for controlling cardiovascular diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks. Recently solved high-resolution crystal structures of the apo-bound and inhibitor-bound forms of ACE2 have provided the basis for a novel molecular docking approach in an attempt to identify ACE2 inhibitors and compounds that block SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. In this study, approximately 140 000 small molecules were screened by in silico molecular docking. In this structure-activity relation study, the molecules with the highest predicted binding scores were identified and assayed for ACE2 enzymatic inhibitory activity and for their ability to inhibit SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. This approach identified N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine as a novel ACE2 inhibitor that also is effective in blocking the SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. Thus, the molecular docking approach resulting in the inhibitory capacity of N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine provides an attractive small molecule lead compound on which the development of more effective therapeutic agents could be developed to modulate hypertension and for controlling SARS infections.

Abstract: Since December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a major epidemic threat in China and later spread worldwide. During the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China, the Chinese Obstetricians and Gynecologists Association (COGA) distributed guidelines regarding care of gynecologic patients. These guidelines were developed by the Obstetrics and Gynecology department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) and represent an effort to integrate infection control strategy and promote professionalism in medical practice. The guidelines represent collaboration with experts from 31 provinces and autonomous regions of mainland China over 2 weeks' time. With the implementation of these guidelines no nosocomial infections of COVID-19 have been identified at PUMCH. We think these guidelines might be helpful to departments of obstetrics and gynecology internationally during these unprecedented times. In our guidelines, we describe basic infection precaution principles, an epidemiologic screening tool, prioritization of surgical procedures, and operating room requirements. Using these principles, we then review management of gynecologic patients during the COVID-19 epidemic in the outpatient and operative and non-operative inpatient settings, as well as in clinical trials.

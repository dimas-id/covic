There is a resurgence of interest in coronectomy, but its appropriate application in the management of third molar teeth has yet to be defined. Dentigerous cysts associated with unerupted teeth are most commonly associated with mandibular third molars. In this case series we evaluate outcome after coronectomy of teeth with associated dentigerous cysts in cases where the inferior dental nerve was thought to be at risk, or there was an increased risk of mandibular fracture. We retrospectively studied 21 consecutive patients treated by coronectomy for dentigerous cysts at the Oral Surgery Department at Guy's Hospital. The most commonly affected teeth were mandibular third molars (20/21). One patient had permanent injury to the inferior dental nerve, but no mandibular fracture or recurrence of cyst was reported. One patient required secondary retrieval of the retained root because of eruption. Coronectomy of unerupted teeth associated with dentigerous cysts is an effective treatment when there is high risk of injury to the inferior dental nerve injury or potential for mandibular fracture. Further work with larger numbers and longer follow-up is required to discover the long-term outcome of the electively retained root.

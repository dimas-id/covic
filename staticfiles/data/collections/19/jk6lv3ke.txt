Italy has been one of the European countries that has been most affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic. By 16 April 2020, 159,107 Italian residents had tested positive for COVID‐19 and these included 1,123 children, up to nine years of age (0.7%) and 1,804 adolescents, aged between 10 and 19 years old (1.1%) (1). These data were in line with the case studies reported for the Chinese population, where the respective percentage (proportion) was 0.9% and 1.2% respectively (2). A five‐year‐old Italian child, who had been affected by many previous and unspecified pathologies, died after testing positive for COVID‐19 infection (1). The lower vulnerability of the paediatric population to COVID‐19 seems evident.

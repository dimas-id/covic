BACKGROUND Consolidation treatment with an anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab, following concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (cCRT) has become a new standard of care for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The rationale of PD-L1 blockade after cCRT is based on preclinical evidence suggesting that chemotherapy and radiotherapy up-regulate tumoural PD-L1 expression, which has not been shown in clinical studies. METHODS To examine alteration in tumoural PD-L1 expression (tumour proportion score, TPS) and density of stromal CD8-positive tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8 + TILs) after cCRT, paired NSCLC samples obtained before and after cCRT were reviewed in comparison with those obtained before and after drug therapy. RESULTS PD-L1 expression was significantly up-regulated after cCRT (median TPS, 1.0 at baseline versus 48.0 after cCRT; P < 0.001), but not after drug therapy. There was no significant correlation between baseline TPS and post-cCRT TPS. CD8 + TIL density was significantly increased after cCRT (median, 10.6 versus 39.1; P < 0.001), and higher post-cCRT CD8 + TIL density was associated with a higher pathologic response and with a favourable survival (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION Tumoural PD-L1 expression was up-regulated after cCRT, which provides pathologic rationale for PD-L1 blockade following cCRT to improve prognosis. Stromal CD8 + TIL density was also increased after cCRT, and higher post-cCRT CD8 + TIL density was a favourable prognostic indicator.

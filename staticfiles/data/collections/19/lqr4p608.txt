We propose a highly-simplified single-alveolus mechanistic model of lung mechanics and gas mixing that leads to an analytical solution for carbon dioxide partial pressure in exhaled breath, as measured by time-based capnography. Using this solution, we estimate physiological parameters of the lungs on a continuous, breath-by-breath basis. We validate our model with capnograms from 15 subjects responding positively (>20% FEV1 drop from baseline) to methacholine challenge, and subsequently recovering with bronchodilator treatment. Our results suggest that parameter estimates from capnography may provide discriminatory value for lung function comparable to spirometry, thus warranting more detailed study.

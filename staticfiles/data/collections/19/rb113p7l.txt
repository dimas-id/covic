BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE Although single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has no advantage over conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), except for better cosmesis, few reports have discussed the criteria for SILC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of our criteria for SILC. METHODS During the study period, SILC was performed at our institution under the following criteria. The inclusion criteria were elective surgery, age of < 60 years, and body mass index of < 30 kg/m2. The exclusion criteria were a thick gallbladder wall, history of choledocholithiasis, previous abdominal surgery, and serious concomitant disease. We reviewed data regarding consecutive patients who underwent LC at our institution from November 2009 to March 2016. The data were assessed with respect to patient characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS A total of 1093 patients underwent elective LC, and 232 (21.2%) of these patients underwent SILC using our criteria. Fourteen patients (6.0%) who underwent SILC required extra ports. Among the patients aged < 60 years, 50.2% (232/462) underwent SILC. There were few adverse events, including intra- and postoperative complications, among the patients who underwent SILC. CONCLUSION The above-mentioned criteria are safe, necessary, and sufficient for SILC over conventional LC.

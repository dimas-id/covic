OBJECTIVE This study explored a multiple mediation model in Wuhan's college students. Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. METHOD The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. RESULTS The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. CONCLUSIONS The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience. Notably, these 2 strong mediators will vastly resist the negative influences of 2019-nCoV victimization experience on mental health in Wuhan's college students until the end of the pandemic.

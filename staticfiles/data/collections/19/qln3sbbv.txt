Abstract We have studied T-cell apoptosis in animal models of human autoimmune disorders of the nervous system and in other tissues devoid of specialized immune-defense mechanisms. Our data suggest that the CNS has high potential for elimination of T-cell-dependent inflammation, whereas this mechanism is less effective in the PNS, and is almost absent in other tissues such as muscle and skin. Interestingly, several conventional and novel immunotherapeutic approaches, such as glucocorticosteroid and high-dose antigen therapy, induce T-cell apoptosis in situ. In vitro experiments suggest different scenarios for the mechanisms by which specific cellular and humoral elements in the nervous system synergize and sensitize T cells for apoptosis in vivo. We also discuss regulatory, proapoptotic mechanisms, such as the Fasâ€“FasL system and galectin-1, that have been utilized in other tissues to mediate immune protection.

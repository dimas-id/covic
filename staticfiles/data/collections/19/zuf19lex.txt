To investigate the inflammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets which play an important role in the course of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 27 patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from 1 to 21 February 2020 were recruited to the study. The characteristics of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF)-&#945;, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin and procalcitonin (PCT), and lymphocyte subsets of these patients were retrospectively compared before and after treatment. Before treatment, there was no significant difference in most inflammatory factors (IL-1ß, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CRP, and serum ferritin) between male and female patients. Levels of IL-2R, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and CRP decreased significantly after treatment, followed by IL-8, IL-10, and PCT. Serum ferritin was increased in all patients before treatment but did not decrease significantly after treatment. IL-1ß was normal in most patients before treatment. Lymphopenia was common among these patients with severe COVID-19. Analysis of lymphocyte subsets showed that CD4+ and particularly CD8+ T lymphocytes increased significantly after treatment. However, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells showed no significant changes after treatment. A pro-inflammatory response and decreased level of T lymphocytes were associated with severe COVID-19.

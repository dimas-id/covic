Technological advances in the field of technical or high performance textiles have made it possible to engineer materials designed to meet specific needs. However, there is no ideal fabric that will provide protection against all hazards. Careful selection of appropriate textiles is crucial for the performance, use, care, and maintenance of protective clothing. Broadly, a clear understanding of the work environment and performance requirements, as well as knowledge of the textiles is essential for the decision making process. According to the OSHA Technical Manual, the greater the level of chemical protective clothing, the greater are the associated risks. For any given situation, equipment and clothing should be selected that provide an adequate level of protection. Overprotection as well as under-protection can be hazardous and should be avoided. In addition to protection, the selection of textiles takes into consideration factors such as the impact of protective clothing on job performance; comfort; durability; availability, and cost; use, care, and maintenance, and cultural factors. To select protective clothing materials, relevant factors have to be identified and prioritized in a multi-step process. This chapter presents a model of the decision-making process and provides some examples of the level of detail necessary in each step. It also describes an online system as a case study to illustrate how technology can be used to assist in the selection of textile materials for protective clothing.

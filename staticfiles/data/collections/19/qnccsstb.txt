BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and the identification of effective therapeutic strategy is a need of the hour to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this scenario, the drug repurposing approach is widely used for the rapid identification of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2, considering viral and host factors. METHODS: We adopted a host transcriptome-based drug repurposing strategy utilizing the publicly available high throughput gene expression data on SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infection viruses. Based on the consistency in expression status of host factors in different cell types and previous evidence reported in the literature, pro-viral factors of SARS-CoV-2 identified and subject to drug repurposing analysis based on DrugBank and Connectivity Map (CMap) using the web tool, CLUE. RESULTS: The upregulated pro-viral factors such as TYMP, PTGS2, C1S, CFB, IFI44, XAF1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 were identified in early infection models of SARS-CoV-2. By further analysis of the drug-perturbed expression profiles in the connectivity map, 27 drugs that can reverse the expression of pro-viral factors were identified, and importantly, twelve of them reported to have anti-viral activity. The direct inhibition of the PTGS2 gene product can be considered as another therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection and could suggest six approved PTGS2 inhibitor drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. The computational study could propose candidate repurposable drugs against COVID-19, and further experimental studies are required for validation.

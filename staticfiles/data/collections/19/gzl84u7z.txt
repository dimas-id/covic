This paper is concerned with stochastic SIR and SEIR epidemic models on random networks in which individuals may rewire away from infected neighbors at some rate [Formula: see text] (and reconnect to non-infectious individuals with probability [Formula: see text] or else simply drop the edge if [Formula: see text]), so-called preventive rewiring. The models are denoted SIR-[Formula: see text] and SEIR-[Formula: see text], and we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive the expressions for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the expected degree of the infectious nodes [Formula: see text] using two different approximation approaches. The first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic simulations of SIR-[Formula: see text] and SEIR-[Formula: see text] epidemics on Poisson and scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches predict the same epidemic threshold and the same [Formula: see text] for both types of epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold, pairwise models overestimate the value of [Formula: see text] computed from simulations, which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with [Formula: see text] (perhaps unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement with simulations.

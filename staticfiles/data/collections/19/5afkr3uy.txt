Objective@#To establish a colloidal gold technique assay for the rapid detection of immunoglobulin(Ig) M and IgG antibodies against 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and to evaluate its clinical performance.@*Methods@#A total of 278 patients who were treated at Wuhan Hankou Hospital and the People&apos;s Hospital of Honghu from February 12, 2020 to February 20, 2020 were collected. According to the diagnostic criteria, 89 patients were confirmed with 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive diagnosis, and 189 were 2019-nCoV nucleic acid-negative suspected patients. A total of 273 medical examiners from Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University from 2015 to 2018 were selected as controls. The serum samples of patients were collected. 2019-nCoV nucleic proteins were obtained from prokaryotic expression vectors. Indirect IgM and IgG colloidal gold techniques were established by using recombinant N protein. 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as control. Serum specimens were tested for 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG. The specificity and sensitivity of colloidal gold assay were analyzed.@*Results@#The sensitivity and specificity of IgM detection reagents were 78.7% and 98.2%, respectively, those of IgG detection reagents were 73.0% and 99.3%, respectively, and those of IgM combined with IgG detection were 87.6% and 98.2%, respectively. For suspected patients with negative 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, the positive rates of IgM and IgG were 59.8% (113/189) and 52.9% (100/189), respectively, and the positive rate of IgM combined with IgG detection was 66.1% (125/189).@*Conclusion@#This reagent of 2019-nCoV antibodies detection (colloidal gold technique) fulfills the requirement for clinical application with high specificity and sensitivity, which can be served as a supplementary detection method for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR.

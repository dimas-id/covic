The spread of a neurotropic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59, in the mouse central nervous system was studied after intranasal inoculation. Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 spread during the 3- to 5-day postinoculation period, through the olfactory pathway into the limbic system. Coronavirus particles were detected in the limbic system by electron microscopy. The combination of temporal propagation through an anatomical-physiological central nervous system pathway and anatomical restriction of viral infection suggests that specific interneuronal transport is important in spread of the virus. This experimental system may represent a model for diseases associated with human coronaviruses (common cold viruses) and/or the human limbic system.

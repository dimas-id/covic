OBJECTIVE To assess whether vaginal secretions and breast milk of COVID-19 patients contain SARS-CoV-2 virus. DESIGN Single center cohort study. SETTING Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province, China. POPULATION OR SAMPLE We studied 13 COVID-19 infected pregnant women diagnosed between January 31 and March 9, 2020. METHODS We collected clinical data, vaginal secretions and stool specimens, breast milk from COVID-19 infected women during different stages of pregnancy and neonatal throat, anal swabs. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S) We assessed viral presence in different biosamples. RESULTS Of the 13 women with COVID-19, 5 were in their first trimester, 3 in their second trimester, and 5 in their third trimester. Of the 5 women during their third trimester who gave birth, all delivered live newborns. Among these 5 deliveries, the primary adverse perinatal outcomes included premature delivery (n = 2) and neonatal pneumonia (n = 2). One of 9 stool samples was positive; and all 13 vaginal secretion samples, and 5 throat swabs and 4 anal swabs collected from newborns were negative for the novel coronavirus. However, 1 of 3 samples of breast milk was positive by viral nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSIONS In this case series of 13 pregnant women with COVID-19, we observed negative viral test results in vaginal secretion specimens, suggesting that a vaginal delivery may be a safe delivery option. However, additional research is urgently needed to examine breast milk and the potential risk for viral contamination.

Molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) isolated between 1998 and 2002 from chickens in Russia was performed. More than 250 field samples were tested by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using two sets of primers corresponding to the most conserved 3'-untranslated region and the most variable S1 gene region of the viral genome. Ninety-one IBV isolates were characterized by phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene hypervariable region comprising 136 to 558 nucleotides. The major group of isolates (38 viruses) showed very close sequence relationship with strains of the Massachusetts genotype circulating in Russia since the early 1970s. The analysed region of the other 22 Russian IBVs was similar (from 89 to 98% identity) to that from the strains of European genotypes including D274 (nine isolates), 793/B (10 isolates), and B1648, 624/I and Italy-02 (one isolate in each group). Two isolates from very distant geographic locations in Russia (Far East and the European part) clustered together with Chinese strains of QXIBV genotype. None of the remaining 27 Russian isolates showed a close sequence relationship with known IBV strains available in sequence databases. The majority of these variant viruses clustered into the six novel Russian genotypes, often correlating with their geographic location. The remaining five of them were placed outside these unique groups, also representing new genotypes. These data for the first time demonstrated the high genetic diversity of IBV isolates circulating in Russia.

Abstract In practice, an epidemic might be spreading among multi-communities; while the communities are usually intra-connected. In this manuscript, each community is modeled as a multiplex network (i.e., virtual layer and physical one). The connections inside certain community are referred as inter-contacts while the intra-contacts denote the connections among communities. For the epidemic spreading process, the traditional susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is adopted. Then, corresponding state transition trees are determined and simulations are conducted to study the epidemic spreading process in multi-communities. Here, the effect of incorporating virtual layer on the range of individual affected by the epidemic is pursued. As illustrated, multi-summits are incurred if the spreading in multi-communities is considered; furthermore, the disparity between summits varies. This is affected by various factors. As indicated, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of individuals being affected; moreover, disparity of different summits is likely to be increased regarding with scenarios of excluding virtual layer. Furthermore, the summit is likely to be postponed if virtual layer is incorporated.

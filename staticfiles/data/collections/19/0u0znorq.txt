The design of alpha-helical tectons for self-assembly is maturing as a science. We have now reached the point where many different coiled-coil topologies can be reliably produced and validated in synthetic systems and the field is now moving on towards more complex, discrete structures and applications. Similarly the design of infinite or fiber assemblies has also matured, with the creation fibers that have been modified or functionalized in a variety of ways. This chapter discusses the progress made in both of these areas as well as outlining the challenges still to come.

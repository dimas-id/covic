BACKGROUND Advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) is prone to developing peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). This case-control study was to compare the efficacy and safety of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) versus CRS plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in Chinese patients with CRC PC. METHODS The 62 consecutive PC patients were treated with CRS (Control group, n = 29) or CRS + HIPEC (Study group, n = 33). The primary end point was overall survival (OS), the secondary end points were perioperative safety profiles. RESULTS For the comparison of Control versus Study groups, the peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≤20 was 13 (44.8%) versus 16 (48.5%) patients (P = 0.78), complete cytoreduction (CC0-1) was achieved in 9 (31.0%) versus 14 (42.4%) cases (P = 0.36). At the median OS was 8.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-12.4) versus 13.7 (95% CI 10.0-16.5) months (P = 0.02), the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 27.5% versus 63.6%, 12.0% versus 20.0%, and 0.0% versus 16.0%, respectively. Serious adverse events in postoperative 30 days were 9.4% versus 28.6% (P = 0.11). Multivariate analysis revealed that CRS + HIPEC, CC0-1, adjuvant chemotherapy ≥6 cycles were independent factors for OS benefit. CONCLUSION CRS + HIPEC could improve OS for CRC PC patients, with acceptable perioperative safety.

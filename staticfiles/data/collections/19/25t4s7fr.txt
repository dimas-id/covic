Cholesterol, certain lipids, membrane-bound and soluble proteins, as well as viruses that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), reach the plasma membrane (PM) via non-classical pathway(s) that remain poorly understood. Typical for this transport is (i) its insensitivity to brefeldin A (BFA), which dissociates selected coat complexes from membranes, resulting in the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus; (ii) its rapid kinetics as compared to the classical secretory pathway; and (iii) its role in the trafficking of lipid raft components. Based on results showing that the intermediate compartment (IC) at the ER-Golgi boundary constitutes a stable tubular network that maintains its dynamics in the presence of BFA, we propose that two bidirectional Golgi-bypass pathways to the PM exist, a direct route from early IC elements, and another, reminescent of the yeast secretory pathway, from late IC elements via the endosomal system. These pathways have implications for the organization of the secretory processes in different cell types. (Part of a Multi-author Review)

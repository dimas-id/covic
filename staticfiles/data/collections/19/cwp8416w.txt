The lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic has converted the world into new experimental laboratories, which may reveal temporal or spatial comparative analysis data. However, some startling information is gathered in terms of reduced premature mortality cases associated with air and water quality improvement, enhanced e-learning on a broader platform, work from home, and successful e-health. The decline in vehicular density on roads and congestion leads to reduced energy consumption and associated greenhouse gases (GHG) and other pollutants emission. The lockdown has also been identified as a possible emergency measure to combat severe air pollution episodes. Similarly, industrial pollution has been recognized as one of the primary causes of water resource pollution and would, therefore, bring change in policy vis-Ã -vis groundwater pollution control. Our findings suggest that the results of successful e-learning and work from home would be a permanent shift from conventional modes in the near future due to a drastic reduction in socio-economic cost. Our critical analysis also highlights that with such temporary lockdown measures acute/chronic ill-effects of anthropogenic perturbations on planet earth can be effectively estimated through sociocultural, socioeconomical and socio-political/sociotechnological nexus.

Abstract Background A few studies have revealed the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, predictive factors for the outcomes remain unclear. Objective Attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Study design This is a single-center, retrospective study. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital. The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared. Results Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated. The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00–5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), serum C‐reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 (35.72 pg/ml [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/ml [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/ml [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/ml [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were the independent risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions This finding would facilitate the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients.

Mechanical circulatory support has been performed as a bridge to cardiac retransplantation in selected patients with graft failure. However, there is limited published experience on the use and potential benefit of the total artificial heart (TAH) as a bridge to cardiac retransplantation. We report on our institutional experience with 3 patients that received TAH as a bridge to retransplant, with 1 patient surviving post-retransplantation. This case series demonstrates the high-risk nature of this undertaking in cardiac retransplant candidates and highlights the issue of sensitization portending greater risk for poor outcomes after TAH as bridge to retransplantation.

Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) to detect and quantify antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and RSV proteins in human plasma or sera are described. The first EIA uses RSV lysate antigens produced in HEp-2 cell line. The second EIA uses RSV F or G gene-expressed antigen in HEp-2 cells. The third EIA uses 30-amino acid synthetic peptides from central conserved region of G protein of RSV A2 or RSV B1 virus and a peptide from the SARS CoV nucleoprotein as a negative control peptide. All three EIAs have been evaluated for detecting and quantifying the respective antibodies in human sera or plasma.

We evaluated the performance of the McGrath video laryngoscope and Pentax Airway Scope in comparison with the Macintosh laryngoscope for nasotracheal intubation in paediatric patients. For this, 108 patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups based on use of the Macintosh laryngoscope, McGrath video laryngoscope, or Pentax Airway Scope. Time to intubation, the intubation difficulty, and the quality of navigation were compared among groups. The median nasotracheal intubation time [interquartile range] in the Macintosh group (33.5 [28.3-39.8] s) was significantly shorter than those of the McGrath (39.0 [32.0-43.0] s) and Pentax groups (43.0 [35.0-52.0] s). The difficulty of nasotracheal intubation was similar among all groups. When navigating and aligning the tube from the oropharynx into the glottic inlet, the cuff inflation method was required in significantly fewer patients for the Macintosh group (11.1%) than for the McGrath (48.6%) and Pentax (51.4%) groups. Thus, compared to the McGrath video laryngoscope and Pentax Airway Scope, the Macintosh laryngoscope allowed shorter nasotracheal intubation times and better facilitated tracheal navigation, requiring less use of the cuff inflation method to navigate the tracheal tube into the glottic inlet.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of free influenza vaccination for healthcare workers in Taiwan. METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted in a partially vaccinated sample of healthcare workers in a medical centre in the southern part of Taiwan. A convenience sample of 500 employees received a questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of influenza like- illness (ILI), rates of absenteeism and costs savings. RESULTS: A final number of 407 returned questionnaires could be evaluated. Forty respondents were not vaccinated. The incidence of ILI was lower in the vaccinated group than the nonvaccinated group (13.6 vs. 15%). Fever was the most frequently occurring ILI. Rate of absenteeism because of ILI in the non-vaccinated employees was higher than in the group of vaccinated employees. The costs per saved lost working day was US $ 36. CONCLUSION: Free influenza vaccination may cause reductions in incidence, absenteeism, and costs associated with ILI in healthcare workers in Taiwan.

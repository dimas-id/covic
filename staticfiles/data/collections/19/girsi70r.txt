Building adaptation encompasses a range of construction activities that improve existing building conditions and extend the effective lives of buildings. The scopes of building adaptation projects vary, and may include rehabilitating failing structures, improving environmental performances, and changing functional uses. In order to address multiple aspects of building adaptation, different terminologies are used in the literature and in practice, including refurbishment, retrofitting, rehabilitation, renovation, restoration, modernization, conversion, adaptive reuse, material reuse, conservation, and preservation, amongst others. These terminologies are often used interchangeably with overlapping definitions, causing a lack of clarity in the addressed scope of work. An extensive literature review of terminologies related to building adaptation was conducted and the most common and applicable terminologies were identified. Recent definitions, applications, and scope for the identified terminologies are reviewed. Based on this classification, a definition framework is developed enabling precise categorization of building adaptation projects, and application is demonstrated in multiple case studies. The proposed definition framework is a valuable reference for future researchers and practitioners to clearly and consistently define the scope of work in their building adaption projects, and thus avoid the high costs arising from codes, specifications, and project descriptions that confuse these definitions.

The human metabolome has remained largely unknown, with most studies annotating ∼10% of features. In nucleic acid sequencing, annotating transcripts by source has proven essential for understanding gene function. Here we generalize this concept to stool, plasma, urine and other human metabolomes, discovering that food-based annotations increase the interpreted fraction of molecular features 7-fold, providing a general framework for expanding the interpretability of human metabolomic “dark matter.”

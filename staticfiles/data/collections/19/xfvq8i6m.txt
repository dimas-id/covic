Obesity is one of the biggest public health problems in the world, and its pathophysiological characteristics include chronic inflammation with an increase in various circulating inflammatory markers, such as acute inflammatory cytokines. Complications in the respiratory tract are related to bodily problems, which lead to a restriction of lung function due to reduced volume, inducing an increase in respiratory work. SARS-CoV-2 has a high potential for contamination by respiratory secretions and, therefore, obesity is one of the main risk factors for complications due to the association established between obesity, chronic inflammation and respiratory infection. The objective was to analyze the complex relationships between obesity and COVID-19 in a meta-analysis study using complex network modeling and the theoretical knockouts technique. Here, we identify and justify through a mathematical analysis the relationships between all the immunological agents added to the proposed immunological networks, considered as a simple evident interaction, relationship, influence, response, activation, based on our quantifiers. They performed the knockouts of all 52 vertices in the COVID-19 network and obesity - regardless of the environment, which would result in nonsense - and the COVID-19 infection network without considering obesity. The stationary flow vector (flow profile), for some knockouts of immunological interest in COVID-19 infections, was chosen IFNα, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and TNFα. This initial study pointed out the importance of chronic inflammation in the obese individual as an important factor in potentiating the disease caused by covid-19 and, in particular, the importance on IL-17.

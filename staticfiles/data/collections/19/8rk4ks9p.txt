Abstract We report a case of a laboratory-confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infected (known as COVID-19) patient who developed respiratory failure and shock accompanied by persistent diarrhoea despite conventional therapeutic interventions. The patient avoided mechanical ventilation and acquired an immediate clinical and radiological improvement, after treatment of intensive plasma exchange (PE) followed by intravenous immunogloblin (IVIG). Successful therapeutic strategies in our case suggest timely initiating PE treatment followed by IVIG in critically ill patients with COVID-19 may prevent the disease from worsening and help to reduce the requirements for mechanical ventilation and intensive supportive care. What's more, it may improve poor clinical outcomes of these patients.

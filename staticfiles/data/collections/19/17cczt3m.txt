Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic illustrated the crucial role of infection surveillance and control measures in the combat of any highly transmissible disease. We conducted an interview survey of 121 medical staff 145 doctors, 46 staff nurses and 30 medical assistants) in a state hospital in Malaysia three months after the end of SARS epidemic (from October to December 2003). Staff was grouped according to those directly involved in the care of suspected SARS patients [S+ group n=41] and those who were not [S- group; n=80]. On hand washing following sneezing, coughing and touching patients, the proportions of medical staff that reported an increase after the SARS crisis were 22.3%, 16.5% and 45.5% respectively. On wearing masks, gloves, and aprons when meeting potentially infectious patients, the proportions that reported an increase were 39.7%, 47.1% and 32.2% respectively. Significantly more staff in S+ than S- group reported these increases. Sixty percent of staff was aware of changes in hospital infection control policies after SARS; 93.4% was aware of notifying procedures, and 81.8% was aware of whom to notify in the hospital. Regarding infection isolation ward, Infectious Control Nurse and Infection Control Committee Chairman in the hospital, the proportions of staff that could correctly name them were 39.7%, 38.3% and 15.7% respectively. Significantly more in S+ than S- group could do so. However, more than half the staff claimed ignorance on the knowledge of infection isolation ward (56.2%), Infection Control Nurse (57.9%) and Chairman (65.3%). Our findings demonstrated that SARS crisis had some positive impact on the infection control practices and awareness of medical staff especially on those with direct SARS involvement. Implications for future control of infectious diseases are obvious.

INTRODUCTION Extracorporeal ileocolic anastomosis in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer has a significant risk of complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the operative and postoperative results of hybrid right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal robotic-assisted anastomosis for adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon compared with the standard extracorporeal anastomosis in a case control study. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-eight right hemicolectomies for cancer (2009-2012) with laparoscopic medial to lateral dissection, vascular ligation, bowel transection, and robotic-assisted intracorporeal anastomosis with specimen extraction through a Pfannestiel incision (robotic group [RG]) were compared with 48 laparoscopic hemicolectomies (2009-2011) with extracorporeal anastomosis (laparoscopic group [LG]). RESULTS The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, stage of cancer, and body mass index. Surgery time was significantly longer in RG patients (RG, 266±41 minutes; LG, 223±51 minutes; P<.05). Operative results were similar in the two groups. Recovery of bowel function (day of first bowel movement: RG, 3.0±1.0 days; LG, 4.0±1.2 days; P<.05) and hospital stay (RG, 7.5±2.0 days; LG, 9.0±3.2 days; P<.05) were quicker and shorter, respectively, in RG. There were four anastomotic complications and four incisional hernias in LG and none in RG (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS There are fewer anastomotic and wound complications in RG patients. Intracorporeal robotic-assisted ileocolic anastomosis allows a faster recovery compared with extracorporeal anastomosis.

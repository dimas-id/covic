Interest in noninvasive feeding tube placement in companion animals led to the adaption of a human technique utilizing endoscopy to place nasojejunal feeding tubes. Data from medical records in which nasojejunal feeding tubes were attempted were reviewed. Feeding tubes were attempted and successfully placed in five dogs within a median of 35 min. Feeding tubes remained in place for approximately 7 days. Complications included facial irritation (5/5), sneezing (5/5), fractured facial sutures (4/5), vomiting (3/5), diarrhea (3/5), crimping of feeding tube (3/5), regurgitation (1/5), epistaxis (1/5), clogging of the feeding tube (2/5), and oral migration with premature removal of the feeding tube (1/5). The deployment technique used in this study was found to be cumbersome. Despite minor complications, endoscopy can be used to rapidly and accurately place nasoenteric feeding devices.

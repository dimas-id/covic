Objective To compare outcomes following intracranial stent retriever-based intracranial thrombectomy (SRT) with emergency extracranial internal carotid artery (EICA) stenting or angioplasty alone in patients presenting with acute stroke due to tandem occlusions of the ICA. Methods Consecutive patients with acute anterior tandem occlusion who received an endovascular intervention within 6h of symptom onset between January 2013 and June 2016 were included in this prospective study. Demographic, radiological, procedural and clinical outcome data were compared between the stenting and the angioplasty alone groups. Results Of the 37 patients eligible for the study, 18 had angioplasty alone and 19 underwent stent placement. Successful recanalization rate was statistically significantly higher in the stenting group than in angioplasty alone group (74% vs. 39%) and although not statistically significant, more patients in the stenting group than in the angioplasty alone group had favourable outcomes (63% vs. 50%). There was no significant difference between groups in rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH), cerebral herniation or mortality. Conclusion This study in a small sample size suggests that among patients with acute anterior tandem occlusion, SRT with EICA stenting tended to achieve higher recanalization and improved clinical outcomes at three months compared with SRT and angioplasty alone with a similar rate of SICH and mortality.

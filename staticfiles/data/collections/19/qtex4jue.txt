Given the current SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, many patients with haemophilia will have close contact with a confirmed case or suffer from coronavirus 2019 respiratory disease (COVID‐19) and will need medical attention. Considering that this situation is exceptional, it is necessary to carry out integrated assistance for patients with haemophilia patients and their relatives, focusing such assistance on all the dimensions of life. In this regard, the WFH's recommendations to optimise haematological prophylaxis and its adherence should be emphasised to minimise the risk of bleeding and thus reduce the need to visit health care facilities [1].

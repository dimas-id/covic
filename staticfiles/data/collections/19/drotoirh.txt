PURPOSE OF REVIEW To summarize the recent developments in minimally invasive adrenal surgery. RECENT FINDINGS Modern adrenal surgery continues to evolve with new techniques. Both the laparoscopic transabdominal and retroperitoneoscopic approaches are now the standard of care for the removal of nonmalignant adrenal tumors. Other recent developments include robotic retroperitoneal adrenalectomy, single-incision laparoendoscopic surgery, and ambulatory adrenalectomy. SUMMARY Here, we review the literature of minimally invasive adrenal surgery over the last year to highlight new developments and technical refinements.

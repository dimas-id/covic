Although attention has been paid to the relationship between malignant diseases and cardiovascular diseases, few data have been reported. Moreover, there have also been few reports in which the preventive factors were examined in patients with or without malignant disease histories requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).This was a retrospective, single-center, observational study. A total of 1003 post-PCI patients were divided into a malignant group, with current or past malignant disease, and a nonmalignant group. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and admission due to heart failure within 5 years of PCI. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly higher probability of the primary endpoint in the malignant group (P = .002). Multivariable Cox hazard analyses showed that in patients without a history of malignant, body mass index (BMI) and the presence of dyslipidemia were independent and significant negative predictors of the primary endpoint (BMI: hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.99, P = .041; prevalence of dyslipidemia: HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99, P = .048), and the presence of multi-vessel disease (MVD) and the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) were independent and significant positive predictors of the primary endpoint (prevalence of MVD: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.18-2.40, P = .004; prevalence of PAD: HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03-2.21, P = .034). In patients with histories of malignancy, no significant independent predictive factors were identified.Patients undergoing PCI with malignancy had significantly higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events but might not have the conventional prognostic factors.

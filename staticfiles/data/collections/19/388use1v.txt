Abstract Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The majority of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units with confirmed severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 developed an acute respiratory distress like syndrome. The main objective of this opinion paper is to raise the discussion about the possible benefit of keeping the patient with COVID-19 disease and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in the prone position during the perioperative period, especially where this position is not a required factor for the surgical or invasive procedure. We believe that the prone position, due to its favorable pulmonary physiology, can improve the V̇/Q̇ ratio in the perioperative period.

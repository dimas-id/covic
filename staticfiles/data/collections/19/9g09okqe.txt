Angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis and complete resection of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The absence of residual AVM after surgery is commonly believed to reduce the risk of future hemorrhage. However, AVMs can recur after proven complete angiographic resection can occur, albeit rarely, especially in the pediatric population. We report a rare case of a recurrent AVM two years after complete resection in an adult patient. This case report shows that AVMs in adults can recur despite their rarity and despite postoperative angiography confirming complete removal. Moreover, in this case, the recurrent AVM involved a new feeding vessel that was not involved with the initial lesion.

By the time this issue of ADAW is published, the final figures will be out. At press time, some $400 million in a $2 trillion stimulus package designed to combat economic problems from the coronavirus pandemic is going to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to Andrew Kessler, principal with Slingshot Solutions. Both the Senate and House versions allocated $400 million. The Senate bill proposed $425 million, while the House proposed $435 million. In both bills, $15 million goes to the Indian Health Service and $50 million to suicide prevention. In the Senate bill, $250 million is allocated to certified community behavioral health clinics (CCBHCs), while that number is $200 million in the House version. These clinics currently exist in only eight states, Kessler pointed out. The CCBHC money will allow states to apply for grants and put forth their own behavioral health priorities, said Kessler. Watch next week's issue for details.

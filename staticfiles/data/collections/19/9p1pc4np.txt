Gastroesophageal reflux disease affects at least 10 % of people in Western societies and produces troublesome symptoms and impairs patients' quality of life. The effective management of GERD is imperative as the diagnosis places a significant cost burden on the United States healthcare system with annual direct cost estimates exceeding 9 billion dollars annually. While effective for many patients, 30-40 % of patients receiving medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors experience troublesome breakthrough symptoms, and recent evidence suggests that this therapy subjects patients to increased risk of complications. Given the high cost of PPI therapy, patients are showing a decrease in willingness to continue with a therapy that provides incomplete relief; however, due to inconsistent outcomes and concern for procedure-related side effects following surgery, only 1 % of the GERD population undergoes anti-reflux surgery annually. The discrepancy between the number of patients who experience suboptimal medical treatment and the number considered for anti-reflux surgery indicates a large therapeutic gap in the management of GERD. The objective of the SSAT State-of-the-Art Conference was to examine technologic advances in the diagnosis and treatment of GERD and to evaluate the ways in which we assess the outcomes of these therapies to provide optimal patient care.

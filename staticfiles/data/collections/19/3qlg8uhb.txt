Recently, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published an alert about the risks of uterine tissue morcellation during laparoscopic procedures. In particular, the possible risk of spreading an undiagnosed malignant tumor was emphasized. From then on, a fervent debate in the media has led major scientific societies to express their position on the matter. We present a safe endobag abdominal morcellation in a single port-access laparoscopy subtotal hysterectomy. The endobag abdominal morcellation is feasible and safe; consequently, the development of devices dedicated to intracavitary morcellation in a closed system has been encouraged.

We incorporate parameter heterogeneity in a two-patch susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with infection during transport and prove that the disease-free and endemic equilibria are globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. We find that infection during transport increases the possibility that the disease persists in both patches and amplifies prevalence when disease is present. We then study the effect of a perfect unilateral exit screening programme. Finally, we compare numerically the effects of using different incidence functions for infection within and while travelling between patches, and find that using mass action incidence to model infection during transport has the effect of maintaining disease prevalence at a higher level compared with when standard incidence is used.

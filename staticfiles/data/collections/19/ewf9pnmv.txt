OBJECTIVE To observe IgG and IgM antibodies in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to explore their significance. METHODS IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in SARS Patients in the first, recovery and follow-up stages, the front healthy doctors and nurses and healthy volunteers with indirect enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. RESULTS The positive ratio of IgG was higher than that of IgM in SARS patients during the first stage. During the recovery, follow-up stages and in the front healthy crowd, the positive ratios of IgG were all higher than those of IgM. CONCLUSION The changeable tendency SARS antibody is more different than that of other infectious diseases. This tendency can be used as a indicator for epidemiological study and serum diagnose.

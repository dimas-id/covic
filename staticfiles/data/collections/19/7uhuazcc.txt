The database here described contains data of integrated surveillance for the “Coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization) in Italy, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The database, included in a main folder called COVID-19, has been designed and created by the Italian Civil Protection Department, which currently manages it. The database consists of six folders called ‘aree’ (containing charts of geographical areas interested by containment measures), ‘dati-andamento-nazionale’ (containing data relating to the national trend of SARS-CoV-2 spread), ‘dati-json’ (containing data that summarize the national, provincial and regional trends of SARS-CoV-2 spread), ‘dati-province’ (containing data relating to the provincial trend of SARS-CoV-2 spread), ‘dati-regioni’ (containing data relating to the regional trend of SARS-CoV-2 spread) and ‘schede-riepilogative’ (containing summary sheets relating to the provincial and regional trends of SARS-CoV-2 spread). The Italian Civil Protection Department daily receives data by the Italian Ministry of Health, analyzes them and updates the database. Thus, the database is subject to daily updates and integrations. The database is freely accessible (CC-BY-4.0 license) at https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19. This database is useful to provide insight on the spread mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, to support organizations in the evaluation of the efficiency of current prevention and control measures, and to support governments in the future prevention decisions.

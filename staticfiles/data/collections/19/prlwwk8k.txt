The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pandemic has delivered a profound and negative impact on the United States. The suspension of elective surgeries including arthroplasty will have a lasting effect on all stakeholders including patients, physicians, and healthcare organizations within the US healthcare system. Resumption of elective hip and knee arthroplasty will need to be carefully focused. The purpose of this work is to address potential strategies, concerns, and regulatory barriers in restarting elective hip and knee arthroplasty in the United States.

BACKGROUND The central circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and interaction of clock genes with the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis are responsible for very distinct cortisol concentrations. Unphysiologically high doses of glucocorticoids that do not follow the circadian rhythm lead to increased rates of morbidity, mortality and reduced quality of life. OBJECTIVES Does a switch to modified-release hydrocortisone in multimorbid elderly patients offer benefits compared to a conventional therapy regime? METHODS Evaluation, analysis and discussion of statistics, recent research results and expert advice. RESULTS Overdosage and unphysiological timing of cortisol administration result in higher incidences of obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, coronary heart disease and cardiac events. Body weight, body mass index and HbA1c decline with Plenadren® (Shire Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, Dublin, Ireland) treatment compared to conventional therapy. CD16+ natural killer cells and natural killer cytotoxycity are reduced, and the incidence of respiratory-tract infections is increased, with conventional therapy compared to Plenadren®. Cortisol influences sleep pattern and sleep quality by its circadian secretion. CONCLUSION Novel modified-release hydrocortisone preparations offer diverse benefits with regard to their effect on metabolism, cardiovascular risk, immunity and sleep, which might be beneficial in particular in multimorbid elderly.

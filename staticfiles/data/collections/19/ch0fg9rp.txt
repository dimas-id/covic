The latest major release of Lucene (version 8) in March 2019 incorporates block-max indexes and exploits the block-max variant of Wand for query evaluation, which are innovations that originated from academia.

We offer additional thoughts on the often idiosyncratic processes by which academic research makes its way into deployed solutions.

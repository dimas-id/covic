Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is an accepted method for incisional hernia repair. Although techniques vary, transfascial suturing of the mesh to the abdominal wall has been proposed as a viable way to fixate the mesh and reduce recurrence rates. We report a 54-year-old woman who had previously undergone a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair following a laparoscopic tubal ligation using a Composix mesh. The patient presented with a symptomatic hernia recurrence. The computed tomography scan showed a periumbilical hernia containing fat. The patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and lysis of adhesions. During the lysis of adhesions, a recurrence through the previously placed composite mesh was encountered where holes had been made by the previously placed transfascial sutures. The hernia was reduced, mesh was removed, and an ePTFE mesh was used to repair the hernia. The mechanism of recurrence appeared to be improperly placed transfascial sutures; overly large bites of mesh caused excessive tension and ultimately a hole in the mesh. Hernia recurrence due to mesh or transfascial suture failure is rarely reported and most often caused by inadequate fixation. Our case highlights the need for meticulous placement of transfascial sutures and demonstrates a mechanism of recurrence due to inadequate placement.

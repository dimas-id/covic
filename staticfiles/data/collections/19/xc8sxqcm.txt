Animals were immunized with transmissible gastroenteritis virus conjugated with gold nanoparticles. The resultant antibodies had a higher titer than antibodies produced in response to native virus. Immunization with the antigen-colloidal gold complex led to a significant increase of the peritoneal macrophages respiratory activity and of plasma IFN-Î³ level in immunized animals.

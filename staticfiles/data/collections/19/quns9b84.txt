The outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa became one of the worst disease-driven humanitarian crises in modern history. The crisis turned the global securitization of health issues into unprecedented levels, at the same time, aligned closely with human security frameworks and thus has significant impacts on national foreign and aid policies. China has played a significant role in the global fight against Ebola, indicating important changes in its foreign policy orientations. Based on the lessons drawn from Chinaâ€™s operation in Africa, it is argued that states must transcend their narrow national interest and seriously consider the dignity and well-being of vulnerable people.

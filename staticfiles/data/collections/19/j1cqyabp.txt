OBJECTIVE To identify and assess the potential public health risks of emergency events of infectious disease in the surrounding areas of Hangzhou during the 11th G20 summit, and to assess their impacts on the G20 summit. METHODS The surrounding cities of Hangzhou included Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Zhoushan, Taizhou and Lishui. Background information on infectious diseases in Zhejiang province was collected, and the brainstorming and expert consultation methods were used to identify the risks. The local risks and the impact of local risks on the G20 summit were assessed. RESULTS The criteria for public health risk was first established. Through the assessments,a total of 27 kinds of infectious diseases in 4 types of public health risks were identified. The impact of these risks on Hangzhou G20 summit was divided into 1 item of high-risk, 12 items of medium risk and 14 items of low risk.According to the results of risk assessment, the recommendations for risk management of respiratory infectious diseases, intestinal infectious diseases, imported infectious diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome and other infectious diseases were made. With risk management, Middle East respiratory syndrome was not occurred during the G20 summit, and the epidemic situation of other infectious diseases with middle or low risks was almost the same with that of past years. CONCLUSIONS sThe public health risks of Hangzhou G20 summit from sudden infectious diseases in outlying areas are mainly medium and low risks. The recommendations on risk management provide a basis for reducing the adverse consequences of public health risks in the event of an outbreak of infectious diseases, avoiding the impact of various risk factors in the outlying areas on G20 summit.

Ranking and measuring attribute importance is one of the key research topics in data mining and machine learning. Most of the existing attribute importance research relying on data-oriented approaches such as statistics and information theory perspectives. User preference, which involves a user specifying his or her preferential attitude towards a set of attributes, is another meaningful perspective. However, the research community has not paid much attention to this perspective. We adopt the three-way decision theory as a framework and concentrate on analyzing attribute importance based on user preference in this paper. In particular, we propose qualitative and quantitative analysis of attribute importance approaches that result a ranking list as well as a set of numerical weights of an attribute set. We then categorize attributes into different groups of importance using qualitative and quantitative analysis results. Finally, a unified model to analyze user-oriented attribute importance is constructed.

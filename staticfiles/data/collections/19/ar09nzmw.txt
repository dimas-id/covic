The computer-aided study and design of RNA molecules is increasingly prevalent across a range of disciplines, yet little is known about the accuracy of commonly used structure prediction packages in real-world tasks. Here, we evaluate the performance of current packages using EternaBench, a dataset comprising 23 in vitro structure mapping and 11 riboswitch activity datasets involving 18,509 synthetic sequences from the crowdsourced RNA design project Eterna. We find that CONTRAfold and RNAsoft, packages with parameters derived through statistical learning, achieve consistently higher accuracy than more widely used packages like the ViennaRNA software, which derive parameters primarily from thermodynamic experiments. Motivated by these results, we develop a multitask-learning-based model, EternaFold, which demonstrates improved performance that generalizes to diverse external datasets, including complete viral genomes probed in vivo and synthetic designs modeling mRNA vaccines.

BACKGROUND Parastomal hernia (PH) is a frequent complication of stoma formation, and recurrence after repair is common. A laparoscopic modified Sugarbaker technique (SB) may decrease the recurrence of PH compared with other methods. METHODS A retrospective review, approved by the institutional review board, of patients who underwent PH repair between 2004 and 2014 was performed. Demographics, factors for ostomy formation, hernia risk factors, intraoperative and postoperative information, and recurrence data were compared among SB and other techniques. Time to recurrence was compared between SB versus other techniques with the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS Sixty-two PH repairs were performed: 39 (61%) paraileostomy and 23 (39%) paracolostomy. Repairs included 25 laparoscopic modified SB and 37 from other techniques. There was no difference in demographics. Postoperative complication rate was lesser in SB versus all other groups (40% vs 76%, P = .02). Recurrence rates were lesser for SB versus all others (16% vs 60%, P < .001). Follow-up was similar among all groups. After adjustment, SB was found to be protective of recurrences (hazard ratio = .28, 95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.82). CONCLUSION A laparoscopic modified SB technique provides decreased rates of recurrence and postoperative complications compared with other approaches.

Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus, causes infectious bronchitis leading to enormous economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide. Houttuynia cordata (Saururaceae) (HC) is a traditional Chinese medicine used in China. In the present study, the effect of HC on cell infection by IBV was determined using plaque assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The inhibitory effect of HC on IBV infection in ovo and in vivo was analysed using specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryos and chickens. Moreover, the effect of HC on cell apoptosis induced by IBV was investigated. Results showed that HC had more than 90% inhibition rate against IBV infection in Vero cells and chicken embryo kidney cells, and decreased more than 90% apoptotic cells caused by IBV. HC fully protected the SPF embryos, and had more than 50% protection rate in SPF chickens, against IBV challenge.

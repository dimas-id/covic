AIM Implant rehabilitation of the atrophic right posterior mandible in a 48-year-old woman using dehydrated homologous bone block, shaped with a computer aided design-computer aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) system, to avoid harvesting of autologous bone block and to assure a perfect fitting of the block above the alveolar crest. RESULTS After 7 months, 6.09, 7.36, and 8.08 mm (mean, 7.18 mm) of total horizontal bone gain was observed at sites 6, 12, and 18 mm posterior to the right mental foramen, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The use of a bone block with CAD-CAM system for alveolar ridge augmentation is a valuable alternative to autograft because it reduces time, cost, and complications for the patients. Data from a computerized tomographic scan can be used to shape a precise 3-dimensional homologous bone block using a CAD-CAM system.

An 81-year-old woman was referred for the treatment of a 79-mm-diameter short neck abdominal aortic aneurysm with highly tortuous iliac arteries. She was considered at high risk for open repair and not suitable for standard endovascular repair given the short length of the proximal neck. Delay for a manufactured custom-made fenestrated stent graft was too long given the diameter of the aneurysm. A flexible stent graft was preferred because of severe iliac tortuosity. Endovascular repair was performed using a physician-modified Anaconda stent graft with 1 fenestration for the left renal artery. The technique for device modification and implantation is described. Postoperative course was uneventful and 1-year computed tomography scan showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm sac and patent left renal artery.

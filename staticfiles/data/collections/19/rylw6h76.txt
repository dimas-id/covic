Kidneys perform a multitude of essential functions within the human body. Of these the most important are (1) maintaining pH through regulation of acid/base levels and (2) excreting end products of metabolism. As for most organ-systems, these functions are especially important for healing following trauma and/or surgery and decline with age. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is one of the common forms of organ failures seen in the ICU and elderly patients are more prone to it. The causes maybe classified as Prerenal (inadequate perfusion), renal (inherent kidney disease) and post-renal (urinary obstruction). Preventing AKI should be an important concern in all critically ill patients but especially important in the elderly patients since the development of AKI can significantly increase in-hospital mortality. Once AKI has set in a systematic and step-wise approach of diagnosis and management is key to avoiding adverse outcomes.

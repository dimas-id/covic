Although serious trauma injuries are uncommon in the pediatric population, nasal injuries are a more common problem. In this population, many physicians are uncomfortable managing these injuries. The evaluation and treatment of nasal trauma differ considerably in children compared with adult nasal fractures. Poor patient cooperation during the physical exam coupled with significant anatomic differences can present the nasal surgeon with a difficult diagnostic dilemma. The surgical management of pediatric nasoseptal injuries is not without controversy, as disturbing the nasal growth centers can have significant effect on future nasal and midfacial development. This article reviews the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges presented by these injuries for children and provides recommendations to successfully manage nasal injuries in this population.

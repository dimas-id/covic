SUMMARY Routine intensive care unit monitoring is common after elective embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. In this series of 200 consecutive endovascular procedures for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 65% of patients were triaged to routine (non-intensive care unit) floor care based on intraoperative findings, aneurysm morphology, and absence of major co-morbidities. Only 1 patient (0.5%) required subsequent transfer to the intensive care unit for management of a perioperative complication. The authors conclude that patients without major co-morbidities, intraoperative complications, or complex aneurysm morphology can be safely observed in a regular ward rather than being admitted to the intensive care unit.

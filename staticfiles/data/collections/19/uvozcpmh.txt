Aseptic technique is a method that involves target-specific practices and procedures under suitably controlled conditions to reduce the contamination from microbes. It is a compulsory laboratory skill to conduct research related in the field of microbiology. Mycologist/microbiologists must follow aseptic techniques for multiplicity procedures such as screening of isolates/strains, pure cultures, slant cultures, single spore cultures, microbes transferring cultures, inoculating media, and conducting several microbiological experiments. Proper aseptic technique has prevented the cultures contamination from inborn and outborn microbes in the environment. As example, airborne microbes (e.g., fungi) handpicked from the surveyorâ€™s health, the lab benchtop, unsterilized glassware and equipment, dust, and other areas, thus interfering to get proper experiment results. Using the proper aseptic technique can significantly reduce/minimize the risk of contamination.

Brucella ovis infection results in genital damage and epididymitis in rams, placental inflammation and rare abortion in ewes, and neonatal mortality in lambs. However, the mechanism underlying B. ovis infection remains unclear. In the present study, we used prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild-type B. ovis and intracellular B. ovis in RAW264.7 macrophages. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the top 10 upregulated and downregulated DEGs. The results showed that 212 genes were differentially expressed, including 68 upregulated and 144 downregulated genes, which were mainly enriched in 30 GO terms linked to biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, beta-alanine metabolism, and quorum sensing pathway. BME_RS01160, BME_RS04270, BME_RS08185, BME_RS12880, BME_RS25875, predicted_RNA865, and predicted_RNA953 were confirmed with the transcriptome sequencing data. Hence, our findings not only reveal the intracellular parasitism of B. ovis in the macrophage immune system, but also help to understand the mechanism of chronic B. ovis infection.

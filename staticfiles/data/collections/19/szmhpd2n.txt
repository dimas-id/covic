AIMS Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an established treatment option in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). ASA is ineffective in some: inaccurate infarct and inability to identify a vessel contribute. We aimed to improve accuracy of infarct using CT angiography guidance and provide a more predictable and satisfactory outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-one successive patients with symptomatic LVOT obstruction refractory to medication underwent CT angiography planning to guide ASA. CT was performed using a dual-source CT system. Alcohol was delivered to the artery identified from CT: in 17/21 this was a sub-branch of a septal artery, in 2/21 the septal vessel was identified from the circumflex artery. Peak gradient improved from 98 (IQR 89.50-111.50) mmHg to 14 (IQR 8.50-22) mmHg (p=0.003). Systolic anterior motion (SAM) improved in 18/20 patients. NYHA class improved by ≥1 in 18/20. Peak VO2 improved from 79.19% of predicted value (±14.01) to 91.62% (±12.02) predicted (p<0.0001). Success at the first procedure is greater with CT guidance, 17/20 vs. 50/75 with traditional methods (pre-CT guidance) (p=0.02); 9/20 had six-month CMR with target septum infarct in all. ASA-related RBBB reduced from 62% to 13% (p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS CT angiography planning improves localisation of infarct and procedural success at the first attempt in ASA when compared to traditional methods. Follow-up to six months suggests a symptomatic, functional and haemodynamic improvement.

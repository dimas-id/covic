Coronaviruses are a genetically highly variable family of viruses that infect vertebrates and have succeeded in infecting humans many times by overcoming the species barrier. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which initially appeared in China at the end of 2019, exhibits a high infectivity and pathogenicity compared to other coronaviruses. As the viral coat and other viral components are recognized as being foreign by the immune system, this can lead to initial symptoms, which are induced by the very efficiently working immune defense system via the respiratory epithelium. During severe courses a systemically expressed proinflammatory cytokine storm and subsequent changes in the coagulation and complement systems can occur. Virus-specific antibodies, the long-term expression of which is ensured by the formation of B memory cell clones, generate a specific immune response that is also detectable in blood (seroconversion). Specifically effective cytotoxic CD8+ Tâ€‘cell populations are also formed, which recognize viral epitopes as pathogen-specific patterns in combination with MHC presentation on the cell surface of virus-infected cells and destroy these cells. At the current point in time it is unclear how regular, robust and durable this immune status is constructed. Experiences with other coronavirus infections (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS) indicate that the immunity could persist for several years. Based on animal experiments, already acquired data on other coronavirus types and plausibility assumptions, it can be assumed that seroconverted patients have an immunity of limited duration and only a very low risk of reinfection. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of viral cycles and immunity is an important prerequisite for the development of vaccination strategies and development of effective drugs.

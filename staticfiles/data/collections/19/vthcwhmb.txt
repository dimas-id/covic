Febrile states may unmask certain Brugada syndrome patients and precipitate ventricular arrhythmias. Here we describe two patients with COVID-19 who developed a fever-induced type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic pattern. Both patients did not show any ventricular arrhythmias during admission. These and previously published cases suggest that the threshold to run an ECG should be low in febrile patients with suspected COVID-19, because these patients are potentially at risk for developing proarrhythmic complications.

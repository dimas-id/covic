BACKGROUND/AIMS Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) has not gained widespread acceptance because of the difficult reconstruction technique, especially for esophagojejunostomy. Although various modified procedures using a circular stapler for esophagojejunostomy have been reported, an optimal technique has not yet been established. In addition, in intracorporeal techniques, twisting of the esophagojejunostomy, which might be the cause of stenosis, is often encountered because application of the shaft is restricted. To prevent twisting of the esophagoejunostomy, we underwent LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located at the left side of the patient. METHODOLOGY From November 2013 to November 2014, a series of 9 patients underwent LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVilâ„¢, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), whose efferent loop was located at the left side of the patient. RESULTS No twisting of the esophagojejunostomy was encountered in all cases. In addition, no stenosis or leakage of the esophagojejunostomy occurred. CONCLUSIONS This reconstruction system may be a feasible surgical procedure in LTG.

Abstract A series of 2-(2-chloroquinolin-3-yl)-5-((aryl)benzylidene)-3-(4-oxo-2-phenylquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)thiazolidin-4-ones (V)1â€“12 have been synthesized. In order to establish optimization of different parameters of chemical transformation, that is the reaction pathway for each step and reaction conditions in the each step, in the present paper, different solvents and catalysts were used. The structures of the synthesized compounds were assigned on the basis of elemental analysis, IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data. All the newly synthesized compounds were screened against various strains of bacteria and fungi.

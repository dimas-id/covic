With a view to establish unique interfacial synergistic interactions between two seemingly distant fields of microfluidics and biology, Bio-microfluidics has become a progressive arena of research in recent times. Bio-microfluidic tools in the format of lab-on-a-chip devices have been extensively utilized to uncouth hitherto un-illuminated regions of cellular-molecular biology, biotechnology and biomedical engineering. This chapter elaborately delineates the linking between the fundamental microscale physics and biologically relevant physico-chemical events and how, in practice, these relations are exploited in microfluidic devices. Finally, potential directions of future biomicrofluidic research are also discussed.

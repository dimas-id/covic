Incidence of anomalies of the aortic arch is estimated 1-2 per cent in newborn babies. Lusory artery may arise either from left sided aortic arch in 0.7-2 per cent, or from right sided aortic arch in 0.4 per cent. Leading symptoms develop from compression of the oesophagus or trachea, or both. If lusory artery dilates conically over the time reaching 3 cm or more we call it Kommerell diverticulum. Very rare complications of this are the Type B aortic dissection, which may turn into chronic thoracoabdominal aneurysm, or its shaggy inner surface can be the source of upper extremity embolism. Rupture is extremely rare complication. In our report we focus on five cases of the mentioned complications with their clinical workups and technical solutions. In a female patient with right sided arch transection of the lusory artery was followed by transposition into the right common carotid artery. The central stump 10 years later gradually expanded and the saccular aneurysm indicated intervention. After complete arch debranching thoracic endograft was implanted. In this group of patients with variable surgical and hybrid procedures neither complication nor mortality occurred.

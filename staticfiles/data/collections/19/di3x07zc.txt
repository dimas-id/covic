Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a constellation of potentially life-threatening acute aortic diseases. The spectrum includes penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, intramural haematoma, dissection, and unstable thoracic aneurysm. AAS cannot be reliably diagnosed clinically and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has revolutionized the diagnosis and management of this group of conditions in the acute setting due to its availability, speed, and accuracy. The purpose of this review is to illustrate key MDCT findings of AAS. Imaging techniques, radiological findings, and common pitfalls are also discussed.

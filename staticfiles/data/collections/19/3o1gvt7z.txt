Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis mainly affecting children below 5 years of age. Diagnosis is made upon a combination of criteria, including persistent fever; edema, erythema, or desquamation of the extremities; polymorphous exanthema; conjunctival injection; erythema of the lips and oral mucosa; and lymphadenopathies. Many cases do not meet all diagnostic criteria but should also be considered for therapy. IVIG and aspirin are the main therapeutic measures.

A case of pericarditis associated with Q fever is described. Transmission was probably via an arthropod vector, which was most likely the kangaroo tick Amblyomma triguttatum. Complete recovery occurred in association with the use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory agents only. This is a rare presentation of Q fever implicating transmission by a novel vector.

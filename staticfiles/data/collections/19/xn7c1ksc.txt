Endovascular treatment of very small aneurysms is technically difficult, although recent advances with coils, microcatheters and adjunctive techniques such as balloon- or stent-assisted coiling have improved the outcomes. The microangiographic fluoroscope (MAF) is a new high-resolution x-ray detector developed for neurointerventional procedures in which superior resolution is required within a small field of view. We report the successful coil embolization of a very small ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm using the MAF technique. The use of the MAF facilitated the precision of the coiling procedure and was helpful in preventing catheter- and coil-related intraprocedural complications.

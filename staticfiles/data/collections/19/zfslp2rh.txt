Leptin-deficient and leptin-resistant mice manifest obesity, insulin resistance, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); however, LVH's mechanisms are not fully understood. Cardiac iron dysregulation has been recently implicated in cardiomyopathy. Here we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction on cardiac remodeling in impaired leptin signaling obese mice. RNA-seq analysis was performed to assess the differential gene expressions in the heart of wild-type and ob/ob mice. In particular, to investigate the roles of caloric restriction on iron homeostasis-related gene expressions, 10-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were assigned to ad libitum or calorie-restricted diets for 12 weeks. Male ob/ob mice exhibited LVH, cardiac inflammation, and oxidative stress. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified that an iron uptake-associated gene, transferrin receptor, was upregulated in obese ob/ob mice with LVH. Caloric restriction attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in ob/ob and db/db mice. Furthermore, we found that caloric restriction reversed iron homeostasis-related lipocalin 2, divalent metal transporter 1, transferrin receptor, ferritin, ferroportin, and hepcidin expressions in the heart of ob/ob and db/db mice. These findings demonstrate that the cardioprotective effects of caloric restriction result from the cellular regulation of iron homeostasis, thereby decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiac remodeling. We suggest that decreasing iron-mediated oxidative stress and inflammation offers new therapeutic approaches for obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.

Coronaviruses have recently caused world-wide severe outbreaks: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2002 and MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012. At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak appeared in Wuhan (China) seafood market as first focus of infection, becoming a pandemics in 2020, spreading mainly into Europe and Asia. Although the virus family is well-known, this specific virus presents considerable differences, as higher transmission rates, being a challenge for diagnostic methods, treatments and vaccines. Coronavirus.pro is a C++ application which simulates Coronavirus replication cycle. This software has identified virus type in short times and provided FASTA files of virus proteins, a list of mRNA sequences and secondary structures. Furthermore, the software has identified a list of structural, non-structural and accessory proteins in 2019-nCoV virus genome more similar to SARS than to MERS, as several fusion proteins characteristics of this virus type. These results are useful as a first step in order to develop diagnostic methods, new vaccines or antiviral drugs, which could avoid virus replication in any stage: fusion inhibitors, RdRp inhibitors and PL2pro/3CLpro protease inhibitors.

Saliva omics, a rapidly developing field for non-invasive diagnostics, may be utilized for monitoring very young or elderly populations, as well as individuals in remote locations. In this study, multiple saliva omics from an individual were monitored over 100 timepoints, over three periods involving: (i) hourly sampling over 24 hours without intervention, (ii) hourly sampling over 24 hours including immune system activation using the standard 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (iii) daily sampling for 33 days profiling the post-vaccination response. At each timepoint total saliva transcriptome and proteome were profiled, and salivary extracellular vesicles were derived, from which small-RNA sequencing was used to determine RNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial RNA components. The two 24-hour periods were used in a paired analysis to reveal vaccination responses. Temporal trends were classified and collective behavior revealed broad immune-responses captured in saliva, both at the innate as well as the adaptive response time frames.

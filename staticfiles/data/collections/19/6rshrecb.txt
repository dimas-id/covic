Objectives: To determine the level of Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) related to COVID-19 preventive health habits and perception of Fear towards COVID-19 in subjects living in Bangladesh. Design: Prospective, cross-sectional survey of (n= 2157) male and female subjects, 13-90 years of age, living in Bangladesh. Methods: Ethical Approval and Trial registration were obtained prior to the commencement of the study. Subjects who volunteered to participate and signed the informed consent were enrolled in the study and completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS). Results: Twenty-eight percent (28.69%) of subjects reported one or more COVID-19 symptoms and 21.4% of subjects reported one or more comorbidities. Knowledge scores were slightly higher in males (8.75, SD 1.58) than females (8.66, SD 1.70). Knowledge was significantly correlated with age (p<.005), an education level (p<.001), Attitude (p<.001), and urban location (p<.001). Knowledge scores showed an inverse correlation with Fear scores (p<.001). Eighty-three percent (83.7%) of subjects with COVID-19 symptoms reported wearing a mask in public and 75.4% of subjects reported staying away from crowded places. Subjects with one or more symptoms reported higher Fear compared to subjects without (18.73, SD 4.6; 18.45, SD 5.1). Conclusions: Overall, Bangladeshis reported a high prevalence of self-isolation, positive preventive health behaviors related to COVID-19, and moderate to high fear levels. Higher Knowledge and Practice were found in males, higher education levels, older age, and urban location. Fear of COVID-19 was more prevalent in female and elderly subjects. Positive Attitude was reported for the majority of subjects, reflecting the belief that COVID-19 was controllable and containable.

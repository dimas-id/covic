In the era of staggering speed in development of the novel coronavirus (CoV) pandemic (COVID‐19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV2), we have reviewed the dermatologists’ tools at hand for their utility (and potential risks) in patients affected by COVID‐19. This review aims to shed light on the anti‐viral and pro‐viral potential of drugs routinely used in dermatology to modulate COVID‐19. The literature search included peer‐reviewed articles published in English language (clinical trials or scientific reviews). Studies were identified by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE and PubMed) from January 1990 to March 2020 and by reference lists of respective articles. Somewhat to our surprise, we have found that several of our drugs widely used in dermatology have antiviral potential. On the other hand, we also frequently use immunosuppressive drugs in our dermatologic patients that potentially pose them at increased risk for COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright.

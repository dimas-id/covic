BACKGROUND The use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction has been increasing. The current ADMs available for breast reconstruction are offered as aseptic or sterile. No published studies have compared aseptic and sterile ADM in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction. The authors performed a retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes of aseptic versus sterile ADM in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction. METHODS Implant-based immediate breast reconstructions with ADM conducted between April 2013 and January 2016 were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups: the aseptic ADM (AlloDerm) group and the sterile ADM (MegaDerm) group. Archived records were reviewed for demographic data and postoperative complication types and frequencies. The complications included were infection, flap necrosis, capsular contracture, seroma, hematoma, and explantation for any cause. RESULTS Twenty patients were reconstructed with aseptic ADM, and 68 patients with sterile ADM. Rates of infection (15.0% vs. 10.3%), flap necrosis (5.0% vs. 7.4%), capsular contracture (20.0% vs. 14.7%), seroma (10.0% vs. 14.7%), hematoma (0% vs. 1.5%), and explantation (10.0% vs. 8.8%) were not significantly different in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Sterile ADM did not provide better results regarding infectious complications than aseptic ADM in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction.

Repeat renal surgery is technically demanding with a high morbidity rate. We describe a novel surgical approach, a salvage robotic transmesenteric off-clamp partial nephrectomy for the management of a renal cell carcinoma in a patient with a history of VHL and multiple prior renal surgeries on the affected kidney. Upon pathological review, the specimen was diagnosed as clear cell RCC, Fuhrman Grade 3, with negative surgical margins. The patient suffered no post-operative complications and had a rapid convalescence. This approach is a feasible and safe alternative in select patients with a significant history of renal surgeries and favorable anatomy.

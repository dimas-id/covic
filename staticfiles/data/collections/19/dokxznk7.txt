The World Health Organization (http:/www.who.int/en/) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov) websites are updated daily as new information is learned about the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) phenomena. The transmission of SARS appears to occur predominantly through direct contact with infectious material. This includes dispersed respiratory droplets, making touching contaminated objects a potential concern. Occupational health nurses must educate themselves and their employees about SARS to allow for accurate and timely sharing of information.

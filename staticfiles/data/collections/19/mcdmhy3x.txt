We followed-up a mild COVID-19 patient for 91 days and serially monitored his serum antibodies to four SARS-CoV-2 related antigens (NP, RBD, S1 and ECD) and neutralization activities. Our data revealed a profile of serial antibody responses during the progress and a quick decline of neutralization activities after discharge.

The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the insights from the model.

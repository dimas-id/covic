OBJECTIVE To evaluate the vascularity of the myometrium after laparoscopic myomectomy sutured by two different methods using contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging. STUDY DESIGN Twenty-eight women who had symptomatic leiomyomas and underwent laparoscopic myomectomy between June 2013 and July 2014 were included in the present study. In the first half period, continuous sutures were used in 12 patients, and in the latter half period, single interrupted sutures were used in 16 patients. Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used 3 or 6 months after surgery to evaluate vascularity after laparoscopic myomectomy. We defined avascularity index as the percentage of avascular area after surgery to cross sectional area of myoma before surgery. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to compare avascularity indeces in the two study groups. RESULTS At 3 months after surgery, avascularity index in continuous sutures group was significantly higher than that in single interrupted sutures group (median 5.0 vs.1.2, p<0.001), suggesting a poorer vascular recovery of the myometrium sutured continuously. CONCLUSION Simple interrupted suturing might be superior to continuous suturing in terms of vascularity evaluated using contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

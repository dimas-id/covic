Human-to-human transmission of influenza viruses is a serious public health threat, yet the precise role of immunity from previous infections on the susceptibility to airborne viruses is still unknown. Using human seasonal influenza viruses in a ferret model, we examined the roles of exposure duration and heterosubtypic immunity on influenza transmission. We found that airborne transmission of seasonal influenza strains is abrogated in recipient animals with pre-existing non-neutralizing immunity, indicating that transmissibility of a given influenza virus strain should be examined in the context of ferrets that are not immunologically na√Øve.

The identification of the different cell types involved in human nephrogenesis, when solely based on morphology, may lead to errors in its interpretation, given the complexity of the histological picture of the fetal and of the newborn kidney. In this study, the most recent works utilizing immunohistochemistry for the identification of the multiple cell types involved in human nephrogenesis are reviewed. The role of WT1, MUC1, Thymosin beta 10, Thymosin beta 4, CD10 and CD44 in the different phases of glomerulogenesis and of tubulogenesis is here described, with particular emphasis on their expression in the early phases of nephrogenesis. On the basis of our data, immunohistochemistry appears to be a useful tool in the study of human nephrogenesis, giving new data on the different steps of the differentiation of metanephric mesenchyme towards the multiple cell types characterizing the mature human kidney. Moreover, allowing a better knowledge of the protein products involved in the generation of new nephrons, immunohistochemistry could open new perspectives in the field of renal regenerating medicine, evidencing the factors able to prolong nephrogenesis after birth, helping us to reach our goal: allowing newborn kidneys to restore their nephron endowment, escaping susceptibility to hypertension and renal disease in adulthood.

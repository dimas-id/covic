Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV. The virus emerged in humans from Wuhan seafood market probably via zoonotic transmission. Within a few days the virus spread its tentacles rapidly to neighboring cities in China and to different geographical regions through travelers and to some extent by human to human transmission leading to significant disease burden globally. More than 2,00,000 people (including more than 8000 deaths) have been infected with this respiratory illness across 167 countries and territories worldwide leading to a pandemic. The present review provides an outline about emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China in 2019-2020. We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness. In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present. Subsequently, we have given a comprehensive overview of the spread of this infection from China to the other parts of the globe. Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results. Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus.

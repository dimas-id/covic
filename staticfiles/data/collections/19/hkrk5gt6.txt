INTRODUCTION Intra-Vascular Ultra-Sound (IVUS) and Frequency Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT), in vivo, intra-vascular, imaging modalities, widely used in the field of coronary disease, have been recently implemented in peripheral endovascular procedures, for procedural assessment, plaque characterization and determination of predictors of treatment outcomes. Their unique characteristics have also been used in order to provide additional features and improve the performance of re-entry devices and atherotomes. Areas covered: Present review focuses on available literature regarding these two promising imaging technologies in the peripheral vasculature, highlighting the added value produced by their use in endovascular therapy, their limitations and their utilization in new endovascular devices. Authors also provide their future perspective and the possible benefits in understanding vascular behavior and lesion characterization in peripheral endovascular interventions. Expert commentary: By providing both quantitative but also qualitative data on vessel and lesion morphology, intravascular imaging modalities offer a valid solution for endovascular treatment evaluation and outcome presentation homogeneity.

PURPOSE To analyze the angiographic and clinical results of transarterial embolization with Onyx (Medtronic-Covidien, Irvine, CA) in dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) partially fed by arteries arising from the carotid siphon or the vertebral arteries. METHODS We isolated 40 DAVFs supplied by either the tentorial artery of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or the posterior meningeal artery of the vertebral artery. These DAVFs were embolized with Onyx through the middle meningeal artery or the occipital artery. We reviewed the occurrence of reflux into the arteries of carotid or vertebral origin. RESULTS In all the cases, reflux occurred into the first millimeters of the DAVF arterial feeders arising from carotid or vertebral arteries but slowly enough to be controlled by interruption of Onyx injection. Reflux was always minimal and Onyx never reached the ostium of the arteries. No cerebral ischemic complications occurred in our series. CONCLUSION The behavior of Onyx is clearly different from that of cyanoacrylate glue, resulting in superior control during injection. Reflux into arteries arising from the ICA or vertebral artery during DAVF treatment always carries a risk of unintentional non-target embolization of normal cerebral vasculature but Onyx appears to be safe in this situation.

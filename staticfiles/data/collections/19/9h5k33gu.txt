Since December 2019, the seriousness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has been on escalation (Lu, et al 2020). Coagulopathy is common in critically ill patients with COVID‐19 (Tang, et al 2020b). Systemic microvascular thrombosismay occur in most deaths, which was further identified by a recent autopsy (Luo 2020). However, less has been known about the coagulation parameter D‐dimer in the progression of COVID‐19. In this study, we describe 279 COVID‐19 patients recruited from three hospitals in Hubei Province, China, and then investigate the dynamic relationship between D‐dimer level and the progression of COVID‐19.

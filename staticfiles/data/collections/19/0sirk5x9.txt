BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Questions remain as to what benefits embolectomy provides to patients presented with considerable early ischemic changes on baseline imaging studies. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score applied to DWI on treatment outcomes in patients with acute stroke undergoing stent-retriever embolectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and DWI data from 171 patients with acute anterior circulation stroke who were treated with stent-retriever embolectomy within 6 hours of symptom onset. DWI-ASPECTS scores were analyzed with the full scale or were dichotomized (4-6 versus 7-10). Patients with DWI-ASPECTS â‰¤3 were excluded from the study. Associations between outcome and clinical and radiologic factors were determined with a multivariate logistic regression analysis. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS The median DWI-ASPECTS was 7 (interquartile range, 6-8). The rates of good outcome, symptomatic hemorrhage, and mortality were not different between high DWI-ASPECTS (scores of 7-10) and intermediate DWI-ASPECTS (scores of 4-6) groups. In patients with an intermediate DWI-ASPECTS, good outcome was achieved in 46.5% (20/43) of patients with successful revascularization, whereas no patients without successful revascularization had a good outcome (P = .016). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of good outcome were age and successful revascularization. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggested that there were no differences in outcomes between patients with a high DWI-ASPECTS and those with an intermediate DWI-ASPECTS who underwent stent-retriever embolectomy for acute anterior circulation stroke. Thus, patients with an intermediate DWI-ASPECTS otherwise eligible for endovascular therapy may not be excluded from stent-retriever embolectomy or stroke trials.

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against five antigenic sites on the spike (S) S1 glycopolypeptide of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were used to select neutralization-resistant variants of the virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequence of such variants with the sequence of the IBV parent strain, we located five antigenic sites on the amino acid sequence of the S1 glycopolypeptide. The variants had mutations within three regions corresponding to amino acid residues 24 to 61, 132 to 149 and 291 to 398 of the S1 glycopolypeptide. The location of three overlapping antigenic sites on the IBV spike protein was similar to the location of antigenic sites on the spike protein of other coronaviruses.

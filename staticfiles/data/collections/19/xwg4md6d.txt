OBJECTIVE: To estimate the ascertainment rate of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological dataset of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Japan as of 28 February 2020. A statistical model was constructed to describe the heterogeneity of reporting rate by age and severity. We estimated the number of severe and non-severe cases, accounting for under-ascertainment. RESULTS: The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases was estimated at 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.37, 0.50), indicating that unbiased number of non-cases would be more than twice the reported count. CONCLUSIONS: Severe cases are twice more likely diagnosed and reported than other cases. Considering that reported cases are usually dominated by non-severe cases, the adjusted total number of cases is also about a double of observed count. Our finding is critical in interpreting the reported data, and it is advised to interpret mild case data of COVID-19 as always under-ascertained.

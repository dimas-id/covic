PURPOSE: To explore the dynamic changes and correlation between CT imaging manifestations and cellular immunity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective review analyzed 23 patients with COVID-19, including 13 males and 10 females aged 27-70 years, with an average age of 48 years. Patients were divided into two groups: group A with 11 critical-severe patients, and group B with 12 common-mild patients. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ decreased, while NEU (%), CRP, and CT scores increased in all patients, WBC in group A increased. In group A, on day 10-12 after disease onset, CT scores and CRP reached the highest point, and day 13-15 LYM, LYM (%) reached the lowest but NEU (%) and WBC reached the highest, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ were at the lowest on day 10-15. In group B, on day 7-9, CT scores, NEU (%) and CRP reached the peak, but LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ reached the lowest. In all patients, CT scores had a significantly negative correlation with CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, LYM (%), and LYM (p = 0.001, r = - 0.797; p = 0.008, r = - 0.698; p = 0.002, r = - 0.775; p < 0.001, r = - 0.785; p = 0.021, r = - 0.571, respectively), and a significantly positive correlation with WBC and NEU (%) (p < 0.001, r = 0.785; p = 0.003, r = 0.691, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dynamic changes of CT manifestations and cellular immunity of patients with COVID-19 were regular and correlation was high between these two parameters.

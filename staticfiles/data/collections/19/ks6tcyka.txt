Abstract APOBEC3G (A3G) is an intrinsic antiretroviral factor which can inhibit Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. This antiviral activity mainly depends on A3G incorporation into viral particles. However, the mechanisms of A3G packaging into HBV particles have not been well characterized. In this paper, we demonstrated that A3G interacted with the HBV core protein (HBc) directly in co-transfected HepG2 cells using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. In addition, we further found that this interaction did not require other factors in vitro using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology on BIAcore 3000. While cellular RNA or viral RNA was added to A3G protein solution before flow through the BIAcore chip, the interaction was not affected. In conclusion, these results suggest the possibility that A3G is incorporated into HBV viral particles via direct binding with HBc protein.

BACKGROUND Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection emerged in 2012. The majority of cases occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the disease carries a high case fatality rate. METHODS We present three MERS-CoV cases and highlight the salient clinical features and laboratory, and radiographic characteristics. RESULTS Although all nasopharyngeal samples were negative, MERS CoV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the E gene (UpE) and open reading frame (ORF1b) on sputum samples. The Ct value of the ORF1 gene was 24.8-29.11. One patient had been on immune suppressive agent and two patients had diabetes mellitus. The average length of hospital stay was 10.6 days. Two patients received ribavirin and IFN-a2b in addition to supportive management. The clinical course for these patients started with a febrile period lasting five days, a reduction in fever was coinciding with increased respiratory rate and oxygen requirements. All patients were discharged home. None of the 50 contacts tested positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION Resolution of the fever was accompanied by an increase in oxygen requirements and respiratory rate also lasting several days. This was followed by resolution of all symptoms and return to normal.

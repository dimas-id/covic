Laparoscopic hepatobiliary surgery, although technically demanding, gains popularity due to the patient benefits of a mini-invasive approach. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a technically feasible and reproducible operation that doesn't require complex digestive reconstruction. It requires advanced laparoscopic skill for vascular dissection and control. Due to the absence of trials proving its oncological results it is mainly indicated for benign or borderline tumours of the pancreatic body and tail. Since for these tumours there is no indication for a lymph node dissection, there are benefits for the patient if the spleen is preserved. There is some evidence that robotic assistance facilitates the procedure and makes it accessible to surgeons diminishing the necessity of advanced laparoscopic skills. In this technical multimedia article, we present our method for a robotic mini-invasive spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the splenic vessels. The technique is presented in a stepwise approach with an accompanying video. We believe that the use of the Da Vinci robotic platform facilitates this demanding procedure.

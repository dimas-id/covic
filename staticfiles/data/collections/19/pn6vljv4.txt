Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) was performed in three consecutive COVID-19 patients, as part of a pilot investigation of the pathophysiological processes underlying the brain involvement by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. These included one with necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, one after recent PEA cardiac arrest without leukoencephalopathy, and one without frank encephalopathy or recent severe hypoxic episode. The MRSI findings were compared to those of two patients with white matter pathology not SARS-CoV2 infection related, and a control patient without clinical encephalopathy. The N-acetyl-aspartate reduction, choline elevation, and glutamate/glutamine elevation found in the COVID necrotizing leukoencephalopathy patient and, to a lesser degree, the COVID post-cardiac arrest patient, follow a similar pattern as seen with the delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy patient. Lactate elevation was most pronounced in the patient with COVID necrotizing leukoencephalopathy.

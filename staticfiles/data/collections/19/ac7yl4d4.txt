BACKGROUND/AIMS Initiating renal replacement therapy in late referred patients with central venous catheter (CVC) hemodialysis (HD) causes serious complications. In urgent start peritoneal dialysis, initiating peritoneal dialysis (PD) within 14 days of catheter insertion still needs HD with CVC. We initiated Emergent start PD (ESPD) with Automated PD (APD) at our center within 48 h from the time of presentation. METHODS A prospective, case-controlled, intention-to-treat study with 56 patients was conducted between March 2016 and August 2017. Group A (24 patients) underwent conventional PD 14 days after catheter insertion. Group B (32 patients), underwent ESPD with APD. Exit site leak (ESL), catheter blockage, and peritonitis at 90 days were primary outcomes. Technique survival was secondary outcome. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar with 3 episodes of ESLs (9.4%) in the study group and none in the control group (p = 0.123). Catheter blockage (16.7%-Group A, 25%-Group B) and peritonitis (none vs. 9.4% in study group) were similar in terms of statistical details just as technique survival (95%-Group A, 88.2%-Group B at 90 days). CONCLUSION ESPD with APD in the unplanned patient is an appropriate approach.

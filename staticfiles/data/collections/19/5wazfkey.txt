The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the death of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.All clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were hospitalised to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China) between 25 December 2019 and 7 February 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk of death of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.In total, 179 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (97 male and 82 female) were included in the present prospective study, of whom 21 died. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age &#8805;65â years (OR 3.765, 95% CI 1.146â17.394; p=0.023), pre-existing concurrent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases (OR 2.464, 95% CI 0.755â8.044; p=0.007), CD3+CD8+ T-cells &#8804;75â cells·µL-1 (OR 3.982, 95% CI 1.132â14.006; p<0.001) and cardiac troponin I &#8805;0.05â ng·mL-1 (OR 4.077, 95% CI 1.166â14.253; p<0.001) were associated with an increase in risk of mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia. In a sex-, age- and comorbid illness-matched case-control study, CD3+CD8+ T-cells &#8804;75â cells·µL-1 and cardiac troponin I &#8805;0.05â ng·mL-1 remained as predictors for high mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia.We identified four risk factors: age &#8805;65â years, pre-existing concurrent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, CD3+CD8+ T-cells &#8804;75â cells·µL-1 and cardiac troponin I &#8805;0.05â ng·mL-1 The latter two factors, especially, were predictors for mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

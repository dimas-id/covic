Currently, the Internet has become a service hosting infrastructure through its interconnection of a very large number of heterogeneous objects, thus offering users several types of services implemented by different sectors.

To avoid this, we have designed a secure e-health platform based on IoT that serves to monitor patients’ medical profiles remotely by collecting their medical records while ensuring their confidentiality and integrity.

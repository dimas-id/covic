Various strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) cause different forms of infectious bronchitis with different clinical signs. Here, primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were infected with three pathogenic IBV strains, and it was observed that the TLR7-MYD88 pathway was inhibited but the TLR3-TIRF pathway was activated. After treatment with poly(I:C)-LMW, poly (I:C)-LMW/LyoVec, and Imiquimod, the replication of IBV was significantly suppressed after 24 h. However, treatment with TLR3 pathway inhibitors such as Pepinh-TRIF, celastrol, chloroquine, and BX795 resulted in increased replication of IBV after 36 h. These results also showed that chloroquine and celastrol were most effective inhibitors of the antiviral response at 48 hpi.

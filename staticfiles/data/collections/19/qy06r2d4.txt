Dermatologists around the world are still doing their best to report more cutaneous manifestations of the emerging COVID-19 infection. New-onset acute or relapsing chronic urticaria may result from the body's overreacting inflammatory response to infection. The cytokine storm hits different organs in the body, including the skin, leading to activation and degranulation of mast cells with resultant urticaria. Low-dose systemic steroids combined with antihistamines can combat the COVID-19 inflammatory insult and play a role in the control of COVID-19 related severe urticarial attack.

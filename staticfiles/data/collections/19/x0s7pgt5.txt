In early March 2020 it became apparent that clinical laboratories would need to quickly develop strategies for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 testing. For most, the initial approach was to send out testing to a reference laboratory.

Concurrently, the demand for rapid accessibility of results persists, leading many laboratories to evaluate options for “in house” testing. This reflection highlights some of the considerations when selecting the best method for your laboratory, with specific examples highlighted from a medium volume laboratory’s experience.

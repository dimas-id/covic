The ability to simultaneously monitor multiple analytes in, for example, a single microplate well, is important for both basic research and clinical applications. In particular, for disease diagnosis there is a growing awareness that determination of a single disease biomarker is insufficient to pathologically confirm a disease state. Consequently, much recent literature has been directed towards the development of multiplexed photoluminescent sensors which can simultaneously detect multiple and diverse biomarkers that exist in a homogenous solution or a single cell, accelerating the progress towards precise disease diagnosis. This tutorial review highlights a selection of recent contributions towards this emerging interdisciplinary field that incorporates chemistry, chemical biology, materials sciences and medical sciences.

Recent reports of serious infection outbreaks internationally remind us of the importance of accurate information and continual vigilance. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has captured headlines as the most severe outbreak in the history of this disease. West Nile disease, measles, pertussis and tuberculosis infect South Dakota patients on a yearly basis. A significant rise in syphilis cases has prompted recommendations for increased prenatal screening. The more unusual viral diseases, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Chikungunha virus, receive media attention but present minimal risk to the state, while the annual influenza epidemic continues to plague us all. We review these infections, both old and emerging, and describe national and local preparedness practices.

This is the first report of virologically verified spontaneous hepatitis A in M. rhesus monkeys with severe involvement of the liver leading to the death of the animals. In 21 out of 23 dead monkeys morphological lesions in the liver have been characterized as acute hepatitis. In 6 (26%) animals no other pathological processes were found. In 15 animals hepatitis was combined with other diseases (dysentery, parasitic infestations, coronavirus infection). Antigen of hepatitis A virus was detected by an enzyme immunoassay in the intestinal contents of 8 monkeys and in the livers of 3 of them. Immune electron microscopic studies detected in the intestines some virus particles morphologically and antigenically similar to human hepatitis A virus.

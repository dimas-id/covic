To examine the potential roles of melatonin in cadmium (Cd) uptake, accumulation and detoxification in Malus plants, we exposed two different apple rootstocks varying greatly in Cd uptake and accumulation to either 0 or 30 µM Cd together with 0 or 100 µM melatonin. Cadmium stress stimulated endogenous melatonin production to a greater extent in the Cd-tolerant Malus baccata Borkh. than in the Cd-susceptible Malus micromalus 'qingzhoulinqin'. Melatonin application attenuated Cd-induced reductions in growth, photosynthesis and enzyme activity, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde accumulation. Melatonin treatment more effectively restored photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments and biomass in Cd-challenged M. micromalus 'qingzhoulinqin' than in Cd-stressed M. baccata. Exogenous melatonin lowered root Cd2+ uptake, reduced leaf Cd accumulation, decreased Cd translocation factors and increased root, stem and leaf melatonin contents in both Cd-exposed rootstocks. Melatonin application increased both antioxidant concentrations and enzyme activities to scavenge Cd-induced ROS. Exogenous melatonin treatment altered the mRNA levels of several genes regulating Cd uptake, transport and detoxification including HA7, NRAMP1, NRAMP3, HMA4, PCR2, NAS1, MT2, ABCC1 and MHX. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous melatonin reduced aerial parts Cd accumulation and mitigated Cd toxicity in Malus plants, probably due to the melatonin-mediated Cd allocation in tissues, and induction of antioxidant defense system and transcriptionally regulated key genes involved in detoxification.

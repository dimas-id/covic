PURPOSE OF REVIEW Patients suffering from acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are at risk for developing chronic limb pain, heaviness, and fatigue, known as the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). RECENT FINDINGS Although several studies have shown that catheter-directed therapy reduces clot burden and may improve clinical outcomes, the multicenter randomized controlled ATTRACT trial showed no difference in PTS or quality of life at 2 years between patients treated with pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) and those treated with anticoagulation alone, and a higher major bleeding rate in the PCDT group. PCDT is not indicated for most patients diagnosed with lower extremity DVT. Since PCDT may benefit patients with iliofemoral DVT, intervention can be considered in this subset of patients if they are at low risk of bleeding.

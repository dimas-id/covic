Systems biology holds the key for understanding biological systems on a system level. It eventually holds the key for the treatment and cure of complex diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, mental disorders, and many others. The â€˜-omics' technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabonomics, are among the major driving forces of systems biology. Featured as high-throughput, miniaturized, and capable of parallel analysis, protein microarrays have already become an important technology platform for systems biology. In this review, we will focus on the system level or global analysis of biological systems using protein microarrays. Four major types of protein microarrays will be discussed: proteome microarrays, antibody microarrays, reverse-phase protein arrays, and lectin microarrays. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions of protein microarray technologies and their applications for systems biology. We strongly believe that protein microarrays will soon become an indispensable and invaluable tool for systems biology.

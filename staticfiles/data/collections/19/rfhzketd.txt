In the 15 February 2007 issue of the Journal, in the letter by Seligman (Seligman SJ. Evidence for quasi species in severe acute respiratory syndrome—associated coronavirus deletion mutants. J Infect Dis 2007; 195:609), it should be noted that, in accordance with Journal style, “quasi species” has been spelled as 2 words, whereas many other publications use the single-word form, “quasispecies”; readers doing a search for the term are advised to take this variant treatment into account.

Helicobacter pylori (HP) colonizes the human stomach and induces acute gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, atrophic gastritis, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Increased virulence in HP isolates derives from harboring the cag (cytotoxin-associated genes) pathogenicity island (cagPAI). We analyzed the microvariants in cagPAI genes with the hypothesis that they may play an important role in determining HP virulence. We tested DNAs from cagA positive patients HP isolates; a total of 74 patients with chronic gastritis (CG, N = 37), intestinal metaplasia (IM, N = 21) or gastric cancer (GC, N = 16) from Mexico and Colombia. We selected 520 non-synonymous variants with at least 7.5% frequency in the original sequence outputs or with a minimum of 5 isolates with minor allele. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, no variants were statistically significantly associated with IM or GC. However, 19 non-synonymous showed conventional P-values < 0.05 comparing the frequency of the alleles between the isolates from subjects with gastritis and isolates from subjects with IM or GC; 12 of these showed a significant correlation with the severity of the disease. The present study revealed that several cagPAI genes from Latin American Western HP strains contains a number of non-synonymous variants in relatively high frequencies which could influence on the clinical outcome. However, none of the associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparison.

BACKGROUND: The effect of HIV co-infection on COVID-19 outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown METHODS: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV and COVID-19 death among (i) public sector 'active patients' (at least 1 health visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases COVID-19 was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs negative adults using modelled population estimates RESULTS: Among 3,460,932 public sector patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died In adjusted analysis, HIV increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]:2 14;95% confidence interval [CI]:1 70;2 70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression increased HIV-associated risk of COVID-19 death remained when restricting to COVID-19 cases (aHR:1 70;95%CI:132;2 18) or hospitalized cases (aHR:1 45;95%CI:1 14;1 84) Current and previous tuberculosis also increased COVID-19 mortality risk (aHR [95%CI]:2 70 [1 81;4 04] and 1 51 [1 18;1 93] respectively) The SMR for COVID-19 death associated with HIV was 2 39 (95% CI:1 96;2 86);population attributable fraction 8 5% (95%CI:6 1;11 1) CONCLUSION: HIV was associated with a doubling of COVID-19 mortality risk While our findings may over-estimate the HIV-associated risk COVID-19 death due to residual confounding, people with HIV should be considered a high-risk group for COVID-19 management

Since emerging in China in December 2019, the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, has infected more than 3 million people worldwide (Johns Hopkins University and Medicine: Coronavirus Resource Center). Since then, clusters of infections have emerged in Singapore, particularly among younger workers in communal living environments. The spectrum of COVID-19 infection ranges from mild respiratory illness, to viral pneumonia and life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome in up 15-20% (Huang, et al 2020, Wu and McGoogan 2020).

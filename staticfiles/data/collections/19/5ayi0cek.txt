Standard and light surgical meshes with identical knitted structure: Parietene Standard/Parietene Light and Premilene/Optilene were chosen for hernioplasty in 20 rats. Six months after surgery, the complications were primarily related to inflammation in groups with implanted standard meshes and with prosthesis deformation in groups with light meshes. The character of complications was determined by characteristics of knitting structure and mechanical proprieties of surgical meshes.

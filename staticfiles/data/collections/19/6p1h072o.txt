Since thermostable Taq DNA polymerase was discovered in 1987, nucleic acid amplification techniques have made great strides and contributed greatly to progress in the life sciences. These techniques were introduced into the clinical laboratory and have produced great changes in diagnostic tools and tests. In particular, there have been many innovative molecular testing developments in the field of diagnostic microbiology.

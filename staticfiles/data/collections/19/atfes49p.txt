OBJECTIVES Current methods to confirm endotracheal tube (ETT) placement have varying degrees of effectiveness and time to completion. We aimed to study the accuracy of real-time tracheal ultrasound (US) to confirm ETT placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. METHODS This work was a prospective study completed at 2 academic tertiary care centers. Patients in the adult ICU requiring emergent intubation were enrolled in the trial. During the intubation process, a US team performed a tracheal US examination to determine, in real time, whether the ETT was placed into the trachea or the esophagus. RESULTS A total of 75 patients were enrolled in the study and were available for analysis. There were 12 (16%) esophageal intubations and 63 (84%) tracheal intubations. One hundred percent of the tracheal intubations and 83% of the esophageal intubations were correctly identified. The positive and negative predictive values of US to detect an esophageal intubation were 100% and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Tracheal US can be highly accurate in identifying the location of the ETT, in real time, in ICU patients undergoing emergent intubation. Although our study shows a great potential of real-time US use during emergent intubations, larger studies would be needed to further evaluate the accuracy of this technique.

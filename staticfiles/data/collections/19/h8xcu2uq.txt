The clinical data on the first wheezing episodes induced by different rhinovirus (RV) species are still limited. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of RV genotypes, sensitization status and clinical characteristics of patients having a respiratory infection caused by either different RV species or other respiratory viruses. The study enrolled 111 patients (aged 3–23 months, 79% hospitalized, 76% with RV infection) with the first wheezing episode. RV-specific sequences were identified by partial sequencing of VP4/VP2 and 5′ non-coding regions with 80% success rate. The investigated clinical and laboratory variables included atopic characteristics and illness severity, parental atopic illnesses, and parental smoking. Of the study children, 56% percent had ≥1 atopic characteristic (atopy, eczema and/or blood eosinophil count ≥0.4×10(9)/L) and 23% were sensitised to allergens. RV-C was detected in 58% of RV positive samples, followed by RV-A (20%) and RV-B (1.2%). Children with RV-A and RV-C induced wheezing were older (p = 0.014) and had more atopic characteristics (p = 0.001) than those with non-RV. RV-A and RV-C illnesses had shorter duration of preadmission symptoms and required more bronchodilator use at the ward than non-RV illnesses (both p < 0.05, respectively) RV-C is the most common cause of severe early wheezing. Atopic and illness severity features are associated with children having RV-A or RV-C induced first wheezing episode rather than with children having a non-RV induced wheezing.

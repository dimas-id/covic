PURPOSE Most cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas (CSDAVF) are unilateral; however, simultaneous bilateral CSDAVFs occasionally may be found. This article reports on 141 patients and compares the angioarchitecture and outcomes of embolization of bilateral CSDAVFs with those of unilateral CSDAVFs, with reference to limited demographics (sex and age) of the patients. METHOD From January 2010 to February 2018 a total of 141 consecutive patients with CSDAVFs were referred for transvenous embolization. Bilateral CSDAVFs were found in 20 patients (14.2%, with a mean age of 62.2 years). The angioarchitecture of the 141 patients with CSDAVFs were evaluated by conventional cerebral angiography. We compared the angioarchitecture and treatment outcomes of 20 bilateral and 121 unilateral CSDAVFs, and in relation to the patients' sex and age. RESULTS Female patients significantly dominated the bilateral CSDAVFs (90%, p = 0.043). Bilateral eye symptoms were significantly more common in bilateral CSDAVFs (p = 0.011), with dominant orbital and cavernous symptoms, and showed statistical significance (p = 0.049 and 0.011, respectively). Occlusion of one CSDAVF may significantly decrease the fistula flow of the other untreated side (n = 13, 65%), leading to less coil utilization for embolization in bilateral CSDAVFs (p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance in the occurrence of occlusion of the inferior petrous sinus(s), in pial vein reflux, and treatment outcomes in the unilateral and bilateral CSDAVFs. CONCLUSION Bilateral CSDAVFs were more dominant in female patients and frequently presented with orbital and cavernous symptoms. Fewer coils were used per lesion in the bilateral CSDAVFs. There was no statistical significance in bilateral and unilateral CSDAVFs in terms of impact of venous drainage, pial vein reflux and treatment outcomes.

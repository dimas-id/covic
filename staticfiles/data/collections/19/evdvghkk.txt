Venous thromboembolism (VTE) complications are the leading cause of preventable in-hospital mortality and morbidity in the United States. Initiatives by the National Quality Forum, the Joint Commission, and the Surgical Care Improvement Project aim to improve the prevention of VTE and emphasize the need to recognize the risk of the condition in hospitalized patients. In clinical practice, individual risk assessment using a validated scoring system provides patients with the best care in the prevention of VTE. This is accomplished by a weighted scoring of risk factors, selection of the most appropriate prevention strategy for patients at risk, and regular risk review across the continuum of care. All hospitals should have a local, written, care pathway which assesses inpatient risk of VTE as early as possible upon admission and identifies members of the health care team responsible for applying risk assessment. Venous thromboembolism risk should be regularly reassessed for any changes in the level of risk, with extended out-of-hospital prophylaxis considered for patients with continued risk factors, such as prolonged immobility or illness, treated at home, or in a long-term care facility. Finally, a mandatory alert system requiring the clinician to address the issue of prophylaxis before any orders are carried out by the nursing staff is one way to protect all hospitalized patients.

INTRODUCTION Epidemics and pandemics from zoonotic respiratory viruses, such as the 2019 novel coronavirus, can lead to significant global intensive care burden as patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A subset of these patients develops refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarize the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics. METHODS A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications. RESULTS Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimized while receiving ECMO so as to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimize resource allocation. CONCLUSION The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.

Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can complicate novel pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) represents the final possible rescue strategy. Variations in practice, combined with a paucity of rigorous guidelines, may complicate blood product resource availability and allocation during a pandemic. We conducted a literature review around venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) transfusion practices for platelets, packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrate, and antithrombin. Pertinent society guidelines were examined, and the practice of Canadian ECLS experts was sampled through an environmental scan. This paper represents a synthesis of these explorations, combined with input from the Canadian Cardiovascular Critical Care (CANCARE) Society, Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons, and the Canadian Critical Care Society. We offer a pragmatic guidance document for restrictive transfusion thresholds in non-bleeding VV-ECMO patients, which may attenuate transfusion-related complications, and simultaneously shield national blood product inventory from strain during pandemic-induced activation of the National Plan for the Management of Shortages of Labile Blood Components.

Surgery of the lower gastrointestinal tract includes segmental resections for benign colorectal diseases and radical resections for treating colorectal cancer performed under elective and emergency conditions. The most important part of the surgical procedure is the reconstruction of the physiological intestinal continuity by anastomosis. At present laparoscopic surgery has widened the array of different suturing and stapling techniques. The effectiveness of manual and stapled anastomoses depends on the expertise of the surgeon.

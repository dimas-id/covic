Since the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected individuals are travelling more frequently and international travel has become much safer. Specific concerns include the safety of ART during travel, drug adherence and interaction considerations, and effects of immunosuppression. This review describes potentially important infections, vaccine effectiveness, safety and special approaches for their use, and HIV-related issues regarding predeparture counselling. With advanced immunosuppression (CD4+ T-cell count < 200/microl or < 14%), the immunogenicity of several vaccines is reduced, complications could occur after live attenuated vaccines and certain infections acquired during travel may be more frequent or severe. Challenges include the best options for malaria chemoprophylaxis, standby treatment and medical follow-up of the increasing number of HIV-infected long-term travellers.

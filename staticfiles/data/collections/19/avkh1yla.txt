BACKGROUND: The incidence of obesity is disproportionally high in African Americans (AA) in the United States. This study compared outcomes for AA patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) with non-AA patients. METHODS: The MBSAQIP database was reviewed for RYGB and SG patients (2015â€“2017). Patients were identified as AA or non-AA and grouped to RYGB or SG. Combined and univariate analyses were performed on unmatched/propensity matched populations to assess outcomes. RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 75,409 AA and 354,305 non-AA patients remained. Univariate analysis identified AA-RYGB and AA-SG patients were heavier and younger than non-AA patients. Overall, AA patients tended to have fewer preoperative comorbidities than non-AA patients with the majority of AA comorbidities related to hypertension and renal disease. Analysis of propensity matched data confirmed AA bariatric surgery patients had increased cardiovascular-related disease incidence compared with non-AA patients. Perioperatively, AA-RYGB patients had longer operative times, increased rates of major complications/ICU admission, and increased incidence of 30-day readmission, re-intervention, and reoperation, concomitant with lower rates of minor complications/superficial surgical site infection (SSI) compared with non-AA patients. For SG, AA patients had longer operative times and higher rates of major complications and 30-day readmission, re-intervention, and mortality, coupled with fewer minor complications, superficial/organ space SSI, and leak. CONCLUSION: African American patients undergoing bariatric surgery are younger and heavier than non-AA patients and present with different comorbidity profiles. Overall, AAs exhibit worse outcomes following RYGB or SG than non-AA patients, including increased mortality rates in AA-SG patients.

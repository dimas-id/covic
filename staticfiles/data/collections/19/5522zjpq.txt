COVID-19 has taken a terrible toll on the nursing home population. Yet, there are five times the number of seniors living in the community who are also extremely vulnerable because they suffer from respiratory illnesses. Using the 2018 wave of the Health and Retirement Study we analyze this group of roughly 7 million seniors living in the community and find that they have multiple risk factors that make them particularly exposed. We also show how current strategies for protecting this population may be exacerbating risks and suggest concrete steps for better protecting this group.

BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD). Its prevalence in swine herds was first reported in China in 2000. PCV2 infection causes immunosuppression that leads to multiple diseases, causing serious economic problems for the swine industry in China. Since information on the genetic variation of PCV2 in Yunnan province is limited, this study aims to investigate the molecular epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of PCV2 from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: A total of 279 clinical samples were collected from different regions of Yunnan between 2016 to 2019, and PCV2 was detected by PCR. We then amplified full genomes from the positive samples, and the sequences were analysed for homology and genetic evolution. RESULTS: Overall, 60.93% (170/279) of the screened swine herd samples were positive for PCV2. We sequenced 15 Yunnan province PCV2 strains from positive samples. Analyses of the complete genomes and Cap genes led to the classification of the 15 Yunnan PCV2 strains into PCV2a (2 of 15), PCV2b (1of 15) and PCV2d (12 of 15). All strains shared 94.3–99.9% of their identities with the nucleotide sequences of complete genomes in this study and shared 94.2–99.9% identity with the reference sequences. All strains share 89.4–100% and 86.8–100% of their identities with the nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequences of Cap, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d genotypes coexisted in Yunnan Province from 2016 to 2019, and the priority prevalence genotype was PCV2d. The data provide evidence for the increased genetic diversity and insights into the molecular epidemiology of PCV2. This study also provides basic data for the Yunnan province PCV2 molecular epidemiological survey and accumulates effective materials for the development of PCV2 vaccines.

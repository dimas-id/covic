Various techniques have been described for blind bedside placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube. However, there is no universal method and the technique depends on the local institutional resources and expertise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a simple new technique for the bedside placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube in an intensive care unit using palpation to confirm tube position. We studied 47 consecutive ventilated patients (mean body mass index 22.4 Â± 4.2 kg/m(2)) requiring enteral tube feeding for nutritional support. We monitored the maximum intensity point of injected air 'bubbling' by palpation and estimated tube position. We monitored the movement of the maximum intensity point from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant. If the maximum intensity point on the right upper quadrant diminished or weakened, we considered the tube had proceeded beyond the pylorus. By palpation, we could feel the bubbling of the injected air in all patients, but four patients were excluded because of failure to complete the protocol. The overall success rate including the four excluded cases was 85.1% (40/47) on the first attempt and 91.5% (43/47) when we included the second attempt. The median time for 40 successful tube placements on the first attempt was 10 (7 to 23) minutes. Our new palpation technique can successfully detect the position of a feeding tube in the stomach and help guide the tube to the correct location in the post-pyloric portion of the stomach in lean critically ill patients.

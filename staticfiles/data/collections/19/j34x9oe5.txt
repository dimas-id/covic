Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are unusual connections between the arterial and venous system that bypass the normal anatomic capillary beds. This case report presents an arteriovenous fistula of the lower extremity caused by a penetrating injury. The patient was diagnosed by Duplex ultrasonography. Diagnostic catheterization of the affected limb showed a high-flow AVF between the left profunda femoris artery and left femoral vein with a deep femoral vein aneurysm measuring 9x4 cm. The AVF was successfully treated with coil embolization.

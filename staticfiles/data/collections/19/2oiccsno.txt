An innovative technique for airway management, using a small-diameter, short-cuffed orotracheal tube for assisting rigid bronchoscopy in critical airway obstruction is reported. The device, part of the translaryngeal tracheostomy kit, "Fantoni method" (DAR TLT, Covidien, Minneapolis, MN), was placed beyond the stenosis and used in combination with the rigid bronchoscope. This procedure improves safety during the management of critical tracheal stenoses because the airway is constantly under the anesthesiologist's control. Consequently, inhalation anesthesia is feasible, use of neuromuscular blockade is possible, end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring is reliable, and the distal airway is protected from blood and debris soilage during tumor debulking. Surgery is faster because it is uninterrupted.

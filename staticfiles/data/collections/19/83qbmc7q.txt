In response to concerns related to privacy in the context of COVID-19, recently European and national Data Protection Authorities (DPA) issued guidelines and recommendations addressing variety of issues related to processing of personal data for preventive purposes. One of the recurring questions in these guidelines related to the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees in reporting, recording and communicating COVID-19 cases in workplace. National Data Protection Authorities in some cases adopted different approaches regarding duties in reporting and communicating the COVID-19 cases, however, they unanimously stressed importance of adopting privacy preserving approaches to avoid raising concerns about surveillance and stigmatization. We stress that in view of increasing use of new data collection and sharing tools such as “tracing and warning” apps, associated privacy related risks should be evaluated on an ongoing manner. In addition, the intricacies of different settings where such apps may be used should be taken into consideration when assessing the associated risks and benefits.

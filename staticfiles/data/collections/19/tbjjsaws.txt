Respiratory specimens collected from outpatients with influenza-like illness in three Canadian provinces (British Columbia (BC), Alberta and Quebec) participating in a community-based sentinel surveillance network were prospectively screened for enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) from 1 August to 31 December 2014 and compared to specimens collected from 1 October 2013 to 31 July 2014. Eighteen (1%) of 1,894 specimens were EV-D68-positive: 1/348 (0.3%) collected from October to December 2013 and 11/460 (2.4%) from October to December 2014, an eight-fold increase in detection rates (p=0.01), consistent with epidemic circulation in autumn 2014. The remaining EV-D68 detections were in September 2014 (6/37). Enhanced passive surveillance was also conducted on all inpatient and outpatient EV-D68 cases (n=211) detected at the BC provincial reference laboratory from 28 August to 31 December 2014. Incidence of hospitalisations was 3/100,000 overall and 21, 17, 4 and 1/100,000 among those<5, 5-9, 10-19 and â‰¥20-years-old with male-to-female ratios>1 among paediatric but not adult cases. Three cases in BC with comorbidity or co-infection died and five exhibited neurological features persisting >9 months. Active surveillance in outpatient and inpatient settings is needed from more areas and additional seasons to better understand EV-D68 epidemiology and potential at-risk groups for severe or unusual manifestations.

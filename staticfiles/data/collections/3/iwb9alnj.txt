Radiation therapy is a standard and effective non-surgical treatment for primary brain tumors and metastases. However, this strategy inevitably results in damage of normal brain tissue, causing severe complications, especially the late-delayed cognitive impairment. Due to the multifactorial and complex pathological effects of radiation, there is a lack of effective preventative and restorative treatments for the irradiated brain. Stem-cell therapy has held considerable promise for decades in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders because of its unique capacity for tissue repair and functional integrity. Currently, there is growing interest in using stem cells as a novel option to attenuate the adverse effects of irradiation. In the present review, we discuss recent studies evaluating stem-cell therapies for the irradiated brain and their therapeutic effects on ameliorating radiation-related brain injury as well as their potential challenges in clinical applications. We discuss these works in context of the pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to CNS tissue in an attempt to elucidate the potential mechanisms of engrafted stem cells to reverse radiation-induced degenerative processes.

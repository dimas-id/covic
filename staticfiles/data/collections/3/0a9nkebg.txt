Both balloon atrial septostomy and static balloon dilation are often ineffective in creating a large atrial septal defect in patients with a thickened atrial septum. In such situations, blade atrial septostomy and atrial septal stenting are alternative treatments. We have devised and performed a new technique, called wire atrial septostomy, which uses a thin soft wire to create a large defect. The details of the procedure are presented.

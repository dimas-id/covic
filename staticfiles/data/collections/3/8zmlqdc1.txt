Abstract An antimicrobial phenolic stilbene, (E)-3-hydroxy-5-methoxystilbene, 1 was recently isolated from the leaves of Comptonia peregrina (L.) Coulter and shown to possess inhibitory activity against several Gram-positive bacteria, including isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and avirulent Bacillus anthracis (Sterne strain), among others. These results prompted the design and synthesis of two new classes of compounds, phenoxystyrenes and phenothiostyrenes, as analogs of the natural antimicrobial stilbene. These and additional stilbenoid analogs were synthesized using new, efficient, copper-mediated coupling strategies. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) antimicrobial assays were performed on all compounds prepared. These preliminary structureâ€“activity relationship studies indicated that both new classes of synthetic analogs, as well as the stilbenes, show promising activity against Gram-positive bacteria when at least one phenolic moiety is present, but not when absent. The potencies of the phenolic phenoxystyrenes and phenothiostyrenes were found to be comparable to those of the phenolic stilbenes tested.

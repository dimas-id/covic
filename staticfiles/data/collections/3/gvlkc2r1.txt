Infectious diarrhea in calves is most commonly associated with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, or some combination of these pathogens. Each of these agents leads to diarrhea through either secretion or malabsorption/maldigestion, though the specific mechanisms and pathways may differ. Specific pharmacologic control and treatment are dependent on gaining a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of these organisms.

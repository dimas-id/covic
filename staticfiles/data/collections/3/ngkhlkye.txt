Herein, we provide a brief synopsis of all manuscripts published in Histochem Cell Biol in the year 2013. For ease of reference, we have divided the manuscripts into the following categories: Advances in Methodologies; Molecules in Health and Disease; Organelles, Subcellular Structures and Compartments; Golgi Apparatus; Intermediate Filaments and Cytoskeleton; Connective Tissue and Extracellular Matrix; Autophagy; Stem Cells; Musculoskeletal System; Respiratory and Cardiovascular Systems; Gastrointestinal Tract; Central Nervous System; Peripheral Nervous System; Excretory Glands; Kidney and Urinary Bladder; and Male and Female Reproductive Systems. We hope that the readership will find this annual journal synopsis of value and serve as a quick, categorized reference guide for “state-of-the-art” manuscripts in the areas of histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and cell biology.

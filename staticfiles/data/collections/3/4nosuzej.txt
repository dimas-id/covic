Human security denotes a human-denominated, as opposed to State, focus for security. It highlights the duality of individual, universal—universalizable—human rights. This duality is central to the notion of human rights tied to human security. The idea of human security beyond borders is fundamentally an exercise in reimagining the traditionally State-based loci of responsibility for those individual but also universal human rights. This chapter introduces the challenges of geopolitical shifts compounded by unprecedented impacts of climate change, migration, and pandemic (potential). It makes a case for rethinking human security of citizens and non-citizens alike—beyond borders.

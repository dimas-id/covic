Abstract The lymphoid, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic lesions of naturally occurring postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) affected pigs have been studied by means of immunohistology. Ten conventionally reared pigs showing acute clinical signs of PMWS were selected from a farm on which animal were seronegative to porcine reproductive and respiratory virus and to Aujeszky’s disease virus. All pigs were positive in tests for porcine circovirus type 2 by ISH and IHC. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to CD3, CD79α, CD45RA (3C3/9), lysozyme, SLA-II-DQ (BL2H5), and MAC387 were used to characterise cells in PMWS lesions. The most relevant changes were reduction or loss of B and T lymphocytes, increased numbers of macrophages, and partial loss and redistribution of antigen presenting cells throughout lymphoid tissues compared to uninfected controls. The characteristics of lymphoid lesions in the present study strongly suggest an immunosuppressive effect of PMWS in affected pigs.

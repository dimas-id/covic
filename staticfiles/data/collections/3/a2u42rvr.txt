Angioplasty with drug-coated balloon (DCB) is an emerging and reliable method for the treatment of femoro-popliteal lesions. We report our experience with the Stellarex™ DCB in the first 50 patients. Methods From July 2015 to November 2017, 50 patients (41 M, 9F), medium age (64 ± 7.4 year) were subject to 33 angioplasties (PTAs) for femoro-popliteal lesions with a paclitaxel-coated balloon (Stellarex™). Based upon clinical data sixteen patients had severe claudication (56% - Rutherford class 3); ten patients suffered from ischemic rest pain (34% - Rutherford class 4); and five presented minor tissue loss (10% - Rutherford class 5). 42% of patients showed femoro-popliteal lesion TASC-II B, and 58% presented lesions pertaining to TASC-II C. Results Immediate technical success was 100% without perioperative complications. Primary patency rate was 94% at twelve months. In three cases restenosis (6%) was detected within a year from procedure, and a further PTA DCB was performed with primary assisted patency rates of 100% at twelve months. Two patients underwent major lower limb amputation. Three patients died during follow-up and one patient was lost at follow-up. Conclusion DCB angioplasty with Stellarex™ is a viable alternative to traditional endovascular procedures proving satisfactory primary patency rates at twelve months. Based on our experience, treatment with DCB is a first choice technique for non-complex de novo lesions of the femoro - popliteal tract.

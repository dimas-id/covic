To evaluate the epidemiology and to investigate the impact of RVI on chronic allograft rejection after pediatric lung transplantation, a retrospective study of pediatric lung transplant recipients from 2002 to 2007 was conducted. Association between RVI and continuous and categorical risk factors was assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact tests, respectively. Association between risk factors and outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Fifty-five subjects were followed for a mean of 674 days (range 14-1790). Twenty-eight (51%) developed 51 RVI at a median of 144 days post-transplant (mean 246; range 1-1276); 41% of infections were diagnosed within 90 days. Twenty-five subjects developed 39 LRI, and eight subjects had 11 URI. Organisms recovered included rhinovirus (n = 14), adenovirus (n = 10), parainfluenza (n = 10), influenza (n = 5), and RSV (n = 4). Three subjects expired secondary to their RVI (two adenovirus, one RSV). Younger age and prior CMV infection were risks for RVI (HR 2.4 95% CI 1.1-5.3 and 17.0; 3.0-96.2, respectively). RVI was not associated with the development of chronic allograft rejection (p = 0.25) or death during the study period. RVI occurs in the majority of pediatric lung transplant recipients, but was not associated with mortality or chronic allograft rejection.

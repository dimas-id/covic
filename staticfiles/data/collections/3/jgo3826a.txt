PURPOSE OF REVIEW To update on the latest developments in sensory changes of female patients with chronic pelvic pain (CPP). CPP is very common, but its pathophysiology is still controversial. Evaluation of pain sensitivity in painful and nonpainful areas is key to understanding the underlying peripheral vs. central contributions to the symptom. This in turn is fundamental to improving the treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS We reviewed the experimental studies published over the last year on pain thresholds to different stimuli measured at both the somatic and visceral level in women with different forms of recurrent or CPP. The majority of the studies indicate a pain threshold decrease to most stimuli in skin, subcutis and muscle in painful pelvic areas, the site of referred pain from pelvic viscera, as well as a decreased pain threshold in most viscera (colon and urinary bladder). A significant threshold decrease is also found in deep somatic tissues (subcutis and muscle) outside the painful zone in the most severe cases, indicating a state of central sensitization. SUMMARY These findings have important implications for clinical practice: pain threshold measurement in both painful and nonpainful sites could have important predictive value of the clinical evolution and response to therapy of CPP.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and consequent social distancing practices have disrupted essential clinical research functions worldwide. Ironically, this coincides with an immediate need for research to comprehend the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the pathology of COVID-19. As the global crisis has already led to over 15,000 deaths out of 175,000 confirmed cases in New York City and Nassau County, NY alone, it is increasingly urgent to collect patient biospecimens linked to active clinical follow up. However, building a COVID-19 biorepository amidst the active pandemic is a complex and delicate task. To help facilitate rapid, robust, and regulated research on this novel virus, we report on the successful model implemented by New York University Langone Health (NYULH) within days of outbreak in the most challenging hot spot of infection globally. Using an amended institutional biobanking protocol, these efforts led to accrual of 11,120 patients presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing, 4267 (38.4%) of whom tested positive for COVID-19. The recently reported genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York City Region, which is a crucial development in tracing sources of infection and asymptomatic spread of the novel virus, is the first outcome of this effort. While this growing resource actively supports studies of the New York outbreak in real time, a worldwide effort is necessary to build a collective arsenal of research tools to deal with the global crisis now, and to exploit the virus's biology for translational innovation that outlasts humanity's current dilemma.

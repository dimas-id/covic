The purpose of this review is to summarize bacterial, fungal, protozoan, and viral causes of reproductive dysgenesis in cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, dogs, and cats. The clinical presentations of disease due to reproductive pathogens are emphasized, with a focus on assisting development of complete lists of causes that result in abortion and infertility in these species. Clinicians are encouraged to assess clinical presentation, create complete lists of differential diagnoses, obtain appropriate diagnostic samples, maximize diagnostic laboratory support, and avoid zoonotic infections resulting from reproductive pathogens of animals. The foundation of an accurate diagnosis of reproductive loss due to infectious pathogens facilitates the prudent use of immunization and biosecurity to minimize reproductive losses.

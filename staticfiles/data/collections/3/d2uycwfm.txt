COVID-19 will be with us through the remainder of 2020 and almost certainly beyond. New Zealand needs a viable strategy to protect its populace until a vaccine is developed and in wide use. Until that time, it makes sense to protect the population by putting in place treatments that will be safe and effective, such as the use of convalescent sera and the use of direct-acting anti-virals. These treatments should be sourced externally or made locally, but steps in this direction must now begin as the lockdown ends. New Zealand has the scientists, the facilities and the will to make this happen, but the support of the government and the population will be needed if this plan is to succeed.

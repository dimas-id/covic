Background: The Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics) was developed to provide an accurate and reliable method for the detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Methods: The performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was assessed at Roche Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). Sensitivity was evaluated using anonymised residual frozen samples from patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); one or more consecutive samples were collected from patients at various timepoints after PCR confirmation. Specificity was evaluated using anonymised unselected residual frozen samples from routine diagnostic testing or from blood donors; all samples were collected before December 2019 and thus deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cross-reactivity was evaluated using anonymised frozen samples containing a wide range of potentially cross-reacting analytes, which were purchased from commercial vendors. For sensitivity and specificity, point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 496 samples from 102 patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99.5% (95% CI 97.0-100.0) at [≥]14 days after PCR confirmation. Overall specificity in 10,453 samples from routine diagnostic testing (n = 6305) and blood donors (n = 4148) was 99.80% (95% CI 99.69-99.88). Only 4/752 samples containing potential cross-reacting analytes were reactive with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, resulting in an overall specificity in this cohort of 99.5% (95% CI 98.6-99.9). Conclusion: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.5% at [≥]14 days after PCR confirmation and a very high specificity of 99.80%. Our findings support the use of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as a tool for the identification of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in populations with a low disease prevalence.

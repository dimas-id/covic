Abstract Procedures for synthesizing Î±-amino acids on a chip for coordination with transitional metal ions and a His-Tagged protein have been successfully developed as a stable protein microarray. Using the recombinant His-Tagged 3CL-protease (3CLpro) as a model for attachment to chips containing d-/l-Glu, Asp, Orn, Ser via different transitional metal ions, it was found that the Orn chip was the best of affinity binding and stability by which Zn2+ was the best metal ion for affinity while Co2+ was the best metal ion for stability. Thus, this protein microarray can be alternatively used as a high throughput screening method for rapid detection against SARS CoV 3CLpro and/or efficient purification of other Tagged proteins.

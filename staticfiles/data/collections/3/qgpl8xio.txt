Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction test-system with fluorescent detection (RT-PCR) for simultaneous identification of main agents of acute respiratory viral infections: influenza A (IAV) and B viruses (IBV), parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, 3, 4 (PIV 1 - 4), adenoviruses (ADV), respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses (RV) and enteroviruses (EV), in presence internal positive control (IPC) represented by vaccine strain of rubella virus RA 27/3. Using multiplex RT-PCR method, respiratory viruses were detected in 116 out of 226 clinical samples (nasal swabs) obtained from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection: in 68 (58.6%) samples--IBV; in 21 (18.1%)--IAV; in 12 (10.3%) --RV; in 6 (5.2%)--PIV 2; in 4--(3.4%) ADV; in 3 (2.6%)--RSV; in 2 (1.7%)--EV; in 2 (1.7%)--PIV 4; in 1 (0.9%)--PIV 3; in 1 (0.9%)--PIV 1. Mixed infection was observed in 4 (3.4%) patients. PCR assay allowed to reveal various respiratory viruses in 51.3% of samples. At the same time samples were tested for the presence of 12 respiratory viruses--IAV, IBV, PIV 1 - 4, RSV, RV, metapneumoviruses, and coronaviruses NL63, 229E and OC43--in the presence of IPC represented by equine arteritis virus using analogous PCR test-system provided by medical center of Leiden university. Results of tests for detection of IAV, IBV, RSV, PIV 1 - 4, and RV, analyzed by both systems, agreed in 94%. Multiplex format of RT-PCR performing significantly reduces time and cost of the test, which make it suitable and effective instrument of epidemiological studies.

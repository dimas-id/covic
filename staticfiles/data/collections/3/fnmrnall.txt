Supraglottic airway devices (SGAs) offer certain advantages over endotracheal intubation, making them particularly well suited for the specific demands of outpatient anesthesia. Patients may tolerate the placement and maintenance of an SGA at a lower dose of anesthetic than that needed for an endotracheal tube; neuromuscular blocking agents are rarely necessary for airway management with an SGA; the incidence of airway morbidity is lower with SGAs than with endotracheal tubes; and SGAs may facilitate faster recovery and earlier discharge of patients. Two limitations of SGAs are incomplete protection against aspiration of gastric contents and inadequate delivery of positive pressure ventilation. Newer variants of the original laryngeal mask airway, the LMA Classic (LMA North America, Inc), as well as an array of other recently developed SGAs, aim to address these limitations. Their utility and safety in specific patient populations (eg, the morbidly obese) and during certain procedures (eg, laparoscopic surgery) remain to be determined.

BACKGROUND: Severe blunt chest injury sometimes induces acute respiratory failure (ARF), requiring ventilator use. We aimed to evaluate the effect of performing rib fixation with the addition of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) on patients with ARF caused by blunt thoracic injury with ventilator dependence. METHODS: This observational study prospectively enrolled patients with multiple bicortical rib fractures with hemothorax caused by severe blunt chest trauma. All patients received positive pressure mechanical ventilation within 24 h after trauma because of ARF. Some patients who received rib fixation with VATS were enrolled as group 1, and the others who received only VATS were designated as group 2. The length of ventilator use was the primary clinical outcome. Rates of pneumonia and length of hospital stay constituted secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included in this study. The basic demographic characteristics between the two groups exhibited no statistical differences. All patients received operations within 6 days after trauma. The length of ventilator use was shorter in group 1 (3.19 ± 3.37 days vs. 8.05 ± 8.23, P = 0.002). The rate of pneumonia was higher in group 2 (38.1% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.005). The length of hospital stay was much shorter in group 1 (17.76 ± 8.38 days vs. 24.13 ± 9.80, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Rib fixation combined with VATS could shorten the length of ventilator use and reduce the pneumonia rate in patients with severe chest blunt injury with ARF. Therefore, this operation could shorten the overall length of hospital stay.

Abstract The conduct of blood donation drives became difficult amid novel coronavirus disease pandemic and national lockdown. Despite no restriction for the outdoor blood donation drives, voluntary blood donor organizations (VBDOs) and individual donors became apprehensive regarding the possible risk of spread of the infection during blood donation. Various confidence-building measures were taken to decrease this hesitation. Numerous preventive measures were taken at the blood bank and at the donation venue to limit the possible risk of the spread of infection. With the help of these measures, the confidence of the individual blood donors and the VBDOs was restored and multiple blood drives were organized.

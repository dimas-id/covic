The ultrasonographic findings for four cats with intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy are described. In two cats, intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy was associated with chronic enteritis. In the remaining two cats, intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy affected the intestinal tract proximal to stenosis due to alimentary lymphoma and an intestinal foreign body, respectively. Moderate increased thickness of the affected intestinal wall, measuring 7–8 mm, was evident on abdominal ultrasonographic examination of all subjects. In addition, the ultrasonographic five‐layered feature of the intestinal wall was maintained, and only the muscular layer appeared thickened. Abdominal ultrasound allowed a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy that was confirmed histologically in all cats.

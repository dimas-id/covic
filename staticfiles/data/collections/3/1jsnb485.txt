Background. In the light of recent outbreak of COVID19 Pandemic for which is there no specific treatment, prevention and awareness is the only key to overcome an adversity of such magnitude. Thus, we aimed to understand the knowledge, attitude and practices of undergraduate medical students pertaining to infection with the COVID19. Methods. An electronic survey developed using an online cloud-based website (Survey Monkey) was served to undergraduate medical students. Participants had a week to voluntarily complete the 8 minute long questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and figures were obtained from surveymonkey.com. Results. Of 2507 invitees across six medical colleges in India, 616 (24.6%) responded. Most undergraduates (age 21.5 years, 46.1% males) were undergoing internship (16.7%) or final year undergraduate training (54.1%). Knowledge regarding viral transmission, clinical-radiologic features, laboratory diagnosis and treatment was adequate among most students (Fig 1). However, the understanding of the incubation period and time to symptoms was less than satisfactory (Supplementary Table 1). Nearly three-fourths 461 (74.8%) were aware of the COVID-19 specific precautions. While their universities had advised most regarding hand hygiene, social distancing, symptom identification, and high-risk groups, fewer were advised to avoid staying back in hostels or drug prevention. Nearly 70% were reluctant to attend clinics from fear of getting infected or passing on to others. Most students read about COVID-19 regularly, and social media accounts of medical journals were the primary 78.9% source. Conclusion. Most medical students are aware of the basics of COVID19 infection and act as a potential reservoir to fill the gaps in Healthcare services should the need arise.

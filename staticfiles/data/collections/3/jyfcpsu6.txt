SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the host-cells by binding the transmembraneous angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) when causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in COVID-19 is debated. Several well-conducted observational studies show no increased risk from RAAS blockade in COVID-19 patients and are detailed in this brief review. The Swedish Society of Hypertension, Stroke and Vascular Medicine supports current recommendations that ongoing RAAS blockade should be maintained in patients with COVID-19.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Spinal anesthesia (SPA) has not been popular for day-case surgery because of prolonged neurologic blockade with long-acting local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, thereby delaying discharge. Although the intermediate duration of action of lidocaine and mepivacaine appears to be more suitable for day-case surgery, their use is not deemed appropriate by many because of a high incidence of transient neurologic symptoms (TNSs). The present review summarizes recent clinical data on the intrathecal use of alternative local anesthetics and adjuvants that may offer valuable alternatives to general anesthesia in day-case surgery. RECENT FINDINGS Prilocaine has a similar intrathecal pharmacokinetic profile as lidocaine but with a significantly lower risk of TNSs. Onset of spinal after 2-chloroprocaine is comparable with lidocaine or prilocaine, but with a considerably shorter duration of action. Also, TNS is clearly less frequent compared with lidocaine. Although its intrathecal use has recently been approved in Europe, this is still considered to be off-label in the USA. Articaine provides an extraordinary fast onset and a short duration of spinal block, the latter being approximately intermediate between chloroprocaine and prilocaine. However, articaine is associated with a high risk for intraoperative hypotension and a small risk for TNS, albeit but less frequent than after lidocaine. Concerns regarding possible neurotoxicity of articaine remain to be resolved. SUMMARY SPA for day cases might become a most valuable method for ambulatory surgery when using short acting local anesthetics. This, however, not only depends on drugs being used but also on infrastructure (post anaesthesia care unit) and organizational issues.

Despite the first application of gene therapy in 1990, gene therapy has until recently failed to meet the huge expectations set forth by researchers, clinicians, and patients, thus dampening enthusiasm for an imminent cure for many life-threatening genetic diseases.

In this review, various gene therapy vectors progressing into clinical development and pivotal advances in gene therapy trials will be discussed.

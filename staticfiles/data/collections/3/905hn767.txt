Abstract This study examines how financial contagion occurs through financial and nonfinancial firms between China and G7 countries during the COVIDâ€“19 period. The empirical results show that listed firms across these countries, financial and non-financial firms alike, experience significant increase in conditional correlations between their stock returns. However, the magnitude of increase in these correlations is considerably higher for financial firms during the COVID-19 outbreak, indicating the importance of their role in financial contagion transmission. They also show that optimal hedge ratios increase significantly in most cases, implying higher hedging costs during the COVID-19 period.

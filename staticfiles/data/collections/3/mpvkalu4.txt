The chapter draws parallels and contrasts between the study of health in North American and other industrialized countries and health of people living in developing countries, which comprise 80% of the world’s population. Lessons are provided for three common health problems where psychologists play a major role within multidisciplinary teams. The lessons use published journal articles, web sites of international organizations, and the author’s personal experiences living and working in developing countries. One topic concerns the large number of women who unnecessarily die in childbirth and the non-medical reasons. The second is environmental health, which includes sources of clean water, waste disposal, and personal hygiene. Solving this problem requires behavior change. The third concerns child hunger and its disabling effects on cognitive development. The focus of this chapter is on examining the health problem within context and identifying solutions that work and do not work. Background is provided for the novice, so students learn the larger picture into which these issues fit, and how to apply the same analysis to other health problems.

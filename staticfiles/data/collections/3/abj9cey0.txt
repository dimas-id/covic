BACKGROUND Patients with hepatocellular adenomas are, in selected cases, candidates for liver resection, which can be approached via laparoscopy or laparotomy. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the surgical approach on the postoperative morbidities of both minor and major liver resections. METHODS In this multi-institutional study, all patients who underwent open or laparoscopic hepatectomies for hepatocellular adenomas between 1989 and 2013 in 27 European centers were retrospectively reviewed. A multiple imputation model was constructed to manage missing variables. Comparisons of both the overall rate and the types of complications between open and laparoscopic hepatectomy were performed after propensity score adjustment (via the standardized mortality ratio weighting method) on the factors that influenced the choice of the surgical approach. RESULTS The laparoscopic approach was selected in 208 (38%) of the 533 included patients. There were 194 (93%) women. The median age was 38.9 years. After the application of multiple imputation, 208 patients who underwent laparoscopic operations were compared with 216 patients who underwent laparotomic operations. After adjustment, there were 20 (9.6%) major liver resections in the laparoscopy group and 17 (7.9%) in the open group. The conversion rate was 6.3%. The two surgical approaches exhibited similar postoperative morbidity rates and severities. Laparoscopic resection was associated with significantly less blood loss (93 vs. 196 ml, p < 0.001), a less frequent need for pedicle clamping (21 vs. 40%, p = 0.002), a reduced need for transfusion (8 vs. 24 red blood cells units, p < 0.001), and a shorter hospital stay (5 vs. 7 days, p < 0.001). The mortality was nil. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopy can achieve short-term outcomes similar to those of open surgery for hepatocellular adenomas and has the additional benefits of a reduced blood loss, need for transfusion, and a shorter hospital stay.

Allogeneic transplantation of human cancellous and cortical bone is a controversially discussed concept in trauma and orthopaedic surgery. Biological and immunological arguments support transplantation of autologous material whenever this is technically possible. On the other hand, synthetic alloplastic materials for bone substitution are available free of immunological and hygienic hazards. In this context the value of allogeneic bone grafts is discussed, especially considering the problem of AIDS. If autologous corticospongious bone is to be used its supply is limited. On the other hand, alloplastic synthetic artificial bone does not meet all the requirements demanded for substitution of large osseous defects up to now. The problems of geometric and mechanical stability of these alloplastic materials still remain. Therefore, no alternative to allografting of large, stable, corticospongious fragments exists in some cases. Bone transplantation is performed without vital indication in nearly every case. Thus an optimum of hygienic security has to be claimed for recipients of allogeneic bone. The “Munich model” for bone transplantation is presented and discussed.

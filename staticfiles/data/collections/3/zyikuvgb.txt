BACKGROUND Varicose veins are common and frequently cause patient distress. In recent years, Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to traditional open venous ligation surgery. AIMS The aim of this study was to directly compare RFA and open saphenofemoral ligation. METHODS This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients undergoing surgical management over a 2-year period commencing from January 2011 were studied. Radiological success, peri-operative serological testing and hospital length of stay were documented. Procedural cost was calculated. A focused cohort analysis was undertaken to compare the initial 50 RFA procedures performed with the last 50. RESULTS During the study period, 296 patients underwent surgical intervention. A total of 204 patients underwent RFA. Sixty-six percent of all patients were female. RFA was associated with a reduction in overnight hospital stay (18 vs. 78 %, P = <0.001) when compared with open ligation with a success rate of 98 %. No significant inter-group difference was noted for 30-day readmission (p = 0.203). Focused cohort analysis identified an increase in hospital day case activity (74 vs. 90 %, p = 0.002), which contributed to a reduction in procedural cost (€1,024 vs. €971, p = 0.003) over the study period. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation is a viable alternative to open repair offering excellent efficacy. It is however associated with a higher procedural cost than the open surgical option.

Most of the SARS‐CoV‐infected patients spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention while a small percentage succumbed to the disease. Here, we characterized temporal changes in N protein‐specific and S glycoprotein‐specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in infected patients who have either recovered from or succumbed to SARS‐CoV infection. Recovered patients were found to have higher and sustainable levels of both N protein‐specific and S glycoprotein‐specific Nab responses, suggesting that antibody responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS‐CoV‐infected patients.

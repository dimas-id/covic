We read with interest the article by Taxonera et al outlining a high incidence of diarrhoea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19).[1] The relationship between these symptoms and faecal calprotectin would be interesting to note. In patients without IBD and COVID‐19, faecal calprotectin was noted to be higher in patients with continuing than resolved diarrhoea, suggesting intestinal inflammation due to COVID‐19.[2]

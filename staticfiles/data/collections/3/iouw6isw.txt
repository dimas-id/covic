Surgery creates most hospital infections, injuries, accidents, invalidity and death in the global healthcare system. The number of surgically treated patients per year is high and increasing. Surgical site infection (SSI) is dependent on type of operation and may occur in 5–20% after surgery, triggers 7–11 extra postoperative days in hospitals and results in 2–11 times higher risk of death than comparable, noninfected patients. Up to 60% of SSI can be prevented. Prevention of postoperative wound infection is done by good general hygiene, operative sterility and effective barriers against transmission of infections, before, during and after surgery. A basic support by hospital leaders, knowledge and skill of the surgical teams, enough resources, excellent treatment of the complete patient admission and monitoring patients after discharge may lead to significant reduction of SSIs, lower death rates and a less expensive health system.

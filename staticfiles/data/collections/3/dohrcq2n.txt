INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of the occlusal support, and mandibular third molars on mandibular angle and condylar fractures. METHOD AND RESULTS: Patients with unilateral and isolated angle or condylar fractures were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional study. Data was collected from patient records and panoramic x-rays. The predictor variables included the type of occlusal support and the presence or absence of third molars. The outcome variable was angle or condylar fracture, while other predictor variables included demographic factors. Bivariate (&#967;2 test) and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between variables and the outcome. 43 angle (mean age: 29.9 ± 12.8 years; 98.4% male) and 37 condylar (mean age: 46.8 ± 20.2 years; 62.2% male) fracture cases were included in this study. Bilateral occlusal support was present in 81.4% of angle fracture group and in 51.3% of condylar fracture group (p<0.001). In the case of bilateral occlusal support, an odds ratio (OR) of 4.2 was found for angle fractures (p<0.006). A third molar was present in 86% of the angle fracture group and in 43.2% of the condylar fracture group (p<0.001). The presence of a third molar exhibited an odds ratio of 8.1 for the angle fractures (p<0.001). When bilateral occlusal support and third molar were present simultaneously, the risk was 15.9 times higher for an angle fracture (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The presence of occlusal support and/or third molars was significantly associated with angle fractures, however, the absence of occlusal support and/or third molars significantly correlated with condylar fractures.

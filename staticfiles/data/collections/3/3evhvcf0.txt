Enveloped viruses infect host cells by a membrane fusion reaction that takes place at the cell surface or in intracellular compartments following virus uptake. Fusion is mediated by the membrane interactions and conformational changes of specialized virus envelope proteins termed membrane fusion proteins. This article discusses the structures and refolding reactions of specific fusion proteins and the methods for their study and highlights outstanding questions in the field.

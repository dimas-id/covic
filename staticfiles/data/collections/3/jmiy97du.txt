SUMMARY: iBioProVis is an interactive tool for visual analysis of the compound bioactivity space in the context of target proteins, drugs, and drug candidate compounds. iBioProVis tool takes target protein identifiers and, optionally, compound SMILES as input, and uses the state-of-the-art non-linear dimensionality reduction method t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to plot the distribution of compounds embedded in a 2-D map, based on the similarity of structural properties of compounds and in the context of compounds' cognate targets. Similar compounds, which are embedded to proximate points on the 2-D map, may bind the same or similar target proteins. Thus, iBioProVis can be used to easily observe the structural distribution of one or two target proteins' known ligands on the 2-D compound space, and to infer new binders to the same protein, or to infer new potential target(s) for a compound of interest, based on this distribution. Principal component analysis (PCA) projection of the input compounds is also provided, Hence the user can interactively observe the same compound or a group of selected compounds which is projected by both PCA and embedded by t-SNE. iBioProVis also provides detailed information about drugs and drug candidate compounds through cross-references to widely used and well-known databases, in the form of linked table views. Two use-case studies were demonstrated, one being on ACE2 protein which is SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor. ACE2 binding compounds and 7 antiviral drugs were closely embedded in which two of them have been under clinical trial for COVID-19. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: iBioProVis and its carefully filtered dataset are available at https://ibpv.kansil.org/ for public use. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

We report the case of a young patient diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 with a history of hypertension. The patient improved after antiviral treatment but eventually developed severe respiratory distress syndrome and cardiac insufficiency. His respiratory secretions were tested for nucleic acids and turn negative twice. Computed tomography image of the patient showed evidence of viral pneumonia on the 11(th) day of onset and continued to worsen. The patient was finally intubated and transferred to a higher-level care center for further treatment. We were very focused on infectious disease protection throughout the treatment, however, suboptimal treatment was provided due to the switch in antihypertensive medication, lack of early nutritional support, and fluid restriction management.

Preparing for mass casualty incidents is essential to maximizing community resilience. Many US-based organizations and regions have developed stockpiles of medications, supplies, and equipment for mass casualty incident preparedness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assess and manage federally stockpiled materials, but hospitals, healthcare systems, and regional organizations are responsible for maintaining locally owned caches. The CDC has protocols for assessing and managing the Strategic National Stockpile, but no such guidance exists for local or geographical/regional stockpiles. This article outlines best practices and recommendations identified in the literature related to maintaining and sustaining a local or regional stockpile. Recommendations are provided on the timing and procedures for assessing, inventorying, storing, managing, tracking, and deploying materials stockpiled on site, in a trailer, or in a warehouse. In addition, alternative approaches for maintaining a local or regional cache, such as vendor- or user-managed inventory methods, are addressed. Management of local or regional caches requires an investment in infrastructure and training but is necessary to ensure the integrity of stockpiled medication and supplies and to enable rapid and appropriate activation during a mass casualty incident. Hospitals, healthcare systems, businesses, academic institutions, public health agencies, organizations, and regions can use the recommendations here to develop protocols or policies to properly manage their existing stockpiles, which should minimize costs related to damaged supplies.

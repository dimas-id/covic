Abstract Since the first cases were detected in China in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly, collapsing many healthcare systems, and forcing them to adapt. Hand surgery has been indirectly affected by this scenario. This article aims to provide an overview on how Spanish hand surgeons have modified their daily practice. Based on a survey conducted nationwide, we observed a decrease in the number of emergency cases and cancellation of elective cases, shift to a more conservative treatment approach, use of personal protective equipment, and decrease in the number of outpatient visits and tests. Without definitive evidence at this point, knowing how we have dealt with the situation so far will help us adopt the needed measures to ensure both the patient’s and surgeon’s safety and manage available resources in future pandemics.

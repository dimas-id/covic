Objective: Due to the circumstances where people being required to home quarantine and eye hospitals being unable to receive patient normally, The application of internet plus technology is explored to build Remote Dedicated Doctor Platform of Ophthalmology (RDDPO) for online consultation, accessing to medication, medical services and advises orderly, and to help to further develop and apply the platform. Methods: In 2018, RDDPO was jointly developed.It has been modified and improved to the formulation of national medical policy and medical insurance policy and the outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, and it has been carried out comprehensive application verification during the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.With a B/S structure, platform docks the official accounts of Wechat platform.On the server side, three J2EE frameworks of the integrated development, including Struts2, Spring and Hibernate are adopted; on the mobile client side, a combination of development tools including React-Native and Redux is used.Meanwhile, a micro-services Architecture (msA) of RESTful WebAPI is chosen at the business logic layer.The terminal data information is used to summarize the results of the platform's functional services for ophthalmic patients, such as remote diagnosis and treatment, online prescription, medicine delivery and health education, etc., and to make statistics on all kinds of data during the epidemic prevention and control period, so as to verify the operations management capabilities of the platform's functions. Results: During the period of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, the number of monthly visits of RDDPO increased from 1063 person times from September 1, 2019 to the end of September to 30 002 person times from February 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020.The proportion of diagnosis and treatment person times of this platform in the total number of diagnosis and treatment person times increased from 19.1% (203/1 063) to 92.3% (277/3 002), which can effectively avoid the risk of personal contact infection and meet the patients' medical needs.95.8% of the patients were very satisfied.95.8% of the patients were very satisfied. Conclusions: The RDDPO establishes a channel for doctor-patient communication during the epidemic, which can be considered as an important way to effectively address the needs of patients for medical treatment.

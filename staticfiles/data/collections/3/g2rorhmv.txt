INTRODUCTION Timely recanalization during endovascular procedures for acute ischemic stroke can be challenging in cases with large clot burden, such as those encountered in the terminal internal carotid T- or L-type occlusion. METHODS A novel but simple technique to achieve fast reduction in clot burden in stroke patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery termination is described where manual suction using a 60-ml syringe applied through an 8-F balloon guide catheter positioned in the cervical carotid vasculature with proximal flow arrest allows subsequent revascularization of the residual middle cerebral artery clot. RESULTS The use of manual suction through a balloon-tipped guide catheter in internal carotid artery L- or T-type occlusion is illustrated. This resulted in a significant reduction of the clot burden and facilitated further interventions leading to full recanalization. CONCLUSION Manual suction using a 60-ml syringe through a balloon guide catheter is a useful and feasible technique that facilitates thrombectomy of large burden cerebral clots.

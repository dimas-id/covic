Abstract With the profound changes in the international security situation, the progression of globalization, and the continuous advancement of biotechnology, the risks and challenges posed by major infectious diseases and bioterrorism to the international community are also increasing. Biosafety, therefore, presents new opportunities for international cooperation and global governance. The world has become more integrated and now shares a common destiny in terms of biosafety. In the face of the current risks and challenges, the international community must work together to avert threats, advance mutual interests, and safeguard global biosecurity. In the context of the current situation regarding biosafety and biosecurity, we conducted the present analysis, and present here some appropriate countermeasures.

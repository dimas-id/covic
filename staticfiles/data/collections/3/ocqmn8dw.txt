This article reviews diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal diseases in guinea pigs and rabbits. The review includes established causes of gastrointestinal disease in these species. The authors highlight syndromes that may be considered emerging or less-recognized causes of gastrointestinal stasis, including gastric dilation and volvulus in guinea pigs and lead toxicity, colonic entrapment, and liver torsion in rabbits. Practitioners should recommend initial diagnostics, including radiographs and blood work on guinea pigs and rabbits presenting with nonspecific signs of gastrointestinal stasis, to better determine possible cause and make the best treatment recommendations.

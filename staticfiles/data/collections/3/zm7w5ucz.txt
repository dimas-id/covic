OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to compare the short-term rate of mesh exposure after a robotic sacrocolpopexy (RSCP) compared with those after RSCP with a concomitant hysterectomy. Secondary objectives included a comparison of mesh exposure from total hysterectomies (TH) versus supracervical hysterectomies (SCH) and determination of risk factors for mesh exposure. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent RSCP between January 2009 and December 2011 at one academic center. The primary outcome was mesh exposure at 6 weeks postoperation. Subjects were divided into two groups: those with concomitant hysterectomy and those with RSCP alone. The hysterectomy group was subdivided into TH versus SCH. Mesh exposures and mesh revision procedures were identified using International Classification of Diseases-9 and CPT codes, respectively, and confirmed by chart review. RESULTS There were 230 eligible women who underwent RSCP during the study period and were followed up at a 6-week postoperative visit; 118 (51.7%) had RSCP only and 112 (48.7%) had a concomitant hysterectomy. Of those who underwent hysterectomy, 79 patients (70.5%) had TH and 33 (29.5%) had SCH. There were nine (3.9%) mesh exposures attributed to RSCP. The difference between the RSCP + hysterectomy group and the RSCP-only group was 2.7% versus 5.1% (P = 0.50). The 2.7% of mesh exposures in the hysterectomy group were associated with TH and none with SCH, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS Although mesh exposure with RSCP is low, serious morbidity can be associated with mesh use and appropriate preoperative counseling is critical.

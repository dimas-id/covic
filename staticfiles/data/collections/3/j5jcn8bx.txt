Viral aerosol infection through cough generates large amounts of viral aerosol and can result in many adverse health effects such as influenza flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To characterize the coughed viral aerosol, the sampler needs to sample at higher flow rate and possess high physical collection efficiency as well as high viral preservation. However, most current inertia-based high flow bioaerosol samplers are not suited for viral aerosol sampling since the viability will be lost doing the sampling process. Current condensation growth methods only have good physical collection efficiency and viral preservation at low flow rate (< 10 LPM). In this study, we developed a viral aerosol sampling system using a cooler and steam-jet aerosol collector (SJAC) for bioaerosol collection for the first time. The system is based on mixing condensation growth method and has high viral preservation at a higher flow rate (12.5 LPM). We control the inlet aerosol flow temperature and the SJAC mixing reservoir temperature to improve the physical collection efficiency and viability preservation of the viral aerosol. Results indicate that the physical collection efficiency is 70–99% for aerosol 30–100 nm when the aerosol flow and mixing reservoir temperature was 19 and 50 °C, respectively. In addition, the system was 7 and 22 times more efficient for viability preservation of MS2 bacteriophage than the commonly used All Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) and BioSampler®, respectively. Finally, the system can be applied to sample at a lower concentration (10(5) PFU/m(3)), and results shows the system was 4.7 times more efficient for viability preservation than using AGI-30 alone. The developed viral collection system will improve our understanding of the characteristics of coughed aerosol and can be used for future evaluation of respiratory protective equipment and environmental sampling.

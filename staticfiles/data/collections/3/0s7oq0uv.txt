The mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome during the spread of COVID-19 have been unclear. In 788 COVID-19 patients from Zhejiang province, we observed decreased rate of severe/critical cases, increased liver/kidney damage, and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity, compared with patients in Wuhan, China. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we isolated one strain of SARS-CoV-2 (ZJ01) from a mild COVID-19 patient. Thirty-five specific gene mutations were identified by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and relative synonymous codon usage heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 virus strains collected globally based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 has T at both sites and is currently the only known TT type. The prediction of the Furin cleavage site (FCS) and sequence alignment of the virus family indicated that the FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 mutations identified near the FCS (F1-2) caused changes in the structure and electrostatic distribution of the S surface protein, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single-cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that the Furin expression was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidneys, and colon. Thus, FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused mild flu-like symptoms, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.

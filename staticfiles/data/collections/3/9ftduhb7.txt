Abstract The innate immune response is the first line of defence against viruses, involving the production of type I IFN (IFN-α/β) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that control the infection. It also shapes the adaptive immune response generated by both T and B cells. Production of type I IFN occurs both in vivo and in vitro in response to Bluetongue virus (BTV), an arthropod-borne virus. However, the mechanisms responsible for the production of IFN-β in response to BTV remained unknown until recently and are still not completely understood. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the identification of cellular sensors and signalling pathways involved in this process. The RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) were shown to be involved in the expression of IFN-β as well as in the control of BTV infection in non-haematopoietic cells. In contrast, induction of IFN-α/β synthesis in sheep primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) required the MyD88 adaptor independently of the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), as well as the kinases dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). As type I IFN is essential for the establishment of an antiviral cellular response, most of viruses have elaborated counteracting mechanisms to hinder its action. This review also addresses the ability of BTV to interfere with IFN-β synthesis and the recent findings describing the non-structural viral protein NS3 as a powerful antagonist of the host cellular response.

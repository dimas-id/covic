OBJECTIVES Optimal management of colon cancer (CC) requires detailed assessment of extent of disease. This study prospectively investigates the diagnostic accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for staging and detection of recurrence in primary CC. MATERIAL AND METHODS PET/CT for preoperative staging was performed in 66 prospectively included patients with primary CC. Diagnostic accuracy for PET/CT and CT was analyzed. In addition to routine follow up, 42 stages I-III CC patients had postoperative PET/CT examinations every 6 months for 2 years. Serological levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), carcinoembryonic antigen, and liberated domain I of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor were analyzed. RESULTS Accuracy for tumor, nodal, and metastases staging by PET/CT were 82% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 70; 91), 66% (CI: 51; 78), and 89% (CI: 79; 96); for CT the accuracy was 77% (CI: 64; 87), 60% (CI: 46; 73), and 69% (CI: 57; 80). Cumulative relapse incidences for stages I-III CC at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were 7.1% (CI: 0; 15); 14.3% (CI: 4; 25); 19% (CI: 7; 31), and 21.4% (CI: 9; 34). PET/CT diagnosed all relapses detected during the first 2 years. High preoperative TIMP-1 levels were associated with significant hazards toward risk of recurrence and shorter overall survival. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates PET/CT as a valuable tool for staging and follow up in CC. TIMP-1 provided prognostic information potentially useful in selection of patients for intensive follow up.

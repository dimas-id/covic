ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) related severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can lead to acute cor pulmonale (ACP). We report a case of ACP secondary to severe Covid-19 ARDS diagnosed with transesophageal echocardiography. Almitrine infusion allowed rapid enhancement of RV function as well as improvement in oxygenation.

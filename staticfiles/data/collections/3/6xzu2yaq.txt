Renal denervation which consists in the ablation of the sympathetic fibers located in the adventitia of renal arteries is a therapeutic strategy allowing improved arterial hypertension control in patients who do not respond to medical treatment. This technique is currently performed using the femoral approach in the majority of cases. The diameter and the length of the ablation catheters limit their use via the radial route. The most frequent peri-procedural complications are vascular problems. We report here two cases of renal denervation via the trans-humeral and trans-radial routes respectively.

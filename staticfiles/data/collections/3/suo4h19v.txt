ABSTRACT Data visualization is an important tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, and specially in epidemiological surveillance. The COVID19-Tracker web application systematically produces daily updated data visualization and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain. It collects automatically daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases and mortality, from February 24th, 2020 onwards. Three applications have already been developed: 1) to analyze data trends and estimating short-term projections; 2) to estimate the case fatality rate; and 3) to assess the effect of the lockdowns on the data trends. The application may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data in Spain.

BACKGROUND To compare the therapeutic value of a bronchial blocker (BB) with a double-lumen tube (DLT) in minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS). METHODS Sixty patients who underwent MICS were randomized to use either a DLT (Group D, n = 30) or a BB (Group B, n = 29; one failed was omitted). The following data were collected: time of intubation and tube localization; incidence of tube displacement; postoperative sore throat and hoarseness; time of cardiopulmonary bypass; maintenance time for SpO2 < 90% (PaCO2 < 60 mmHg); mean arterial pressure and heart rate; SpO2, PaO2, PaCO2, EtCO2, mean airway pressure, and airway peak pressure; surgeons' satisfaction with anesthesia; and short-term complications. RESULTS The times of intubation and tube localization were significantly longer in Group B than in Group D (P < 0.05). Patients in Group B exhibited significantly lower incidence of tube displacement, postoperative sore throat, and hoarseness when compared with patients in Group D (P < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after tracheal intubation (P < 0.05). The mean airway pressure and airway peak pressure were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after one-lung ventilation (P < 0.05). SpO2 and PaO2 in Group B were significantly higher than in group D after cardiopulmonary bypass (P < 0.05). No short-term postoperative complications were observed in patients of Groups B and D during 3 month follow-up. CONCLUSION BB can be a potential alternative to the conventional DLT for lung isolation in MICS. TRIAL REGISTRATION ChiCTR1900024250, July 2, 2019.

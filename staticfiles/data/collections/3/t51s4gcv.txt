Defective interfering (DI) RNAs, helper virus-dependent deletion mutant RNAs derived from the parental viral genomic RNA during replication, have been described for most RNA virus taxonomic groups. We now report that DI RNA production in the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, persistently infected by virulence-attenuating positive sense RNA hypoviruses, depends on one of two host dicer genes, dcl-2. We further report that nonviral sequences that are rapidly deleted from recombinant hypovirus RNA virus vectors in wild-type and dicer gene dcl-1 deletion mutant strains are stably maintained and expressed in the Deltadcl-2 mutant strain. These results establish a requirement for dcl-2, the C. parasitica dicer gene responsible for antiviral defense and generation of virus-derived small interfering RNAs, in DI RNA production and recombinant virus vector RNA instability.

OBJECTIVES To study the organization and practices in nosocomial infection (NI) control in regional and provincial hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data were collected by questionnaires answered by chairpersons of infection control committees (ICC) infection control nurses (ICNs) and link nurses in regional and provincial hospitals. RESULTS From April to June 2002, sets of questionnaires were sent to all chair persons of regional and provincial hospitals, 120 infection control nurses and 57 link nurses. Of 92 hospitals, 78.3% of chairpersons and all ICNs and link nurses responded. The ICC were chaired by the directors or deputy directors in 26.4% and by doctors in various specialties in the remaining. Among ICNs, 14.2% had never attended a course in infection control and 62.5% had less than 6 years experience. Lack of support from administrators, budget, co-operation from medical personnel and ICN position were the main problems in the IC program. CONCLUSION Nosocomial infection control in regional and provincial hospitals in Thailand needs more support from administrators and more co-operation from medical personnel.

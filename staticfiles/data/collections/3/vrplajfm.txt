Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign neoplasm of infancy, with most occurring in the head and neck region. Predisposing factors include prematurity, low birth weight, multiple gestations, advanced maternal age, and chorionic villous sampling. In addition, white women, particularly those with a family history, are also at a higher risk. However, pulmonary infantile hemangiomas are exceedingly rare, with only a few case reports in the literature. Infantile hemangiomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pulmonary mass in the early pediatric population. We present a case of pulmonary infantile hemangioma in a premature male infant successfully managed by surgical excision, with an emphasis on the pathogenesis and histologic features.

Telemedicine and teleconsultation are the application and development of the telecommunication networks. Health experts can solve problems by using the electronic and communication technologies without distance limitation. In this study, we try to develop the telemedicine and teleconsultation system between local site and consulting expert site. Two applications of this system in clinical medicine are discussed. The system at each site has a workstation including a cable modem or ADSL connection, a monitor, a web camera, speakers, a microphone for communication, and NetMeeting application software. The first application in this study is to develop a school-based intervention program by using this system for high-risk school-age children in one of the earthquake-struck areas. The preliminary result of this study is that the telemedicine and teleconsultation system is more effective than traditional consultation and supervision. Moreover, we can apply this system in training local volunteers, educators, and welfare workers. Meanwhile, we can save lots of cost and time since we don't need to travel between the local site and the expert site. In the end of this study, the second application of this system in SARS case treatment was also discussed.

Polykaryon formation in bovine fetal spleen (BFS) cells infected with bovine coronavirus L9 occurred only in media supplemented with trypsin. A single 1 to 2 h trypsin treatment 10 h and later after infection induced formation of polykaryons. Trypsin treatment at pH 7.5 and 8.0 induced polykaryons while treatments at lower or higher pH levels did not. Cell fusion activity was partially suppressed by the presence of antibody.

BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a very popular technique for the treatment of morbid obesity. Less and less invasive laparoscopic approaches to SG have been proposed and shown to be safe and feasible. OBJECTIVES We developed a reduced port laparoscopic approach to sleeve gastrectomy (RLSG) with the aim to further optimize the advantages of laparoscopy. Preliminary and safety profile of RLSG as well as 3 years weight loss outcome are hereby discussed. SETTING University Hospital, Kuwait. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients had morbid obesity with history of failure of conservative treatment. The RLSG procedure was performed using only two skin incisions. RESULTS The analyzed population comprised 808 patients, including 642 women and 166 men. Mean age and BMI were 28.34 ± 8.37 and 41.09 ± 6.34, respectively. Mean operative time was 43 ± 20 min (range, 31-185). Mortality was nil. Overall morbidity rate was (4.5%). Three patients had postoperative leak (0.4%). Median duration of hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-5). Mean percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) was 23.18 ± 17.3% at 1 month, 55.08 ± 22.9% at 6 months, 82.6 ± 22.6% at 1 year, and 84.3 ± 22.4% at 3 years. Mean percentage total weight loss (%TWL) was 9.34% at 1 month, 22.42% at 6 months, and 34.57% at 1 year. CONCLUSION RLSG is a safe and effective surgical option in patients with morbid obesity. Moreover, 3-year follow-up assessment confirmed adequate % EWL.

A serologic survey was done on 618 cat sera submitted to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1988. The samples were collected from clinically normal and sick cats. The sera were tested for the presence of antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus by a commercial immunoassay, to a coronavirus by an indirect fluorescent antibody test, and to Toxoplasma gondii by a commercial latex agglutination test and for the presence of feline leukemia virus antigen with one of 3 different commercial assay kits. Ten percent of the sera had antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus, 35% had antibodies to a coronavirus, and 22% had antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Feline leukemia virus antigen was detected in 15% of the sera. Thirty-two percent of the sera had evidence of exposure to 2 or more of the agents.

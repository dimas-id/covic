At the end of December 2019, Chinese public health authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia of unknown cause in central city of Wuhan in Hubei province. Shortly after, Chinese scientists identified a hitherto undescribed beta‐coronavirus as the likely causative agent. The disease is now referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), and the virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Since 31 December 2019 and as of 25 May 2020, 5,432,512 cases of COVID‐19 (in accordance with the applied case definitions and testing strategies in the affected countries) have been reported globally, including 345,467 deaths.

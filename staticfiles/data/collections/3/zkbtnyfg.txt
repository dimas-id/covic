Abs (antibodies) are complex glycoproteins that play a crucial role in protective immunity to malaria, but their effectiveness in mediating resistance can be enhanced by genetically engineered modifications that improve on nature. These Abs also aid investigation of immune mechanisms operating to control the disease and are valuable tools in developing neutralization assays for vaccine design. This review explores how this might be achieved.

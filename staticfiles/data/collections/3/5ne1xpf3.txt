Described is the synthesis of novel arylated and alkynylated 2,4′‐diphenyl sulfones based on what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first palladium(0)‐catalyzed cross‐coupling reactions of bis(triflates) of 2,4′‐bis(hydroxy)diphenyl sulfone. The reactions proceed with very good site‐selectivity.

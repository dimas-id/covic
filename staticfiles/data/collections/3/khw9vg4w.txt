OBJECTIVE To report our successful outcomes of genital split-thickness skin graft (STSG) in covering major skin loss and providing good functional and cosmetic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for all adult urology patients who underwent STSG at our institution from 1998 to 2014. Patients had a wide range of disease etiologies, including tissue loss (eg post-Fournier's gangrene), lymphedema, buried penis, foreign body injection, and tumors. RESULTS A total of 54 patients were identified with the following breakdown of etiology: 13 patients with tissue loss (eg post-Fournier's gangrene), 13 with lymphedema, 12 with buried penis, 8 with foreign body injection, 4 with hidradenitis suppurativa, and 4 with tumors. Fifty-two out of 54 patients had more than 90% graft take, with maintained or improved erection, normal voiding, good cosmetic outcome as judged by the patient and the examining surgeon, and normal mobility. One patient died at 3 months due to cardiovascular cause, and 1 patient had a poor take of the graft. CONCLUSION We show the wide variety of indications for STSG use, the ease of the technique, and its successful outcomes. We believe this procedure should be offered to patients as a first-line treatment and also as a last resort when other more conservative approaches fail.

Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is responsible for common colds. Like other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E exploits cellular proteases to activate fusion mediated by the spike protein. We analysed the proteolytic processing of the HCoV-229E spike protein by trypsin-like serine proteases leading to activation of the fusion process. Unlike in other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E fusion activation appears to be a one-step process. Indeed, cleavage of the S1/S2 interface does not seem to be a prerequisite, and the fusion activation is highly reliant on the S2' region, with arginine residue 683 acting as the recognition site.

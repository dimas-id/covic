We read the recently published article by Drs. Agopian, Verna and Goldberg (1) with great interest. The authors have provided an important assessment of liver transplant volumes across the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) regions from February to March of 2019 and 2020. The study revealed a significant center-based difference in volume of transplant particularly among centers located in the same metropolitan areas including New York City.

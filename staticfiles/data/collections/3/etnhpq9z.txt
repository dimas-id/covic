Major incidents during the recent past have reinforced the value that the NHS and other agencies have invested into the comprehensive Emergency, Preparedness, Resilience and Response framework. This gives a detailed structure of the role of the NHS in any type of major incident from man-made disaster to pandemic flu. This has required preparation of communication, transport, security, military and healthcare systems. Also included is how the response to the incident is handled at a local level and for different levels of response. Examples of how this has played out are described. Specialist training at the higher and advanced level for trainees is established so that victims are triaged at the scene and received by consultants with appropriate training. Hospitals, ambulance services and intensive care units across the country can use networks to ensure not only rapid access to Major Trauma Centres but also to highly sophisticated skills when advanced life support is required. The NHS response to major incidents has been shown to be effective and successful.

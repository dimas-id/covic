Immediate mesh insertion has been recently used for breast reconstruction after breast-conserving surgery. We report a case of abscess formation following immediate nonabsorbable mesh insertion with breast-conserving surgery. In this article, we demonstrate multimodal breast imaging features and pathologic correlations of the case. In addition, we illustrate characteristic sonographic findings of nonabsorbable mesh fibers to differentiate them from a gossypiboma caused by a retained surgical sponge or tumor recurrence.

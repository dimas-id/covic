PURPOSE Laparoscopic gastric wedge resection is a standard treatment for removing gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs). So far, however, there have been few reports of single-incision laparoscopic intragastric wedge resection. Our aim was to describe this procedure and our experience with it. METHODS From January 2010 to December 2013, a total of 21 consecutive patients with gastric SMTs underwent single-incision intragastric resection at our institution. Their clinicopathologic data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The patients consisted of nine men and 12 women with a mean age of 51.9 ± 12.9 years (22-69 years). Their mean body mass index was 22.6 ± 2.0 kg/m(2). Mean tumor size was 2.4 ± 0.7 cm, with the following anatomic distribution: esophagogastric junction in three patients, fundus in twelve, upper body in three, and lower body in two. Mean operating time was 68.6 ± 12.0 minutes. There were no conversions to open surgery and no major intraoperative complications. Time to resumption of water intake was 1.4 ± 0.5 days. Mean hospital stay was 4.9 ± 1.7 days. There were no recurrences or deaths during the mean 19-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Single-incision intragastric wedge resection is a feasible and safe procedure. It is especially efficient for treating small endophytic gastric SMTs located on the upper and mid portion of the stomach.

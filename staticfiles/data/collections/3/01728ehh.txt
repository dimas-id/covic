Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a functionally limiting disorder secondary to increased intracranial pressures (ICPs) with a prevalence of one per 100,000 persons. It is estimated to cost >$400 million per year in productively. Symptoms classically consist of chronic headaches, papilledema, and visual loss. The pathophysiology is unknown but postulated to involve increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. Traditional treatments involve weight loss, acetazolamide, CSF diversion, or optic nerve fenestration. More recent technology has allowed exploration of venous sinus stenosis. Through venous sinus stenting (VSS), the ICPs and venous sinus pressures decrease. After treatment, >75% exhibit an improvement in headaches, ~50% improvement in tinnitus, and ~50 % improvement in ophthalmologic testing. Complications are rare but involve stent stenosis, femoral pseudoaneurysm, and hemorrhages. Future studies will look into controlled studies for VSS as well as expansion to other venous structures of the intracranial circulation.

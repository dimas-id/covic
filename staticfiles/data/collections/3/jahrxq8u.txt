Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death around the world according to the World Health Organization. In-stent restenosis is an inflammatory response of the immune system to endovascular stent implantation in atherosclerotic patients. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are of great interest in this field in order to limit the side effects of stent treatments. Poly([R,S]-3,3-dimethylmalic acid) (PDMMLA) is a new biodegradable statistical polyester which presents promising properties as a stent coating. In this work, we studied by dynamic tensiometry, the adhesion of extracellular matrix proteins (bovine serum albumin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin) and plasma membrane proteoglycan (syndecan-4) on three PDMMLA derivatives with different hydrophilicity levels. The results show that proteins have different adhesion profiles and affinity on these surfaces. They show similar behavior on the most hydrophilic surface, making hydrophilic, ionic and hydrogen type bonds. Then we compared each protein's individual profile to that of a mixture of all studied proteins. The comparison shows that vitronectin and syndecan-4 are the quantitatively dominating proteins adsorbed by specific interactions. Based on the results from previous studies, this work allowed us to identify the most important PDMMLA surface as a promising biomaterial for bioactive stent-coating.

This article explores conditions and enablers for teacher professional learning in religious education in Catholic schools. It examines the impact on religion of the pluralising and secularising influences in Australia today and identifies what this asks of religious education and religious educators in response. New pedagogical approaches which emphasise identity formation as critical to religious education, make teacher identity formation and ongoing learning vital for Catholic schools to undertake. The article proposes that teacher professional learning in Catholic schools focus on developing the following three dispositions and skills: self-awareness and reflexivity; openness to faith perspectives; and courageous communication skills. The article investigates teacher professional learning theory and research to make recommendations for teacher development in religious education. It raises two concepts as integral to professional learning in a Catholic context: Dialogue and Community. These concepts are highlighted as theologically and strategically important for Catholic school communities to attend to and explore.

This report addresses whether it is safe to perform totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair for patients taking antithrombotic agents. Between January 2011 and June 2012, 77 patients (70 men, 7 women) underwent TEP repair at Osaka Police Hospital, 22 (28.6 %) of whom had been treated with antithrombotic drugs preoperatively. Warfarin was stopped at least 3 days preoperatively and antiplatelet drugs were stopped at least 7 days preoperatively. Standard bridging intravenous heparin therapy was used according to the operative risk of each patient. The mean operative time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between these patients and a control group, although the patients on antithrombotic therapy were significantly older with higher surgical risk. No major complications or recurrence developed in either group. Our TEP repair method and bridging heparin therapy seem to be safe and feasible for minimizing postoperative complications.

In the epidemic evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the issues of mutation, origin, typing and the effect of mutation on molecular detection remain to be unrevealed. In order to identify the evolutionary relationship of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the detection efficiency of primers that are currently used in different countries, we retrieved genomic sequences of 373 SARS-CoV-2 strains from multiple databases and performed genome-wide variation analysis. According to the nucleotide C28144T variation, the SARS-CoV-2 can be divided into group A (117 strains) and group B (256 strains). The spike protein gene (S gene) coding region 1841 (total 23403) A1841G, formed a B1 subgroup (40 strains) in group B, of which 30 strains were from European and American countries in March (especially Washington, USA). These mutations are likely to be influenced by the environment or the immunization selection pressure of different populations. Although the mutation is not in the receptor binding region (RBD) and alkaline cleavage region, it may also affect the ability of transmission and pathogenicity; however, the significance is not yet clear. As the ratio of A / B strains in the epidemic months showed an increasing trend (0.35: 1 in January, 0.62: 1 in February and 0.76: 1 in March), it seems that the transmissibility of group A strains becomes stronger with time. Based on the variation of 11 nucleotide sites during the epidemic process, it is speculated that the Washington strain is more like an ancestor type, and the Wuhan strain is the offspring of the group A virus strain. By comparing the detection capabilities of primers in different countries, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide variation may only affect molecular detection of very few strains. The differences in the transmissibility, pathogenicity and clinical manifestations of different types of strains require further investigations.

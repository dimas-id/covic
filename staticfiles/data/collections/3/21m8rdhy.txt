COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and spreading worldwide has become a serious challenge for the entire health care system as regards infection prevention, rapid diagnosis, and treatment. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a dynamically developing diagnostic method used in intensive care, cardiology and nephrology, it can also be helpful in diagnosing and monitoring pneumonia. Interstitial pneumonia appears to be the most common clinical manifestation of coronavirus infection. We present 4 case reports of COVID-19 involving the lungs, in which transthoracic lung ultrasound was successfully utilized as a constituent of bedside diagnostics and a review of the literature concerning potential use of LUS in COVID-19 diagnostics. The possibility to perform this examination repeatedly, its non-invasiveness and high sensitivity make it an important element of care provided for patients with viral pneumonia.

The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began since early December 2019, and has been declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Due to the hypercoagulable state, blood stasis and endothelial injury, severe patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for thrombosis. We report a case of very severe COVID-19 complicated with venous thrombosis and arteriosclerosis obliterans of lower extremities. Risk stratification for deep vein thrombosis and peripheral arterial disease are of vital importance for the prognosis of COVID-19.

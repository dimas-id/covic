The development of highly effective antiviral agents has been a major objective in virology and pharmaceutics. Drug repositioning has emerged as a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative approach to traditional drug discovery and development. This new shift focuses on the repurposing of clinically approved drugs and promising preclinical drug candidates for the therapeutic development of host-based antiviral agents to control diseases caused by coronavirus and influenza virus. Host-based antiviral agents target host cellular machineries essential for viral infections or innate immune responses to interfere with viral pathogenesis. This review discusses current knowledge, prospective applications and challenges in the repurposing of clinically approved and preclinically studied drugs for newly indicated antiviral therapeutics.

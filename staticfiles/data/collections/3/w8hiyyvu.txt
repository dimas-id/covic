The coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-2-CoV, most commonly involves the respiratory tract; however, more severe cases have been found to have multi-organ involvement, including the central nervous system. Headache has been documented as a presenting symptom of COVID-19, which may prompt neurology consultation. To date, few cases of COVID-19 meningitis have been confirmed, but it must remain in the differential diagnosis for patients with headache and fever. A 58-year-old female with multiple sclerosis on fingolimod, chronic migraine well-controlled on fremanezumab, and cerebrovascular disease presented with fevers and respiratory symptoms, as well as acute treatment-refractory headache with associated neck stiffness and transient behavioral abnormalities. Although not confirmed with cerebrospinal fluid testing, we suspect this patient had COVID-19 meningoencephalitis, highlighting the need to consider secondary headaches in patients with coronavirus infection, even in the setting of chronic migraine. We offer anecdotal treatment recommendations for acutely refractory secondary headache and guidance for the consulting neurologist during the COVID-19 pandemic.

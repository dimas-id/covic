PURPOSE To investigate if laser atherectomy with adjunctive balloon angioplasty can improve endovascular treatment outcomes for femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis (ISR). METHODS A dual center study included 135 symptomatic patients (mean age 71 years; 76 men) who underwent endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal ISR between 2006 and 2013. Of these, 54 (40%) were treated with laser atherectomy and the remaining 81 patients with balloon angioplasty alone. Angiographic images were reviewed for lesion morphology and characteristics, TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) II classification, and distal runoff. Class I ISR was defined as focal lesions â‰¤50 mm, class II ISR as lesions >50 mm, and class III ISR as stent total occlusion. Recurrent ISR was determined by a peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4 by duplex ultrasound. RESULTS Patients treated with laser atherectomy had longer mean ISR lesion length (222 vs 114 mm, p<0.001) and more class III ISR (69% vs 20%, p=0.001). There was no association between laser atherectomy and rates of recurrent restenosis or occlusion for patients with class I/II ISR, but there was a significantly lower rate of target lesion revascularization at 2 years among patients treated with laser atherectomy (14% vs 44%, p=0.05). In comparison, patients with class III ISR treated with laser atherectomy had lower rates of recurrent restenosis at 1 year (54% vs 91%, p=0.05) and 2 years (69% vs 100%, p=0.05). Patients with class III ISR treated with laser atherectomy also had lower rates of recurrent in-stent occlusion at 2-year follow-up (33% vs 71%, p=0.04). CONCLUSION When used to treat complex ISR, including in-stent occlusions, laser atherectomy with adjunctive balloon angioplasty may be associated with improved patency.

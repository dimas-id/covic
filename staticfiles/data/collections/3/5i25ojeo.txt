Voiding urosonography (VUS) entails the intravesical administration of US contrast agent (USCA) for the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). VUS is now recognized as a practical, safe, radiation-free modality with comparable or higher sensitivity than direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), respectively. An extensive review of the literature regarding both the procedural aspects and comparative diagnostic values of VUS has been published (Darge Pediatr Radiol 38:40-63, 2008a, b). The aim of this review is to provide an update on various facets of VUS that have taken place since the publication of the above-mentioned two reviews.

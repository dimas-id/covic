A rotavirus, morphologically similar to other known rotaviruses, was demonstrated in the faeces of 5 foals with diarrhoea on two properties. Four of these 5 samples produced specific intracytoplasmic fluorescence in cell culture when reacted with calf rotavirus antiserum conjugate. Sixteen affected foals from both properties were depressed, did not suckle and became recumbent. Most had a watery diarrhoea which lasted for 3 days and resulted in some dehydration and loss of body condition. Sick foals were separated from their mothers following the onset of diarrhoea and given fluid therapy and antibiotics, but despite these measures 4 of 12 affected foals on one property died. Acute and convalescent sera were collected from 6 foals, and in each case a rise in the titres of complement fixing and neutralising antibodies was demonstrated. Faecal filtrates containing foal rotaviruses were fed to gnotobiotic piglets and the effects compared with those of other rotaviruses. Viral isolates from both properties produced an asymptomatic infection in piglets. This contrasts with the other rotaviruses isolated in Australia that have been shown to cause diarrhoea in gnotobiotic piglets.

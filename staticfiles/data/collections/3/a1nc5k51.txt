From late December 2019 a new human-adapted coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was observed and isolated in clustered patients in Wuhan, China. It has been proved to be able to transmit human-to-human and cause pneumonia, leading to about 2% fatality. Its genome characteristics, immune responses and related potential treatments, such as chemical drugs, serum transfusion and vaccines including DNA vaccines, are discussed in this review for a brief summary.

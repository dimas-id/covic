BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to identify possible risk factors associated with chylous ascites after colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS Patients who underwent colorectal cancer resection were enrolled in this study. Data were compared between patients who developed chylous ascites and those who did not. RESULTS Chylous ascites was detected in 48 (6.6%) patients. There were significant differences between the groups with and without chylous ascites in terms of age (65.6 vs 61.6 years, P = .017), operator (5.0% vs 15.5%, P < .001), operative procedure based on tumor location (P = .041), operative time (206.0 vs 229.8 minutes, P = .045), and blood loss (78.1 vs 219.7 mL, P = .036). After subgroup analysis for right-sided colectomy and low anterior resection to compensate for the effects of the operative procedure, the differences in the operative time and blood loss were not significant. In most patients, chylous ascites was resolved with conservative management. CONCLUSIONS Chylous ascites developed significantly more frequently in patients who underwent right-sided colectomy and in elderly patients. In addition, the incidence was also dependent on the operator. Conservative treatment was effective in most patients.

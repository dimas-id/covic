OBJECTIVE To assess the views, needs and intended behaviour of general practitioners and practice nurses (PNs) regarding pandemic influenza. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A postal survey of GPs and PNs in four Divisions of General Practice in New South Wales, selected to represent a diverse sample of practices from inner-city, semi-urban and rural areas. The study was undertaken from 1 February to 1 April 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES GPs' and PNs' responses to survey statements assessing their awareness and perceived personal risk, intended behaviour in the event of a pandemic, and expectations surrounding antivirals, vaccine and personal and family protection. RESULTS Of 390 general practice staff who were sent the survey, 139 (36%) completed it. Most respondents felt confident that they possessed the necessary knowledge (71.5%, 98/137) and skills (73.7%, 101/137) to provide patient care during an influenza pandemic. Although 38.7% (53/137) stated that they would visit quarantined symptomatic patients, 41.6% (57/137) were unsure. More than half the respondents (53.2%, 74/139) stated that they would require access to vaccination and antivirals for their family as well as themselves before they would attend symptomatic patients at the general practice. CONCLUSION These findings provide evidence of the need to ensure that general practice staff have access to personal and family protection to encourage an adequate response to a pandemic situation.

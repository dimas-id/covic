Objective@#To explore the value of chest CT features and clinical indexes in the differential diagnosis between suspected COVID-19 with two or more negative nucleic acid tests and confirmed COVID-19.@*Methods@#The clinical data and chest CT images of 105 cases withconfirmedCOVID-19 (55 males and 50 females, aged from 2 month to 88 years) and 97 cases with suspected COVID-19(59 males and 38 females, aged from 1 month to 93 years) were analyzed retrospectively in Shiyan Taihe Hospital from January 21 to February 10, 2020. &#x03C7;2test and two independent sample t test were used to analyze the clinical data and CT signs of the two cases, with P&lt;0.05 for the difference statistically significant.@*Results@#Compared with the suspected patients, the average age of diagnosis of covid-19 was higher (t = 2.460, P = 0.01). The main pathological changes were pure ground glass (68 cases) and mixed ground glass density (53 cases) (&#x03C7;2 = 50.016, P&lt; 0.01). Interstitial thickening (83 cases) (&#x03C7;2 = 55.395, P&lt; 0.01), vascular thickening (73 cases) (&#x03C7;2 = 57.527, P&lt; 0.01), air bronchoscopic sign or bronchiectasis Zhang (67 cases) (&#x03C7;2 = 17.899, P&lt; 0.01), cord focus (54 cases) (&#x03C7;2 = 5.500, P = 0.02), easily distributed under the pleura and the long axis of the lesion was parallel to the pleura (89 cases) (&#x03C7;2 = 23.597, P&lt; 0.01), most of them had no pleural effusion (&#x03C7;2 = 7.017, P&lt; 0.01); both lesions were mainly distributed in patches (89 cases were confirmed, 87 suspected) (&#x03C7;2 = 19.573, P&lt; 0.01). In addition, the lesions of patients with confirmed covid-19 showed progress in short term (72 / 87, 82.76%), and those with suspected covid-19 showed remission in short term (63 / 89, 70.78%). The difference was statistically significant (&#x03C7;2 = 51.114, P&lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference in gender and distribution of pulmonary lobes (&#x03C7;2 = 1.462, P= 0.23; &#x03C7;2 = 7.381, P= 0.19). The number of white blood cells (&#x03C7;2 = 17.891, P&lt; 0.01) and the percentage of lymphocytes (&#x03C7;2 = 11.151,P&lt; 0.01) of covid-19 were mostly normal or decreased, creatine kinase (&#x03C7;2 = 9.589, P&lt; 0.01) were mostly normal, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mostly normal or increased (&#x03C7;2 = 4.240, P= 0.04).@*Conclusions@#The imaging features and biochemical indexes of diagnosed COVID-19 are different from those of suspected COVID-19. The comparative analysis of imaging features, clinical indexes and reexamination are helpful for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and suspected COVID-19.

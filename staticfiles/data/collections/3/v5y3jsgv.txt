Adverse pregnancy outcomes can follow direct placental, fetal, or neonatal infection, or preterm birth associated with vaginal, cervical, intrauterine, or even nonpelvic infections. These latter infections appear to be associated with the majority of very early preterm births, and may explain some of the long-term neurologic damage associated with preterm birth. Bacterial vaginosis and its associated intrauterine infections likely contribute far more to the overall burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes than the more classical perinatal infections such as rubella and syphilis.

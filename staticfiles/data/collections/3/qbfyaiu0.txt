Recently, gastric ultrasonography has been used as a noninvasive portable tool for evaluating gastric content and volume in adults and children. Pediatric patients are not always cooperative, especially younger ones, and it may be difficult to keep them in the appropriate scanning position without sedation. Hence, we modified the scanning method and position, and evaluated the efficacy of this alternative scanning technique in pediatric cases. We evaluated the gastric contents of 44 pediatric patients aged 4-14 years who were about to undergo elective surgery. Solid food and fluids were prohibited 8 and 2 h before anesthesia, respectively. Before anesthetic induction, we used gastric ultrasonography to measure the antral cross-sectional area in the supine position (supine CSA), irrespective of peristaltic contractions. The gastric volume was then aspirated using a multi-orifice catheter under general anesthesia. Supine CSA measured via this gastric ultrasonography method was positively correlated with gastric volume (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001). We concluded that our alternative method of measuring antral CSA may be applicable for children minimal gastric contents.

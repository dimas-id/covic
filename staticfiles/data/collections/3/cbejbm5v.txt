In developing countries, viruses causing respiratory disease are a major concern of public health. During January 2010–December 2011, 2,737 patients with acute respiratory infection from the outpatient departments as well as patients admitted to hospitals were screened for different respiratory viruses. Nasal and or throat swabs were collected and transported to the laboratory where initial screening of influenza A and influenza B viruses was performed. The samples were tested further for influenza C virus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, human rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus by conventional RT‐ PCR. The study revealed that the majority of the patients were under 5 years of age; both due to their higher susceptibility to respiratory infections and presentation to hospitals. Out of 2,737 patients enrolled in this study, 59% were found positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Influenza B infection was detected in 12% of patients followed by influenza A (11.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (7.1%), parainfluenza virus‐2 (6%), metapneumovirus (3%), parainfluenza virus‐3 (1%), parainfluenza virus‐4 (0.6%), parainfluenza virus‐1 (0.3%), influenza C (0.2%) and human rhinovirus (0.2%). Distinct seasonal infection was observed only for influenza A and influenza B viruses. J. Med. Virol. 85:1459–1465, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

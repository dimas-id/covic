MOTIVATION The past decade has seen extension in the methods of sequence analysis from single gene based to analyzing multiple genes and proteins simultaneously. Consequently, there is a need for software tools that will allow mining of these enormous datasets at genome level effectively. A key challenge is to make them user-friendly, available to a larger community and integrate with public domain software without much hassle. RESULTS A web-based interactive computational tool is described for visualization and comparison of gene order from prokaryotic and selected viral genome data. Many intriguing similarities and differences in gene order of multiple genomes can be compared and revealed. The interface facilitates easy extraction of the nucleotide sequence of the gene of interest and BLAST analysis against GenBank at NCBI to provide insights into gene functions and orthologs of the gene in other species.

Between 2002 and 2007, more than 1000 chickens from commercial farms, live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger were tested for the presence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the spike 1 (S1) gene revealed a new genotype of IBV that we refer to as 'IBADAN'. The minimum genetic distance to the closest 'non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32 % at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4 % at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. As IBV S1 plays a major role in antigenicity, the antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005 but only to a low level (antigenic relatedness of 33 %), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. A comparison of S1 sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity. Despite the absence of obvious clinical signs in poultry infected by IBADAN strains, it is important to test the cross-protection of current vaccine strains.

In this study several SARS-CoV structural proteins and fragments were expressed in E. coli as GST or TRX fusion proteins. They were fabricated on a microarray and tested with sera from SARS patients. Antigenic screening indicated that recombinant GST-N2 fusion protein, the carboxy-terminus 213aa-423aa of N protein, was strongest positive and weakest non-specific compared with others. An indirect antibody ELISA method was developed and clinical positive and negative sera for their antibodies against GST-N2 fusion protein were assayed. 311 out of the 442 sera from clinical SARS inpatients, as well as 229 out of 302 sera from convalescent patients gave positive reactivities; positive rates were 70.4% and 75.8% respectively. Sera from a total of 2726 non-SARS patients and healthy individuals were tested and the false positive rate was only 0.07%. When the sensitivity control sample was diluted 1 : 64, it yielded OD values above the cutoff value. Reported data showed that this was a relatively high degree of sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV antibody testing. The data indicate that GST-N2 fusion protein, which was screened by protein microarray, may be a valuable diagnostic antigen for the development of serological assays for SARS. In addition, protein microarray assay presents a higher positive rate and sensitivity (86.1% and 1 : 200) compared with the traditional ELISA screening method, and could provide a rapid, parallel and high-throughput antigen screening platform.

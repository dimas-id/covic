99mTc-labeled MAA is commonly used for single photon emission computed tomography SPECT. In contrast, positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) delivers images with significantly higher resolution. The generator produced radionuclide 68Ga is widely used for PET/CT imaging agents and 68Ga-labeled MAA represents an attractive alternative to 99mTc-labeled MAA. We report a simple and rapid NaCl based labeling procedure for the labeling of MAA with 68Ga using a commercially available MAA labeling kit for 99mTc. The procedure delivers 68Ga-labeled MAA with a high specific activity and a high labeling efficiency (>99%). The synthesis does not require a final step of separation or the use of organic solvents.

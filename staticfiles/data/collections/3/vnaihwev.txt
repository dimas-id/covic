OBJECTIVE To evaluate the use of a single needle driver with the V-Loc (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) running suture and compare this with the use of 2 needle drivers with polyglactin interrupted sutures (IS) in dividing the dorsal venous complex (DVC) and forming the urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective cohort study was performed to compare V-Loc (n = 40) with polyglactin (n = 40) sutures. Division of the dorsal venous complex and formation of the UVA during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using V-Loc or polyglactin sutures were studied. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters were measured. RESULTS V-Loc sutures were associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean dorsal vein suture time (3.15 minutes V-Loc vs 3.75 minutes IS, P = .02) and UVA anastomosis time (8.5 minutes V-Loc vs 11.5 minutes IS, P = .001). No significant difference was noted between operative time (121 minutes V-Loc vs 130 minutes IS, P = .199), delayed healing rates (5% V-Loc vs 7.5% IS, P = .238), continence rate at 12 months (97.5% V-Loc vs 95% IS, P = .368), and urethral stenosis rates (2.5% V-Loc vs 2.5% IS, P = .347) in both groups. CONCLUSION The use of a V-Loc running suture with a single needle driver is a feasible, reproducible, and economic technique with no significant difference in continence rates and urethral stenosis rates, compared with the use of a traditional interrupted suture.

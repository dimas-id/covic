As of January 22, 2020, "disease caused by a novel coronavirus" became a reportable disease of public health significance in Ontario. Public health units were provided with guidance on the entry of patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), into the provincial public health information system. Between January 22 and February 22, 2020, there were 359 individuals who had a negative test result recorded and three confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of those who tested negative, 51% were female and 71% were under 50 years of age. The most common symptoms reported were cough (55%), fever (37%) and sore throat (35%). The majority were tested within three days of symptom onset, but over one-quarter tested more than seven days after symptom onset. Over the first month of reportability, reported travel history shifted from China to an increasing proportion with travel outside of China.

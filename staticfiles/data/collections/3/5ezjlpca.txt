Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) plays a major role in the protection against lethal infection with mouse hepatitis virus A59. IFN-gamma production reaches a maximum level 2 days after viral inoculation, especially in liver immune cells. Among these cells, natural killer cells are the major producers of this cytokine. Transfer experiments indicated that the protective role of IFN-gamma is mediated through a direct effect on cells targeted by the virus rather than through indirect activation of T lymphocytes.

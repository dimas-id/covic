As a syndrome of injurious pulmonary inflammation resulting in deranged respiratory physiology, acute lung injury affords numerous potential therapeutic targets. Two main pharmacological treatment strategies have arisen-the attempted inhibition of excessive inflammation or the manipulation of the resulting physiological derangement causing respiratory failure. Additionally, such interventions may allow the delivery of less injurious mechanical ventilation. An emerging approach is the use of cell-based therapy, which, rather than inhibiting the inflammatory process, seeks to convert it from an injurious process to a reparative one. This review outlines previous, current, and emerging pharmacological therapies for acute lung injury.

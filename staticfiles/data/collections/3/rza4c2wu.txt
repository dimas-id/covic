To maintain operative safety, patient selection criteria for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) are more stringent than that for traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TLC). No other method could demonstrate the same feasibility and safety as TLC because the patient selection criteria were too restrictive for SILC to compare with TLC. In this study, we conducted a comparative study between our original SILC and TLC for demonstrating similar feasibility and safety among patients who had the same selection criteria as that for TLC. A statistical comparison between 114 patients of SILC and 201 patients of TLC was conducted during the same time period. The preoperative patient characteristics for SILC and TLC showed no statistical difference. In the operative result analysis, a significant disadvantage of SILC was the prolongation of operative time by only 15 minutes. The original SILC was as feasible and safe as TLC and virtually scarless cholecystectomy could be performed without any selection criteria. This was performed using only 2 trocars from an umbilical incision and 2 incisionless extracorporeal retraction devices.

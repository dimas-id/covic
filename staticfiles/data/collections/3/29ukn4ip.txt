To screen small animals susceptible to SARS-CoV, five species of animals, including guinea pig, hamster, albino hamster, chicken and rat, were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV strain BJ-01 by different routes. On the basis of this, further cynomolgus and rhesus macaques were selected and experimentally inoculated SARS-CoV, the quality they serve as animal model for SARS was evaluated. The results showed that, all five species of small animals chosed were not susceptible to SARS-CoV, no characterized changes in clinical sign and histopathology were observed after infection, but from the lung samples of large rat and pig guinea, the genomic RNA of SARS-CoV could be detected by RT-PCR at day 14 post infection, this suggested that SARS-CoV could replicate in these animals. After inoculated with SARS-CoV, all inoculated cynomolgus and rhesus macaques had developed interstitial pneumonia of differing severity. These changes on histopathology were similar to that seen in SARS patients, but the pathological lesions were less severe than that of human. Except interstitial pneumonia, no other characterized pathological changes were observed. This suggested cynomolgus and rhesus macaques were not the ideal animal model for SARS in fact, but they could serve as animal model for SARS when a more ideal animal model is absent.

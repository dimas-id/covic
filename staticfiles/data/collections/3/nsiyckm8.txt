This research presents viable solutions for prediction modelling of schistosomiasis disease based on vector density. Novel training models proposed in this work aim to address various aspects of interest in the artificial intelligence applications domain. Topics discussed include data imputation, semi-supervised labelling and synthetic instance simulation when using sparse training data. Innovative semi-supervised ensemble learning paradigms are proposed focusing on labelling threshold selection and stringency of classification confidence levels. A regression-correlation combination (RCC) data imputation method is also introduced for handling of partially complete training data. Results presented in this work show data imputation precision improvement over benchmark value replacement using proposed RCC on 70% of test cases. Proposed novel incremental transductive models such as ITSVM have provided interesting findings based on threshold constraints outperforming standard SVM application on 21% of test cases and can be applied with alternative environment-based epidemic disease domains. The proposed incremental transductive ensemble approach model enables the combination of complimentary algorithms to provide labelling for unlabelled vector density instances. Liberal (LTA) and strict training approaches provided varied results with LTA outperforming Stacking ensemble on 29.1% of test cases. Proposed novel synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) equilibrium approach has yielded subtle classification performance increases which can be further interrogated to assess classification performance and efficiency relationships with synthetic instance generation.

BACKGROUND The immune response to dengue virus (DENV) primary infection in infants and young children is not well characterized. In Northern Argentina, >90% of the population was DENV-na√Øve before the 2009 outbreak, allowing evaluation of age-dependent primary responses to infection. METHODS We conducted a comparative study of the immune response to DENV in 27 infected infants, young children and their mothers. Lymphocyte T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17 and inflammatory responses were assayed in blood during the 2009 DENV-1 epidemic. RESULTS The immune response to DENV-1 was significantly biased to Th2 in infected infants and young children, compared to infants with other febrile illnesses (for IL-4 p < 0.001) and to their infected mothers (for IL-4 p < 0.01). In addition, IL-17 suppression was observed in the memory response to DENV-1 in infected infants (p < 0.01 vs placebo). CONCLUSION Age-related differences in the primary response to DENV, characterized by an immature Th2 polarization and Th17 suppression in infants, should be studied further in order to expand our understanding of the mechanism of dengue pathogenesis.

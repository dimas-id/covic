OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical outcome of mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome, who received corticosteroid with those who did not. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Intensive care setting. PATIENTS: All adult mechanically ventilated patients, who were admitted to the ICU between March 20, 2020, and May 10, 2020, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cohort was divided into two groups based on corticosteroid administration. The primary outcome variable was ventilator-free days at day 28. Secondary outcome variable was ICU-free days at day 30, and hospital-free days at day 30. Consecutive 61 mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome were analyzed. Patient in corticosteroid group as compared with noncorticosteroid group have higher 28-day ventilator-free days (mean, 10.2; median, 7 [interquartile range, 0–22.3] vs mean, 4.7; median, 0 [interquartile range, 0–11]; p = 0.01).There was no significant difference noted in secondary outcomes (ICU-free days at day 30 and hospital-free days at day 30). CONCLUSIONS: Among mechanically ventilated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, corticosteroids use was associated with significant improvement in 28-day ventilator-free days at day 28, but no significant improvement in ICU-free days at day 30, and hospital-free days at day 30.

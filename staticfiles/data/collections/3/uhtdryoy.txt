Life-threatening cardiovascular anomalies require surgery for structural repair with cardiovascular patches. The biomaterial patch, derived from Bombyx mori silk fibroin (SF), is used as an alternative material due to its excellent tissue affinity and biocompatibility. However, SF lacks the elastomeric characteristics required for a cardiovascular patch. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we combined the thermoplastic polyurethane, PellethaneÂ® (PU) with SF to develop an elastic biocompatible patch. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the blended SF/PU patch in a vascular model. Additionally, we focused on the effects of different SF concentrations in the SF/PU patch on its biological and physical properties. Three patches of different compositions (SF, SF7PU3 and SF4PU6) were created using an electrospinning method. Each patch type (n = 18) was implanted into rat abdominal aorta and histopathology was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-implantation. The results showed that with increasing SF content the tensile strength and elasticity decreased. Histological evaluation revealed that inflammation gradually decreased in the SF7PU3 and SF patches throughout the study period. At 6 months post-implantation, the SF7PU3 patch demonstrated progressive remodeling, including significantly higher tissue infiltration, elastogenesis and endothelialization compared with SF4PU6. In conclusion, an increase of SF concentration in the SF/PU patch had effects on vascular remodeling and physical properties. Moreover, our blended patch might be an attractive alternative material that could induce the growth of a neo-artery composed of tissue present in native artery.

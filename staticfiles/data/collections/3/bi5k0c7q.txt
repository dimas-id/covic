BACKGROUND We propose that needlescopic surgery (NS) should be considered as a way of improving the esthetic result and post-operative quality of life of patients and of reducing costs and stress on surgeons, and we have evaluated the results of NS. METHODS We used NS in 157 patients between May 1998 and December 2010: cholecystectomy in 150 patients, marsupialization of splenic and hepatic cysts in 4 and splenectomy in 3, respectively. Under general anesthesia, one 12-mm and two or three 2- or 3-mm ports were introduced into the operative field. The specimen was retrieved from the 12-mm wound using a plastic bag. RESULTS The procedures were successfully completed in all patients without conversion to an open procedure. In eight (5.3%) of 150 cholecystectomies a change to 5-mm instruments was required. The mean operation times and postoperative hospital stays for cholecystectomy, splenectomy, and marsupialization of splenic and hepatic cysts were 80.2 min and 3.2 days, 167 min and 5.6 days, 170 min and 7 days, and 120 min and 7 days, respectively. There were a few perioperative complications. The most important factor for reducing operation time and achieving a low conversion rate is the use of at least one 3- or 5-mm port for the grasping instruments in cholecystectomy. We recognized a residual cyst requiring splenectomy 62 months after marsupialization in one case. Technical points for performing safe procedures on solid organs were: no direct organ mobilization to avoid organ injuries, the rotation of the operating table and the utilization of organ gravity to create a better operative field, the minimum use of the needlescope to perform a safe maneuver and the improvement of bi-manual technique. CONCLUSIONS NS is a safe and feasible procedure for achieving minimal invasive surgery. We should consider NS as a first choice to treat operable diseases in this laparoscopic era.

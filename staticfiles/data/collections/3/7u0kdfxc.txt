Practical relevance: Infectious disease in feline patients often presents a diagnostic challenge. This article reviews the most relevant viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases and their cutaneous manifestations. Many of the diseases discussed have overlapping presentations or may mimic more common noninfectious disease processes. The purpose of the article is to reinforce knowledge of common and uncommon infectious diseases, help practitioners identify possible infectious dermatoses, create a comprehensive and prioritized differential list, and provide guidance for the diagnosis of these diseases. A working knowledge of these clinical syndromes is important if what is thought to be a case of a common disease does not respond to conventional management. AUDIENCE This review is aimed at veterinarians who treat cats and especially those with an interest in feline dermatology. Tables are included to allow the reader to formulate a concise list of differential diagnoses for clinically similar presentations. The diagnostic approach to a case of ulcerative facial dermatitis is reviewed in a Case Notes quiz. Evidence base: This article includes up-to-date information regarding dermatologic manifestations of less commonly encountered feline cutaneous infectious diseases. Information has been drawn from the published, peer-reviewed literature and the most recent textbook chapters with a particular aim of describing and differentiating clinical lesions and the diagnostic approach to cutaneous disease, especially in unusual cases.

This lecture summarizes the chronology and rationale that led to the discovery of angiotensin-(1-7) as a hormone that, in its own right, opposes the vasoconstrictor and proliferative actions of angiotensin II. The work discussed here additionally analyzes the newest findings on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue that efficiently hydrolyzes angiotensin II into angiotensin-(1-7). Both components of this system may significantly influence our future perspective of the role of the renin-angiotensin system, not just in terms of its role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function but, moreover, as regulators of a vast array of disease processes in which inflammation and immune mechanisms play a role.

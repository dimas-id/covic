In view of the pandemic caused by a new virus, influenza A (H1N1), we report the case of a 56-year-old patient without relevant risk factors and with severe acute respiratory syndrome resulting from infection with this virus. We present the results of laboratory tests and the imaging findings (chest X-ray and CT scans). The evolution was favorable, and the patient was discharged after 14 days.

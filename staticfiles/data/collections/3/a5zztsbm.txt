OBJECTIVES The management of postoperative pain in thoracic surgery is an open issue. The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain after a videothoracoscopic lobectomy versus a mini-thoracotomy approach. METHODS Between April 2011 and January 2013 we enrolled in a prospective, non-randomized study 145 patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy with lymphadenectomy for Stage I lung cancer. In 75 cases (Group A), surgery was performed through a videothoracoscopic approach. In 70 cases (Group B), surgery was undertaken through a conservative mini-thoracotomy. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale and lung function by spirometry and six-minute walking test (6MWT) before surgery, at 48 h and 1 month after surgery. RESULTS Patients were stratified by age, sex, lung function, type and duration of surgery. Length of hospital stay (median, days) was 4 for Group A and 6 for Group B (P = 0.088). The differences between mean postoperative pain values were significant at 1, 12, 24 and 48 h (6.24 vs 8.74, 5.16 vs 7.66, 4.19 vs 6.89 and 2.23 vs 5.33; P = 0.000). In Group A, mean preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second values were 2.65 ± 0.61, and 1.83 ± 0.65 and 2.09 ± 0.65, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month (P = 0.028); in Group B, they were 2.71 ± 0.71 preoperatively and 1.33 ± 0.52 and 1.82 ± 0.63, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month. In Group A, mean preoperative 6MWT values (m) were 426.85 ± 51.18, and 371.23 ± 55.36 and 392.07 ± 56.12, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month; in Group B, they were 421.76 ± 56.65 preoperatively and 312.03 ± 48.54 and 331.83 ± 47.99, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS The videothoracoscopic approach in the treatment of Stage I lung cancer reduces postoperative pain, which seems to allow a rapid functional recovery of patients.

Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate the subpopulations of lymphocytes in the colonic mucosa of healthy dogs and dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fourteen normal dogs and 13 dogs with IBD were examined. Endoscopic biopsy specimens of colonic mucosa from each dog were stained specifically for pan T lymphocytes (CD3) and pan B lymphocytes (CD79a), and for plasma cells with methyl green pyronin (MGP) stain. Cells were counted by means of a grid and statistical analysis was performed on the data collected. B and T lymphocytes were also counted in the glandular epithelium of normal dogs and dogs with IBD and the normal and abnormal groups compared statistically. Healthy dogs had significantly lower numbers of T cells in the lamina propria and glandular epithelium and significantly lower numbers of B cells in the lamina propria. Significant group differences for plasma cells were not evident. Our results indicate that in IBD a chronic cellular immune reaction is present in the diseased gut involving increased numbers of B and T lymphocytes.

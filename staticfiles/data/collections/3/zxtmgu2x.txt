Objectives Valproic acid (VPA) is an anticonvulsant used in several clinical scenarios. VPA has been increasingly associated with intentional or unintentional overdose. In patients presenting with severe VPA overdose, supportive care and airway protection are cornerstones of treatment, while levocarnitine is suggested in patients with hyperammonemia and hemodialysis is recommended in patients with VPA serum concentrations (SC) >1,300 mg/L and presence of cerebral edema or shock. Meropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity. The pharmacological interaction between VPA and meropenem is characterized by a rapid decrease in VPA concentrations, which contraindicates concurrent use. Case presentation The following case report describes the use of meropenem to enhance the clearance of VPA in the case of severe VPA overdose. A patient with altered mental status was transported to the emergency department (ED) after VPA overdose. Meropenem was prescribed for significant elevated VPA SC. An important decline in SC was observed with short-term meropenem dosing, and an improvement in mental status occurred shortly after administration. Conclusions Carbapenem therapy has the potential to be used as last line strategy in the management of severe VPA overdose in patients where SC represent a significant risk of toxicity and clinical symptoms suggest difficulty managing the patient.

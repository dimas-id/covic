ABSTRACT. Objetive To analyse the microbiota of the physiotherapist´s work environment to understand the existing potential risks in order to adopt appropriate preventive measures. Design Cross-sectional descriptive observational study. Setting Physiotherapist´s working environment. Participants 19 physiotherapy and rehabilitation centres. Intervention A microbiological sampling was carried out in the physiotherapy centers. The samples were studied using the usual culture and analysis methodology for characterization and isolation of a range of bacteria. Main outcome measures Absolute and relative frequency of microorganism isolation. Results In the analysis, pathogens normally responsible for nosocomial infections were detected, especially on instruments and equipment used by the physiotherapist like sponge electrodes, and were significantly more contaminated than the rest of the places studied (p<0.01). Conclusion This situation confirms the absence of measures and protocols for the prevention and control of such infections in the physiotherapist's environment, which is why they must be considered in order to protect both physiotherapy professionals and patients.

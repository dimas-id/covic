As a result of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the medical and dental services across the world have to tackle unprecedented situations, providing essential care and professional support. The global health care crisis caused directly by the vast number of severe COVID-19 cases, and indirectly by reduced access to health care, as well as by limited secondary care provision, had a major impact on specialist services, and subsequently the deterioration of medical and dental conditions, particularly in vulnerable persons. In particular, at present, special care dentistry seems to play a unique role, dealing with a wide range of patients with underlying medical conditions and co-morbidities, phobic individuals, and persons with learning/physical disabilities. The effective adaptation of health services to the current new reality, based on an empathetic approach and recent guidelines, would allow us to maintain an adequate care provision, minimizing the long-term impact of the pandemic.

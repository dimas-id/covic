Replication, the process by which the genetic material of a virus is copied to generate multiple progeny genomes, is the central part of the virus infection cycle. For an infection to be productive, it is essential that this process is coordinated with other aspects of the cycle, such as translation of the viral genome, encapsidation, and movement of the genome between cells. In the case of positive-strand RNA viruses, this represents a particular challenge, as the infecting genome must not only be replicated but also serve as an mRNA for the production of the replication-associated proteins. In recent years, it has become apparent that in positive-strand RNA plant viruses all the aspects of the infection cycle are intertwined. This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding replication-associated events in such viruses.

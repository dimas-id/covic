Abstract The effect of vaccinating pregnant cows with an inactivated vaccine against Mannheimia haemolytica, BRSV and PI3V infections on selected immune responses in their offspring was examined. Blood samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks from six newborn calves from each of vaccinated (experimental) and unvaccinated (control) dams. Specific antibodies to M. haemolytica, BRSV and PI3V and mean values of IgA, IgG concentrations were significantly higher in the experimental calves compared with the controls. However, specific antibody titres to adenovirus type 3, BHV1 and BVDV in the experimental calves had constant levels while the control group levels changed. The IgM, Hp and SAA concentrations generally increased until week 8 in the experimental group, but the control group titres became higher after week 9. This study demonstrates that specific immunisation of cows pre-partum significantly stimulated parameters associated with immunity and it also controlled the acute phase response intensity in their offspring. Therefore the vaccination of dams may provide additional antibody protection against infection to their offspring.

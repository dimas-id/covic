An irreparable tear of the subscapularis is a surgical challenge. Open approaches have been widely described to restore the anatomy and the function of the shoulder. Pectoralis major transfer is the most common technique used in this difficult clinical situation. Although this procedure has only been performed through an open approach, we describe a new arthroscopic technique for pectoralis major transfer. The critical part in this technique, in general, is the musculocutaneous nerve dissection, which is also possible through the arthroscopic approach. Together with an alternative method of harvesting using chips of bone and a minimal skin incision, this promising, less invasive technique presents all the advantages of the arthroscopic approach and provides a strong fixation to the lesser tuberosity.

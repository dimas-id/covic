The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important protein that acts as a chloride channel and regulates many physiological functions, including salt transport and fluid flow. Mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR protein cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells of the lungs, pancreas, intestines, and other organs. In the peripheral and central nervous system, CFTR expression has been detected in the neurons of rat brains, ganglion cells of rat hearts, human hypothalamus, human spinal cord, and human spinal and sympathetic ganglia. However, CFTR has not been identified in other parts of the nervous system. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and laser-assisted microdissection (LMD) followed by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR to identify CFTR proteins and messenger RNA in human and rat paracervical ganglion cells. CFTR and its gene expression were both detected in paracervical ganglion cells, a finding that might link this important protein to the neuronal regulation of female urogenital function. These findings could provide new insights into the symptoms related to the reproductive system frequently observed in female cystic fibrosis patients.

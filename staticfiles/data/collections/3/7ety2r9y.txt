Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a worldwide health threat. Here, we report that low plasma interleukin-3 (IL-3) levels were associated with increased severity and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infections. IL-3 promoted the recruitment of antiviral circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) into the airways by stimulating CXCL12 secretion from pulmonary CD123+ epithelial cells. This study identifies IL-3 as a predictive disease marker and potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 infections.

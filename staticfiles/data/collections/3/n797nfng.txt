Patients undergoing nephrectomy for central renal tumors suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may carry a small risk of having transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) on final pathology, even in the absence of filling defects or abnormal cytology. We describe outcomes in such patients undergoing robotic nephrectomy for suspected RCC, with intraoperative specimen assessment to guide completion ureterectomy if TCC is present. Between September 2010 and August 2015, ten patients had central renal masses suspicious for RCC, which were not amenable to nephron-sparing surgery. Patients underwent a four-arm robotic nephrectomy technique using a GelPOINT(Â®) access port. Following hilar ligation, the ureter was divided between adjacent hem-o-lok clips, placed in an endocatch bag, and extracted through the GelPOINT incision for the frozen section analysis. If intraoperative assessment confirmed TCC, a robotic completion ureterectomy and a bladder cuff excision were performed. Of the ten patients with central tumors who underwent robotic nephrectomy for suspected RCC, four (40 %) had TCC on the frozen section analysis and underwent completion ureterectomy. Five patients had RCC, and one patient had an oncocytoma. Mean age was 63.1 years (49-76) and mean tumor size was 4.0 cm (1.9-7.6). Mean operating time was 246 min (135-328). All patients had negative margins. Mean length of stay was 2.5 days. No recurrences were documented at median 8.5 months follow-up. For patients undergoing robotic nephrectomy for central renal tumors, intraoperative specimen evaluation can help determine the need for minimally invasive completion ureterectomy.

Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumour; its main symptom is pain, which is sometimes resistant to analgesic or anti-inflammatory medication. The surgical treatment consists of en bloc excision or curettage of the lesion. Several alternative methods have been proposed, among which CT guided-percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. We report on ten patients who were diagnosed clinically and radiologically as presenting an osteoid osteoma and were treated with this technique, with more than two years follow-up. Results were uniformly excellent. The pain was relieved and the rate of post-operative complications was very low. We recommend percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of this lesion.

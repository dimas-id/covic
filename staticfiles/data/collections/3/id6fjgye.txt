The human microbiome refers to all of the species that inhabit the human body, residing both on and in it. Over the past several years, there has been a significantly increased interest directed to the understanding of the microorganisms that reside on and in the human body. These studies of the human microbiome promise to reveal all these species and increase our understanding of the normal inhabitants, those that trigger disease and those that vary in response to disease conditions. It is anticipated that these directed research efforts, coupled with new technological advances, will ultimately allow one to gain a greater understanding of the relationships of these species with their human hosts. The various chapters in this book present a range of aspects of human microbiome research, explain the scientific and technological rationale, and highlight the significant potential that the results from these studies hold. In this chapter, we begin to address the potential and long-term implications of the knowledge gained from human microbiome research (which currently is centered in the developed world) for the developing world, which has often lagged behind in the benefits of these new technologies and their implications to new research areas.

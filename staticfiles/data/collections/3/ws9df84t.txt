In the current pandemic situation, the literature urges to consider the gender approach to avoid deepening existing inequalities, as already happened in previous epidemics. This field note aims to describe an experience of application of gender analysis to the impact of the pandemic on the public health, carried out by the students and teachers of the Diploma of Gender and Health of the Andalusian School of Public Health-University of Granada. The activity consisted of a review of the literature on caregiving and its impact on health in the context of health crisis, a gender analysis of information and shared reflection and debate. The debate was grouped into around five reflections, in which the care was putted in the center. Every reflection was linked to the need to incorporate the gender approach in measures and specific actions.

BACKGROUND Chronic leg ulcers are defined as those that show no tendency to heal after 3 months of appropriate treatment or are still not fully healed at 12 months. In this article, we present an approach to the challenging problem of chronic leg ulcers that is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine, i.e., the explicit use of the best available scientific evidence as a guide to treatment. METHODS Selective review of the relevant literature, including current guidelines and meta-analyses, concerning diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for chronic leg ulcers. RESULTS The main types of causally directed treatment are: vein surgery to eliminate pathological reflux, interventions to improve the circulation in arterial occlusive disease, and treatment of underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION Physicians providing modern evidence-based management of chronic leg ulcers should make use of their own clinical experience in combination with the best current scientific evidence. It seems clear that the many available treatment options should be evaluated critically in an interdisciplinary setting. In particular, causally directed treatment must be provided in addition to symptomatic, stage-based local wound treatment.

BACKGROUND Spinal aneurysms are rare among spinal arteriovenous malformations (SAVMs). There are few reports of endovascular management of spinal aneurysms associated with SAVM. OBJECTIVE To present endovascular management of aneurysms associated with SAVM. METHODS Of 91 patients with SAVMs,eight (9%) presented with aneurysms. Of these, three were male and five were female with a median age of 18 years (range 11-38). We evaluated the presenting pattern, lesion level, type of the target aneurysm related to the presenting pattern and AVM nidus, and the result obtained after embolization or open surgery. Clinical status was evaluated by Aminoff-Logue (ALS) gait and micturition scale scores. RESULTS The presenting patterns were subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH, n=3) or mass effect caused by extrinsic (n=4) or intrinsic (n=1) cord compression. Aneurysms were located in four cervical, two thoracic, and two lumbar enlargement areas. There were two prenidal (arterial), three nidal, and three postnidal (venous) aneurysms. The mean diameter of the aneurysms was 9 mm (range 3-27). Glue embolization (n=6), open surgery (n=1), and combined surgery and embolization (n=1) was performed to obliterate the aneurysms. Obliteration of the target aneurysms resulted in improvement of symptoms and clinical stabilization of SAVMs in all patients during a mean of 55 months (range 7-228) of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Identification of a symptomatic aneurysm should be associated with clinical presentation pattern. Targeted obliteration of the aneurysm by embolization and/or surgery resulted in improvement of symptoms and stabilization of SAVM.

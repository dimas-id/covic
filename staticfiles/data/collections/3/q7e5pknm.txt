The gene encoding the fusion (F) glycoprotein of pneumonia virus of mice consists of 1657 bases and contains an open reading frame encoding 537 amino acids which is more similar to the F proteins of pneumoviruses than to those of other paramyxoviruses. Computer-assisted sequence analyses can be combined with data on the antigenicity of various F proteins to suggest a possible arrangement of secondary structure elements common to all pneumovirus and paramyxovirus F proteins.

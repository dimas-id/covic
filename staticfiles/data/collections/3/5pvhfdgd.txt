Bioabsorbable internal fixation has been clinically available for nearly 20 years and has been used for hard tissue and/or soft tissue fixation from the head to toe. During this time, there has been a rapid evolution in bioabsorbable polymers as well as in the implants and their clinical applications. There is a plethora of bioabsorbable polymers now available for clinical use, and although all are related chemically, seemingly small changes in formulation can have a dramatic effect on their biomechanical and physiological properties. This article summarizes much of the relevant scientific, technical, and clinical literature in a simple, straightforward manner to help surgeons better understand and appreciate the nuances of bioabsorbable fixation. This up-to-date review should also help researchers establish a baseline of knowledge that can provide a platform for further developments in this exciting field.

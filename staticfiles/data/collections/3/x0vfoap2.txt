Heparin-binding proteins (HBP) from seminal plasma have been expected to participate in modulation of the acrosomal reaction, and have been correlated with fertility in some species. However, they have not been described in the dog. The aim of this study was to document the HBPs of canine seminal plasma. Six pooled samples of seminal plasma from three crossbred dogs were used. The HBPs were isolated by heparin affinity chromatography and the fractions recovered were pooled. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out on 12 and 18% vertical minigels. The stained gels were scanned and the molecular weight (kDa) values for each band within a lane were calculated by image analysis software. The electrophoresis analysis of the pooled eluded fractions identified 19 bands, with molecular weights varying from 61.5 to 5.2 kDa. Previous studies, using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, identified two bands (67 and 58.6 kDa), which were positively correlated with some semen parameters (sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal sperm and plasma membrane integrity). The 61.5 kDa band detected in the present study apparently corresponded to the 58.6 kDa band identified previously. Canine seminal plasma contained HBP; since HBP modulate the acrosome reaction in other species, they may have the same function in the dog. Further studies are necessary to better characterize this protein and determine if it is associated with fertility in the dog.

Background New dressings aimed at reducing surgical wound complications after knee arthroplasty continue to evolve. We compared wound complications and reoperations between 2 dressings: 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive and polyester mesh (Dermabond® Prineo®, "mesh") and silver-impregnated occlusive dressings and n-butyl-2-cyancacrylate adhesive (AQUACEL® Ag SURGICAL cover dressing with SwiftSet™, "standard"). Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed 353 consecutive partial and total knee arthroplasties performed by a single surgeon; 6 were excluded for not using either dressing type. Thus, 347 cases were separated into 2 cohorts: mesh (n = 176) and standard dressing (n = 171). Demographics and risk factors were similar, except for age. Surgical and closure techniques were consistent in all patients. Delayed wound healing was assessed by the surgeon at the 2-week office visit for drainage, suture abscess, or wound edge separation. Secondary outcome measures include infection, office-based closure, and return to the operating room for reclosure. Results There were 2 instances of delayed wound healing in the mesh group and 16 in the standard dressing group (1.14% vs 9.36%, P ≤ .0001). There were significantly fewer reoperations in the mesh group than in the standard group (0 vs 2.33%, P = .04). There were no infections or office-based closures. Conclusion Mesh dressings were associated with fewer episodes of delayed wound healing and reoperations than the standard dressing. A possible mechanism may be that this brand of mesh distributes wound tension more evenly. In addition, because it remains in place longer during the immediate postoperative period, it may work via prolonged wound edge support.

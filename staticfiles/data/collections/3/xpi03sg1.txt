BACKGROUND/AIM: Pneumonia is the most serious clinical presentation of COVID-19. This study is aimed to determine the demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings that can properly predict COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in Gazi University hospital. All hospitalized patients with confirmed and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between 16 March 2020, and 30 April 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. COVID-19 patients were separated into two groups as pneumonia and non-pneumonia and compared to determine predicting factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.20 and not correlated with each other were included in the logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 247 patients included in the study, the median age was 40, 58% was female. COVID-19 was confirmed in 70.9% of these patients. 21.4% of COVID-19 confirmed cases had pneumonia. In the multivariate analysis male sex (p = 0.028), hypertension (p = 0.022) and shortness of breath on hospital admission (p = 0.025) were significant factors predicting COVID-19 pneumonia Conclusion: Shortness of breath, male gender, and hypertension were significant for predicting COVID-19 pneumonia on admission. The patients with those factors should be evaluated more carefully for diagnostic procedures, such as thorax CT.

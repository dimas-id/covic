INTRODUCTION Progress in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures have been associated with improved survival in HSCT recipients. However, they have also brought to light organ-specific complications, especially pulmonary complications. In this setting, pulmonary complications are consistently associated with poor outcomes, and improved management of these complications is required. Areas covered: We review the multiple infectious and noninfectious lung complications that occur both early and late after allogeneic HSCT. This includes the description of these complications, risk factors, diagnostic approach and outcome. A literature search was performed using PubMed-indexed journals. Expert commentary: Multiple lung complications after allogeneic HSCT can be diagnosed concomitantly and require a multidisciplinary approach. A specific clinical evaluation including a precise analysis of a lung CT scan is necessary. Management of these lung complications, especially the noninfectious ones, is impaired by the lack of prospective, randomized control trials, suggesting preventive strategies should be developed.

PURPOSE Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a powerful procedure, achieving and maintaining significant weight loss remains challenging in superobese populations. Transit bipartition with sleeve gastrectomy is derived from biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and might improve weight loss control. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two series of 71 primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and transit bipartition (TB) with a body mass index ≥ 50 kg/m2 were retrospectively compared after 2 years. Postoperative course, side effects, nutritional status, and weight outcomes were reviewed. Weight was expressed as BMI, percentage of excess BMI lost (%EBMIL), and percentage of total weight lost (%TWL). RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable for age and BMI of 51.9 ± 1.8 for RYGB and 51.6 ± 5 for TB. TB was longer to perform (92 vs 74 min, p ≤ 0.001) with a 30-day complication rate of 4.2% and 5.6%, but there was 1 death after RYGB. Weight loss was greater after TB compared with RYGB with %EBMIL of 85.3 ± 15.8% vs 73.9 ± 17.2% (p = 0.0002). One TB patient suffered from protein malnutrition but none after RYGB. After TB, 7% of the patients experienced > 3 stools a day and 1 patient required revision, while 3 patients had diarrhea after RYGB. Late reoperations were required for 7 and 1 patients after RYGB and TB. Comorbidity improvement was similar. CONCLUSION In a superobese population, TB appeared relatively safer compared with RYGB. It achieved a better weight loss at 2 years with a trend for more digestive side effects.

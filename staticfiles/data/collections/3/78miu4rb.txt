Thromboembolism and myocardial injury are common in COVID-19 patients. Low molecular weight heparin appears to be associated with good prognosis in COVID-19 patients and has the ability to reduce coagulation and inflammation markers. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients should be placed on thromboprophylaxis with the option of full-therapeutic anticoagulation or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in high risk or mechanically ventilated patients. Thromboprophylaxis should also be considered at hospital discharge for high risk patients. Clinical judgment should be utilized to evaluate the bleeding and safety risk of anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients without confirmed data.

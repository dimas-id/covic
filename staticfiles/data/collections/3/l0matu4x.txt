PURPOSE: This is one of the first surveys of a USA-wide sample of full-time college students about their coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related experiences in spring 2020. METHODS: We surveyed 725 full-time college students aged 18–22 years recruited via Instagram promotions on April 25–30, 2020. We inquired about their COVID-19–related experiences and perspectives, documented opportunities for transmission, and assessed COVID-19's perceived impacts to date. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of participants experienced any COVID-19–related symptoms from February to April 2020, but less than 5% of them got tested, and only 46% stayed home exclusively while experiencing symptoms. Almost all (95%) had sheltered in place/stayed primarily at home by late April 2020; 53% started sheltering in place before any state had an official stay-at-home order, and more than one-third started sheltering before any metropolitan area had an order. Participants were more stressed about COVID-19's health implications for their family and for American society than for themselves. Participants were open to continuing the restrictions in place in late April 2020 for an extended period of time to reduce pandemic spread. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial opportunity for improved public health responses to COVID-19 among college students, including for testing and contact tracing. In addition, because most participants restricted their behaviors before official stay-at-home orders went into effect, they may continue to restrict movement after stay-at-home orders are lifted, including when colleges reopen for in-person activities, if they decide it is not yet prudent to circulate freely. The public health, economic, and educational implications of COVID-19 are continuing to unfold; future studies must continue to monitor college student experiences and perspectives.

Accumulating evidence suggests that influenza and influenza-like illnesses can act as a trigger for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite these unprecedented times providers should not overlook ACS guidelines, but may choose to modify the recommended approach in situations with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease. In this document, we suggest recommendations as to how to triage patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and provide with algorithms of how to manage the patients and decide the appropriate treatment options in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. We also address the inpatient logistics and discharge to follow-up considerations for the function of already established ACS network during the pandemic.

PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of single-stage endovascular treatment in patients with severe extracranial large vessel stenosis and concomitant ipsilateral unruptured intracranial aneurysm. METHODS Hospital database was screened for patients who underwent single-stage endovascular treatment between February 2008 and June 2013 and seven patients were identified. The procedures included unilateral carotid artery stenting (CAS) (n=4), bilateral CAS (n=2), and proximal left subclavian artery stenting (n=1) along with ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm treatment (n=7). The mean internal carotid artery stenosis was 81.6% (range, 70%-95%), and the subclavian artery stenosis was 90%. All aneurysms were unruptured. The mean aneurysm diameter was 7.7 mm (range, 5-13 mm). The aneurysms were ipsilateral to the internal carotid artery stenosis (internal carotid artery aneurysm) in five patients, and in the anterior communicating artery in one patient. The patient with subclavian artery stenosis had a fenestration aneurysm in the proximal basilar artery. Stenting of the extracranial large vessel stenosis was performed before aneurysm treatment in all patients. In two patients who underwent bilateral CAS, the contralateral carotid artery stenosis, which had no aneurysm distally, was treated initially. RESULTS There were no procedure-related complications or technical failure. The mean clinical follow-up period was 18 months (range, 9-34 months). One patient who underwent unilateral CAS experienced contralateral transient ischemic attack during the clinical follow-up. There was no restenosis on six-month follow-up angiograms, and all aneurysms were adequately occluded. CONCLUSION A single-stage procedure appears to be feasible for treatment of patients with severe extracranial large vessel stenosis and concomitant ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm.

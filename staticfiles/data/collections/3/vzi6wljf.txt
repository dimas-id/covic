In most rural areas of the world, approximately 90 % of the population is involved in farming as a way of earning a living. Small-scale farming, fishing, raising livestock and non-farm activities are some of the common livelihoods that these populations survive on. Rural livelihood poses a great challenge as these populations are often in a state of poverty where they lack the basic necessities for survival. A rural household with diverse sources of income earning activities has better chances of survival financially than a household which has only one source. Delivery of quality education and training in a variety of skills in rural areas is therefore needed to attain sustainable rural livelihoods. In order for a rural population to strive there is need for livelihoods that would sustain and support their households and communities.

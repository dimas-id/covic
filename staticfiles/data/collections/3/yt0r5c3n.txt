Dietary intake during pregnancy plays a vital role in determining the health of both mother and baby. Maternal undernutrition affects a large proportion of women in low and lower middle income countries (LLMIC) likely influencing high maternal, infant, and child mortality in these countries. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been proposed as effective solutions to improve maternal and neonatal health. This paper reviews the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on improving dietary/nutrients intake of pregnant women in LLMIC. Eight electronic databases were searched from inception up to April 2018, including the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Index Medicus, and Maternity and Infant Care. Using Covidence, two reviewers assessed articles for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Only studies published in English language were included. Data were summarised narratively. In total, 6,778 were identified of which four were included, with three randomised controlled trials and one prepost experimental study. Studies were conducted in India (n = 2), Indonesia (n = 1), and Kenya (n = 1). All articles evaluated the use of nutrient supplements; iron supplements (n = 1), vitamin supplements (composition not mentioned; n = 1), or calcium supplements (n = 1). This review suggests that mHealth interventions can be used to improve intake of micronutrient supplementation and nutritional status of pregnant women in LLMIC. Further studies are needed to address the limited evidence base related to mHealth nutrition interventions targeting dietary intakes of pregnant women in LLMIC.

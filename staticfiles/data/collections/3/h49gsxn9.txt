This chapter provides a brief summary of issues surrounding the utilization of nonhuman primates in biomedical research. Although a relatively small proportion of the total number of animals utilized in biomedical research, nonhuman primates occupy a unique position as the species most closely related to humans, and thus have the potential to provide highly relevant information regarding human health issues. Nonhuman primates are utilized across a wide diversity of research topics and examples are provided including infectious disease, neuroscience, and genomics. Pertinent information relating to ethical issues, species selection, housing, and specific pathogen-free status are provided as an overview of relevant issues associated with selection of nonhuman primate models. Selected references are provided as a reference for more comprehensive information relating to these topics.

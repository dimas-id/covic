We describe a 10-month-old boy diagnosed with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (XHIM) after suffering from life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), although his previous clinical history and first level laboratory tests investigating immunological function did not indicate immunodeficiency. When the patient's overall condition was good, elective bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched older brother was performed successfully. We describe how correct diagnosis and successful treatment were made possible thanks to the involvement of a network of specialists.

The objective of this study was to compare serum IgG concentrations, blood metabolites indicative of nutritional status, weight gain and mortality rate in goat kids fed a commercial colostral supplement containing immunoglobulins against several pathogen microorganisms, prior to the ingestion of the mother colostrum, and goat kids ingesting natural colostrum only. There was no difference in serum IgG concentrations between 27 kids fed a colostrum supplement (20 g, derived from cow lacteal secretions) prior to the kids’ first meal (658 ± 703 mg dl(−1)) and 21 kids ingesting maternal colostrum freely (1011 ± 1140 mg dl(−1)) at 24 hours of birth. Hematocrit values, serum glucose and urea concentrations at 24 hours and 5 days of age were unaffected by treatment. Serum total proteins were 14% higher (P < 0.05) in the unsuplemented group than in the supplemented group at 5 d of age. There was no significant difference between the supplemented and unsupplemented kids in daily weight gain from birth to 70 days of age (92 ± 4.8 vs 102 ± 5.1 g day(−1)). Mortality was 4% for kids receiving the colostrum supplement as compared with 0.0% for kids ingesting maternal colostrum only. Results suggest that, in intensively managed non-dairy goats with kiddings in summer, the supplementation of this commercial colostrum derived from cow lacteal secretions and containing antibodies against diverse pathogens organisms did not enhanced growth, survival or immunity under the farming conditions of this study.

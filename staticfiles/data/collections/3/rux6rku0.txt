The coronavirus infection (COVID‐19), first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, is a major public health crisis with new infections increasing exponentially worldwide. COVID‐19 is an acute infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV2) and has contributed to significant morbidity and mortality, including the development of coagulopathy. Similar thrombotic and thromboembolic events have occurred during other viral outbreaks, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS‐CoV), and influenza A H1N1.

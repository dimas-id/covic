INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Debate persists over whether surgery to correct pelvic organ prolapse (POP) should be combined with midurethral sling (MUS) insertion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) up to 12 months after transvaginal mesh surgery, with or without MUS, and to identify risk factors for postoperative SUI. METHODS This retrospective single-center study included patients who underwent transvaginal mesh surgery with Upholdâ„¢ between October 2010 and December 2017. The primary outcome was the prevalence of SUI at 12 months postoperatively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risks factors for postoperative SUI. RESULTS Of the 308 women included, 123 (40%) were continent (no SUI), 108 (35%) had SUI, and 76 (25%) had occult SUI. Forty-nine patients (15.9%) had a concomitant MUS procedure. At 12 months after surgery, 35.9% of patients without concomitant MUS had SUI vs 14.3% with (p = 0.003). Thirty-five patients (29%) developed de novo SUI. Postoperative complications were more common in patients with concomitant MUS (30.6% vs 17%; p = 0.003). The best predictor of postoperative SUI was the presence of preoperative SUI (OR 2.52 (1.25-5.09). Concomitant MUS (p < 0.001), and prior POP surgery (p = 0.034) were protective factors for postoperative SUI. CONCLUSION Preoperative SUI is the most important risk factor for postoperative SUI. However, given the higher risk of postoperative complications with concomitant MUS and the acceptable rate of de novo SUI rate without it, two-stage surgery seems preferable for patients with preoperative SUI.

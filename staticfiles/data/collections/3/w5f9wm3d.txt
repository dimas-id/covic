In the spring of 2003, a series of sudden deaths in a group of adult lions (Panthera leo) with a previous history of depression, inanition, and lethargy, was investigated. Five animals died within 24 to 36 hours after onset of signs of disease. Serologic screening for viral disease detection was negative, evidence of parasites was not detected, and results of a complete blood count and serum biochemical analysis were within reference intervals in all lions. The most relevant lesions observed were multiple areas of necrosis and hemorrhage in the intestinal outer muscular layer, and cellulitis with an intense bloody edema in the mesenteric and the pericardial fat tissue. On the basis of the fulminant course of the disease, the gross and histologic findings, and the isolation and identification of Clostridium sordellii, a diagnosis of infectious myositis and cellulitis associated with acute clostridiosis was made. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of sudden death associated with C. sordellii in felines.

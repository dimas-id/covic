Rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza is important for infection control, as well as for patient management. Alere i Influenza A&B is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based integrated system for detection and differentiation of influenza virus A and influenza virus B. The performance of the Alere i Influenza A&B was screened using frozen nasopharyngeal-swab specimens collected in viral transport medium (VTM) that were originally tested fresh with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) assay during the 2012-2013 influenza outbreak. In total, 360 VTM specimens were selected for Alere i Influenza A&B testing: 40 influenza virus A H1N1-2009 (influenza virus A-1), 40 influenza virus A H3N2 (influenza virus A-3), 37 influenza virus A "equivocal" or "no subtype detected" (influenza virus A-u), 41 influenza virus B, and 202 influenza virus-negative specimens, as initially determined by the FilmArray RP assay. The Alere assay showed sensitivities of 87.2%, 92.5%, 25.0%, and 97.4% for influenza virus A-1, influenza virus A-3, influenza virus A-u, and influenza virus B, respectively, after discordant resolution by Prodesse ProFLU+ PCR. The specificities were 100% for both influenza virus A and influenza virus B. In general, the Alere i Influenza A&B provided good sensitivity, although the assay did show poorer sensitivity with samples determined to have low influenza virus A titers by Prodesse ProFlu+ PCR (a mean real-time PCR threshold cycle [CT] value of 31.9 Â± 2.0), which included the majority of the samples called influenza virus A "equivocal" or "no subtype detected" by a single BioFire FilmArray RP test. The integrated, rapid, and simple characteristics of the Alere i Influenza A&B assay make it a potential candidate for point-of-care testing, with a test turnaround time of less than 15 min.

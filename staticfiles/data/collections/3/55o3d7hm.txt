Transarterial embolization is an established minimally invasive treatment for solid tumors. Unintended inflammation, foreign body reactions and ischemia-triggered neoangiogenesis are clinical drawbacks of permanent embolic materials. The aim of the current study was to characterize a new type of biodegradable starch microsphere with regard to angiographic and histopathological features such as patterns of acute arterial occlusion as well as induction of tissue necrosis, microsphere biodegradation, and inflammation and foreign body reactions during follow-up. Key characteristics of both biodegradable prototypes (L1 and L2; prototype groups) were as follows: microspheres are biodegradable by serum α-amylase, produced from chemically crosslinked potato starch to different extents, in a diameter range of ∼300-800 µm, differing in size distribution and featuring a microsphere deformation of ∼1%. In vivo transarterial embolization with L1 and L2, while applying clinical standard techniques, was performed and compared with clinically established permanent microspheres (Embosphere®500-700 and Embosphere®700-900; control groups). Twenty-four pig kidneys were embolized with the different embolic materials by following the study protocol, and there were no technical failures or complications. Parenchymal necrosis with interstitial calcification was observed in all kidneys independent of the type of embolic material used. Compared with the permanent embolic materials, biodegradable microspheres showed complete (L1) or partial (L2) biodegradation within one week after transarterial embolization, and induced a comparable (L1) or a lower (L2) degree of arterial wall necrosis and a lower degree of inflammation and foreign body reactions. In conclusion, the presented new type of biodegradable microsphere is promising, and could be further evaluated in terms of clinical translation.

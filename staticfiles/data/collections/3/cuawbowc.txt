Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is seriously endemic in China with 70%~90% of the notified cases worldwide and showing an epidemic tendency of upturn in recent years. Early detection for its future epidemic trends plays a pivotal role in combating this threat. In this scenario, our study investigates the suitability for application in analyzing and forecasting the epidemic tendencies based on the monthly HFRS morbidity data from 2005 through 2019 using the nonlinear model-based self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and logistic smooth transition autoregressive (LSTAR) methods. The experimental results manifested that the SETAR and LSTAR approaches presented smaller values among the performance measures in both two forecasting subsamples, when compared with the most extensively used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method, and the former slightly outperformed the latter. Descriptive statistics showed an epidemic tendency of downturn with average annual percent change (AAPC) of âˆ’5.640% in overall HFRS, however, an upward trend with an AAPC = 1.213% was observed since 2016 and according to the forecasts using the SETAR, it would seemingly experience an outbreak of HFRS in China in December 2019. Remarkably, there were dual-peak patterns in HFRS incidence with a strong one occurring in November until January of the following year, additionally, a weak one in May and June annually. Therefore, the SETAR and LSTAR approaches may be a potential useful tool in analyzing the temporal behaviors of HFRS in China.

Increasingly we are reaching a situation where current antimicrobial medicines are no longer effective for common infections, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a global public health crisis. The reliance on antimicrobials such as antibiotics has become a major issue for both medicine and agriculture, particularly given the slow development of new medicines and pharmaceutical industry investment. The UK government has been working with other international bodies in the search for solutions to the many challenges AMR poses. Herbal medicines may provide a useful modality in the fight against AMR and can work solely or in tandem with current antimicrobial approaches. Recommendations for herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak have featured in Chinese national guidelines and policies, but UK strategies have no such guidance. More research is urgently needed to explore the biological plausibility and safety of herbal medicines to manage AMR. AMR is universal, affecting anyone and everyone, at any age and in any country. Investigating how such approaches can be integrated into western medicine will be important to elucidate.

Summary Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease affectingruminants and pigs. In countries in which control of FMD relies predominantly on vaccination, young stock ingest specific anti-FMD virus antibodies in the colostrum. This maternally-derived antibody (MDA) provides immediate protection against infection with FMD virus, but also interferes with the development of active immunity following vaccination. However, susceptibility to infection precedes the ability to respond to vaccination in the presence of MDA. Currently available vaccines cannot overcome this inhibitory effect of MDA, and protection of young stock can only be provided by their- isolation from FMD virus.

This is a case report of a 42-year-old patient, who was admitted to hospital with clinical pneumonia The only positive test result was for SARS-CoV-2 After a few days of treatment, the patient was discharged in stable condition for isolation at home The patient had previously had contact with the mental health services and was diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia but had been without outpatient contact or treatment for the last four years After seven days he was admitted in a state of severe psychosis This begs the question if the psychotic relapse was triggered by a neuroinflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2

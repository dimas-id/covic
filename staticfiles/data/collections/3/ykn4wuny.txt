Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition characterized by lower respiratory tract symptoms, airflow obstruction, and airway inflammation. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration in respiratory health termed exacerbations. Exacerbations are responsible for much of the morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with COPD, and also affect the rate of decline in lung function. Most exacerbations are caused by episodes of tracheobronchial infection. The clinical features comprise a worsening in symptoms beyond usual day-to-day variation. Examination may reveal tachypnea and signs of respiratory failure. Pathologically, exacerbations are associated with an increase in airway and systemic inflammation which, at least in more severe disease, is predominantly neutrophilic. Simple investigations are indicated to exclude differential diagnoses and assess exacerbation severity. Treatment aims to support respiratory function whilst drugs aimed at the underlying cause are able to act. The cornerstone of therapy is inhaled bronchodilators, with oral corticosteroids in all but the mildest exacerbations. Antibiotics are indicated if there has been a change in the character of the sputum. Some patients with respiratory failure will require supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation. Strategies to prevent exacerbations include inhaled corticosteroids, long acting bronchodilators, and influenza vaccination.

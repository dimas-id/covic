Self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) has emerged as a vital strategy to formulate poor water soluble compounds for bioavailability enhancement. However, certain limitations are associated with SMEDDS formulations which include in vivo drug precipitation, formulation handling issues, limited lymphatic uptake, lack of predictive in vitro tests and oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. These limitations restrict their potential usage. Inclusion of polymers or precipitation inhibitors within lipid based formulations helps to maintain drug supersaturation after dispersion. This, thereby, improves the bioavailability and reduces the variability on exposure. Also, formulating solid SMEDDS helps to overcome liquid handling and stability problems. Usage of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and suitable antioxidants to minimize oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids are few of the steps to overcome the limitations associated with SMEDDS. The review discussed here, in detail, the limitations of SMEDDS and suitable measures that can be taken to overcome them.

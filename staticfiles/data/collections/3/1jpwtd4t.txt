Traditional teaching suggests that corticosteroids should be avoided during acute infectious episodes for fear of compromising the immune response.

We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the current strength of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in specified infections, and to make appropriate graded recommendations.

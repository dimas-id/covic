Quarantine is a well-known risk factor for psychological and psychiatric disturbances. We evaluated burden of migraine during lockdown due to COVID 19 pandemia. Forty-nine subjects followed in our headache clinic for migraine were evaluated for migraine burden by means of global assessment of migraine severity (GAMS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) by phone interview. Moreover, depression and anxiety were quantified by Beck depression inventory (BDI) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). We evaluated changes in the value of migraine score from the 2 months immediately before lockdown (from January 1 to March 9) to the 2 months of quarantine (from March 10 to May 3). Value of GAMS was 5.61 ± 0.76 before and 4.16 ± 1.46 during quarantine (p < .001). VAS was 7.49 ± 1.10 before and 5.47 ± 1.88 during quarantine (p < .001). We also found a time by depression level interaction, F(1,47) = 6.21, p = .016, F(1,47) = 14.52, p < .006, respectively, showing that subjects with lower level of depression had better course of migraine. In conclusion, we showed that, during quarantine due to COVID pandemia, subjects with migraine had fewer migraine attacks and lesser pain and show moderate level of depression, correlated to migraine burden.

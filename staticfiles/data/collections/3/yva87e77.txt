Neonatal calves were fed whole milk (control) or one of three milk replacers with one-third of the total protein supplied by casein, Promocaf (a commercial soy protein concentrate), or an experimental soy flour. Xylose absorption was studied at 3 and 8 wk after a 12-h fast. Urine was collected for 5 h, and jugular blood was sampled at 0, 2.5, and 5 h after administration of xylose. Urinary excretions of xylose at 8 wk were 3.4, 5.3, 7.8, and 21.3% of xylose administered, respectively, for calves fed Promocaf, soy flour, casein, and milk. Increases in plasma xylose 2.5 h after administration were 7.7, 21.3, 31.8, and 46.5 mg/dl. Calves were sacrificed at 12 or 14 wk and duodenal tissues sampled for scanning electron microscopy. Micrographs revealed normal intestinal morphology with long, round, tapering villi when milk was fed. Casein feeding produced shorter, broader villi than did feeding whole milk. Abnormalities included absence of villi and short, blunted, convoluted villi on mucosal surfaces of calves fed soy proteins. Reduced surface area for intestinal absorption probably resulted from villous atrophy in calves with abnormal mucosae. Impairment of absorptive ability appears to be associated with morphological changes in intestinal structure.

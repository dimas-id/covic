The aims of the present work were to determine the prevalence and titer of serum antibodies against several rotavirus VP8* proteins from different P genotypes in children and adults in Valencia, Spain; and to determine the role of the secretor status (FUT2(G428A) polymorphism) in the antibody response. The VP8* protein from the P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], P[11], P[14] and P[25] genotypes were produced in E. coli. These proteins were tested with 88 serum samples from children (n = 41, 3.5 years old in average) and from adults (n = 47, 58 years old in average) by ELISA. A subset of 55 samples were genotyped for the FUT2(G428A) polymorphism and the antibody titers compared. The same subset of samples was also analysed by ELISA using whole rotavirus Wa particles (G1P[8]) as antigen. Ninety-three per cent of the samples were positive for at least one of the VP8* antigens. Differences in the IgG seroprevalence were found between children and adults for the P[4], P[8] and P[11] genotypes. Similarly, significant differences were found between adults and children in their antibody titers against the P[4], P[8], and P[11] VP8* genotypes, having the children higher antibody titers than adults. Interestingly, positive samples against rare genotypes such as P[11] (only in children), P[14] and P[25] were found. While no statistical differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found for any of the tested P genotypes studied, a higher statistic significant prevalence for the P[25] genotype was found in secretors compared to non-secretors. Significant differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found when the whole viral particles from the Wa rotavirus strain (G1P[8]) were used as the antigen.

ELANE neutropenia is associated with myelodysplasia and acute leukemia (MDS–AL), and severe infections. Because the MDS–AL risk has also been shown to be associated with exposure to GCSF, since 2005, in France, patients receiving high daily GCSF doses (>15 μg/kg/day) are eligible for HSCT, in addition to classic indications (MDS–AL or GCSF refractoriness). We analyzed the effect of this policy. Among 144 prospectively followed ELANE-neutropenia patients enrolled in the French Severe Congenital Neutropenia Registry, we defined two groups according to period: “before 2005” for those born before 2005 and followed until 31/12/2004 (1588 person-years); and “after 2005” comprised of those born after 2005 or born before 2005 but followed after 2005 until 31/03/2019 (1327 person-years). Sixteen of our cohort patients underwent HSCT (14 long-term survivors) and six developed MDS–ALs. Six leukemic transformations occurred in the before-2005 group and none after 2005 (respective frequencies 3.8 × 10(–3) vs. 0; P < 0.01), while four HSCTs were done before 2005 and 12 since 2005 (respective HSCT rates increased 2.5 × 10(–3) vs. 9 × 10(–3); P < 0.01). Our results support early HSCT for patients with ELANE mutations who received high GCSF doses, as it might lower the risk of leukemic transformation.

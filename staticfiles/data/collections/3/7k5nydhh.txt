PURPOSE To assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) donor nephrectomy (LESSDN) procedure after experience with the LESS-plus-one-trocar donor nephrectomy (LEPODN) procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 2009 to 2014, 126 left laparoscopic donor nephrectomies (LDNs) were performed, including 59 Standard (Std)-LDN, 30 LEPODN, and 37 LESSDN. In the LEPODN procedure, a 5-mm trocar was added as a right-hand working trocar to the LESSDN procedure. A GelPOINT(Â®) platform was applied on a pararectal single incision in both LEPODN and LESSDN procedures. After performing the LEPODN procedure several times, each surgeon performed the LESSDN procedure. RESULTS Std-LDN, LEPODN, and LESSDN procedures were performed by 10, 10, and 7 surgeons, respectively. The mean operative time, estimated blood loss, warm ischemia time, time to ambulation, and length of postoperative hospital stay were the shortest for the LESSDN procedure (P<0.012, P=0.007, P<0.001, P=0.027, and P=0.001, respectively). No significant difference in the complication rate, delayed graft function rate, and mean 7-day post-transplant serum creatinine levels was observed among the three procedures. Individual results of the operative time and estimated blood loss for the LESSDN procedure were not significantly inferior to those of Std-LDN and LEPODN procedures for each surgeon. CONCLUSIONS The LESSDN procedure can be introduced safely and effectively without compromising the operative time, complication rate, and graft function after experience with the LEPODN procedure among multiple surgeons. The LEPODN procedure may be an effective bridge from standard multiport LDN to LESSDN.

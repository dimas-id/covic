Two trillion dollars later, with states fighting for ventilators and other COVID‐19 equipment, the opioid epidemic, with methamphetamine close on its heels, has not abated. If anything, it has gotten worse. There was no money in the CARES Act for single state authorities (SSAs) in charge of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant. Nothing in it recommends that money be put in the SAPT block grant — as the SSAs had requested. Nothing in it allows the rule related to mobile units for methadone to be made effective immediately (which the SSAs and others had requested). The SSAs also recommended allowing State Opioid Response year 3 money to be used to address what states are seeing on the ground, giving them more flexibility. Nope.

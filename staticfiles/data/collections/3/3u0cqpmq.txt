The da Vinci single port surgical system (SP) is the newest iteration of robotic technology, which combines the camera and all instruments into a single port. Robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion has classically been a difficult operation. Here we describe our technique for RARC with the SP and review our initial outcomes and data in the literature. Four patients at our institution underwent single port robotic assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal ileal conduit using the da Vinci SP surgical system. Operative steps were performed as described. Perioperative outcomes were reviewed. All patients successfully underwent the procedure without intraoperative complications. The average operative time was 270 minutes with an EBL of 250 cc. The average nodal harvest was 12.5. The average length of stay was 5.5 days. There was one 30-day Clavien Grade II complication and no additional 90-day complications. With our initial experience with the da Vinci surgical system, radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion can be performed safely and quickly with the right technique. Our outcomes are similar to other initially published data. Further study is necessary to determine the additional benefits and clinical outcomes.

INTRODUCTION Several techniques have been used for arthroscopic repair of middle segment, posteromedial or posterolateral corner tears of the meniscus. One of the commonly used methods is the inside-out double arm needle technique. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE We have developed a vertical mattress absorbable suture technique. It is easy to perform with a small sized skin incision for knot tying. This technique just necessitates 1 or 2 spinal needles for repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2010 and February 2012, 20 menisci were treated by this technique, a modified method of the outside-in vertical meniscal repair using a spinal needle and No. 2 PDS absorbable suture material. Evaluation of clinical results was done using the Lysholm score. RESULTS The mean preoperative Lysholm score was 63.9 and the mean postoperative score was 97.3. A second look arthroscopy was performed in 13 knees (65%) and the repair sites were well healed. CONCLUSIONS We recommend this method as an alternative technique for repair of the middle segment, posteromedial or posterolateral corner of the meniscus.

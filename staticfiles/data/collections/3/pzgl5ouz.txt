Abstract Primary infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) predisposes cattle to secondary infection with bacteria that cause bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). However, the interaction between BRSV and bacteria is unclear. This in vitro study examined the adherence of Pasteurella multocida (PM) to BRSV-infected cells was assessed in colony forming unit assays, by flow cytometry analysis, and by indirect immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of epithelial cells (A549, HEp-2, and MDBK). An in vitro model based on infection of BRSV-infected epithelial cells revealed that PM adherence to BRSV-infected cells was 2- to 8-fold higher than uninfected cells. This was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and IFA. Epithelial cell expression of mRNA encoding cytokines and chemokines increased after exposure to PM, but increased further after co-infection with BRSV and PM. BRSV-mediated adherence of PM to epithelial cells may underlie the serious symptoms of BRDC.

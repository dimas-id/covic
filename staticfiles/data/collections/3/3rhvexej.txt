OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cardiopulmonary effects of low-pressure (6 mmHg) peritoneal insufflation of varying duration in healthy cats during ovariectomy (OVE). STUDY DESIGN Prospective, randomized study. ANIMALS Female cats (n = 24). METHODS After anesthesia induction, cats had short (Short LAP; n = 8) or long duration (Long LAP; n = 8) laparoscopic ovariectomy, or Open OVE (Open; n = 8) for comparison. Hemodynamic and pulmonary measurements were recorded after induction of anesthesia (T0), 5 minutes after abdominal insufflation had reached 6 mmHg of pressure (T1), after the 2nd ovary had been resected (T2), after abdominal decompression (T3), and at the end of anesthesia, after abdominal closure (T4). Hemodynamic and pulmonary variables were compared between groups. RESULTS Low-pressure abdominal insufflation caused cardiopulmonary changes in cats. At T1 and T2, Long LAP and Short LAP caused a significant change in PvCO2 and RC when compared with Open. During T3, RC was lower only in Long LAP. At T2, there was decrease in SV, but not CO for Long LAP when compared with Open. CONCLUSIONS Duration of insufflation was associated with worsening of negative cardiopulmonary effects; however, these effects were reversible and resolved by the end of the procedure.

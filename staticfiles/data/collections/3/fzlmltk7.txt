Since the discovery of human bocavirus (hBoV), the virus has been detected worldwide in respiratory tract samples from young children by various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and real-time PCRs (Q-PCR). Until now, no data have been reported on the presence of hBoV in Belgium and the detection of hBoV in a multiplex Q-PCR setting has not been described. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and reliable multiplex Q-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hBoV DNA and adenovirus (AdV) DNA. During the winter of 2004â€“2005, 445 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were analysed from 404 Belgian children up to 5 years old with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). (Co)infections with hBoV, AdV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza A virus were investigated. A viral agent was detected in 61% (n = 272/445) of the NPAs. Multiplex Q-PCR found a prevalence of 11% (n = 51/445) hBoV and 13% (n = 58/445) AdV. Coinfections were more frequently found with AdV (62%; n = 36/58) than with hBoV (49%; n = 25/51). Follow-up samples were available from 22 patients with ARTIs. In three patients, hBoV DNA persisted for one month. Multiplex Q-PCR may help in closing the diagnostic gap by addressing a broader range of potential respiratory pathogens.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE Coil migration is a potential complication of endovascular aneurysm treatment. Dislodged coils into the parent artery require retrieval to prevent thromboembolic complications. A variety of techniques for coil retrieval have been described, including the use of single stentrievers and aspiration catheters. CLINICAL PRESENTATION The use of 2 stentrievers, as opposed to a single device, was thought to be advantageous in coil removal by the additional point of friction due to the extensive length of coil stretching and earlier failure of a single device. CONCLUSION In this report, 2 synchronous Solitaire FR Revascularization Devices (Covidien/Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) were deployed, 1 distal and 1 proximal, to retrieve an inadvertently deployed coil.

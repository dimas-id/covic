International travel goes hand-in-hand with medical delivery to underserved communities. The global health care worker (HCW) can be exposed to a wide range of infectious diseases during their global experiences. A pre-travel risk assessment visit and all appropriate vaccinations and education are performed. Universal practices of water safety, food safety, and insect avoidance will prevent a majority of travel related infections and complications. Region specific vaccinations will further reduce illness risk.. An understanding of common travel related illness signs and symptoms is helpful. Lastly, emerging pathogens that can cause a pandemic, such as SARS-CoV-2, should be understood to avoid healthcare worker infection and spread in the workplace and when returning home.

Current proposals for quantum compilers involve the synthesis and optimization of linear reversible circuits and among them CNOT circuits. This class of circuits represents a significant part of the cost of running an entire quantum circuit and therefore we aim at reducing the size of CNOT circuits. In this paper we present a new algorithm for the synthesis of CNOT circuits based on the solution of the syndrome decoding problem. Our method addresses the case of ideal hardware with an all-to-all qubit connectivity and the case of near-term quantum devices with restricted connectivity. Benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in both cases of partial and full connectivity.

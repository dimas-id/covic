This Journal recently published two papers describing autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (1, 2). AIHA is characterized by the destruction of red cells by autoantibodies, but the mechanism underpinning autoimmunity in COVID-19 patients has yet to be elucidated.

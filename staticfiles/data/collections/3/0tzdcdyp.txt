A combined comparative virological, morphological, and immunological study of experimental coronavirus encephalomyelitis was carried out in mice in order to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the formation of the foci of lesions in acute and chronic forms of the disease. Intracerebral inoculation of C3H mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus induces a disease with demyelinization foci in the CNS running acute, subacute, or chronic course. This model underlies a concept that demyelinating diseases are caused by viruses producing immunopathologic responses realized via certain histocompatibility loci. The long-term persistence of viral antigen in the CNS and liver may be explained by virus replication in hepatocytes and oligodendrocytes at low levels, and exacerbations of the disease are prevented by the immune system.

This paper reports the case of a ruptured aneurysm in the vasa corona at the craniocervical junction with dysgenesis of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Dysgenesis of the proximal PICA in the present case caused the development of a pial anastomosis in the vasa corona, resulting in the formation of an aneurysm because of increased haemodynamic stress at the vasa corona. The aneurysm was successfully treated with transarterial coil embolization. The clinical entity in the present case is extremely rare and it is important to consider an aberrant vascular anomaly as the cause of an isolated spinal aneurysm.

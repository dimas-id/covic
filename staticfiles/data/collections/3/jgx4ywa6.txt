A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of a cerebral aneurysm that was incidentally found. The aneurysm was 7 mm in size and located on the left anterior communicating artery. Using a balloon assisted technique, we performed coil embolization. During the second coil insertion, the first coil was dislodged into the anterior communicating artery. We attempted coil retrieval using a snare, which was unsuccessful. We applied a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) and advanced a Penumbra 4MAX immediately proximal to the dislodged coil; the dislodged coil was then successfully retrieved. ADAPT is a simple procedure for retrieval of a detached coil, and it can be used as an alternative to the snare technique.

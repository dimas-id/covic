The synthesis of nanostructured materials can be considered a research field of high importance, especially in the recent past, due to the unique properties that make these materials applicable in different fields of science and technology. Metallic nanoparticles gained significant interest due to the possibility to obtain them through biological means, among other techniques. Silver nanoparticles are some of the most investigated metallic nanoparticles, due to their recognized anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral potential. This chapter aims to summarize the emerging efforts to address current challenges and solutions in the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly through the use of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized via microbes and plants pathways.

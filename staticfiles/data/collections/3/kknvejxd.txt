Antisense oligonucleotides are recognized to be very efficient tools for the inhibition of gene expression in a sequence specific way. For the discovery of a novel efficient way to modify oligonucleotides, a series of single isonucleotide-incorporated antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been synthesized, in which an isonucleotide was introduced at different positions of the sequences. The binding behaviors of modified oligodeoxynucleotides to the complementary sequence were studied by UV, CD, and molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that although the incorporated isonucleotides at certain positions of the sequence interfere with the binding ability to a different extent, B-form duplexes were maintained and the binding abilities of the 3'-end-modified duplexes were better than the corresponding mismatched duplexes. The digestion of modified oligodeoxynucleotides by snake venom phosphodiesterase showed that an isonucleotide strongly antagonizes hydrolysis. The DNA/RNA hybrid formed by a modified oligodeoxynucleotide and its target RNA could activate RNase H. The 3'-end-modified antisense oligodeoxynucelotides inhibited S-glycoprotein expression of SARS-CoV at the mRNA levels in insect Sf9 cells. This study indicated the possibility of designing a novel and effective antisense oligodeoxynucleotide by incorporating an isonucleotide at the 3'-end of the sequence.

INTRODUCTION Single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy is one of the most interesting surgical advances. Here, we evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy as treatment for a right-sided aldosterone-producing adenoma. CASE PRESENTATION A 39-year-old Japanese woman presented with hypertension and hypokalemia. Abdominal computed tomography and an endocrinological workup revealed a 19mm right adrenal tumor with primary aldosteronism. Our patient was informed of the details of the surgical procedure and our efforts to reduce the number of incisions needed - ideally, to a single incision - when removing her adrenal gland. A single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy was attempted. A multichannel port was inserted through a 2.5cm umbilical incision. A 5mm flexible laparoscope, articulating laparoscopic dissector and tissue sealing device were the primary tools used in the operation. The right liver lobe was evaluated using a percutaneous instrument, providing good visualization of the operative field surrounding her right adrenal gland. The single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy was successfully completed without any intraoperative complications. The operating time was 76 minutes, and her blood loss was 5mL. Oral intake was resumed on the first postoperative day, and the length of her hospital stay was three days. Her postoperative course was uneventful with no morbidity within one month of follow-up, and our patient had excellent cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS Single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a safe and feasible procedure for patients with a right-sided adrenal tumor when performed by a surgeon experienced in laparoscopic and adrenal surgery. However, more surgical experience using this technique is required to confirm our initial impressions.

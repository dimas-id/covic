BACKGROUND The benefit of using the laparoscopic approach in minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has not been established. We therefore compared the outcome of esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer performed with open surgery, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)/laparotomy (hybrid MIE), and VATS/ laparoscopy (total MIE). METHODS Patients with esophageal cancer undergoing tri-incisional esophagectomy with three different approaches between 2005 and 2009 were analyzed from a prospective database. RESULTS Three groups of patients underwent esophagectomy by open surgery (n = 64), hybrid MIE (n = 44), and total MIE (n = 30). The total MIE group had significantly longer operative times but had shorter postoperative ventilator usage times postoperative hospital stay, and they began jejunostomy feeding sooner (P < 0.05, compared with the other groups). There was a significant trend toward a decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications and anastomotic leakage in parallel to the proportion of minimally invasive procedures for esophagectomy (P < 0.05 for the trend test), with a significant difference between the open surgery and total MIE groups (30% vs. 6.7%, and 28% vs. 6.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Use of a laparoscopic procedure in MIE for patients with esophageal cancer might provide benefit by facilitating postoperative recovery and reducing the rates of post-esophagectomy pulmonary complications and anastomotic leakage.

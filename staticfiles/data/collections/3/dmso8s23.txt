Community health workers (CHWs) can reduce health disparities for low income patients but type of contact and outcomes has had limited study. Low-income Hispanic primary care patients with hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥ 9% received care managment (CM) over 6 months classified as: (CM1) telephone only; (CM2) clinic visit but no calls; (CM3) clinic visit with calls; and (CM4) ≥ 2 visits ± calls. Type of CM delivery and time to DM control (HbA1c < 9%) examined in Cox proportional hazards model and more rapid control within 6 months using logistic regression. Models adjusted for demographics, clinical, and health care variables. At baseline, 523 patients had mean HbA1c 10.9% (SD = 1.7%), mean age 57.9 years (SD = 10), 58.5% women, 87.6% Hispanic, and 55.5% uninsured. CM types for patients: 51 (9.8%) CM1; 192 (36.7%) CM2; 44 (8.4%) CM3; and 236 (45.4%) CM4. Median time to HbA1c control was 197 days (95% CI [71, 548]) and 41.5% achieved control within 6 months. Compared with CM1, control was more rapid for CM2 (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% CI [1.01, 2.09], p = 0.043) and CM4 but not significant (HR [95% CI] 1.29 [0.91, 1.83], p = 0.15). Adjusted odds of more rapid control within 6 months were twofold higher for CM2 (p = 0.04) and CM4 (p = 0.055), respectively, versus CM1. CM2 did not differ from CM1. DM control was less likely for CM by telephone only than face-to-face in clinic. To benefit vulnerable patients with uncontrolled DM, in-person engagement may be required.

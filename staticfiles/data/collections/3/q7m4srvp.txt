PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The main goal of this article is to discuss how the development of state-of-the-art technology has made it possible to address fundamental questions related to how the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) operates within the brain from the neurophysiological and molecular perspective. RECENT FINDINGS: The existence of the brain RAS remains surprisingly controversial. New sensitive in situ hybridization techniques and novel transgenic animals expressing reporter genes have provided pivotal information of the expression of RAS genes within the brain. We discuss studies using genetically engineered animals combined with targeted viral microinjections to study molecular mechanisms implicated in the regulation of the brain RAS. We also discuss novel drugs targeting the brain RAS that have shown promising results in clinical studies and trials. SUMMARY: Over the last 50 years, several new physiological roles of the brain RAS have been identified. In the coming years, efforts to incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, and single-cell RNA sequencing will lead to dramatic advances in our full understanding of how the brain RAS operates at molecular and neurophysiological levels.

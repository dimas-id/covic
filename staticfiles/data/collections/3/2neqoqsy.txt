The GIS plays a vital role in public health information visualization for public health information management, broadcasting, data management, statistical analysis, and decision supporting. This paper described the elementary requirement and the essential technology for public health information visualization and proposed a framework of the unified public health information visualization platform based on the Web GIS and visualization technology. The system framework adopted multi-tier system infrastructure that consist the sever tier and the front tier. In the server tier, the J2EE based architecture was adopted to construct a distrusted system infrastructure. In the front tier, the GIS map java applet is used to show the public health information with spatial graphical map, and the web based graphics figures such as curves, bars, maps and multi-dimensional visualization technology are used to visualize the public health information. The public health information contained the geo-referenced data, such as specific location, area code, latitude and longitude, street address, and geopolitical boundaries can be visualized with GIS distribution maps. The system infrastructure, functions, system integration, and some key technology were discussed in this paper. It would have the important practical value for constructing the visible public health information system.

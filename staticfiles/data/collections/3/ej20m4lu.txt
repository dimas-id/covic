OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to report unanticipated lung base findings on abdominal CT in 23 patients concerning for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In these patients, who were not previously suspected of having COVID-19, abdominal pain was the most common indication for CT (n = 19), and 11 patients had no extrapulmonary findings. Seventeen patients underwent polymerase chain reaction testing, which returned positive results for all 17. CONCLUSION. Unsuspected coronavirus disease may be strongly suggested on the basis of lung findings on abdominopelvic CT.

The entire S1 protein genes of eight infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine strains used in China were compared with those of the IB virus isolates present in the field in China. The nucleotide and amino acid similarities between the eight IB vaccine strains and the field strain, tl/CH/LDT3/03, which was isolated from a teal (Anas sp.), were not more than 81.1% and 79.2%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 genes showed that the vaccines and field strains belonged to different clusters and showed larger evolutionary distances, and indicated that they were of different genotypes. Four out of the eight vaccines, in addition to the Massachusetts type vaccine H120, were used for protection tests against challenge by the IB virus isolate tl/CH/LDT3/03. This revealed that each of the five IB vaccines induced poor protection against the teal isolate, as assessed by respiratory protection, clinical signs and mortality, indicating the necessity of developing vaccines from local strains for IB control in China.

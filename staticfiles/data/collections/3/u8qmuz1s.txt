Cyclophilins play a key role in the life cycle of coronaviruses. Alisporivir (Debio 025) is a nonimmunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporine with potent cyclophilin inhibition properties. Alisporivir reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA production in a dose-dependent manner in Vero E6 cells, with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.46 ± 0.04 µM. Alisporivir inhibited a postentry step of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. These results justify rapidly conducting a proof-of-concept phase 2 trial with alisporivir in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

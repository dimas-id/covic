Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy was first reported 20 years ago. This technique uses a small umbilical incision and 2 small upper abdominal incisions. During the last 5 years, this approach has become the preferred technique for many pediatric surgeons in the infant who needs a pyloromyotomy. Recently, with the advent of single-site umbilical laparoscopic surgery, this approach is being used for several common pediatric conditions, including pyloric stenosis. This article will describe the single-site approach used at the Children's Hospital of Alabama and the early outcomes from its use in a relatively small group of infants. An improvement in the cosmetic appearance of the abdominal wall with the single-site approach appears to be the primary reason for its use.

Current dogma holds that the innate immune system primes the adaptive immune system in response to infection, which in turn amplifies innate responses in a positive loop to effectively control pathogens. Therefore, it is accepted in most cases that T-cell deficient hosts die of acute infection because of the impaired ability of the innate immune system to control pathogens. Recent studies, however, reveal that adaptive immune cells actively dampen initial innate responses. In contrast to current understanding, there is now evidence that an insufficient number of T cells results in loss of control of innate immune responses. This raises new questions regarding the, as of yet underappreciated, role of the adaptive immune system in early infection and inflammation.

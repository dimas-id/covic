Abstract Small non-coding RNAs, which are 20â€“25 nucleotide ribonucleic acids, have emerged as an important transformation in the biological evolution over almost three decades. microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are two significant categories of the small RNAs that exert important effects on bone endocrinology and skeletology. Therefore, clarifying the expression and function of these important molecules in bone endocrine physiology and pathology is of great significance for improving their potential therapeutic value for metabolism-associated bone diseases. In the present review, we highlight the recent advances made in understanding the function and molecular mechanism of these small non-coding RNAs in bone metabolism, especially their potentially therapeutic values in bone-related diseases.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a paradigm shift in disease management. Since immunosuppression may cause increased susceptibility to COVID-19, there is uncertainty as to whether systemically treated nail psoriasis patients are at increased infection risk. While specific data on nail psoriasis treatments and COVID-19 is lacking, we present clinical trial data on rates of upper respiratory infections, nasopharyngitis, viral infection, pneumonia and overall infections. Some systemic medications and biologics are associated with increased in infections risk compared to placebo in clinical trials. However, this data should be regarded cautiously since clinical trials on nail psoriasis, particularly controlled studies, are lacking. Our recommendations may be helpful in guiding physicians managing nail psoriasis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

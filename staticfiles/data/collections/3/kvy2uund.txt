Persistent and stable expression of foreign genes has been achieved in mammalian cells by integrating the genes into the host chromosomes. However, this approach has several shortcomings in practical applications. For example, large scale production of protein pharmaceutics frequently requires laborious amplification of the inserted genes to optimize the gene expression. The random chromosomal insertion of exogenous DNA also results occasionally in malignant transformation of normal tissue cells, raising safety concerns in medical applications. Here we report a novel cytoplasmic RNA replicon capable of expressing installed genes stably without chromosome insertion. This system is based on the RNA genome of a noncytopathic variant Sendai virus strain, Cl.151. We found that this variant virus establishes stable symbiosis with host cells by escaping from retinoic acid-inducible gene I-interferon regulatory factor 3-mediated antiviral machinery. Using a cloned genome cDNA of Sendai virus Cl.151, we developed a recombinant RNA installed with exogenous marker genes that was maintained stably in the cytoplasm as a high copy replicon (about 4 x 10(4) copies/cell) without interfering with normal cellular function. Strong expression of the marker genes persisted for more than 6 months in various types of cultured cells and for at least two months in rat colonic mucosa without any apparent side effects. This stable RNA replicon is a potentially valuable genetic platform for various biological applications.

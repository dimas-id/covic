Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease in the new millennium. It has been ascertained that a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV, is the etiological agent of SARS. While the extraordinarily rapid isolation and full genome sequencing of SARS-CoV constituted a remarkable scientific achievement, identification of the actual animal reservoir(s) of SARS-CoV is more difficult. Initial evidences indicated that the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) was the primary suspect of the animal origin of SARS (Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005). Recent studies suggested that horseshoe bat is one of the real reservoirs (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) and masked palm civet may have only served as an intermediate amplification host for SARS-CoV and fulfilled efficient interspecies transmission (Lau et al., 2005). This chapter will summarize the studies on the animal reservoir(s) of SARS-CoV.

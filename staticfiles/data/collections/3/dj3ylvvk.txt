The diagnosis and treatment of patellofemoral disorders can challenge even the experienced orthopedic surgeon. Differential diagnosis is broad and multiple anatomic abnormalities must be taken into account in order to manage care. The majority of patients with patellofemoral disorders can be treated successfully nonoperatively. When nonoperative management fails, and in the carefully selected patient, a variety of surgical options exist based on the anatomic pathology involved, but each brings its own potential for complication. We discuss several of the surgical treatment options that are available to the orthopedic surgeon for the treatment of patellofemoral disorders, including lateral retinacular release, medial soft-tissue reconstructive procedures, and bony procedures (including trochleoplasty and tibial tubercle osteotomy. We describe potential complications of each procedure and what the orthopedic surgeon can do to avoid them.

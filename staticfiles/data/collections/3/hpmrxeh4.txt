Introduction: Short bowel syndrome represents the leading aetiology that causes intestinal failure both in children and adults. Total parenteral nutrition support has dramatically improved the prognosis for these patients but, if related irreversible complications occur, the alternative is represented by surgery and/or transplantation. Areas covered: Autologous gastrointestinal reconstructive procedures are a feasible, alternative approach with good long-term outcome data in experienced surgical centres. Expert commentary: Ongoing innovative efforts have driven the surgical options for successful autologous reconstructive surgery: bowel elongation/tapering techniques (LILT,STEP and the new SILT) together with the "reversed bowel segment" procedure are now recognized procedures and all must be tailored to the individual patient needs to obtain the optimal result in terms of enteral autonomy. Background laboratory experimentation with new procedures e.g. options for bowel dilation techniques and distraction-induced enterogenesis, may provide additional management and treatment modalities.

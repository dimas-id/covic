Objective To describe The Tugcu Bakirkoy robotic perineal radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection technique, and present the results of seven patients. Material and methods We performed seven robotic perineal radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection operation using Da Vinci Xi HD Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA) on single Gel-port platform. The operation is completed in 4 stages: stage 1 open perineal dissection and gel port placement, stage 2 robotic perineal radical prostatectomy, stage 3 robotic pelvic lymph node dissection, stage 4 vesico-urethral anastomosis. In addition to describing the operation technique step by step, we aimed to present the perioperative and postoperative findings of the seven patients who underwent The Tugcu Bakirkoy Technique. Results All operations were successfully completed without any complications in fully the robotic procedure by a single surgeon. Demographic data of the patients were as follows: Mean age (62.1±8 years), mean body mass index (28.2±0.7 kg/m2), mean prostate specific antigen value (10.7±3 ng/mL), and mean prostate volume (64.2±15.3 cc). Mean operative time (184.1±20.2 mins), blood loss (64.2±15.3 cc), hospitalization time (2.1±0.6 days), and time to withdrawal of the urethral catheter (7.8±0.8 days) were also estimated. According to the pathology results, lymph node metastasis was detected in 3 patients while the surgical margin was positive in one. Conclusion We demonstrated for the first time that a new The Tugcu Bakirkoy robotic perineal radical prostatectomy technique which was previously tested in a cadaveric model, can be safely applied for the first time in vivo, and presented our results. On the basis of this, for problems that can not be overcome by traditional methods, this method is a good alternative as a way out. In this regard, it is necessary to carry out advanced studies so that this method can be applied to daily practice.

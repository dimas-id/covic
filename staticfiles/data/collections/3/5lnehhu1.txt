Abstract Hamster polyomavirus (HaPyV) major capsid protein VP1 based chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) carrying model GP33 CTL epitope derived from Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) were generated in yeast and examined for their capability to induce CTL response in mice. Chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs were effectively processed in antigen presenting cells in vitro and in vivo and induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation. Mice immunized only once with VP1-GP33 VLPs without adjuvant developed an effective GP33-specific memory T cell response: 70% were fully and 30% partially protected from LCMV infection. Moreover, aggressive growth of tumors expressing GP33 was significantly delayed in these mice in vivo. Therefore, HaPyV VP1-derived VLP harboring CTL epitopes are attractive vaccine candidates for the induction of insert-specific CTL immune response.

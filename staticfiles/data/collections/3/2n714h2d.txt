Abstract A 2-day-old goat died suddenly after the onset of severe diarrhea. No specific gross lesions were observed except for a remarkably thin intestinal wall and watery intestinal contents. Histopathological analysis revealed large numbers of Gram-positive bacilli layered upon the intestinal epithelia of the small intestine. Heavy growth of only Clostridium perfringens type E, and no detection of the other enteric pathogens in the small intestine, suggests that C. perfringens type E contributed to the death of this kid. To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of C. perfringens type E from a goat with diarrhea.

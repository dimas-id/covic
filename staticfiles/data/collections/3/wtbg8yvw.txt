Information flow security properties were defined some years ago in terms of suitable equivalence checking problems. These definitions were provided by using sequential models of computations (e.g., labeled transition systems [17, 26]), and interleaving behavioral equivalences (e.g., bisimulation equivalence [27]). More recently, the distributed model of Petri nets has been used to study non-interference in [1, 5, 6], but also in these papers an interleaving semantics was used. By exploiting a simple process algebra, called CFM [18] and equipped with a Petri net semantics, we provide some examples showing that team equivalence, a truly-concurrent behavioral equivalence proposed in [19, 20], is much more suitable to define information flow security properties. The distributed non-interference property we propose, called DNI, is very easily checkable on CFM processes, as it is compositional, so that it does not suffer from the state-space explosion problem. Moreover, DNI is characterized syntactically on CFM by means of a type system.

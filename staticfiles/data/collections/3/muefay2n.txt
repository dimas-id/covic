Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified agent foisted upon humanity and responsible for the contagious affliction, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] that has rapidly evolved into a pandemic testing to their limits, and sometimes beyond, the capacity to respond of healthcare systems across the world [2]. Management is purely supportive and social isolation crucial to containment [3]. Enforced reallocation of hospital resources and personnel to cope with the increasing numbers requiring hospital admission and intensive care [4] in the most trying of conditions has been at the expense of many hospital departments, among them those offering diagnostic and support services for lung cancer [5â€“7].

The optimal way to treat severe thoracic scoliosis remains controversial. Compared with conventional procedures, the uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UniVATS) rises in popularity in thoracic surgery because of less pain and faster recovery. This retrospective study aimed to apply UniVATS to treat severe thoracic scoliosis. Between October 2013 and March 2018, eight scoliotic patients with extremely large Cobb angle and profoundly limited flexibility underwent UniVATS for anterior release, followed by posterior instrumentation and fusion. The mean age at the time of surgery was 14.8 ± 2.4 years and the mean follow-up was 2.2 ± 1.3 years. The average levels of anterior thoracic discectomy and posterior fusion were 3.6 ± 0.7 and 11.5 ± 1.2, respectively. The mean coronal and sagittal correction rates were 70 ± 19% and 71 ± 23%, respectively. UniVATS contributed to minor access trauma (3-cm incision) with minimal blood loss, shorter operation time (75 ± 13 mins), less requirement of stay in the intensive care unit (0.3 ± 0.5 day) or chest tube placement (0.3 ± 0.7 day), speedier and narcotic-free recovery, and earlier ambulation within one day. This is the first study to assess the safety and efficacy of UniVATS in the treatment of severely stiff thoracic scoliosis, providing comparable surgical outcomes, less pain, faster recovery and superior cosmetic results without significant complications.

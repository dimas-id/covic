OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia using qualitative and/or quantitative chest computed tomography (CT) indicators and identify the CT characteristics of critical cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n = 12), severe cases (group B, n = 15), and critical cases (group C, n = 24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher exact test, one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A (69% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C. Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these 3 groups with high sensitivity (B + C vs A, 90%; C vs B, 92%), specificity (100%, 87%), and accuracy (92%, 90%). Critical cases had higher total severity score (>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation (>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density (>-779 HU) and full width at half maximum (>128 HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density (â¦50%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, 8 patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and 2 of them had died. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.

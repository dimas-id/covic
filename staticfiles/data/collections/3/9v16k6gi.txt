During these difficult times, it is not easy to learn all the nursing lessons from the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. It is not easy because - at the time of writing - Italian nurses are in the middle of this emergency that shows no sign of diminishing.

As a global community we have only known about this virus for a few months, but it has invaded lives, hospitals and homes, subverting habits, practices, and protocols. Some of the lessons learned will emerge later - after reflection and retrospective analysis. However, some things are now so evident that sharing them now is vital to help prepare those who are getting ready to face this emergency.

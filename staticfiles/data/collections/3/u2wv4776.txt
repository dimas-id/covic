Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel agent associated with respiratory symptoms in adults and children. We studied prospectively the first acute respiratory infection in a birth cohort of healthy neonates in Switzerland. HBoV was identified in 5 (4.5%) of 112 infants as young as 3 months of age. In 4 of the 5 infants, HBoV was associated with other respiratory viruses. We conclude that HBoV circulates in the community and is acquired early in life.

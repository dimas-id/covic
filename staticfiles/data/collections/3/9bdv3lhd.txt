Due to the vastness of the science virology, it is no longer an offshoot solely of the microbiology. Viruses have become as the causative agents of major epidemics throughout history. Many therapeutic strategies have been used for these microorganisms, and in this way the recognizing of potential targets of viruses is of particular importance for success. For decades, antibodies and antibody fragments have occupied a significant body of the treatment approaches against infectious diseases. Because of their high affinity, they can be designed and engineered against a variety of purposes, mainly since antibody fragments such as scFv, nanobody, diabody, and bispecific antibody have emerged owing to their small size and interesting properties. In this review, we have discussed the antibody discovery and molecular and biological design of antibody fragments as inspiring therapeutic and diagnostic agents against viral targets.

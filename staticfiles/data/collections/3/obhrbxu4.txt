Mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) continue to rise across the world. Information regarding the predictors of mortality in COVID‐19 patients remains scarce. Herein, we performed a systematic review of published articles, from January 1 to April 24, 2020, to evaluate the risk factors associated with mortality in COVID‐19. Two investigators independently searched the articles and collected the data, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We looked for associations between mortality and patient characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities. A total of 14 studies documenting the outcomes of 4659 patients were included. The presence of comorbidities such as hypertension (OR 2.5; 95% CI 2.1‐3.1; P<0.00001), coronary heart disease (OR 3.8; 95% CI 2.1‐6.9; P<0.00001) and diabetes (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.7‐2.3; P<0.00001) were associated with significantly higher risk of death amongst COVID‐19 patients. Those who died, compared to those who survived, differed on multiple biomarker levels on admission including elevated levels of cardiac troponin (+44.2 ng/L, 95% CI 19.0‐69.4; P=0.0006); C‐reactive protein (+66.3 µg/mL, 95% CI 46.7‐85.9; P<0.00001); interleukin‐6 (+4.6 ng/mL, 95% CI 3.6‐5.6; P<0.00001); D‐dimer (+4.6 µg/mL, 95% CI 2.8‐6.4; P<0.00001); creatinine (+15.3 µmol/L, 95% CI 6.2‐24.3; P=0.001) and alanine transaminase (+5.7 U/L, 95% CI 2.6‐8.8; P=0.0003); as well as decreased levels of albumin (‐3.7 g/L, 95% CI ‐5.3 to ‐2.1; P<0.00001). Individuals with underlying cardiometabolic disease and that present with evidence for acute inflammation and end‐organ damage are at higher risk of mortality due to COVID‐19 infection and should be managed with greater intensity.

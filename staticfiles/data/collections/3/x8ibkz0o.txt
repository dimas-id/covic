The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has raised concerns among physicians and their patients with rheumatic diseases (RDs) as the risk of infection was believed to be increased due to altered immune system activity that is typical of RDs and possibly worsened by glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs.[1] An appeal for adherence to therapy was shared among rheumatologists, but special attention should be paid to pregnant women who suffer from RDs.

The aim of the investigations was to determine the influence of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) on the development of pathomorphological lesions in the respiratory organs and on the health status of experimentally infected broiler breeders and pheasants from the rearing stage. There was no evidence of clinical signs in infected broiler breeder hens nor in the group of infected pheasants except for one bird in the latter group which exhibited slower movement and gasping. The frequency and intensity of pathomorphological lesions were higher in pheasants. The gross pathology findings were characterized mainly by redness of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and accumulation of mucous content in the nasal cavities, infraorbital sinuses, larynx and trachea. Histopathology confirmed the presence of inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Lesions in the lungs included hyperaemia, granulomatous and fibrinous pneumonia. ORT was reisolated only from the group of infected pheasants. Reisolation was successful from the respiratory organs (trachea, larynx, infraorbital sinuses, and lungs) of eight out of 10 infected birds. The serological response in both species was characterized by rapid production of specific antibodies that reached a maximum level in the blood in the first week after experimental infection. The antibody titres decreased gradually and were maintained at a stable level until the 12th week after inoculation. Fourteen weeks post-inoculation specific antibodies could not be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

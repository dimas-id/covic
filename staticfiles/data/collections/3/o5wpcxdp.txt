Abstract From allozymes in 1983 to whole genomes in 2015, genetic studies of the cheetah have been extensive. In this chapter we provide an overview of the available literature. Overall, patterns of genetic variation provided evidence of low variability and suggest this loss occurred thousands of years ago. Differences between published subspecies were supported genetically. At a local scale, populations were generally considered panmictic with minor genetic structure. Although cheetahs have persisted despite low genetic variability, important questions arise from these findings: Does the cheetah have the ability to adapt to and evolve with future changes in environmental and infectious pressure? How would cheetahs cope with further loss of genetic diversity? Connectivity in the wild should be maintained via prevention of habitat loss, while management of small isolated populations may require reestablishing gene flow. Genetics could assist captive-breeding decisions and provide forensic evidence as to the geographical origin of illegally traded animals.

This chapter describes the current views of the pathogenesis of virus infections of the nervous system, with particular attention to certain aspects of virus-host interactions. Following invasion of the central nervous system, infection can follow a variety of patterns, as to number and distribution of neuronal and non-neuronal cells involved. There is a corresponding diversity in the pathological lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) produced by acute virus infection. Infection can be pictured as a race between virus and host defenses, where many factors, acting through different mechanisms, can influence the outcome. Outcome is always determined by multiple virus and host variables, although single variables can be independently studied under experimentally controlled conditions in the laboratory. The chapter demonstrates that in many virus-host combinations, the immune response plays an important role in recovery from primary infections. It mentions that an immunopathological process mediates the disease which follows certain CNS virus infections.

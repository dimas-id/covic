BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting nationwide lockdowns have posed a major challenge to the management of pre-existing and newly diagnosed endocrine disorders. Herein, we have summarized the management approaches of common endocrine disorders amid the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till 25 May 2020, with the following keywords: “COVID-19”, “diabetes mellitus”, “thyroid disorders”, “primary adrenal insufficiency”, “Cushing's syndrome”, “pituitary tumors”, “vitamin D″, “osteoporosis”, “primary hyperparathyroidism”, “hypoparathyroidism”, “management”, “treatment” and “guidelines” with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”. RESULTS: We have summarized the feasible strategies for the management of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, primary adrenal insufficiency (including congenital adrenal hyperplasia), Cushing's syndrome, pituitary tumors, osteoporosis, primary hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism amid the constraints laid down by the raging pandemic. In general, medical management should be encouraged and surgical interventions should be deferred whenever possible. Ongoing medications should be continued. Sick-day rules should be sincerely adhered to. Regular contact with physicians can be maintained through teleconsultations and virtual clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the burden of endocrine disorders in the general population, their management needs to be prioritized amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The present research investigates the effects of “High Performance Work Systems (HPWS)” on employees’ “work engagement” and “service-oriented Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB)”, through the development of a social and justice climate. In doing so, “Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM)” was applied based on a convenient sample of 448 customer-contact hotel employees across ten Greek hotel organizations. In summary, the study reveals first the valuable contribution of HPWS towards the development of a justice and service climate, which in turn influence positively employees’ work engagement. As a consequence, employees respond by exhibiting extra role behaviors and by engaging in service-oriented OCB. Overall, the findings clarify the mechanism behind the HPWS process, known as the “black-box”, a valuable knowledge for professionals practicing Human Resource Management (HRM).

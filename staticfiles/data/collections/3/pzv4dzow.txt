INTRODUCTION: Physical distancing during the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic has brought telehealth to the forefront to keep up with patient care amidst an international crisis that is exhausting healthcare resources Understanding and managing health-related concerns resulting from physical distancing measures are of utmost importance OBJECTIVES: To describe and analyze the volume, content, and geospatial distribution of tweets associated with telehealth during the Covid-19 pandemic METHODS: We inquired Twitter public data to access tweets related to telehealth from March 30, 2020 to April 6, 2020 We analyzed tweets using natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning methods Clustering analysis was performed to classify tweets Geographic tweet distribution was correlated with Covid-19 confirmed cases in the United States All analyses were carried on the Google Cloud computing service "Google Colab" using Python libraries (Python Software Foundation) RESULTS: A total of 41,329 tweets containing the term "telehealth" were retrieved The most common terms appearing alongside 'telehealth' were "covid", "health", "care", "services", "patients", and "pandemic" Mental health was the most common health-related topic that appeared in our search reflecting a high need for mental healthcare during the pandemic Similarly, Medicare was the most common appearing health plan mirroring the accelerated access to telehealth and change in coverage policies The geographic distribution of tweets related to telehealth and having a specific location within the United States (n=19,367) was significantly associated with the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in each state (p&lt;0 001) CONCLUSION: Social media activity is an accurate reflection of disease burden during the Covid-19 pandemic Widespread adoption of telehealth-favoring policies is necessary and mostly needed to address mental health problems that may arise in areas of high infection and death rates

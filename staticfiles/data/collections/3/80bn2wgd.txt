Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are founded to be effective to delay epidemic spread and to reduce the number of patients. Moderate NPIs took in Japan seemed to have reduced the COVID-19 patients and to lower death rates, thus, effects of those NPIs are worthy of investigation. We used open source data and divided the data into three periods: Jan 22 to Feb 25 (Period I), Feb 26 to Apr 6 (Period II), and Apr 7 to May 14 (Period III). We developed the SIRD model and applied the Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate a combination of optimal results, including the peak of infected cases, the peak date, and R0. For Period I, the estimated peak infected cases were smaller than the observed ones, the peak date was earlier than the observed one, and the R0 was about 4.66. For the other two periods, the estimated cases were more, and the peak dates were earlier than the observed ones. The R0 was 2.50 in Period II, and 1.79 in Period III. NPIs took in Japan might have reduced more than 50% of the daily contacts per people compared to that before COVID-19. Owing to the effects of NPIs, the Japanese society had avoided collapse of medical service. Nevertheless, the capacity of daily RT-PCR may have restricted the reported confirmed cases.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, personal protective equipment is widely used to limit infection of caregivers. Innovative solutions have been described to overcome supply shortage. The adaptation of the EasyBreathÂ® surface snorkeling mask by the Prakash team has benefited from outstanding media coverage. We present four 3D-printed devices that we have modified from the initial innovative design in order to adapt to local constraints. We tested the mask during surgery. The modifications that we made provide better ergonomics, visibility and communication capacities, but that have no official approval for use and can therefore only be recommended in the absence of a validated alternative solution. 3D printing is a tool of prime importance in the production of devices for medical use in health crisis situations.

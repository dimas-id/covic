The inactivation of [Formula: see text] viruses upon exposure to acidic ozone water was investigated using chicken allantoic fluids of different dilutions, [Formula: see text] values, and initial ozone concentrations. The inactivation effect of the acidic ozone water was found to be stronger than the inactivation effect of the ozone water combined with the degree of acidity, indicating a synergic effect of acidity on ozone decay in water. It is also shown that acidic ozone water with a [Formula: see text] value of 4 or less is very effective means of virus inactivation if provided in conjunction with an ozone concentration of 20 mg/l or higher.

The paper is focused on the numerical simulation of acoustic properties of the free jets from circle nozzle at low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The near-field of compressible jet flow is calculated using developed regularized (quasi-gas dynamic) algorithms solver QGDFoam. Acoustic noise is computed for jets with M = 0.9, Re = 3600 and M = 2.1, Re = 70000 parameters. The acoustic pressure in far field is predicted using the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings analogy implemented in the libAcoustics library based on the OpenFOAM software package. The determined properties of the flow and acoustic fields are compared with experimental data. The flow structures are characterized by the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability waves, which lead to energy outflux in the radial direction. Their further growth is accompanied by the formation of large and small-scale eddies leading to the generation of acoustic noise. The results showed that for selected jets the highest levels of generated noise is obtained at angles around 30Â° which agrees well with experimental data.

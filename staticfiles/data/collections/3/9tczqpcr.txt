Advancements in soft tissue minimally invasive surgery have been rapid and comprehensive since its inception in human medicine approximately 25 years ago. From its origins in traditional laparoscopy, followed rapidly by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, minimally invasive surgery in human medicine has evolved through a number of different platforms that now include single-port approach devices, robotic surgery as well as natural orifice transluminal endosurgery. Whilst some of these remain beyond the reach of veterinary medicine for now, largely because of technical challenges and the prohibitive costs of some single-use disposable components, veterinary minimally invasive surgery is advancing rapidly allowing our small animal patients to benefit from some of the many documented advantages that a minimally invasive approach affords the patient.

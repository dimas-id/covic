Objective This video is a step-by-step illustration of the laparoscopic-assisted mobilisation and resection of a sacrococcygeal teratoma Altman type III. Indication Laparoscopic supralevatory tumour mobilisation is an established method in selected centres and can be the initial step in approaching sacrococcygeal teratomas with an intrapelvic portion, facilitating a complete (R0) resection. Method Laparoscopic surgery is performed in supine position with a 5 mm umbilical trocar, a 5 mm trocar in the right upper abdomen, and two 3 mm trocars in the left middle and lower abdomen. We use a 5 mm 45° optic and 3 mm laparoscopic grasping forceps as well as Overholt clamps. For coagulation, a laparoscopic 5 mm diathermy Sealer (LigaSure™, Covidien, Neustadt) is used. Conclusion In selected tumours, laparoscopic assisted tumour mobilisation enables surgeons to clearly identify and ligate the primary tumour-supplying vascular structures at the beginning of the operation, thereby avoiding the risk of major bleeding throughout the subsequent tumour mobilisation. The laparoscopic approach also allows an accurate dissection and mobilisation of the supralevatory tumour parts under direct vision. After repositioning the patient into the prone position, infralevatory preparation can be carried out safely and fast in the conventional sacral approach without any major risk of bleeding.

Seasonal flu and pandemics, which account for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths, require rapid and reliable detection mechanisms for preventive and therapeutic measures. Current methods of viral detection have limitations in speed, accuracy, accessibility, and usability. This project presents a novel, widely applicable viral diagnosis that uses a modified version of the traditional rolling circle amplification (RCA) to be sensitive, specific, direct, colorimetric, and operable at room temperature. We are specifically aiming to detect SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A (H1N1pdm09), and Influenza B (Victoria Lineage). Results using synthetic viral DNA sequences show that the diagnostic test could take as fast as 30 minutes and detect up to picomolar concentrations of DNA strands. The next step for this project is to test the assay with synthetic viral RNA to verify the results. We envision that the implementation of this type of diagnostic test could allow faster responses to outbreaks of related viruses and quicker societal recovery.

The patient was a 52-year-old woman, who was found to have an abnormality in the upper gastrointestinal(UGI)tract, via a contrast-imaging study; she had no symptoms.Computed tomography(CT)revealed a tumor, measuring approximately 100mm in diameter, in the antrum of the stomach.The tumor was diagnosed as gastric schwannoma using endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration(EUS-FNA).Preoperative CT revealed multiple lymph adenopathies around the antrum, which led to the suspicion of lymph node metastasis. The patient underwent a laparoscopic partial gastrectomy after the confirmation of the absence of lymph node metastasis by intraoperative rapid diagnosis.

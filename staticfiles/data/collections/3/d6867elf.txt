The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted healthcare delivery worldwide. In hotspot areas such as Wuhan, Lombardy, and New York City, the disease has forced hospitals to focus on COVID-19 patients. Anecdotal reports have suggested that the pandemic has led to a decrease in patients presenting to these hospitals with serious cardiovascular and neurologic diseases such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and stroke. We sought to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency transfers for STEMI, stroke, and acute aortic emergencies within our regional health system.

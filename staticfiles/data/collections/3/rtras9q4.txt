In recent years, the demand for new antiviral strategies has increased markedly. There are many contributing factors to this increased demand, including the ever-increasing prevalence of chronic viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C, and the emergence of new viruses such as the SARS coronavirus. The potential danger of haemorrhagic fever viruses and eradicated viruses such as variola virus being used as bioterrorist weapons has also increased the profile of antiviral drug discovery. Here, the virus infections for which antiviral therapy is needed and the compounds that are available, or are being developed, for the treatment of these infections are described.

We read with great interest the Special Editorial by Dr Thapa and co-authors on the importance of not neglecting emotions of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic1 as maternal mental health can be associated with short and long term risks for their and their children's physical and psychological health. Most studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy have focused on physical effects of the pandemic on infected mothers as well as the possibility of vertical transmission: these tend to eclipse the equally relevant maternal mental health needs during these unprecedented times.

The identification of the right order of the equation in applied fractional modeling plays an important role. In this paper we consider an inverse problem for determining the order of time fractional derivative in a subdiffusion equation with an arbitrary second order elliptic differential operator. We prove that the additional information about the solution at a fixed time instant at a monitoring location, as"the observation data", identifies uniquely the order of the fractional derivative.

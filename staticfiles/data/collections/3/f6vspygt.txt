BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D over early clinical outcome and serum cytokine levels in patients with moderate to severe brain injury. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the ICU unit were recruited into the study. Subjects were randomly allocated to a treatment regimen comprising either a one-time oral dose of 120,000 IU (two tablets of 60,000 IU each) of vitamin D (n = 20) or 8 mg of saccharide (two tablets of 4 g each) as placebo (n = 15). The main parameters evaluated included duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2). RESULTS: The results indicated an improvement in the level of consciousness after 7 days in the vitamin D-treated group compared with placebo. An elevation in GCS score by 3.86 units in the vitamin D-treated group with a 0.19-unit descent in the control group was recorded. Duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced in the vitamin D-treated group compared with the control group (4.7 days vs. 8.2 days, p value 0.0001). A noticeable reduction was recorded in inflammatory biomarkers (cytokines) in the vitamin D-treated group (IL-6 p = 0.08, TNF-α p = 0.02, IL-2 p = 0.36) with notable elevation in IFN-γ (p = 0.65) compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: In the acute phase of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin D supplementation plays a vital role and has a favourable effect on the consciousness level of patients.

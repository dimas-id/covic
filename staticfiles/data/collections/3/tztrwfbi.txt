Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an important disease, which leads to severe economic losses in swine-producing areas of the world. However, current antiviral strategies cannot provide highly effective protection. In this study, three theoretically effective interference target sites (71–91, 144–164, 218–238) targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PRRSV were designed and selected, and then three siRNA-expressing plasmids were constructed, respectively named p2.1-N71, p2.1-N144, and p2.1-N218. The recombinant siRNA-expressing plasmids were transfected into Marc-145 cells; then the cells were infected with PRRSV (JL07SW strain); finally, after incubation for 48 h, the antiviral activity of those siRNA-expressing plasmids in Marc-145 cells was assessed by cytopathic effects, virus titers, indirect immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. Experimental results demonstrated that these three siRNA-expressing plasmids could effectively and significantly inhibit the replication of PRRSV by 93.2%, 83.6%, and 89.2% in Marc-145 cells, respectively. Among these three siRNA-expressing plasmids, p2.1-N71 was found to be most effective, while p2.1-N144 and p2.1-N218 displayed relatively weak inhibition of virus replication. The results indicated that siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N gene of PRRSV could significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells. Based on our experimental results and previous reports, the 71–91, 179–197, and 234–252 sites of the N gene are good choices to effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV, and this RNA interference technique can be a potential anti-PRRSV strategy.

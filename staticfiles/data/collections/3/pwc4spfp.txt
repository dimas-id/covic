Historically, serum therapy was previously used to combat infectious pathogens. However, serum sickness and anaphylaxis limited its broad application. The advancement of antibody engineering technologies has made it feasible to generate monoclonal antibodies. There are divergent methods for antibody engineering and optimization. In this chapter, we summarized the latest developments in engineering antibodies for infectious diseases.

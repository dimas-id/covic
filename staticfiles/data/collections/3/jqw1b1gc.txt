OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to describe the long leg cast with a pelvic band (LLCPB), a novel alternative to spica casting for treating femur fractures in patients aged 6 months to 6 years which requires no casting above the waist, allows for hip flexion adjustments after it is applied, and does not require an operating room for placement. METHODS Seven children aged 7.9 months to 3.7 years with femur fractures treated with the LLCPB at a single institution were retrospectively studied. All children were casted in the emergency department under conscious sedation. Radiographic and subjective outcomes were recorded. RESULTS All 7 children achieved acceptable reduction of their fractures without the need for re-reduction or cast wedging. Five of the 7 children were discharged from the emergency department; 1 child required 1 night of hospitalization and another child required 2 nights of hospitalization. There were no complications. The cost of placing an LLCPB at our institution was $430.46. The cost of placing a spica cast in the operating room was $5427.54 to $6465.00. CONCLUSIONS The long leg cast with a pelvic band seems to be an acceptable treatment for children aged 8 months to 4 years with spiral femur fractures. This technique has significant advantages over traditional and modified spica casts including allowing for uninhibited toileting, weight bearing on the unaffected leg, adjustment of hip flexion at any point after placement, and easier access to the perineum, abdomen, and chest for hygienic and medical purposes. Furthermore, treatment with an LLCPB presents significant potential for cost savings.

BACKGROUND Minimally invasive surgery represents the gold standard for the management of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of robotic surgery for the management of DIE. METHODS A 5-year retrospective cohort study was made of robotic procedures including: segmental bowel resections, removal of nodules from the rectovaginal septum (RVS) with or without rectal shaving and partial bladder resection. RESULTS Overall, 19 bowel resections, 23 removals of RVS nodules and five bladder resections were performed, alone or in combination. Associated posterior vaginal resections were performed in 12 cases. Neither intra-operative complications, nor conversion to laparotomy occurred. One anastomotic leakage was recorded. CONCLUSION This series of robotic procedures for DIE represents the largest currently available and it helps to promote robotics as a safe and attractive alternative to accomplish a comprehensive surgical treatment of DIE, especially when bowel or bladder resections are needed.

A phytochemical investigation of the flowers of Chrysanthemum indicum yielded sesquiterpenoids 1-25 with various carbocyclic skeletons, including 10 new (1-10) and 15 known (11-25) analogues. The structures were elucidated via their physical data, while the absolute configuration of compounds 6, 8, and 10 was assessed via electronic circular dichroism analysis. The evaluation of the effect of sesquiterpenoids on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) replication showed that compounds 1-5, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 21 increased cell viability against cell death in PEDV-injected cells. Compounds 2, 12, and 17 were selected and investigated for their inhibition of proteins required for PEDV replication. Compounds 2 and 17 significantly reduced PEDV nucleocapsid and spike protein synthesis compared with azauridin as a positive control.

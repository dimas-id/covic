Abstract Picornaviruses include several important clinical pathogens which cause diseases varying from common cold to poliomyelitis and hepatitis. Introduction of RT-PCR methods for the detection of these viruses has significantly facilitated the diagnosis of picornavirus infections and elucidated their etiological role in clinical illnesses. Partial sequence analysis of the genomes has been used for typing of the viruses and in studies of molecular epidemiology of picornaviruses. These molecular approaches are likely to become the most predominant techniques for the diagnosis and epidemiological analysis, particularly in the enterovirus infections.

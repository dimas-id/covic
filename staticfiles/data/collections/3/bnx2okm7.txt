Abstract This is the first report of an acute and fatal outbreak of bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV)-2 infection in Israel. The clinical presentation varied with the age of the affected animals with a bovine–respiratory–complex–like syndrome in young stock, and diarrhea and dysentery only in the lactating stock. Enteritis first appeared in one shed of post-parturient cows; it spread for 6weeks, until at least 30% of the lactating stock contracted enteritis or dysentery. At the same time, dairy calves aged 10–90days exhibited severe respiratory disease. Of 79 animals that died, 13/350 (3.7%) were adult lactating cows, and 66/1100 (6%) were young feedlot calves. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolated virus revealed a 95% identity with the corresponding genome parts of various BVDV type 2 sequences. The route of introduction of BVDV-2 into Israel could not be elucidated.

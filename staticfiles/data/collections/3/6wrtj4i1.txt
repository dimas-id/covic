The objective of this study was to link arsenic exposure and influenza A (H1N1) infection‐induced respiratory effects to assess the impact of arsenic‐contaminated drinking water on exacerbation risk of A (H1N1)‐associated lung function. The homogeneous Poisson process was used to approximate the related processes between arsenic exposure and influenza‐associated lung function exacerbation risk. We found that (i) estimated arsenic‐induced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) reducing rates ranged from 0.116 to 0.179 mL/μg for age 15–85 years, (ii) estimated arsenic‐induced A (H1N1) viral load increasing rate was 0.5 mL/μg, (iii) estimated A (H1N1) virus‐induced FEV(1) reducing rate was 0.10 mL/logTCID50, and (iv) the relationship between arsenic exposure and A (H1N1)‐associated respiratory symptoms scores (RSS) can be described by a Hill model. Here we showed that maximum RSS at day 2 postinfection for Taiwan, West Bengal (India), and the United States were estimated to be in the severe range of 0.83, 0.89, and 0.81, respectively, indicating that chronic arsenic exposure and A (H1N1) infection together are most likely to pose potential exacerbations risk of lung function, although a 50% probability of lung function exacerbations risk induced by arsenic and influenza infection was within the mild and moderate ranges of RSS at day 1 and 2 postinfection. We concluded that avoidance of drinking arsenic‐containing water could significantly reduce influenza respiratory illness and that need will become increasingly urgent as the novel H1N1 pandemic influenza virus infects people worldwide.

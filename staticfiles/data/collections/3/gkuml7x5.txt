Monitoring recanalization and reperfusion during acute ischemic stroke is a challenge for therapeutic assessment. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows continuous monitoring of the brain regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2). We sought to evaluated rSO2 variation during mechanical thrombectomy during acute ischemic stroke. Three patients admitted for middle cerebral artery occlusion were continuously monitored during mechanical thrombectomy (rSO2 in the infarcted and non-infarcted side and interhemispheric difference). The procedure was a success in two of them and failed in the third. At the beginning, rSO2 was lower in the infarcted side and interhemispheric difference was more than 5%. When the procedure succeeded, rSO2 in the infarcted side rise (about 10%) and interhemisperic difference decrease (about 7%). When the procedure failed, rSO2 was the same at the beginning and at the end. NIRS may be useful to monitor recanalization during management of acute ischemic stroke.

BACKGROUND/AIMS Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a serious complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Stromal cells have been tested as therapy for HC. Decidua stromal cells (DSCs) protect the fetus from the mother's immune system. METHODS Eleven patients with HC of grades 3-4 were treated with DSCs after HSCT. The median age was 33 years (range 8-50), and the median dose of DSCs was 1.5 × 106/kg (range 0.7-2.5). The patients were given 1 dose (1-4). RESULTS In 5 patients, HC disappeared within 5 days after DSC infusion. Patients who received DSCs within 3 days after the start of HC had a duration of HC of 5 days and a shorter duration of pain than patients who were given DSCs later (p = 0.02). Three patients received DSCs prepared in albumin instead of AB-plasma and tended to have a shorter duration of pain (p = 0.07). There was no infusion toxicity. Adverse events were those often seen after HSCT. Nine of the 11 patients (82%) were alive 1 year after HSCT. CONCLUSIONS Based on this pilot study, we started a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study using 2 doses of 1 × 106 DSCs/kg suspended in albumin for treatment of early HC.

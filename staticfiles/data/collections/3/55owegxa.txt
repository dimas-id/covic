OBJECTIVE Determine if abnormal prenatal Doppler ultrasound indices are predictive of postnatal impaired cerebral autoregulation. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study of 46 subjects, 240-296 weeks' gestation. Utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy and receiver-operating characteristic analysis, impaired cerebral autoregulation was defined as >16.5% time spent in a dysregulated state within 96 h of life. Normal and abnormal Doppler indices were compared for perinatal outcomes. RESULTS Subjects with abnormal cerebroplacental ratio (n = 12) and abnormal umbilical artery pulsatility index (n = 13) were likely to develop postnatal impaired cerebral autoregulation (p â‰¤ 0.02). Abnormal cerebroplacental ratio was associated with impaired cerebral autoregulation between 24 and 48 h of life (p = 0.016). These subjects have increased risk for fetal growth restriction, lower birth weight, lower Apgar scores, acidosis, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage and/or death (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Abnormal cerebroplacental ratio and umbilical artery pulsatility index are associated with postnatal impairment in cerebral autoregulation and adverse outcome.

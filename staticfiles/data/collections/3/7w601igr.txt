Public reporting of PCI outcomes has had a polarizing effect on the cardiology community. The potential benefits of public reporting are many, but a host of unintended consequences have likely mitigated the anticipated positive impact of current reporting systems.

We also offer a perspective on future directions with a view to ensuring the benefits of public reporting while minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.

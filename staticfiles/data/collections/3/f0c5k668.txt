This chapter represents an energy-conscious approach to understanding thermal comfort. With the environmental variable of T, MRT, RH and wind v as its structure, it begins with a psychrometric analysis where the roles of temperature and humidity are denominated in PMV votes and the power needed to improve those votes. The role of humidity is critically reviewed with a case made for challenging the accepted norms an optimum RH range. Finally the efficacy of moving air is analysed in the different ways it can be employed.

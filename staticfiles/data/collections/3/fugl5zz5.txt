We have evaluated 24 cytopathic (CP) and 37 noncytopathic (NCP) strains of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) with a dot blot assay using four different genome segments of the NADL strain as hybridization probes (p80, p54, gp53, and gp62). The p80 and p54 probes hybridized to 23/24 (96%) and 2224 (92%), respectively, of CP strains examined. In contrast, these same two probes only detected 1636 (43%) and 536 (13%), respectively, of the NCP strains examined. The gp53 probe detected 1824 (75%) and the gp62 probe detected 1924 (79%) of the CP strains. In contrast, these latter two probes only detected 937 (24%) and 737 (20%), respectively, of NCP strains. This low detecteion rate of NCP strains suggests a need for developing a probe based on NCP sequences for identification of NCP strains.

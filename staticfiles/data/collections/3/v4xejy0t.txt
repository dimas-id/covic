PURPOSE Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is associated with shorter hospitalization and lower complication rates compared to open ventral hernia repair. We sought to determine if hernia-related factors, such as defect size and re-operative status correlate with postoperative complications, operative times and length of stay (LOS). METHODS The study is a retrospective review of 30-day perioperative outcomes following LVHR in 91 patients who underwent surgery at a single institution from August 2009 through June 2012. A single surgeon performed all procedures. RESULTS Indications for surgery were recurrent incisional hernia in 33 % of patients and primary incisional or ventral abdominal hernias in the rest. Coated polyester mesh with an average size of 348 cm(2) (±214; range 113-1,036) was used. Mean operative time was 132 min (±66.1; range 53-412). The mean LOS was 4.0 days (±3.5; range 1-22). Complications occurred in 13 patients for overall morbidity of 16.5 % and no mortality. There was one recurrence in 30 days (1.1 %). Patients who had a surgery >120 min or a LOS >1 day were statistically more likely to have multiple hernias, larger defect sizes (>40 cm(2)), larger mesh sizes (>300 cm(2)) or a history of recurrent hernia (P < 0.05). No other clinical or demographic variable evaluated in this study correlated with operative time or LOS. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is safe with a low incidence of perioperative complications. Patients with multiple, larger and recurrent hernias have longer operative times and LOS. This information can be used to guide preoperative planning for the patient, surgeon and treating institution.

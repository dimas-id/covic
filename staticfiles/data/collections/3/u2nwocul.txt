Recognizing various natural and man-made disasters have caused major supply chain disruptions over the last two decades, this chapter illustrates the vulnerability of many global supply chains and provides justifications for companies to develop a systemic approach to managing supply chain risks. Viewing supply chain risk management as comprising four steps—identifying risks, accessing risks, mitigating risks, and responding to risks—this chapter highlights the overall structure and key objectives of the book.

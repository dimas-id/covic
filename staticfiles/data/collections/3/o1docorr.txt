OBJECTIVE To investigate the exact mechanism of SARS-CoV pathogenesis at the protein level. METHOD Under the condition of the establishment of dendrtic cells (DC) culture method, we used recombinant adenovirus to infect mature DC to make clear the development changes in mRNA levels and secreted protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha by using RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULT We found that mRNA levels and secreted protein levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in DC had increased gradually after rAd-N infection during first 24 h compared with the control DC infected by rAd-LacZ (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION It is suggested that N protein may be related to the excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines during SARS-CoV infection at the acute phase.

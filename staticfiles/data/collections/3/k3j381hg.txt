Abstract Recognized in the late 1980s in North America and Europe the syndrome that caused reproductive and respiratory problems in swine was initially called “mystery swine disease” and is now termed “porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS)”. In the early 1990s an arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSV), was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease. Since then research has progressed substantially. Most recently “porcine high fever disease” was reported in China starting in 2006 with PRRSV being a critical virus associated with high morbidity and mortality (20%) associated with this syndrome which in 2010 is still causing severe pathology in pigs in China, with spread to Vietnam and Cambodia. This volume contains a series of reviews that highlight the virus, its pathogenesis, epidemiology, immunology, vaccinology and host genetic control. This paper provides a brief historical review of PRRS and the associated PRRSV. It presents areas of research gaps that inhibit current progress towards PRRS elimination through production of effective vaccines and current plans for PRRS elimination or eradication programs. It is hoped that this discussion will stimulate further collaboration between researchers and swine veterinarians throughout the world to provide answers that enhance our understanding of PRRS and PRRSV in an effort to eliminate this economically important disease.

A simple gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA) based on indirect reaction format was developed for rapid detection of antibodies against avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The detection time of IBV IgG by the GICA was less than 10 min, whereas the HI test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) require 1-2 hr. Reference sera against newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease, avian influenza virus H5 and H9 subtypes were all negatives for anti-IBV antibodies using the GICA. Compared with the HI, the sensitivity of the GICA was 92.11% and specificity was 81.71%. The agreement rate between the 2 tests was 85%. Compared with the ELISA, the sensitivity of the GICA was 92.31% and specificity was 97.06%. The agreement rate between the 2 tests was 95%. The GICA test strip is a reliable and useful tool for the on-site surveillance of anti-IBV antibodies.

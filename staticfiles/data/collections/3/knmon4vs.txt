Integrating risk communication and community engagement into the national public health emergency response is crucial. Considering the difficulties and challenges faced by China in the prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and based on interim guidelines from the World Health Organization, this article makes several recommendations addressing the outbreak in China. These include improvements in the internal governmental risk communication systems, enhancing the coordination between internal and partner governmental emergency management, and promoting public communication in response to societal concerns. Regarding these recommendations, we emphasize community engagement in joint prevention and control, confronting uncertainty and countering rumors effectively, and strengthening international cooperation and evidence-based decision making for prevention and control measures.

Newborn lambs (n = 45) at the Agricultural Research Institute of Northern Ireland were fed either 50 grams of commercial lamb milk replacer or 50 grams of commercial colostrum replacer (bovine origin) in 200 ml of water four times during the first 24 hours of life or were given ad libitum access to the ewe. Total plasma protein at 24 hours of age was highest in lambs allowed to suckle the ewe (76.9 g/L). However, by 14 days of age, there were no differences in plasma protein levels among the three treatments. Bovine IgG was measured in lambs fed colostrum replacer and ovine IgG was measured in other lambs. Mean plasma IgG concentrations at 24 hours of age were 0.7 (milk replacer), 18.0 (colostrum replacer), and 26.6 (dam's milk) g/L. Bovine IgG administered orally to newborn lambs was adequately absorbed, and circulating IgG concentrations were sufficiently maintained throughout this study.

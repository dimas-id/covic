BACKGROUND Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare but serious complication from myocardial infarction and cardiac surgery. Although standard treatment is surgical intervention, percutaneous closure of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm has become an option for high-risk surgical candidates. Experience with percutaneous treatment is limited to a few single case reports. This is the first series of percutaneous treatment of the left ventricular pseudoaneurysms. METHODS AND RESULTS This is a retrospective analysis of 9 procedures of percutaneous repair of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm in 7 consecutive patients (ages 51 to 83 years, 6 men) completed in our Structural Heart Disease center from June 2008 to December 2010. All patients were considered as a high risk for surgery because of multiple comorbidities. Multiple imaging modalities were used before, during, and after the procedures to improve success and efficacy. The left ventricular pseudoaneurysms of all 7 patients were successfully repaired. Fluoroscopy time on average was 36.5Â±24.0 minutes (range, 12.4 to 75.7 minutes). All patients were followed up for a period ranging from 3 to 32 months after the procedure. Each patient improved by at least 1 New York Heart Association functional class, and 4 patients improved by 2 classes. CONCLUSIONS Transcatheter closure of the left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a feasible alternative for high-risk surgical candidates. The use of multiple imaging modalities is required for a detail planning and execution of the procedure.

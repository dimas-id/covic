To investigate the relationship between viral load and secondary transmission in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we reviewed epidemiological and clinical data obtained from immunocompetent laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 at Toyama University Hospital. In total, 28 patients were included in the analysis. Median viral load at the initial sample collection was significantly higher in adults than in children and in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients. Among symptomatic patients, non-linear regression models showed that the estimated viral load at onset was higher in the index (patients who transmitted the disease to at least one other patient) than in the non-index patients (patients who were not the cause of secondary transmission; median [95% confidence interval]: 6.6 [5.2-8.2] vs. 3.1 [1.5-4.8] log copies/{micro}L, respectively). High nasopharyngeal viral loads around onset may contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19.

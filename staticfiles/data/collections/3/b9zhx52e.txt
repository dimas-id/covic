We report the case of a 53-year-old woman who underwent complete port-accessed middle lobectomy by a new technique that preserves all muscles, including the extracostal and intercostal muscles. The operation was performed by using only thoracovideoscopy, and the resected lobe was withdrawn in a pouch through a subxiphoid incision through the substernal route. This complete port-accessed lobectomy is a new technique and is thought to be less invasive than video-assisted lobectomy with minithoracotomy.

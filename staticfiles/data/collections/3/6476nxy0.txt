The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a global rush to uncover basic biological mechanisms, to inform effective vaccine and drug development. Despite viral novelty, global sequencing efforts have already identified genomic variation across isolates. To enable easy exploration and spatial visualization of the potential implications of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on infection, host immunity and drug development we have developed COVID-3D (http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/covid3d/).

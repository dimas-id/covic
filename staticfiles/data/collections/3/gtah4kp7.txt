The kinetics with which IgE responses develop in vivo following immunization of experimental animals indirectly support the existence of IL-4-secreting T cells as a normal component of the T cell repertoire. At the same time, studies of IL-4-secreting cell frequencies directly ex vivo have argued that T cells with the potential to become IL-4 secretors exist in vivo, in the form of precursors requiring stimulation and 4 – 12 days of culture as well as restimulation with mitogen or Ag before they become detectable as lymphokine-secreting cells. We demonstrate here that intravenous administration of low doses of anti-CD3 mAb 145-2C11 results in IL-4 production within 60 min of stimulation as demonstrated by Northern analysis of mRNA and a sensitive, selective bioassay (CT.4S cell proliferation) of biologically active IL-4 protein. Production of IL-4 is paralleled by IFNγ synthesis, displaying similar kinetics. These findings, consistent with the presence of mature cells capable of IL-4 and IFNγ synthesis in the T cell repertoire of naive mice, are supported by the observation that stimulation of spleen cells from naive mice with anti-CD3 mAb in vitro for 12 h also results in strong IL-4 and IFNγ mRNA and protein synthesis. The data support and extend those obtained through analysis of cytokine mRNA synthesis alone, thereby providing evidence that “fresh” T cells are indeed capable of producing IL-4 directly ex vivo and are consistent with the existence of IL-4-secreting cells as a normal component of the T cell repertoire of naive mice.

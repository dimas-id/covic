Infection is a major complication of patients with hematological malignancies. Prophylaxis is a key element in the management of these patients, and is composed by two main components: infection control measures and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. Infection control measures are safe, but not always effective. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is usually effective but may increase resistance rates, toxicity, and cost. Therefore, a careful evaluation of the actual risk for infection, the pathogens that predominate in a particular setting, and the periods at risk are important in order to define the most appropriate strategy. In this chapter we review the most important parameters to assess the risk on an individual basis, and the evidences and recommendations supporting infection control measures and antimicrobial prophylaxis against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites.

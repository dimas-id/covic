INTRODUCTION This serial cross-sectional survey study aimed to review the trend in various infection control practices in residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) in Hong Kong from 2005 to 2014. METHODS Annual cross-sectional surveys were conducted at all RCHEs in Hong Kong, including self-administered questionnaires, on-site interviews, inspections, and assessments conducted by trained nurses, from 2005 to 2014. In all, 98.5% to 100% of all RCHEs were surveyed each year based on the list of licensed RCHEs in Hong Kong. RESULTS There was a substantial increase in the proportion of RCHE residents aged â‰¥85 years, from 40.0% in 2005 to 50.2% in 2014 (P=0.002). The percentage of RCHE residents with special care needs also increased, from 22.3% in 2005 to 32.6% in 2014 for residents with dementia (P<0.001) and from 3.4% in 2005 to 5.0% in 2014 for residents with a long-term indwelling urinary catheter (P<0.001). The proportion of RCHEs with separate rooms for isolation areas ranged from 73.6% to 80% but did not show any significant trend over the study period. The proportion of RCHEs with alcohol hand rub available showed an increasing trend from 25.4% in 2006 to 99.2% in 2014 (P=0.008). The proportion of health or care workers (who were not the designated infection control officers) passing skills tests on hand washing techniques increased from 79.2% in 2006 to 91.5% in 2014 (P=0.02). An increasing trend was also observed for the proportion of infection control officers who were able to prepare properly diluted bleach solution, from 71.5% in 2005 to 92.2% in 2014 (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS For infection control practice to continue improving, more effort should be made to enhance and maintain proper practice, and to mitigate the challenge posed by the high turnover rates of healthcare workers in RCHEs. Introduction of self-audits on infection control practices should be considered.

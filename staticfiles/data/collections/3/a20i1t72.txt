HIV-1 infection is characterized by a progressive CD4 T cell depletion. It is now accepted that apoptosis of uninfected bystander CD4 T lymphocytes plays a major role in AIDS development. Viral envelope glycoproteins (Env) are mainly involved in inducing this cell death process, but the mechanisms triggered by HIV-1 leading to immunodeficiency are still poorly understood. Recently, we have demonstrated that autophagy is a prerequisite for Env-mediated apoptosis in uninfected CD4 T cells, underlining its role in HIV-1 infection. However, occurrence of autophagy in HIV-1-infected cells has not yet been described. Several hypotheses are discussed, based on the comparison with data from other viral infections.

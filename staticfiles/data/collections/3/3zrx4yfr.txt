The benefits of Big Data Analytics (BDA) are substantial in instances where organisations manage to successfully implement analytical capabilities. These benefits include improved, data driven decision-making, which can lead to deeper insight into business operations and as a result better performing organisations. Not surprisingly, an increased number of organisations are researching best implementation practices for BDA projects. Similar to software projects, research has shown that many BDA projects fail or do not deliver the business value as promised. To address this issue, the main objective of this research is to identify BDA implementation considerations for new BDA endeavors that will help organisations to align their BDA efforts with their overall business strategy to maximize business value. Based on a Benefit Dependency Network (BDN) model as main theoretical underpinning, a structured literature review was conducted focusing on investment objectives, business benefits, enabling changes and IT enablers when implementing BDA. A BDA implementation requires a holistic approach by considering aspects such as the skills of people which will have an impact on the structure of the organisation, business processes and technology changes to deliver benefits and investment objectives. Each of the domains of the BDN should be considered prior to BDA implementations. The research offers a guideline to organisations implementing BDA, based on the foundation of BDN.

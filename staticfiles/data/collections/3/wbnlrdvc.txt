INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Sacral colpopexy/hysteropexy is a well-established approach to vaginal apex support and was the first technique used to treat pelvic organ prolapse (POP) with robotic assistance. However, dissection at the level of the promontory may be difficult, especially in obese patients, and associated with rare but potential serious morbidity such as life-threatening vascular injury. In an attempt to avoid this risk, we describe a new robotic approach for POP repair with lateral suspension. METHODS From March 2012 through June 2013, ten patients with symptomatic anterior vaginal wall and uterine prolapse were operated by a single surgeon. The video presents the different steps of robotically assisted laparoscopic repair of POP by lateral suspension with mesh and uterine conservation using da Vinci S or Si system. RESULTS POP repair was successfully completed in all ten patients without any perioperative or postoperative complication. CONCLUSION Robotically assisted laparoscopic repair of POP by lateral suspension with mesh is a novel and feasible technique with promising short-term results. It may have several theoretical advantages over sacral colpopexy/hysteropexy and may represent an alternative in cases of difficult dissection of the promontory.

The trend of single port surgery is increasing recently, and it is technically feasible for right hemicolectomy. However, the operation requires special and expensive access port for the insertion of the instruments. Day et al reported the use of a novel "glove" access port for right hemicolectomy in this pilot study. Four single port right hemicolectomies were performed by using this access port. The access port was found to be user-friendly and durable. No adverse outcome was associated with this access port. This "glove" access port is a suitable device for single port right hemicolectomy.

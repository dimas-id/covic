In patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough and dyspnea, are the most frequent clinical manifestations. These patients may also present with less well-defined symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort both at the time of diagnosis and during the clinical course. In a few cases, these symptoms may also present before the appearance of respiratory symptoms. To penetrate the body, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses ACE2 receptors, which are present not only in respiratory epithelium but also in gastrointestinal mucosa and liver cholangiocytes. In several cases, viral RNA is detectable in the stool of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The liver damage seems to show a multifactorial origin. About 2%-11% of patients with COVID-19 have known underlying hepatic pathologies. In 14%-53% of COVID-19 cases, there is an alteration of the indices of liver cytolysis and is more frequently observed in severe forms of COVID-19, especially during hospitalization.

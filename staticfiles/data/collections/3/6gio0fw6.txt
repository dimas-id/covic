Abstract The objectives were to separate canine seminal plasma proteins (with SDS-PAGE) and to determine the correlation between specific proteins and semen characteristics. Three ejaculates from 20 mixed-breed dogs, of unknown fertility, were collected by digital manipulation. Ejaculate volume and color, sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, and membrane integrity (hypoosmotic swelling test and fluorescent staining) were assessed. For each dog, seminal plasma was pooled from all three ejaculates and proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE, using polyacrylamide concentrations of 13% and 22% in the separation gels. After staining, gel images were digitized to estimate molecular weights (MW) and integrated optical density (IOD) of each lane and of individual bands. Total seminal plasma protein concentration was 2.19±1.56g/dL (mean±SD; range 1.12–5.19g/dL). A total of 37 protein bands were identified (although no dog had all 37 bands). In the 13% gel, molecular weights ranged from 100.6 to 17.1kDa, with four bands (49.7, 33.2, 26.4, and 19.5kDa) present in samples from all dogs. In the 22% gel, molecular weights ranged from 15.6 to 3.6kDa, with nine bands (15.6, 13.5, 12.7, 11.7, 10.5, 8.7, 7.8, 5.6, and 4.9kDa) present in samples from all dogs. Combined for both gels, the majority of bands (85%) had molecular weights <17kDa, with B20 (15.6kDa) in high concentrations in samples from all dogs. There were positive correlations (P ≤0.01) between two bands, B4 (67kDa) and B5 (58.6kDa), and sperm motility (r =0.66 and r =0.46), sperm vigor (r =0.56 and r =0.66), percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa (r =0.55 and r =0.59), the hypoosmotic swelling test (r =0.76 and r =0.68), and fluorescent staining (r =0.56 and r =0.59), respectively. In conclusion, 37 proteins were identified in seminal plasma; two were significantly correlated with semen characteristics.

Wastewaters generated from hospitals contain pharmaceuticals residues, pathogens, chemical reagents, radionuclide, and other harmful matter. The wastewater characteristics, quantity, and handling methods have not only variations among countries but also within a country. Some hazardous substances of hospital wastewaters (HWWs) may have a regulatory status and should be treated accordingly while others have characteristics similar to that of domestic sewage. At a global level, guidelines do exist for treatment of these HWWs. But literatures have shown that legislation has various loopholes in implementation. This chapter outlines the current status of management and handling of HWWs around the major industrial hubs of worlds in two categories of developed (the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe) and developing (India, China, Iran, and Bangladesh) countries. Various literatures and guidelines of these countries have been referred which mainly highlight different treatment scenarios and status of coverage of HWW management guidelines.

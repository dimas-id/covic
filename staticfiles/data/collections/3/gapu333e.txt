The demand for general anesthesia in pediatric radiosurgery has been increasing, but the issues involved are not highlighted well in the medical literature. We developed remotely controlled monitoring and anesthesia techniques, and applied our system to three pediatric patients who underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery with automated settings. Based on the perioperative safety management, the following issues are of considerable concern: to avoid emotional trauma associated with the treatment, to secure airway patency in a variety of head positions, and to apply all standard monitors. In this report, we describe the details of our project with a comprehensive literature review.

A coronavirus was isolated from feces of a diarrheic foal and serially propagated in human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18) cells. Antigenic and genomic characterizations of the virus (isolate NC99) were based on serological comparison with other avian and mammalian coronaviruses and sequence analysis of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. Indirect fluorescent-antibody assay procedures and virus neutralization assays demonstrated a close antigenic relationship with bovine coronavirus (BCV) and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (mammalian group 2 coronaviruses). Using previously described BCV primers, the N protein gene of isolate NC99 was amplified by a reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) procedure. The RT-PCR product was cloned into pUC19 and sequenced; the complete N protein of NC99 (446 amino acids) was then compared with published N protein sequences of other avian and mammalian coronaviruses. A high degree of identity (89.0 to 90.1%) was observed between the N protein sequence of NC99 and published sequences of BCV (Mebus and F15 strains) and human coronavirus (strain OC43); only limited identity (<25%) was observed with group 1 and group 3 coronaviruses. Based on these findings, the virus has been tentatively identified as equine coronavirus (ECV). ECV NC99 was determined to have close antigenic and/or genetic relationships with mammalian group 2 coronaviruses, thus identifying it as a member of this coronavirus antigenic group.

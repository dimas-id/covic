A novel coronavirus (SARS-coronavirus, SARS-CoV) was discovered as the pathogen of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). According to studies with other coronaviruses, the membrane protein (M protein) is the main structural protein and the recombinant M protein may be useful as an antigen for detecting antibodies against coronavirus and for preparing vaccine. In this work, the M protein of SARS-CoV was expressed in E. coli as fusion protein with maltose binding protein at N-terminus and MxeGyrA intein CBD at C-terminus. The recombinant protein was identified by Western blot and mass spectrometry. The soluble parts of the cell crude extract were then partially purified by MBP affinity chromatography. The purified protein will be used for the studies on M protein's structure and the development of diagnostic method of SARS.

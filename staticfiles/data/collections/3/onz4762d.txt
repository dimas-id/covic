Abstract: This chapter summarises data on the persistence of food-and waterborne viruses in the natural environment and discusses the different factors which can affect this persistence. Conventional and alternative methods by which persistence can be studied are described, and the natural factors influencing virus persistence outside the host organism are discussed. Available data concerning virus persistence in water, soil, on surfaces and in food products are reviewed.

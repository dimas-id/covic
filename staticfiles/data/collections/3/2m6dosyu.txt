The present report describes outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal cross bred cattle calves ageing 1–2 months in an organized dairy farm. The protozoan infection was confirmed by identifying bright red oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. in the faecal samples after staining with modified acid Fast Zeihl–Neelsen stain. Metronidazole and furazolidone combination was able to induce clinically and parasitological recovery. This is believed to be the first report on the successful use of this drug combination against cryptosporidiosis.

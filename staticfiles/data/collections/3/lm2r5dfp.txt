Aerosolized ribavirin has been used in pediatric immunocompromised patients to treat acute respiratory viral infections, but oral ribavirin may be a less expensive alternative that allows for outpatient therapy. Oral ribavirin has compared favorably to aerosolized ribavirin in adult studies, but data on safety are lacking in pediatric populations. Four cases are described in which oral ribavirin was used to treat viral respiratory infections in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants at a Children's Hospital, demonstrating safety and feasibility.

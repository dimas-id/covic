Viral pandemics are emerging as a serious global threat to public health, like the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Viruses, especially those belonging to a large family of +ssRNA viruses, have a high possibility of mutating by inserting, deleting, or substituting one or multiple genome segments. It is of great importance for human health worldwide to predict the possible virus mutations, which can effectively avoid the potential second outbreak. In this work, we develop a GAN-based multi-class protein sequence generative model, named ProteinSeqGAN. Given the viral species, the generator is modeled on RNNs to predict the corresponding antigen epitope sequences synthesized by viral genomes. Additionally, a Graphical Protein Autoencoder (GProAE) built upon VAE is proposed to featurize proteins bioinformatically. GProAE, as a multi-class discriminator, also learns to evaluate the goodness of protein sequences and predict the corresponding viral species. Further experiments show that our ProteinSeqGAN model can generate valid antigen protein sequences from both bioinformatics and statistics perspectives, which can be promising predictions of virus mutations.

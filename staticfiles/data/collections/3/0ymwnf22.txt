INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a timely response from the healthcare system train a large and diverse group of healthcare workers/responders swiftly. METHODS: In order to address this need, we created a downloadable pedagogical video content through first-person point-of-view to rapidly train users on COVID-19 procedures in the RevinaxÂ® Handbook mobile App. Eight new tutorials were designed through this technology platform to assist healthcare workers/responders caring for COVID-19 patients. A survey was then sent to assess their interest. RESULTS: In one-month since the App was created, it was downloaded by 12,516 users and a feedback survey determined that the users valued the tutorials in helping them learn COVID-19 procedures efficiently in real-time. The fast-growing number of downloads and positive user feedback evidences that we created a valuable educational tool with an emergent- and growing-demand. DISCUSSION: The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial. The fact that these healthcare workers/responders took the time to complete the survey during a pandemic was indicative of its immediate value. Further, the App users indicated that they FPV tutorial was rather helpful in addressing their training needs regarding their roles in COVID-19 patient care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The tutorials were deployed to offer efficient and rapid global public health educational outreach as a tool to address COVID-19 healthcare training in a timely manner.

Biosecurity is emerging as a major global health priority for which innovative and unprecedented solutions are needed. Biosecurity is a challenging biocomplexity problem involving multifaceted processes such as interactions between humans and nonhuman biota, anthropogenic environmental and ecological factors, and socioeconomic and political pressures. Key to an effective biosecurity strategy will be fundamental understanding of evolutionary, anthropogenic and environmental driving forces at play in transmission and perpetuation of infectious diseases. Biosecurity solutions will depend on increased support of basic biomedical research and public education, enhanced healthcare preparedness, alternative strategies for ensuringsafety, and improved interagency cooperation regarding global health policy.

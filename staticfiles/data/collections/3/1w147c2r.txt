Coronavirus disease 2019 has become a worldwide pandemic By April 7, 2020, approximately 1,279,722 confirmed cases were reported worldwide including those in Asia, European Region, African Region and Region of the Americas Rapid and accurate detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for patient care and implementing public health measures to control the spread of infection In this study, we developed and validated a rapid total nucleic acid extraction method based on real‐time RT-PCR for reliable, high‐throughput identification of SARS-CoV-2 using the BD MAX platform For clinical validation, 300 throat swab and 100 sputum clinical samples were examined by both the BD MAX platform and in-house real-time RT-PCR methods, which showed 100% concordant results This BD MAX protocol is fully automated and the turnaround time from sample to results is approximately 2 5 h for 24 samples compared to 4 8 h by in-house real-time RT-PCR Our developed BD MAX RT-PCR assay can accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 infection and shorten the turnaround time to increase the effectiveness of control and prevention measures for this emerging infectious disease

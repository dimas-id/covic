Fourteen cytokines or chemokines were analyzed on 88 RT‐PCR‐confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. IFN‐γ, IL‐18, TGF‐β, IL‐6, IP‐10, MCP‐1, MIG, and IL‐8, but not of TNF‐α, IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐10, IL‐13, or TNFRI, were highly elevated in the acute phase sera of Taiwan SARS patients. IFN‐γ was significantly higher in the Ab(+) group than in the Ab(−) group. IFN‐γ, IL‐18, MCP‐1, MIG, and IP‐10 were already elevated at early days post fever onset. Furthermore, levels of IL‐18, IP‐10, MIG, and MCP‐1 were significantly higher in the death group than in the survival group. For the survival group, IFN‐γ and MCP‐1 were inversely associated with circulating lymphocytes count and monocytes count, but positively associated with circulating neutrophils count. It is concluded that an interferon‐γ‐related cytokine storm was induced post SARS coronavirus infection, and this cytokine storm might be involved in the immunopathological damage in SARS patients.

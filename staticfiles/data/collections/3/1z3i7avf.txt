Abstract: As soon as it became clear that our economy was going to be paralyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, AAHKS leadership acted swiftly to ensure that our members were going to be eligible for the anticipated federal economic stimulus. The cessation of elective surgery, enacted in mid-March and necessary to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, would surely challenge the solvency of many of our members’ practices. While our advocacy efforts discussed below have helped, clearly more relief is needed. Fortunately, our mitigation efforts have led to a “flattening of the curve” and discussions have begun on when, where, and how to safely start elective surgery again.

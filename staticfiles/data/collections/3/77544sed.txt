ssRNA phages belonging to the family Leviviridae are among the tiniest viruses, infecting various Gram-negative bacteria by adsorption to their pilus structures. Due to their simplicity, they have been intensively studied as models for understanding various problems in molecular biology and virology. Several of the studied ssRNA characteristics, such as coat proteinâ€“RNA interactions and the ability to readily form virus-like particles in recombinant expression systems, have fueled many practical applications such as RNA labeling and tracking systems and vaccine development. In this chapter, we review the life cycle, structure and applications of these small yet fascinating viruses.

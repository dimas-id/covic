Respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the Middle East (MERS-Co V) has caused wide attention since it was discovered, and the design of effective vaccines for MERS-Co V becomes a hot area at present. Therefore, this review is aimed at novel research progress of the recombinant vaccine for MERS-Co V, including selection and improvement of animal model for vaccine test,construction and optimization of recombinant subunit vaccine, attempts at recombinant live vector vaccine based on varies of vectors, as well as the advantages of pseudovirus. In conclusion, we make a summary about the novel research progress of the recombinant vaccine for MERS-Co V and a promising prospect of its development in terms of both safety and effectiveness verification in the future will be demonstrated.

Abstract Pigs suffer enteritis induced by pathogenic bacteria infection and toxins in the moldy feed, which cause intestinal epithelial damage and diarrhea through the whole breeding cycle. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal mucosal barrier function through repairing intestinal epithelial damage. However, little was known about the effects of IL-22 against apoptosis caused by toxins and infection of intestinal pathogens in the intestinal epithelium, especially in pigs. In this study, we had successfully used prokaryotic expression system to produce recombinant porcine interleukin-22. Meanwhile, purified rIL-22 could activate STAT3 signal pathway and have been demonstrated to be safe to IPEC-J2 cells by increasing E-cadherin expression, without proinflammatory cytokines changes. Furthermore, rIL-22 reversed apoptosis induced by deoxynivalenol (DON) and played a vital part in repairing the intestinal injury. We also found that rIL-22 stimulated epithelial cells to secrete pBD-1 against enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) K88 infection, as well as alleviating apoptosis ratio. This study provided a theoretical basis for curing intestinal inflammation caused by ETEC infection and epithelial apoptosis induced by DON with rIL-22 in pigs.

A 57-year-old man presented with a progressive flaccid symmetrical motor and sensory neuropathy following a 1-week history of cough and malaise. He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome secondary to COVID-19 and started on intravenous immunoglobulin. He proceeded to have worsening respiratory function and needed intubation and mechanical ventilation. This is the first reported case of this rare neurological complication of COVID-19 in the UK, but it adds to a small but growing body of international evidence to suggest a significant association between these two conditions. Increasing appreciation of this by clinicians will ensure earlier diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients presenting with this.

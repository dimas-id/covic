We have been studying SIR models, in which the transitions are from susceptible to infective to removed, with the removal coming through recovery with full immunity (as in measles) or through death from the disease (as in plague, rabies, and many other animal diseases). Another type of model is an SIS model in which infectives return to the susceptible class on recovery because the disease confers no immunity against reinfection. Such models are appropriate for most diseases transmitted by bacterial or helminth agents, and most sexually transmitted diseases (including gonorrhea, but not such diseases as AIDS, from which there is no recovery). One important way in which SIS models differ from SIR models is that in the former there is a continuing flow of new susceptibles, namely recovered infectives. Later in this chapter we will study models that include demographic effects, namely births and deaths, another way in which a continuing flow of new susceptibles may arise.

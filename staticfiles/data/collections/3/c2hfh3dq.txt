Abstract On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared that the influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus had become the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Rapid detection and differentiation from seasonal and avian influenza would be beneficial for patient management and infection control. It was the aim of this study to develop a real-time RT-PCR that can detect all influenza A viruses and offer simultaneous typing for influenza A/H1N1/2009. This would be a useful addition to existing diagnostic protocols for influenza A. Its routine use would allow laboratories to screen out influenza A/H1N1/2009 positive samples rapidly and would reduce overall testing costs.

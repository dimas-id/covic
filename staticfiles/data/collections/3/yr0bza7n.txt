KEY MESSAGE A detailed, step-by-step protocol for isolation of rice gametes for transcriptional profiling, with a general workflow that includes controls for RNA contamination from surrounding cells and tissues is presented. Characterization of the transcriptome and other -omics studies of flowering plant gametes are challenging as a consequence of the small sizes and relative inaccessibility of these cells. Collecting such poorly represented cells is also complicated by potential contamination from surrounding sporophytic, adjacent gametophytic tissues and difficulties in extracting high-quality intact cells. Here we present detailed, step-by-step procedures for collecting intact, unfixed rice (Oryza sativa) egg cells and sperm cells without enzymatic treatments. In addition, we also present a general workflow for assessing sample purity by RT-PCR, using primers specific for marker genes preferentially expressed in surrounding cells and tissues. These protocols should facilitate future studies of genome-scale characterization of gametes in this important model crop.

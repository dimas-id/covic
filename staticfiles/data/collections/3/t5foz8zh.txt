We have read with great care and interest the article by Li et al The authors provide interesting elements with respect to the possible entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at the brain area and plead for an implication of the central nervous system in respiratory problems linked to coronavirus disease. Here we provide additional elements that support those observations, notably the role of brainstem structures located in the medulla oblongata in modulating respiration. We also discussed the possible pathways the virus uses to cross the brain blood barrier and reach the brainstem.

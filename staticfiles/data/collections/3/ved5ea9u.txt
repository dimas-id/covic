Abstract Purified preparations of the Spanish field isolate of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus AST/89 were found to contain the plus-stranded genomic RNA of more than 7.4 kilobases (kb) and large amounts of a subgenomic mRNA of 2.4 kb. The smaller RNA was translated in vitro and shown to code for a 60 kDa protein which was immunoprecipitated using anti-RHDV as well as anti-VP60 sera.

INTRODUCTION The cost associated with single-port laparoscopic access devices may limit utilisation of single-port laparoscopic surgery by colorectal surgeons. This paper describes a simple and cheap access modality that has facilitated the widespread adoption of single-port technology in our practice both as a stand-alone procedure and as a useful adjunct to traditional multiport techniques. METHODS A surgical glove port is constructed by applying a standard glove onto the rim of the wound protector/retractor used during laparoscopic resectional colorectal surgery. To illustrate its usefulness, we present our total experience to date and highlight a selection of patients presenting for a range of elective colorectal surgery procedures. RESULTS The surgical glove port allowed successful completion of 25 single-port laparoscopic procedures (including laparoscopic adhesiolysis, ileo-rectal anastomosis, right hemicolectomy, total colectomy and low anterior resection) and has been used as an adjunct in over 80 additional multiport procedures (including refashioning of a colorectal anastomosis made after specimen extraction during a standard multiport laparoscopic anterior resection). CONCLUSIONS This simple, efficient device can allow use of single-port laparoscopy in a broader spectrum of patients either in isolation or in combination with multiport surgery than may be otherwise possible for economic reasons. By separating issues of cost from utility, the usefulness of the technical advance inherent within single-port laparoscopy for colorectal surgery can be better appreciated. We endorse the creative innovation inherent in this approach as surgical practice continues to evolve for ever greater patient benefit.

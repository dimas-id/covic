BACKGROUND To study the molecular mechanism of interferon alpha2b(IFNalpha2b) inhibiting the SARS virus replication. SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS virus) cDNA chip was developed and applied to detect the virus RNA transcription levels in the interferon-treated and untreated cell cultures, and the mechanism of anti-SARS virus activity of interferon alpha2b in cell culture system was explored. METHODS SARS virus cDNA chip was prepared by comparing the published SARS virus genome sequence, and the cDNA chip was used to study the interferon alpha2b function during SARS virus replication. RESULTS SARS virus cDNA chip was successfully prepared by using PCR method. The results showed that the cDNA chip could be used to detect the viral RNA transcription level. Interferon alpha2b could inhibit almost all the SARS virus gene transcription. An unknown gene at the position 28130-28426 bp, named as U gene, may play an important role during the viral replication. CONCLUSION A SARS virus whole genome cDNA chip was established. It could be used to study the virus molecular biology and antiviral drug screening. The results also showed that interferon alpha2b could inhibit almost the whole virus gene transcription by using the cDNA chip.

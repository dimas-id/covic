Blood is classified as a drug and transfusion is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the USA. General knowledge of blood manufacturing, shelf life and storage media, common component modifications, blood types, and product compatibility allows the clinician to better communicate their needs and to understand what options may be available when ordering blood products. All transfusions offer benefits, and the clinician must comprehend the possible adverse events, especially those related to TRALI, which continues to be the most common cause of transfusion-related death reported to FDA, with TACO as the second most-commonly reported event. Transfusing in the setting of hemorrhagic blood loss adds additional challenges regarding volume overload, coagulopathy, and optimum transfusion ratios of red cells, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. The information imparted in this chapter will help equip the clinician with the knowledge needed to make the best decisions for patients requiring blood products, especially injured patients.

To deliver their genetic material into host cells, enveloped viruses have surface glycoproteins that actively cause the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Recently determined X-ray crystal structures of the paramyxovirus fusion (F) protein in its pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations reveal the dramatic structural transformation that this protein undergoes while causing membrane fusion. Conformational changes in key regions of the F protein suggest the mechanism by which the F protein is activated and refolds.

European populations of free-living wildcats have been shown to be exposed to cat viruses. Luxembourg has a high degree of habitat fragmentation, and hybridisation rates between domestic cats and wildcats are high. We therefore assessed the seroprevalence of six viruses in 34 serum samples collected between 2001 and 2016 from wildcats in Luxembourg. The values for feline leukemia virus (FeLV; 52.9%) and feline coronavirus (FCoV; 47.1%) were amongst the highest reported for wildcats. We found evidence for the cumulative likelihood of exposure to FCoV affecting its seroprevalence. Routine monitoring of viral agents in this strictly protected species should be considered.

Knowledge regarding the modes of transmission of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza continues to develop, as do recommendations for the prevention of spread within healthcare facilities. The adoption of the most prudent, multifaceted approaches is recommended until there is significant evidence to reduce protective measures. The greatest threat to healthcare personnel and patients appears to be exposure to patients, healthcare personnel, or visitors who have not been recognized as contagious. The processes used within healthcare facilities must hold this concept central to any infection control plan and act in a preventive manner. This article focuses on the development of an algorithm for intensive care unit intake precautions, based on the early identification of potential source patients, as well as appropriate selection and adequate use of personal protective equipment. Visitor management, hand and respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette have been used as measures to decrease the spread of infection. Vaccination of healthcare personnel, combined with work furlough for ill workers, is also explored. Recommendations include the elimination of potential exposures, engineering and administrative controls, and utilization of personal protective equipment.

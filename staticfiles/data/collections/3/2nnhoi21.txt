PET-CT is now the mainstay for imaging lymphoma patients. The complimentary nature of the metabolic and anatomic information provided by a PET-CT examination has become an essential component of patient management, complimenting clinical and laboratory criteria used in staging, restaging, and therapy monitoring. The nature of a particular lymphoma subtype and the patient’s clinical presentation will determine the extent PET-CT imaging is best employed in a particular patient’s management.

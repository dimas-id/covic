Abstract Background Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) present unique characteristics including disease vintage, immunosuppression, and single functioning kidneys. We conducted preliminary analyses to assess the impact of COVID-19 on outcomes in KTR compared to non-transplant patients. Methods We evaluated published information in peer-reviewed journals between 01/01/20 and 04/24/2020 with available data on AKI, renal replacement therapy (RRT), intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and death, and compared clinical outcomes in KTR versus non-transplant recipients with COVID-19. Results A total of 19 published articles were identified, including a total of 88 KTR and 5,342 non-transplant patients. The sample size varied between 2 and 2,634. Mean age was 58.6 years vs. 58.9 years in KTR vs. non-transplant. Patient-level incidence of AKI (27.5% vs. 13.3%, p<0.001), RRT (15.4% vs. 3.3%, p<0.001), ICU stay (34.1% vs. 15.1%, p<0.001), and death (22.7% vs 16.2%, p=0.10), was higher in KTR, representing relative risks of 2.06 (1.44, 2.96), 4.72 (2.62, 8.51), 2.25 (1.67, 3.03), and 1.41 (0.95, 2.08), respectively. Conclusion Early results suggest that the KTR are at significantly greater risk of AKI, RRT, and ICU stay from COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. The risk of death may not be significantly different.

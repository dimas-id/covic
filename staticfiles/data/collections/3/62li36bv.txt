The repair of hernias through iliac crest defects is challenging secondary to the inherent weakness of the abdominal musculature and the rigidity of the pelvis. The defect is surrounded by inadequate tissue to properly buttress the repair. Full-thickness tricortical bone harvested from the iliac may result in an incisional hernia through the bony defect. Options for repair include using the aponeurosis of the gluteus muscle, prosthetic material, or straightening the iliac crest. We report two patients who had their defects repaired laparoscopically using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh. Two patients with hernias following full-thickness iliac crest bone harvest presented secondary to increasing pain and size of their hernias. Both defects were repaired laparoscopically using spiral tacks laterally, medially, and superiorly, and with an intracorporeal stitch inferiorly at the iliac crest to secure the mesh. The two defects averaged 24.5 cm(2) in size and were repaired with PTFE mesh. For adequate visualization, the cecum was mobilized and the mesh repair overlapped the defects by a 4-cm margin. Both patients were discharged after 2.5 days. There were no infectious or neurologic complications, and neither patient has recurred. The laparoscopic approach to the repair of hernias resulting from tricortical iliac crest bone harvest is safe and may be preferable to open repair. Advantages include durable repair, better interoperative visualization, and reduced post-operative pain, morbidity, and hospital stay.

Mexican health policy is promoting the quality of health services by hospital certification meeting the NMX-CC standards family, which is the Mexican equivalent of the ISO 9000 standards family. These standards can help both product- and service-oriented organizations achieve standards of quality that are recognized and respected throughout the world in developing a quality management system (QMS).

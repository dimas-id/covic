Until recently it was believed that extracellular gadolinium based contrast agents were safe for both the kidneys and all other organs within the dose range up to 0.3 mmol/kg body weight. However, in 2006, it was demonstrated that some gadolinium based contrast agents may trigger the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a generalised fibrotic disorder, in renal failure patients. Accordingly, the use of gadodiamide and gadopentate dimeglumine for renal failure patients was banned in Europe in spring 2007. The same two compounds should only be used cautiously in patients with moderate renal dysfunction. The current paper reviews the situation (July 2007) regarding gadolinium based contrast agent and the severe delayed reaction to some of these agents. The fear of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis should not lead to a denial of a well indicated enhanced magnetic resonance imaging examination.

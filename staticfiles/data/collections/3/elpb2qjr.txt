LiveOnNY, the organ procurement organization (OPO) for the greater New York metropolitan area, suspended several best practices to manage the rising referrals of deaths from hospitals during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. On April 2, 2020 hospitals in the donor service area were notified that COVID‐19 referrals should be deferred. Still, only 2% of referred patients to the OPO in April, 2020 were on ventilators and considered possible organ donors, versus a baseline of 11% in 2019. Few of these deaths were unrelated to COVID‐19. Accordingly, organ donors declined to 10 in April (from 26 in March). Despite the exclusion of marginal donors and organs, the implementation of COVID‐19 donor testing and the availability of local procurement surgeons, only 1 organ (a liver) was accepted by a transplant center outside of New York State and 8 organs (5 livers, 4 kidneys) were transplanted in state. 11 organs (1 liver, 10 kidneys) were discarded. Allocation was unsuccessful for 11 additional organs (1 liver, 4 kidneys, 4 hearts, 2 lungs). Despite the obstacles, organ donation remained an important model of collaboration and satisfaction for the healthcare community in the pandemic’s U.S. epicenter. Declining COVID‐19 deaths led to the resumption of the comprehensive referral policy on May 6, 2020, with improvement to 18 donors in May.

Abstract A simple procedure for the analysis of the structural proteins of influenza and parainfluenza viruses utilizing adsorption to erythrocytes is described. The method involves virus growth in the presence of [35S]methionine, adsorption of clarified culture medium with a 0.5% suspension of either guinea-pig or chicken erythrocytes and analysis of the virus-erythrocyte aggregates by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polya-crylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). All of the structural proteins can be detected using this procedure, and the protein profiles of virus-adsorbed erythrocyte complexes compare extremely well with those of sucrose density gradient purified virus preparations.

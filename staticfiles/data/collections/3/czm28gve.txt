Excessive anthropogenic activities have led to high-level ammonia loss and volatilization, which is regarded as a key factor in Chinese haze formation. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of ammonia emission estimations is accomplished at both temporal (1980-2016) and spatial (provincial) scales using a mass-balanced model, and emission projections through 2030 are also studied in different development scenarios. The results show that the ammonia emissions increased from 4.7 Tg N yr-1 in 1980 to 11 Tg N yr-1 in 2016, which is an approximately 2.4-fold increase. The cropland and livestock emissions are the largest contributors, as most reports show approximately 80% contributions; however, nonagriculture sources of fuel combustion, waste treatment and ammonia escape have grown rapidly in recent years, accounting for 14% in 2016. The spatial differences also reveal the complex heterogeneity in Chinese provinces. In addition, the emission intensities of major agriculture and non-agriculture sources are 0-80 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and over 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, indicating a higher degree of ammonia concentration from non-agriculture emissions, which should attract wide concern. In terms of scenario analysis, emissions would reach 12.8 Tg N yr-1 in 2030 under the currently developed model and 7.3 Tg N yr-1 under a series of reduction policies; the spatial analysis also shows that the North China Plain has a 2.1 Tg N yr-1 reduction potential. The results of this study provide new insights into ammonia emission estimations and a better understanding of the environmental impacts of ammonia emitted from different sources.

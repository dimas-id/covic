BACKGROUND This pilot study aimed to evaluate the optical performance and clinical handling of a new variable-view rigid endoscope with angulation from 0 ยบ to 120 ยบ in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. METHODS The EndoCAMeleon endoscope was assessed by experienced surgeons and assistants during a variety of advanced gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. After each procedure, both the surgeon and the assistant each completed questionnaires designed to assess the endoscope's ease of handling and optical performance. RESULTS The endoscope was assessed during 21 advanced procedures. Questionnaire responses confirmed surgeon and assistant satisfaction with the mechanical handling and vision provided by the endoscope. In particular, the ability to vary the viewing angles enabled the surgeon to visualize the surgical site without moving the endoscope shaft. CONCLUSIONS The new endoscope performed well in the hands of experienced surgeons and assistants undertaking advanced procedures. The variable-view rigid endoscope allows the use of visual ports during primary port entry and enhances vision. Further study is required to evaluate its performance in routine practice.

ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has attracted worldwide concerns because of its high person-to-person infectivity and lethality, and it was labeled as a pandemic as the rapid increase of confirmed cases in most areas around the world became evident. The SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. There are also evidences of transmission through aerosols and digestive tracts. Since orthodontic treatment involves large population who need routine return-visits, it was significantly affected and suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of the dental clinics and hospitals. Although the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively controlled in China and many areas have gradually resumed work and classes, orthodontic participants are still under high risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 or patients in the incubation period may cause the cross infection between orthodontic practitioners and patients. The close proximity between the practitioners and the patients, and the generation of droplets and aerosols that contain saliva and blood during treatment further increase the risks of transmission. In this review, we summarized the preventive strategies for controls of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to protect both staffs and patients during the orthodontic practice.

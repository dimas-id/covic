The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the proliferation of a highly contagious and frequently fatal pneumonia around the world.[1] COVID-19 has severely affected Italy, and at the onset of this crisis, Bergamo, a city in northern Italy, regularly reported the highest number of cases in the country for many weeks. During outbreaks of infectious disease, pregnant women represent a high-risk population due to their increased susceptibility to infections, particularly when comorbidities such as pre-gestational diabetes (present in 0.5% of pregnant populations) are present.[2,3] Few data are available on pregnant women with pre-gestational diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

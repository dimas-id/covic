BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke assistance is facing changes and new challenges since COVID-19 became pandemic. A variation on the patient influx might be one of the greater concerns, due to fewer people coming to emergency departments or coming too late. However, no data quantifying this have been published until now. The aim was to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak on hospital stroke admissions and their characteristics in our region. METHODS: The data of every patient admitted to any hospital of our healthcare system with a diagnosis of ischaemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 19 April 2020 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and compared between periods before and after the setting of the state of emergency secondary to the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: In total, 354 patients with ischaemic stroke were admitted in our study period. There was a weekly average of 27.5 cases before the setting of the state of emergency against 12 afterwards (P < 0.001). This drop in stroke cases occurred progressively from week 11, persisting in time despite the decrease in confirmed cases of COVID-19. No differences in the proportion of intravenous thrombolysis (21.1% vs. 21.5%, P = 0.935) or endovascular therapy (12.4% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.510) were found, nor in other demographic or clinical characteristics except for median onset-to-door time (102 vs. 183 min, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: This observational study offers the perspective of a whole region in one of the countries more heavily stricken by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and shows that the decrease of stroke events, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, happened globally and without any specific patient distribution.

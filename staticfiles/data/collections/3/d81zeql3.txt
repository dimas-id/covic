Abstract A synthetic peptide containing selected epitopes from staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) and enterotoxin B (SEB) was used to produce monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to respective enterotoxins in a single fusion procedure. The peptide inhibited the reaction of polyclonal anti-SEA or anti-SEB antisera with their homologous enterotoxin, thus showing that the chosen epitopes are part of the antibody-inducing enterotoxin sequences. Two Mabs, Mab-A and Mab-B, reacted with both the peptide and with either SEA or SEB. Used in a double antibody sandwich ELISA, the Mabs were able to quantitate the native SEA or SEB toxins at nanogram levels.

AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of unidirectional barbed suture technique for vaginal cuff closure in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). METHODS In a retrospective chart review, data were analyzed from 165 patients who underwent a TLH with an unidirectional barbed suture technique for vaginal cuff closure from January 2012 to June 2016 at tertiary-care university-based teaching hospital and academic affiliated hospital. Vaginal cuff was closed by single layer 3/0 V-Loc unidirectional 9â€³, 180 day Absorbable Wound Closure Device (Covidien Healthcare, Mansfield, MA) and the suture was not stitched backward to secure distal end. RESULTS A total of 165 patients were included and the median age was 50 years (range, 35-84 years). The median completion time for hysterectomy time was 100 min (range, 40-240 min) and the median vaginal cuff closure time was 7 min (range, 4-15 min). The median estimated blood loss was 87.8 mL (range 30-250 mL) and the median uterine weight was 200 g (range, 40-900 g). Intraoperative complication included bladder perforation (1.2%) and postoperative complications were vaginal cuff dehiscence (1.8%), cuff cellulitis (0.6%), vesicovaginal fistula (0.6%) and unexplained fever (0.6%). CONCLUSION According to the results of current study, the use of unidirectional barbed suture without backward stitching appears to be safe for the vaginal cuff closure in TLH.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has long been a powerful tool for structural analysis of membrane proteins. However, because of difficulties in resolving contributions from individual residues, most of the derived measurements tend to yield average properties for the system under study. Isotope editing, through its ability to resolve individual vibrations, establishes FTIR as a method that is capable of yielding accurate structural data on individual sites in a protein.

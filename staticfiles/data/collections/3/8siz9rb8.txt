There is a need for widespread testing in India to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus in the population. While RT-PCR is the recommended diagnostic technique, its use is limited to well-equipped laboratories due to the need for specialized instrumentation, reagents and trained personnel. Immunodiagnostic tests are not yet recommended by the WHO for diagnosing active infections. There is a strong need for developing point-of-care molecular tests. Based on our past experience with paperfluidic devices for diagnosing bacterial infections by molecular tests, we propose the development of a diagnostic test for COVID-19. As a platform technology, it could be adapted to other viral outbreaks in future.

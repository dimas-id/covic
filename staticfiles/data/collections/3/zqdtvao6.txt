BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We report our preliminary results in terms of safety and efficacy in using the low-profile LEO Baby stent for the treatment of large-neck and complex intracranial aneurysms with balloon-then-stent-assisted coiling and single- or dual-stent-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical and radiologic data of all consecutive patients treated at our institution from September 2012 to October 2013 for an intracranial aneurysm by using a LEO Baby stent were retrospectively analyzed. Immediate and midterm clinical and anatomic follow-up of each patient is reported. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with 29 aneurysms were treated with LEO Baby stents at our institution. The mean age of patients was 48 years; 20 patients were women (71%). One patient was treated in the acute phase of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 8 procedures, a double-lumen-catheter balloon was used for balloon-then-stent-assisted coiling. In 3 cases, a LEO Baby stent was used in a Y-, T-, and telescopic dual-stent configuration. In 18 cases, a single LEO Baby stent was used. In 2 cases, technical failure to deploy the stent resulted in acute parent artery thrombosis. In 3 further cases, thromboembolic complications occurred intraoperatively. MR imaging and angiographic midterm follow-up showed complete aneurysm occlusion for 96% of the followed patients (27/29). Clinical outcome was favorable for all patients followed up. CONCLUSIONS Results obtained in our study by using the LEO Baby stent for balloon-then-stent and single- or dual-stent-assisted coiling of complex and distally located intracranial aneurysms are encouraging. Incomplete or inadequate opening of the device is a potential cause of laminar blood flow alteration and thrombus formation.

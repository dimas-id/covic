The COVID-19 pandemic represents an international health crisis that is challenging to all governments. Health practitioners in different fields have a duty to guide people and governments to achieve safe health practices. The Saudi Society for Cardiac Surgeons recognizes that it is difficult to establish evidence-based guidelines for safe cardiac surgery practices in such a crisis because this is an unprecedented health pandemic. So we decided to work with our colleagues in other societies by reviewing different recommendations and safe practices issued by different health organizations and scientific societies. The aim was to come up with recommendations that could guide hospitals, physicians, and other members of the healthcare team on the best available practices that are applicable to our community and that will not only ensure optimum patient care delivery but also protect healthcare workers from the risk of infection and aid the national effort in containing and managing this worldwide pandemic.

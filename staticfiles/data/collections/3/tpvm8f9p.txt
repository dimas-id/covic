New improved methods are required for the early detection of esophageal adenocarcinoma in order to reduce mortality from this aggressive cancer. In this review we discuss different screening methods which are currently under evaluation ranging from image-based methods to cell collection devices coupled with biomarkers. As Barrett's esophagus is a low prevalence disease, potential screening tests must be applied to an enriched population to reduce the false-positive rate and improve the cost-effectiveness of the program.

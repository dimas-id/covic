A comprehensive, systematic characterization of cirolating proteins in health and disease will greatly facilitate development of biomarkers for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of cancers and other diseases. The Human Proteome Organization Plasma Proteome Project pilot phase aims to (1) compare the advantages and limitations of many technology platforms; (2) contrast reference specimens of human plasma (ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid, heparin, citrate-anticoagulated) and serum, in terms of numbers of proteins identified and any interferences with various technology platforms; and (3) create a global knowledge base/data repository.

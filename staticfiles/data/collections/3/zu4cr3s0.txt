Background: Small incisional hernias can be repaired laparoscopically with low morbidity and reasonable recurrence rates. The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic with open technique in medium- and large-sized defects regarding postoperative complications and recurrence rates. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, 102 patients with medium- or large-sized defects according to EHS classification underwent incisional hernia repair. Patients' characteristics, hernia size and postoperative complications were prospectively recorded. In October 2016, eligible patients were assessed for recurrence. Results: About 31 patients underwent laparoscopic IPOM and 71 patients open SUBLAY repair. Morbidity rate was significantly lower in IPOM group than in SUBLAY group (19% versus 41%; p = .028). Postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification were significantly lower in the IPOM group (p = .021). Duration of surgery (88 versus 114 min; p = .009) and length of hospital stay (five versus eight days; p < .001) were significantly shorter for IPOM than for SUBLAY. 71 patients were available for follow-up. Recurrence rates showed no significant difference between study groups (13% versus 7%, p = .508). Conclusions: Laparoscopic repair in medium- and large-sized defects is a feasible and safe approach. IPOM compared to SUBLAY significantly reduces postoperative complications and hospital stay; recurrence rates are comparable.

We present the case of a critically ill 47-year-old man diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) who developed extensive pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas in conjunction with an acute abdomen during the recovery phase of his acute lung injury. A non-surgical conservative approach was taken as the definitive surgical procedure; a complete small-bowel resection was deemed to be associated with an unacceptably high long-term morbidity. However, repeat computed tomography four days later showed complete resolution of the original computed tomography findings. Pneumatosis intestinalis from non-ischaemic origins has been described in association with norovirus and cytomegalovirus. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been described in COVID-19.

The advent of new diagnostics assays for Group A Streptococcus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus now provide rapid results with increased sensitivity and specificity. Molecular testing is no longer confined to the walls of the laboratory, but moving to the patient in the form of point-of-care tests. In addition, multiplex syndromic panels are allowing broad testing of pathogens associated with a single clinical presentation. This article focuses specifically on rapid diagnostic tests for pathogens most affecting children. Rapid and accurate pathogen detection in children may result in decreased time to optimal antimicrobial treatment and improved patient outcomes.

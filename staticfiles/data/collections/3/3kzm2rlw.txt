AIM: WHO Malaria report 2017 estimated 216 million cases of malaria and 445,000 deaths worldwide, with 91% of deaths affecting the African region. RESULTS/METHODOLOGY: Microwave promoted the synthesis of cycloalkyl amine substituted isoindoline-1,3-dione-4-aminoquinolines was urbanized for evaluating their antiplasmodial activities. Compound with the optimum combination of propyl chain length and hydroxyethyl piperazine proved to be the most potent among the synthesized scaffolds against chloroquine-resistant W2 strain of Plasmodium falciparum with an IC(50) value of 0.006 Î¼M. Heme-binding along with density functional theory studies were further carried out in order to delineate the mechanism of action of the most active compound. CONCLUSION: The synthesized scaffold can act as a therapeutic template for further synthetic modifications toward the search for a new antimalarial agent.

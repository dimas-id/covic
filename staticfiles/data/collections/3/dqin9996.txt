The recent Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE) challenges current data on the prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The LUNG SAFE investigators claimed that their data demonstrated the predictive validity of the Berlin criteria. Also, the LUNG SAFE showed a disturbingly large gap between scientific evidence and medical practice. All of these statements demand that we question the interpretations of the study's findings.

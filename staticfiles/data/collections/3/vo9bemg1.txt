Abstract Chapter 7 presents six case studies that should provoke the reader to delve more into the particulars of each incident. Specifically, the chapter provides details on the Sverdlovsk anthrax incident (1979); the Rajneeshee Salmonella incident (1984); the Surat, India pneumonic plague outbreak (1994); the Fallen Angel ricin incidents (2003–04); Amerithrax (2001); and the outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa (2014–15). Each of these incidents help illustrate the difference between an unusual natural outbreak and one due to an intentional act. In addition, each case study presented herein shows how confounding these outbreaks can be to public health officials and how fear, panic, and social disruption may ensue.

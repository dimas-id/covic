I read with interest the rapid review by Gupta and colleagues [1] concerning the incidence and timing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) positive faecal samples in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The authors acknowledge insufficient evidence in support of transmission via faeco‐oral route and identify the need for further research regarding the viability of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the context of human faeces. However, it is equally pertinent to consider the viability of the virus in faecal bio‐aerosols generated by toilet plumes [2].

We have treated two patients who had an Achilles tendon and overlying tissue defect using an anterolateral thigh flap with fascia lata. Postoperatively, skeletal suspension of the affected leg and intra-arterial heparin infusion were performed for seven days. Six weeks postoperatively, the patients could walk again.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer is on the rise. Standing on verge of exciting discoveries, research is being translated into therapies that are being widely administered to patients. Providing a hope for cure, where none existed before. This new body of knowledge has come from a better understanding of cancer genetics, molecular and sub molecular behavior, and understanding of cancer-generated cellular environments. These have led to development of immunotherapy and its many sub-genres, improvement and introduction of new radiation technologies, and decreasing toxicities of existing chemotherapies. RECENT FINDINGS: The purpose of this review is to have a summary look at this huge landscape of cancer therapy. Specially looking at toxicities that an anesthesiologist should be familiar with while providing perioperative care for these patients, complications like tumor lysis syndrome, cytokine release syndromes, Kounis syndrome, myocarditis, encephalopathies, and pituitary failure need to be kept in mind. SUMMARY: One should be knowledgeable about these therapies and approach these patients with a high index of suspicion. Anesthesiologists will need to refine preoperative assessment with appropriate testing and intraoperative and postoperative management in collaboration with oncologists, while involving the expertise of internists, cardiologist, and endocrinologists in helping assess and manage these patients in the perioperative period.

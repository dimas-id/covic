BACKGROUND: Risk stratification of HCAP patients is a possible Antimicrobial Stewardship (AST) intervention for the treatment of multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative (GN) vs. community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens. This study assessed the impact of a risk stratification guideline for empiric antimicrobial selection relative to acceptance rates and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In 2017, a guideline for inpatients with HCAP was launched. High risk (HR) of MDR GN was defined as patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), or with >1 risk factor including: receipt of any antimicrobial within 30 days or broad spectrum antimicrobials within 90 days, hemodialysis dependence, or immunocompromised. HR patients were recommended to receive antimicrobials covering MDR GN and low-risk patients to narrower CAP regimens. Patients treated for HCAP post guideline implementation were compared with a historic 2014 cohort for guideline concordance, antimicrobial selection, and clinical outcomes. AST interventions were also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 105 patients in the post-implementation period were compared with 309 historic patients. Guideline-concordant risk-stratified therapy increased 13% [95% CI (3%, 24%)] overall. Clinical failure rates were similar with 11% vs 10% (P = 0.608) in the pre- and post-implementation periods, with an 84% AST acceptance rate (Figure 1). Treatment length decreased [8.1 to 6.6 days (P < 0.001)] and de-escalation increased [31% to 72% (P < 0.001)] as seen in Table 1. CONCLUSION: Introduction of a risk stratified guideline through AST intervention changed practice by matching MDR risk with empiric HCAP therapy. Failure rates were comparable. Secondary benefits included: decreased treatment duration and hospital stay, increased de-escalation rates and decreased MDR GN antimicrobial use in low-risk patients.

Ten strains, eight field and two reference laboratory strains, of canine coronavirus (CCV) were comparatively examined with respect to antigenic relationships and pathogenic potential in dogs. With monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune antisera to feline coronavirus and CCV, respectively, varying degrees of antigenic diversities were found among the strains by neutralization and immunofluorescence assays, but it was felt that they belong to one serotype. Specific-pathogen-free puppies experimentally inoculated with some CCV strains manifested clinical symptoms, but there was a difference in their virulence. In order to elucidate the prevalence of CCV infections in dogs in Japan, we tested for neutralizing antibodies to CCV in 467 field dogs, and found a prevalence of 44.1%. Moreover, by using nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on rectal swabs of 100 diarrheic dogs recently presented in veterinary clinics, evidence of CCV in 16% of these specimens was found. The results suggested that CCV infection is more widespread than expected in dogs, and that CCV is a significant etiologic factor in canine diarrhea also in Japan.

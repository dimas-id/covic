Abstract Little or nothing is known about the correlation between the upper limbs deep vein thrombosis (UL-DVT) and SARS-CoV-2. We describe the increased risk of UL-DVT in 3 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who require continuous positive airway pressure with hood and the need for early adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.

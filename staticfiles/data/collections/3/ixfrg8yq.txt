Influenza C virus contains a single surface glycoprotein in its lipid envelope which is the hemagglutinin‐esterase‐fusion glycoprotein (HEF). HEF binds cell‐surface receptors, is a receptor‐destroying enzyme (a 9‐O‐acetylesterase), and mediates the fusion of virus and host cell membranes. A bromelain‐released soluble form of HEF has been crystallized. Two different tetragonal forms have been identified from crystals with the same morphology [P (1(3))22, a = b = 154.5, c = 414.4 Å, and P4(1(3))2(1)2, a = b = 217.4, c = 421.4 Å]. Both crystal forms share a common packing scheme. Synchrotron data collection and flash cooling of crystals have been used for high‐resolution data collection.

Cathepsin B is a potential target for the development of drugs to treat several important human diseases. A number of inhibitors targeting this protein have been developed in the past several years. Recently, a group of small molecules were identified to have inhibitory activity against cathepsin B through high throughput screening (HTS) tests. In this study, traditional continuous and binary QSAR models were built to classify the biological activities of previously identified compounds and to distinguish active compounds from inactive compounds for drug development based on the calculated molecular and physicochemical properties. Strong correlations were obtained for the continuous QSAR models with regression correlation coefficients (r(2)) and cross-validated correlation coefficients (q(2)) of 0.77 and 0.61 for all compounds, and 0.82 and 0.68 for the compound set excluding 3 outliers, respectively. The models were further validated through the leave-one-out (LOO) method and the training-test set method. The binary models demonstrated a strong level of predictability in distinguishing the active compounds from inactive compounds with accuracies of 0.89 and 0.94 for active and inactive compounds, respectively, in non-cross-validated models. Similar results were obtained for the cross-validated models. Collectively, these results demonstrate the modelsâ€™ ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds, suggesting that the models may be used to pre-screen compounds to facilitate compound optimization and to design novel inhibitors for drug development.

Assessing the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is a daily challenge for anesthesiologists. The best assessment of the depth of anesthesia is commonly thought to be the one made by the doctor in charge of the patient. This evaluation is based on the integration of several parameters including epidemiological, pharmacological and physiological data. By developing a protocol to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the consciousness level of the patient. We developed a complete solution for high-resolution longitudinal follow-up of patients during anesthesia. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was trained on the database in order to predict and assess states based on four physiological variables that were adjusted to the consciousness level: Heart Rate (HR), Mean Blood Pressure (MeanBP) Respiratory Rate (RR), and AA Inspiratory Concentration (AAFi) all without using EEG recordings. Patients undergoing general anesthesia for hernial inguinal repair were included after informed consent. The algorithm was tested on 30 patients. The percentage of error to identify the actual state among Awake, LOC, Anesthesia, ROC and Emergence was 18%. This protocol constitutes the very first step on the way towards a multimodal approach of anesthesia. The fact that our first classifier already demonstrated a good predictability is very encouraging for the future. Indeed, this first model was merely a proof of concept to encourage research ways in the field of machine learning and anesthesia.

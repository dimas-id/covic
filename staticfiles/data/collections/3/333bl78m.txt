The questions how a viral infection induces cellular autoimmune reactions (CMAI) and which components of both virus and auto-antigen play part in this process were addressed in our animal model of measles virus (MV)-induced CMAI against myelin basic protein (MBP) during subacute measles encephalitis (SAME). In an attempt to define whether cellular or humoral immune responses are involved in the occurrence of the autoimmune based disease process, Lewis rats were treated with different combinations of antibodies and T cells reactive with either MV and its structural proteins or MBP and MBP-peptides. The only treatment combination after which experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-like disease and pathology developed was when non-encephalitogenic T cells reactive against residues 69â€“81 of MBP were adoptively transferred into MV-infected Lewis rats. The results of the study show that T cells which are non-encephalitogenic in the normal central nervous tissue are capable of inducing an allergic encephalomyelitis in animals with a viral infection involving the brain.

The CoViD-19 pandemic has changed the concept of clinic and doctor-patient relationship. Due to the risk of mutual contagion, patients in many cases were managed without direct physical contact. This resulted in a forced acceleration towards e-health and remote consultation. The onset of a new professional figure is ever closer, the virtualist, the doctor who can treat patients without direct physical contact. For this reason, new skills and organizational methods are needed to create a care approach capable of integrating technology opportunities with the traditional clinical method.

Advocacy of the use of facemasks by the public as a measure against the spread of COVID‐19 is controversial, with some healthcare professionals arguing that the use of a face mask may increase the rate at which people touch their faces, due to readjusting the mask. We assessed the facial touching behaviour of bus passengers in China before and after the outbreak of COVID‐19 and found that wearing a face mask does not increase the number of hand‐face contacts and is likely, therefore, to have a positive beneficial effect on suppressing the spread of COVID‐19 within populations when used in conjunction with social distancing measures.

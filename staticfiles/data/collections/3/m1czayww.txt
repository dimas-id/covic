BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate outcomes in the treatment of bilateral inguinal hernia, comparing the laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) and open tension-free mesh repair (LICHT) approaches. METHODS We performed a prospective controlled non randomized clinical study in 128 patients with bilateral inguinal hernia over a period of 3 years. LICHT was used in 106 cases (53 patients) while TEP was employed in 150 cases (75 patients). The main outcome measurements were: recurrence rate, operating time, hospital stay and postoperative complications. RESULTS There were three recurrences (2.3%): two in the LICHT group (3.8%) and one (1.3%) in the TEP group P = NS. The TEP procedure was faster than LICHT repair (48.8 ± 10.8 vs. 70.4 ± 11.2 min) P < 0.01. Postoperative complications were more frequent in LICHT group (16%) than TEP group (5.3%) P < 0.01. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the TEP group (0.6 ± 0.8 vs. 1.3 ± 1.2 days) P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS The TEP approach is an effective option for the treatment of bilateral inguinal hernia when performed by experienced surgeons.

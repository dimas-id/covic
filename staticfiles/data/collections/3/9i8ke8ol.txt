Developing successful drug delivery methods is challenging for any tissue, and the eye is no exception. Translating initial concepts into advanced technologies treating diseases in preclinical models and finally into functional and marketable products for humans can be particularly daunting. While referring to specific ophthalmic companies and products, this review considers key exchanges that lead to successful translation. By building on basic science discoveries in the academic setting, applied science can perform proof-of-concept work with simple, benchtop experiments. Eventually, simple models need to be translated to more robust ones where cells, tissues, and entire organisms are incorporated. Successful translation also includes performing due diligence of the intellectual property, understanding the market needs, undertaking clinical development, meeting regulatory requirements, and eventually scale up manufacturing. Different stages of the translation can occur in different environments, including moving from academia to industry, from one company to another, or between veterinary and human applications. The translation process may also rely on contract organizations to move through the complex landscape. While the path to a commercial, marketable product may not look the same each time, it is important to design a development plan with clear goals and milestones to keep on track.

BACKGROUND The present study was performed to determine whether thyroidectomy patients undergoing general anesthesia provided with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) have a lower risk of voice-related complications and laryngopharyngeal symptoms than those undergoing endotracheal intubation (ETI). MATERIALS AND METHODS In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, we studied 64 patients undergoing elective thyroid lobectomy between July 2013 and February 2014. Acoustic analyses were performed preoperatively and at 48 h and 2 weeks postoperatively. The voice handicap index (VHI), M.D. Anderson dysphagia index (MDADI), and laryngopharyngeal symptom score (LPS) were determined preoperatively and at 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks post-thyroidectomy. RESULTS In acoustic analysis, jitter, shimmer and noise-to-harmonic ratio showed significantly better results in the LMA group than the ETI group 48 h after surgery, but there was no difference at 2 weeks. The incidence of postoperative lower-pitched voice in the LMA group was also significantly lower than that in the ETI group. In the LMA group, the VHI, MDADI, and LPS were better compared to those in the ETI group at 24 h postoperatively, and improved to the preoperative state within 1 week. However, those in the ETI group remained poorer than the preoperative values 1 week after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Use of the LMA in general anesthesia for thyroid surgery has advantages over the ETI in decreasing patients' subjective and objective voice symptoms, reducing the duration of symptoms, and relieving the laryngopharyngeal symptoms.

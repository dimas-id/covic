This commentary article provides observations on the psychosocial consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among people in China and articulates a population health perspective to understand and address identified issues. We highlight key psychosocial effects of COVID-19, such as anxiety, insomnia, and trauma response, in the context of salient factors that shape Chinese people's psychological experiences, including the availability of Internet and technology, large-scale quarantine, economic impact, and the rise of xenophobia globally. Further, from a population health perspective, we make recommendations in COVID-19-related research and interventions that aim to promote the psychosocial health of Chinese people.

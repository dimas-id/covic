There have been a substantial number of studies suggesting possible health benefits from polyphenols in wine, especially red wine. These hypothetical effects, in addition to those of alcohol, are attributed by many to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the polyphenols. The aim of this paper was to map the scientific research on wine and health by using bibliographic analyses of papers published during the period 2002-2011. Papers were published in 535 different journals and in 106 different subject categories, the most productive journals being the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Food Chemistry and Molecular Nutrition, and Food Research, and the most productive subject category being food science and technology. Institutions in the main network of collaboration between centers were primarily located in France, Italy, and the United State. The number of papers on the medicinal use of wine has been dramatically rising in recent years because of the increased awareness of its importance in modern society. We emphasize the large distribution of information among numerous journals and the multidisciplinary nature of the topic. In the network of co-words, we observe the central role played by the terms "resveratrol", "wine", and "polyphenols".

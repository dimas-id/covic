The development of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the field of ceramics has brought new opportunities for the development of virus-removal techniques. A number of nanoceramics, including nanostructured alumina, titania and zirconia, have been introduced for the applications in virus removal or separation. Filtration or adsorption of viruses, and thus the removal of viruses through nanoceramics, such as nanoporous/mesoporous ceramic membranes, ceramic nanofibers and ceramic nanoparticles, will make it possible to produce an efficient system for virus removal from blood and one with excellent chemical/thermal stability. Currently, nanoceramic membranes and filters based on sol-gel alumina membranes and NanoCeram nanofiber filters have been commercialized and applied to remove viruses from the blood. Nevertheless, filtration using nanoporous filters is limited to the removal of only free viruses in the bloodstream.

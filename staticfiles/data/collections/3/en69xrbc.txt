• The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 pandemic as a global public health emergency. • Research community has responded rapidly, and thousands of articles have been published already in scholarly journals, making it difficult for clinicians to sift through the evidence and find answers. • Methodologist researchers and relevant international organizations have addressed the pandemic immediately. However, these efforts are hindered with avoidable problems and massive duplication of effort. • We believe that research methodologists can be very useful now to clinicians. The COVID-evidence project can be an example of how to establish a living dialogue of methodologists and clinicians to fight COVID-19 pandemic.

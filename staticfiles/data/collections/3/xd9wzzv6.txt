Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental requirement for life in multicellular organisms, including humans, and a mechanism to maintain homeostasis and prevent unwarranted cellular proliferations such as cancer. An antisense gene in HIV-1 (Hap) induces apoptosis in human cells. Apoptotic T cell death following HIV-1 infection leads to a compromised immune system and eventually AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). A review of several studies that focused on long-term survivors of HIV-1 reveals that these survivors had deletion-mutations in Hap. A subset of these survivors changed course and experienced CD4+ T cell death and progression to AIDS. These individuals had virus that regained Hap gene sequence that had previously been deleted. Analysis of the changes in the genetic sequences with in vivo progression of the revertant HIV-1 virus allowed identification of a specific region in Hap we are calling MORT. MORT, in Hap RNA forms a primary microRNA-like structure. Potential human mRNAs targeted by MORT mi/siRNAs include gene/RNA sequences of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and apollon, along with many other human gene sites/RNAs. Thus MORT may be acting as an RNA antagonist to cellular IAPs thereby inducing apoptotic cell death. Surprisingly, additional potential MORT targets include viral sites in human SARS-CoV-2, including the protease, nsp5 RNA. Future uses for RNA therapy and a hypothesis for an HIV intrinsic mechanism utilizing MORT for viral anti-viral (or anti-microbial) and HIV anti-immune cell defense are proposed.

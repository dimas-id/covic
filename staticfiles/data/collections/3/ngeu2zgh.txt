PURPOSE The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of ovariectomy by single-port access laparoscopy for cryopreservation. METHODS Observational prospective monocentric study including patients referred for an ovariectomy for ovarian tissue cryopreservation underwent ovariectomy by single-port access laparoscopy. Feasibility, intra- and post-operative complications, and quality of the ovarian tissue collected were reported. RESULTS Height patients were included. No conversion to standard laparoscopy or laparotomy was performed and no intra- or post-operative complications were reported. Median duration of surgery was 35 min (30-60). The quality of all the ovarian tissue collected was correct, and cryopreservation was possible for all patients. CONCLUSIONS Ovariectomy for cryopreservation by laparoscopy with SPA seems feasible. The advantages of this technique are particularly interesting in these patients who require the least aggressive surgical technique possible and a rapid convalescence.

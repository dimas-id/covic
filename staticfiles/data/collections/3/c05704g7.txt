The Iriomote cat (Felis iriomotensis) was first discovered on Iriomote Island in the Yaeyama Islands of Japan in 1965. Ten male and 11 female adult cats were captured during the 6 yr period from 1983 to 1988. These were examined for evidence of viral and mycoplasmal infections. Neither Mycoplasma sp. nor Ureaplasma sp. were detected in swab samples of oropharyngeal and urogenital regions. A foamy virus was isolated from the oropharyngeal swab of a female cat examined in 1988. Feline leukemia virus was not detected in any of the cats. All cats were negative for serum antibodies to feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus, feline immunodeficiency virus and rotavirus. Eleven of 19 (58%), 14 of 17 (82%) and 6 of 17 cats (35%) had serum antibodies against feline calicivirus, coronavirus and feline syncytium forming virus, respectively.

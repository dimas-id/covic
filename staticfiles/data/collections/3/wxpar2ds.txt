BACKGROUND Insufficient coverage of the area of a possible groin hernia is an important risk factor in hernia recurrence. To prevent recurrence, it is important to use the appropriate mesh size based on the size of the myopectineal orifice (MPO), which is the weak area of the abdominal wall where inguinal hernias occur. We aimed to estimate the appropriate mesh size for groin hernias by investigating MPO size. METHODS Four hundred and six patients underwent groin hernia repair using a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach at the Zeze Hospital between July 2009 and December 2017. We investigated patients' backgrounds, MPO components dimensions, and hernia recurrence, and evaluated the appropriate mesh size. RESULTS The 359 male and 47 female patients had an average age of 63 ± 15 years. In 171, 147, and 88 cases, hernias were localized to the right, left, and bilaterally, respectively. The number of lateral, medial, femoral, and combined hernias was 317, 124, 11, and 42, respectively. The 95th percentile for the horizontal and vertical lengths in cases of hernia orifice ≥ 3 cm were 9.6 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively, while it was 9.2 cm and 6.4 cm in cases of hernia orifice < 3 cm. We added 2 cm and 3 cm to the 95th percentile for the length and width of the MPO, resulting in 13.2 × 10.4 cm and 15.6 × 13.0 cm in cases with hernia orifice < 3 cm and ≥ 3 cm, respectively. Relapse after TEP occurred in 1 patient (0.2%). CONCLUSION The appropriate mesh size for TEP repair, derived from intraoperative MPO measurements, was estimated as 13.2 × 10.4 cm and 15.6 × 13.0 cm when the hernia orifice was < 3 cm and ≥ 3 cm, respectively. Using appropriate mesh sizes based on MPO measurement may reduce groin hernia recurrence after TEP.

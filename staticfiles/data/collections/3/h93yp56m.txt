The process of cell death as a result of exposure to pseudorabies virus (PRV) in cultured cells was examined and specific features characteristic of apoptosis were observed. At early times of infection, externalization of membrane phospholipid phophatidylserine was detected by flow cytometry analysis. During the infection process, caspase 3-like protease activity was induced and the activity increased in a time dependent manner. Cellular DNA degradation was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Morphologic changes of the nucleus that included chromatin condensation and margination to the periphery of the nucleus were evident in electron microscopy analysis. These biochemical and morphologic changes demonstrated that, during PRV replication, the host cell was induced to undergo apoptosis.

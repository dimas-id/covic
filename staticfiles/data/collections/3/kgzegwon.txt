Ever since the newscast of the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and its subsequent spread to several countries worldwide, the possible modes of spread are being anticipated by various health care professionals. Tear and other conjunctival secretions, being one of the body fluids, can potentially help transmit the disease inadvertently. Conjunctival secretions from patients and asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 cases may also spread the disease further into the community. Direct inoculation of body fluids into the conjunctiva of healthy individual is also postulated to be another mode of spread. The risk to heath care providers thus becomes strikingly high. A vigilant ophthalmologist can play a critical role in breaking the chain of transmission.

In this population-based study, we identified 307 confirmed COVID-19 cases from massive surveillance, including 129,551 individuals screened at fever clinics or returning from Hubei and 3710 close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Among them, 17 patients were asymptomatic at initial clinical assessment. These asymptomatic patients on admission accounted for a small proportion of all patients (5.54%) with relatively weak transmissibility, and the detection rate was 0.35 per 100 close contacts. Moreover, the dynamics of symptoms of the 307 patients showed that the interval from symptom remission to the final negativity of viral nucleic acid was 5.0 days (IQR 2.0 to 11.0 days), with 14 patients (4.56%) having re-detectable viral RNA after discharge. Together, our findings suggested asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients only accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19. Also, the asymptomatic phase in during recovery of COVID-19 urged that negativity in viral RNA is necessary as de-isolation criteria and follow-up is recommended.

Like most animals, bats are threatened by habitat loss and degradation. However, they are also uniquely threatened almost universally by humans. In this chapter, I will emphasize the educational issues I believe will be most important to the next generation of bat conservationists. Though threat levels and possible solutions vary widely, the importance of addressing unfounded fear cannot be ignored. Putting disease concerns in perspective has been essential throughout the history of bat conservation efforts and is currently a resurgent issue that threatens the educational progress that has been made in recent decades.

OBJECTIVE To compare surgical times and perioperative complication rates of single portal access and 2-portal laparoscopic ovariectomy (LapOVE) in dogs using a bipolar vessel sealer/divider device, and to evaluate the performance of novice laparoscopists for right ovariectomy. STUDY DESIGN Controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS Female dogs (n=42). METHODS Dogs were divided into groups: 1=single portal and 2=2 portal. LapOVE was performed using a 5 mm vessel sealer/divider device and a 10 mm operating laparoscope (Group 1) or a 5 mm laparoscope (Group 2). Dog characteristics (weight, body condition score, ovarian ligament fat score), operative time, and perioperative complication rate were compared between groups. Right ovariectomy duration was evaluated for 2 novice laparoscopists. RESULTS No significant difference was found in mean total surgical time between group 1 (21.07 min/s) and group 2 (19.06 min/s). Factors significantly affecting times included body condition scores, ovarian ligament fat score, ovarian bleeding, and surgeon expertise. Minor complications (bleeding from ovaries or after splenic trauma) occurred and were similar in both groups. Bleeding was correlated to body condition score and ovarian ligament fat score. Interindividual differences were found among surgeons for right ovariectomy time. CONCLUSIONS Single portal access LapOVE using vessel sealer/divider device is feasible, safe, and does not significantly increase total surgical time in comparison with 2-portal approach. Laparoscopic skills may play a role in ability to perform single portal LapOVE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE LapOVE can be performed using single portal access.

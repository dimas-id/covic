A New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-5 (NDM-5)-producing ST16 Klebsiella pneumoniae strain was isolated from a Dutch patient in a long-term care facility without recent travel history abroad. Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) revealed that the Dutch isolate was clonally related to isolates detected in four patients in Denmark in 2014. Public health experts and clinicians need to be informed; repetitive screening may be needed in patients without known risk factors for carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae who have undergone antibiotic treatment.

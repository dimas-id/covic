COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vesicular skin rashes have been reported as associated with COVID-19, but there is little information about this cutaneous manifestation. We designed a prospective observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had vesicular lesions. Clinical characterization of skin findings was conducted by dermatologists. When possible, histological analysis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the content of the vesicles was performed. In total, 24 patients were included. A disseminated pattern was found in 18 patients (75%), and a localized pattern was found in 6 (25%). Median duration of the skin rash was 10 days. Of the 24 patients, 19 (79.2%) developed the skin rash after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Histological examination in two patients was consistent with viral infection, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in four patients. This single-centre study shows the clinical characteristics of vesicular skin rashes in patients with COVID-19.

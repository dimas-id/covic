A severe public health crisis has been declared worldwide since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was classified as a pandemic of acute respiratory infectious disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). China has taken strict measures to curb the spread of the disease to save lives, and has managed to control the outbreak. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close physical contact, so it is challenging to prevent nosocomial infection and possible spread during dental treatment. Since the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, a disease prevention and control strategy based on the new concept of population risk classification and rational use of personal protective equipment has been implemented by the Peking University Hospital of Stomatology. Nosocomial infection prevention and control concepts and measures relating to dental diagnosis and treatment are critically checked in the hospital. Our experiences in handling this situation are shared here and may have wide-ranging implications for infection prevention and control (IPC) for COVID-19 in dental practices worldwide.

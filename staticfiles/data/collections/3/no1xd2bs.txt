OBJECTIVES: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents have specific health care needs and are susceptible to health care disparities. Lack of skills and knowledge on the part of health care providers have a negative effect on their access to care and health outcomes. This study 1) explores the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding LGBT people, and 2) assesses the impact of a one-hour lecture targeting adolescent LGBT health needs. METHODS: Fourth-year medical students attended a compulsory one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and gender identity development in adolescence, highlighting health issues. We created a questionnaire with items to elicit students' knowledge and attitudes about LGBT health issues. Students were invited to complete this questionnaire online anonymously one week before the lecture and one month after the lecture. RESULTS: Out of a total of 157 students, 107 (68.2%) responded to the pre-intervention questionnaire and 96 (61.1%) to the post-intervention questionnaire. A significant proportion-13.7% of all respondents-identified as LGBT or questioning. Our results show that most medical students already show favorable attitudes towards LGBT people and a certain degree of knowledge of LGBT health needs. They demonstrated a large and significant increase in knowledge of LGBT health issues one month after the lecture. DISCUSSION: A single one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and LGBT health issues may increase knowledge among medical students. Medical students and professionals should receive such training to increase their knowledge about LGBT patients as it, together with favorable attitudes, has the potential to improve health outcomes among this vulnerable population.

Kidney transplantation might not be considered a life‐saving procedure as there are alternative forms of renal replacement, although it is superior in the long‐term life expectancy and overall costs.

Since kidney grafts can also be transplanted from a living donor, the suspended elective activity has had a major significant impact for this organ compared to the others.

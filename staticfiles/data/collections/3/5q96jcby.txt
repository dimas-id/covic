The quest for RBCs in transfusion medicine has prompted scientists to explore the large-scale expansion of human RBCs from various sources. The successful production of RBCs in the laboratory depends on the selection of potential cell source, optimized culture, bio-physiological parameters, clinically applicable culture media that yields a scalable, contamination-free, non-reactive, non-tumorogenic, stable and functional end product. The expansion protocol considering the in vivo factors involved in homeostasis can generate a cost-effective and readily available cell source for transfusion. This review paper discusses several approaches used to expand RBCs from various sources of stem cells.

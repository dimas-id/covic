BACKGROUND Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is a safe and efficacious surgical approach for local excision of benign adenomas and early-stage rectal cancer. However, utilization of the technique has been limited due to the unavailability of high-priced specialized instrumentation at many institutions and the technically demanding training required. To avoid these obstacles, we have explored an alternative approach called Transanal Endoscopic Video-Assisted excision, which combines the merits of singleport access and local transanal excision. METHODS A disposable single-incision port is inserted into the anal canal for transanal access. The port contains 3 cannulae for introducing instrumentation into the rectal lumen, and a supplementary cannula for carbon dioxide insufflation. Pneumorectum results in rectal distention and optimizes the visual field during the procedure. Standard laparoscopic instrumentation is utilized for visualization and transanal excision of rectal pathologies. CONCLUSIONS Transanal endoscopic video-assisted excision is an innovative approach to local excision of benign and malignant rectal lesions. The approach averts several of the pitfalls commonly experienced with transanal endoscopic microsurgery. Continued investigation and development of this novel modality will be important in establishing its role in minimally invasive surgery.

The use of extracorporeal support systems in cardiac and/or pulmonary failure is an established treatment option. Although scientific evidence is limited there is an increasing amount of data from individual studies, e.g. Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial 2010, suggesting that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a veno-venous pump-driven system is a life-saving procedure in severe respiratory failure. Initially established as a rescue option for postcardiotomy cardiac failure extracorporeal life support (ECLS) as a pump-driven veno-arterial cardiovascular support system is increasingly being used in cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction, as bridging to transplantation or as part of extended cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) as an arterio-venous pumpless system is technically easier to handle but only ensures sufficient decarboxylation and not oxygenation. Therefore, this method is mainly applied in primarily hypercapnic respiratory failure to allow lung protective ventilation. Enormous technical improvements, e.g. extreme miniaturization of the extracorporeal assist devices must not obscure the fact that this therapeutic option represents an invasive procedure frequently associated with major complications. With this in mind a widespread use of this technology cannot be recommended and the use of extracorporeal systems should be restricted to centers with high levels of expertise and experience.

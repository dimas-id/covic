BACKGROUND Biliopancreatic diversion is perceived as the most effective operation for long-term treatment of massive obesity. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis is a safe and feasible procedure with similar results to the classic derivation, but reducing surgical time without decreasing the efficacy. METHODS Descriptive, observational, prospective study of patients undergoing gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis between April 2010 and December 2015. The postoperative follow-up was 24 months. RESULTS One thousand five hundred twelve patients underwent gastroileal bypass. The mean time of the procedure was 32 min; the average stay was 2.2 days. 30.1% of patients lost more than 100% of their excess weight, and 72.35% of patients lost more than 75% of their excess weight. 95.17% of patients dropped to a BMI < 35; 75.99% to a BMI < 30 and 30.15% to a BMI < 25. CONCLUSIONS Gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis is a safe and fast procedure providing similar results to biliopancreatic diversion with respect to weight loss.

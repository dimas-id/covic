BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented veterinary emergency hospitals with unique challenges. Rapid online surveys represent an efficient way of collating responses to rapidly shifting circumstances. METHODS: Fifty, 24-h small animal emergency veterinary hospital representatives were recruited to participate in weekly surveys in April 2020 to catalog changes due to COVID-19 pandemic. KEY FINDINGS: The majority of emergency veterinary hospitals surveyed reported significant changes to day-to-day operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. SIGNIFICANCE: Reporting of weekly survey results provides useful information on how emergency veterinary hospitals with similar challenges are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

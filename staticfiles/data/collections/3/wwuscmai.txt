Antibody phage display is an in vitro technology to generate recombinant antibodies. In particular for pathogens like viruses or toxins, antibody phage display is an alternative to hybridoma technology, since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system. Phage display allows the generation of human antibodies from naive antibody gene libraries when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. This technology also allows the construction of immune libraries to select in vivo affinity matured antibodies if immunized patients or animals are available. In this review, we describe the generation of human and human-like antibodies from naive antibody gene libraries and antibodies from immune antibody gene libraries. Furthermore, we give an overview about phage display derived recombinant antibodies against viruses and toxins for diagnostics and therapy.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope spike (S) glycoprotein, a class I viral fusion protein, is responsible for the fusion between the membranes of the virus and the target cell. The S2 domain of protein S has been suggested to have two fusion peptides, one located at its N-terminus, downstream of the furin cleavage, and another, more internal, located immediately upstream of the HR1. Therefore, we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide corresponding to segment 873-888 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, peptide SARS IFP, as well as the structural changes taking place in both the phospholipid and the peptide induced by the binding of the peptide to the membrane. We demonstrate that SARS IFP peptide binds to and interacts with phospholipid model membranes and shows a higher affinity for negatively charged phospholipids than for zwitterionic ones. SARS IFP peptide specifically decreases the mobility of the phospholipid acyl chains of negatively charged phospholipids and adopts different conformations in the membrane depending upon their composition. These data support its role in SARS-mediated membrane fusion and suggest that the regions where this peptide resides might assist the fusion peptide and/or the pretransmembrane segment of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein in the fusion process.

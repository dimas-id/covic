OBJECTIVE To report a case of small bowel obstruction caused by barbed suture applied in hysterosacropexy, and possible solutions. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic hysterosacropexy for a Stage 2 uterine prolapse, presenting with acute abdominal pain and a bowel obstruction syndrome 2 days following the surgery. Conservative treatment was given, but the symptoms did not improve and gradually became worse. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed on the 7th day after the hysterosacropexy, and the volvulus was found. The residual end of the barbed V-Loc adopted in the peritoneal closure was incidentally hooked to the mesentery and caused small bowel obstruction. The redundant V-Loc was released and cut off at 2 cm. Neither bowel ischemia nor significant bowel injury was noted. Two days later, she was discharged without complication. CONCLUSION A barbed suture has a risk of bowel obstruction when used in surgery. To avoid a grave prognosis, early diagnosis and prompt management of complication is necessary.

BACKGROUND Knot-tying in the deep operative field is very complicated because of the narrow working space during endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. We present a novel technique for tying deep knots called the "easy slip-knot," which was developed from a knot used to tie fishing lines. METHOD After threading the dura, an easy slip-knot is made outside the nostril. One end of the string is pulled, the knot then naturally slips, and should reach the operative field without needing a knot-pusher. FINDINGS This method is not complicated, is easily applied to the operative field by slipping the knot into position, and is able to tie sutures securely. CONCLUSIONS The easy slip-knot should be useful for endoscopic surgery.

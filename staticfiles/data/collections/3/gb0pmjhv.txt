Awake craniotomy is a unique technique utilized for mapping neuro and motor function during neurosurgical procedures close to eloquent brain tissue. Since active communication is required only during surgical manipulation of eloquent brain tissue and the patient is "sedated" during other parts of the procedure, different methods for anesthesia management have been explored. Furthermore, airway management ranges from spontaneous breathing to oro or nasotracheal intubation. Case reports have described the use of laryngeal masks (LMs) previously; however, its safety compared to tracheal intubation has not been assessed.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 30 patients that underwent awake craniotomy for tumor surgery to compare the feasibility and safety of different airway management strategies. Nasal fiberoptic intubation (FOI) was performed in 21 patients while 9 patients received LM for airway management. Ventilation, critical events, and perioperative complications were evaluated.Cannot intubate situation occurred in 4 cases reinserting the tube after awake phase, while no difficulties were described reinserting the LM (P < .0001). Furthermore, duration of mechanical ventilation after tumor removal was significantly lower in the LM group compared to FOI group (62 ± 24 vs. 339 ± 82 [min] mean ± sem, P < .0001). Postoperatively, 2 patients in each group were diagnosed with and treated for respiratory complications including pneumonia, without statistical significance between groups.In summary, LM is a feasible airway management method for patients undergoing awake craniotomy, resulting in reduced ventilation duration compared to FOI procedure.

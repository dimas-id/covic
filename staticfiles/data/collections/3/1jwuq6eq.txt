It is expected that families will take care of their children until such time as they can care for themselves, and then families will also care for their aging relatives when these elders can no longer do so. However, when no one can or does care for vulnerable populations such as children, the mentally and physically disabled, and the elderly, the responsibility falls on the state to protect its citizens. Maltreatment falls into four categories: physical abuse, sexual abuse and exploitation, psychological abuse, and neglect. When an instance of maltreatment is confirmed and other interventions are unsuccessful, the state may assume care and responsibility of children or other vulnerable members. This leads to placement in foster homes or group homes for the children, or assisted living facilities for the adults. Each state has a department focused on family services to oversee these placements and services for the vulnerable individual, as well as to provide services to help the family regain custody and care. Although resources do not ever seem to be entirely sufficient, treatment programs for substance-abusing parents, parent education programs, and guardianship programs for the elderly are all among various interventions across the states in some form or another.

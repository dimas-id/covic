Trocar site hernia is not a common acute complication encountered after robot-assisted surgery, especially in the urological cohort of patients. A few case reports of small bowel obstruction secondary to incarceration by trocar site hernia have been described in gynaecological surgery and prostatectomies. As the clinical presentation is non-specific, late diagnosis has significant implication on morbidity and mortality. Here, we present a rare case of a patient with recent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma presented with features of impending bowel obstruction secondary to incarcerated small bowel in the trocar site. We also reviewed the literature focusing on clinical features of trocar site hernia and preventive measures.

Although the currently available vaccines represent an outstanding success story in modern medicine and have had a dramatic effect on morbidity and mortality worldwide, it is clear that improvements are required in the current vaccine delivery technologies. Improvements are required to enable the successful development of vaccines against infectious diseases that have so far proven difficult to control with conventional approaches. Improvements may include the addition of novel injectable adjuvants or the use of novel routes of delivery, including mucosal immunization. Mucosal delivery may be required to provide protection against pathogens that infect at mucosal sites, including sexually transmitted diseases. Alternatively, novel approaches to delivery, including mucosal administration, may be used to improve compliance for existing vaccines. Of particular interest for safer mass immunization campaigns are needle-free delivery devices, which would avoid problems due to needle re-use in many parts of the world and would avoid needle-stick injuries.

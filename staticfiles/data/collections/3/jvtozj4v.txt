Abstract This review presents a retrospective of the studies carried out in the last 10 years (2006â€“2016) using spectroscopic methods as a research tool in the field of virology. Spectroscopic analyses are sensitive to variations in the biochemical composition of the sample, are non-destructive, fast and require the least sample preparation, making spectroscopic techniques tools of great interest in biological studies. Herein important chemometric algorithms that have been used in virological studies are also evidenced as a good alternative for analyzing the spectra, discrimination and classification of samples. Techniques that have not yet been used in the field of virology are also suggested. This methodology emerges as a new and promising field of research, and may be used in the near future as diagnosis tools for detecting diseases caused by viruses.

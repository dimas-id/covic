This review considers principles of the use of mass spectrometry for the study of biological macromolecules. Some examples of protein identification, virion proteomics, testing vaccine preparations, and strain surveillance are represented. Possibilities of structural characterization of viral proteins and their posttranslational modifications are shown. The authorsâ€™ studies by MALDI-MS on S-acylation of glycoproteins from various families of enveloped viruses and on oligomerization of the influenza virus hemagglutinin transmembrane domains are summarized.

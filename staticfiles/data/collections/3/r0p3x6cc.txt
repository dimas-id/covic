Coronaviruses infect humans and animals through epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts that serve as their primary target. When studying infections in cultured polarized epithelial cells, we found previously that coronaviruses are released from specific plasma-membrane domains; thus, mouse hepatitis virus (strain A59; MHV-A59) leaves murine epithelial kidney cells from the basolateral surface, whereas release of transmissible gastroenteritis virus from porcine epithelial kidney cells is confined to the apical membrane. This observation begged the question whether a particular coronavirus is consistently shed through the same membrane, irrespective of the nature of the epithelial cell. We therefore extended our studies with MHV-A59 to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) strain I and human colon carcinoma (Caco-2) cells, both of which are naturally refractory to MHV-A59 but were made susceptible to infection by transfection with recombinant MHV receptor cDNA. The release of MHV-A59 from Caco(MHVR) cells occurred preferentially from the basolateral side, consistent with our previous observations. In contrast, release from MDCK(MHVR) cells occurred almost exclusively from the apical surface. Because of this difference, we studied MHV-A59 infection of MDCK(MHVR) cells in more detail. The virus entered the cells preferentially from the apical side, a situation similar to that in murine epithelial cells, where the highest density of MHV receptor glycoprotein was found. The results from this and previous studies show that targeting of vesicles containing MHV-A59 to a specific side of epithelial cells may vary in different epithelial cell types.

Infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, with the constant fear of global epidemics. It is indeed an irony that the reticuloendothelial system (RES), the bodyâ€™s major defence system, is the primary site for intracellular infections which are more difficult to treat. Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages play an important role in defence. However, ingenious pathogen survival mechanisms including phagolysosome destruction enable their persistence. Microbial biofilms present additional challenges. Low intracellular drug concentrations, drug efflux by efflux pumps and/or enzymatic degradation, emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR), are serious limitations of conventional therapy. Targeted delivery using nanocarriers, and passive and active targeting strategies could provide quantum increase in intracellular drug concentration. Receptor mediated endocytosis using appropriate ligands is a viable approach. Liposomes and polymeric/lipidic nanoparticles, dendrimers micelles and micro/nanoemulsions could all be relied upon. Specialised targeting approaches are demonstrated for important diseases like tuberculosis, HIV and Malaria. Application of targeted delivery in the treatment of veterinary infections is exemplified and future possibilities indicated. The chapter thus provides an overview on important aspects of infectious diseases and the challenges therein, while stressing on the promise of targeted drug delivery in augmenting therapy of infectious diseases.

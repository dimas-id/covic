A case of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in an 11-month-old European shorthair cat is reported. The infected cat displayed loss of weight, respiratory distress, ascitis, anemia and died within 15 days after the first appearance of clinical signs. Lesions typical of a mixed form (effusive and non-effusive) of FIP were observed and by RT-PCR a feline coronavirus (FCoV) type I strain was detected in several tissues. The RT-PCR results were confirmed by sequence analysis of the amplified products. Phylogeny carried out on fragments of the M and S genes showed that the FCoV strain segregates with typical type I FCoVs.

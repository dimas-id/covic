Numerous reports exist of the transmission of zoonoses to humans during and after solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Donor-derived infections of numerous etiologies, including West Nile virus infection, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and infection due to Brucella species have been reported. Most zoonoses occur as a primary infection after transplantation, and immunocompromised patients are more likely to experience significant morbidity and mortality from these infections. Risks of zoonotic infection in the posttransplantation period could be reduced by patient education. Increased recognition of the risks of zoonoses, as well as the advent of molecular biology-based testing, will potentially augment diagnostic aptitude. Documented zoonotic infection as it affects transplantation will be the primary focus of this review.

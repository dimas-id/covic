Langmuir monolayers have been used as cell membrane models, where lipid composition is normally varied to mimic distinct types of membranes. For eukaryotic membranes, for instance, rather than using only zwitterionic phospholipids there is now a trend to employ mixtures to simulate the lipid rafts known to be relevant for various cellular processes. In this study, we demonstrate that effects from chitosans on Langmuir monolayers are considerably higher if lipid raft compositions (ternary mixtures of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol) are used. Significantly, measurable effects on the surface pressure isotherms start at 10-6 mg mL-1 for chitosans in lipid rafts, to be compared with 10-2 mg mL-1 for neat dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). This applies to both a commercial chitosan and chitosans soluble at physiological pH. Incorporation of these chitosans in the raft monolayers was confirmed in polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) experiments, where both the tail groups and headgroups were found to interact with chitosan. Since the effects on membrane models may be observed at such small concentrations for chitosans and probably other molecules, some studies may have to be revisited where neat phospholipids should be replaced by lipid raft compositions.

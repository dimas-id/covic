PURPOSE To report the effectiveness of directional atherectomy for the treatment of popliteal artery occlusive disease. METHODS This subset of the prospective, multicenter, single-arm DEFINITIVE LE trial included 158 patients (mean age 72.0±10.9 years; 82 men) who underwent directional atherectomy in 162 popliteal artery lesions between 2009 and 2011. Forty-eight (30.4%) patients were suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). The mean lesion length was 5.8±3.9 cm; 38 (23.5%) arteries were occluded. The primary outcome measure for patients with intermittent claudication (IC) was duplex ultrasound-defined primary patency at 1 year; the outcome for subjects with CLI was freedom from major amputation of the target limb at 1 year. Outcomes and adverse events were independently assessed. RESULTS Procedure success (≤30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 84.4% of treated lesions; adjunctive stenting was required in 6 (3.7%) of the 162 lesions. The 1-year primary patency rate was 75.0% (IC patients 78.2% and CLI patients 67.5%, p=0.118). The freedom from major amputation in both cohorts was 100%. In both IC and CLI patients, significant improvements were demonstrated at 1 year in the Rutherford category, walking distance, and quality of life in comparison to baseline. CONCLUSION This study indicates that directional atherectomy in popliteal arteries leads to favorable technical and clinical results at 1 year for claudicant as well as CLI patients.

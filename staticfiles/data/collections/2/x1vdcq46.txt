Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis, is an acute infectious disease caused by Chlamydia psittaci (Cps) and commonly prevails in poultry and other species of bird. Humans infected by Chlamydia psittaci may suffer from unapparent subclinical infection, with symptoms ranging from mild flulike illness to severe SARS. As a typical animal-based infectious disease, psittacosis rarely has pulmonary signs but a long illness course, despite its clinical manifestation characterized by severe pulmonary lesions. Repeated onsets of psittacosis may lead to chronic diseases.

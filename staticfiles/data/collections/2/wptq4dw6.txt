AIM Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) is a nerve-sparing technique for the treatment of rectal prolapse. Concerns about the use of synthetic meshes in the pelvis and the associated risk of erosion have led to the recent use of biological meshes in some colorectal units. This retrospective study aims to assess the outcomes of patients undergoing LVR using a noncross-linked nondermal biological mesh. METHOD The medical notes of all patients who underwent LVR between 1 December 2011 and 31 May 2014 were reviewed. The rate of obstructed defaecation before surgery was retrospectively determined from medical records using the Rome III criteria. The rates of obstructed defaecation and faecal incontinence following surgery were determined using a self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 51 patients had LVR between 1 December 2011 and 31 May 2014. Their mean age was 57.3 ± 2.5 years and the mean follow-up was 23 ± 1 months. There were seven (13.7%) postoperative complications. In total, 45 (88%) patients completed the functional outcome questionnaires. Before surgery, 33 (73.3%) patients complained of symptoms of obstructed defaecation. At the end of follow-up, 22 (48.8%, P = 0.001) patients continued to have some symptoms of obstructed defaecation. Before surgery, 12 (26.7%) patients complained of faecal incontinence. At the end of follow-up, only three (6.7%, P = 0.004) patients reported faecal incontinence. At the end of follow-up, recurrence of symptoms had occurred in six (13.3%) patients. CONCLUSION LVR using a biological mesh is safe and results in significant reduction in symptoms associated with external rectal prolapse and rectal intussusception.

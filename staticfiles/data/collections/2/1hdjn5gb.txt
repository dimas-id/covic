Patients with a laryngectomy are at increased risk for droplet-transmitted diseases and, therefore, COVID-19, which has now caused a worldwide pandemic. Adaptive measures to protect patients with a laryngectomy and their families were designed and implemented in the Hong Kong SAR (HK). Driven by the fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, hospitals in HK have since modified infection control routines to prevent a repeat public health nightmare. To face COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, we have adapted guidelines for our patients with a laryngectomy. Contact precautions, droplet precautions with physical barriers, and hand and equipment hygiene are our mainstays of prevention against COVID-19, and sharing these routines is the aim of this article. The COVID-19 pandemic is still roaring ahead. Awareness and precautions for patients with a laryngectomy who may be at higher risk are outlined here and should be maintained during the current pandemic.

ABSTRACT: Various 5-substituted-2-(1-((diethylamino)methyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)hydrazinecarbothioamide (4a, b) and 5-substituted-2-(1-((diethylamino)methyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-N-(phenyl-4-substituted)hydrazinecarbothioamide (5a–h) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were screened for cytotoxicity against human HeLa and CEM T-lymphocytes as well as murine L1210 cells. The compounds were also screened for β-lactamase inhibitory activity, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activity against various strains of microorganisms. Several of these compounds were endowed with low micromolar 50 %-cytostatic concentration (IC(50)) values, and some were virtually equally potent as melphalan. The most potent inhibitors against the murine leukemia cells (L1210) were also the most inhibitory against human T-lymphocyte (CEM) tumor cells. Derivative 2-(1-((diethylamino)methyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide 5c emerged as the most potent cytostatic compound among the tested compounds. Derivatives 4b, 5a, 5b, and 5d showed antiviral activity against HEL cell cultures (IC(50) 11–20 μM). Moderate antimicrobial activity was observed for all derivatives. The encouraging cytostatic and antiviral activity data provide an adequate rationale for further modification of these molecular scaffolds. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: Derivative 5c (1.9–4.4 μM) emerged as the most potent cytostatic compound among the tested compounds. Derivatives 4b, 5a, 5b, and 5d showed antiviral activity against HEL cell cultures (IC(50) 11–20 μM). [Image: see text]

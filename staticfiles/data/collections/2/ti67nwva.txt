Infective endocarditis (IE) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is extremely uncommon. Reported cases have usually been associated with intravenous drug use, prosthetic heart valves, and/or implanted cardiac devices. Traditionally, successful treatment has necessitated a combination of antimicrobial(s) and valve replacement. Yet, P. aeruginosa IE remains difficult to manage, especially in cases where valve replacement may not be an immediate option. We present such a case of P. aeruginosa IE, highlighting that medical management with 2 antipseudomonal synergistic agents may be an alternative to surgery in particularly complicated cases.

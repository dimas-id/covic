Pneumonia is a common cause of hospital admission and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a growing health problem in developed country and worldwide. Elderly patients suffer from more severe disease, require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and exhibit higher mortality compared with their younger counterparts. The immunological changes that occur with age called “immunosenescence” (decreased efficiency of the adaptive and innate immune systems) are known to be responsible for the increased susceptibility of elderly persons to infectious diseases and for their limited response to vaccines [1].

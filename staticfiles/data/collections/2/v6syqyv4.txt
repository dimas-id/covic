Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) has been demonstrated to infect dendritic cells (DC) and reduced its ability to stimulate host immune responses. This study aimed to determine whether non‐replicating FMDV could induce apoptosis of the host immune cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that bone morrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were induced to undergo apoptosis in a dose‐dependent manner, which was determined by the annexin‐V staining, DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL staining methods, after they were treated with the chemically inactivated FMDV in vitro. The initiation of apoptosis was apparently via an interaction of the integrin receptor on BMDCs and the RGD motif within the VP1 capsid protein of FMDV. The initiation activated a cascade of apoptotic pathway including reduced expression of Bcl‐2, activation of caspases, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Pretreatment with BMDCs with LPS prevented the inactivated FMDV induced apoptosis, suggesting immature BMDCs are susceptible to such apoptosis. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the inactivated FMDV induces the apoptosis in BMDCs via the integrin receptor and subsequently triggers the apoptosis signal, suggesting that such induction of apoptosis is likely to impair immune responses against FMDV infection.

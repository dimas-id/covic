A 40-year-old, HIV-infected female patient received antibiotic treatment for a urinary tract infection. After the initial success of therapy and a symptom-free period, she developed pneumonia with septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In spite of intensive care and respirator therapy with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), she died of infectious toxic shock. Autopsy findings showed relapsing, gramnegative, bacterial pneumonia (morphologically compatible with Klebsiella pneumonia) and secondary, invasive aspergillosis. The pathogenesis and epidemiology of these unusual complications of AIDS are discussed.

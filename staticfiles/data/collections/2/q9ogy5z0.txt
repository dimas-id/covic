We wish to show our experiance with threating a rare congenital brain malformation-encephalocele. It is a protusion of brain matter with greater incidence in the Far East. Our case is even more curious because of the site of occurrence-frontobasal. Most of encephalocele occur in the occipital region. In this article we report a case of a 57-year-old woman, without deformations on the face, which had epileptic seizures and in spite of receiving antiepileptic drug. She was also frequently treated for sinusitis. She never had rhinoliquorrhea, nor was she diagnosed to have meningitis. In the last few years she had difficulty breathing on her right nostril. After she was diagnosed with encephalocele and treated surgically her recovery was complete and she is without the seizures.

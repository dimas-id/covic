Abstract Charge neutral steric block oligonucleotide analogues, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNA) or phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO), have promising biological and pharmacological properties for antisense applications, such as for example in mRNA splicing redirection. However, cellular uptake of free oligomers is poor and the utility of conjugates of PNA or PMO to cell penetrating peptides (CPP), such as Tat or Penetratin, is limited by endosomal sequestration. Two new families of arginine-rich CPPs named (R-Ahx-R)4 AhxB and R6Pen allow efficient nuclear delivery of splice correcting PNA and PMO at micromolar concentrations in the absence of endosomolytic agents. The in vivo efficacy of (R-Ahx-R)4 AhxB PMO conjugates has been demonstrated in mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and in various viral infections.

Oceans cover more than 70 percent of the surface of our planet and are characterized by huge taxonomic and chemical diversity of marine organisms. Several studies have shown that marine organisms produce a variety of compounds, derived from primary or secondary metabolism, which may have antiviral activities. In particular, certain marine metabolites are active towards a plethora of viruses. Multiple mechanisms of action have been found, as well as different targets. This review gives an overview of the marine-derived compounds discovered in the last 10 years. Even if marine organisms produce a wide variety of different compounds, there is only one compound available on the market, Ara-A, and only another one is in phase I clinical trials, named Griffithsin. The recent pandemic emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, highlights the need to further invest in this field, in order to shed light on marine compound potentiality and discover new drugs from the sea.

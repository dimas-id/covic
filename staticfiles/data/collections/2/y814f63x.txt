The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the complications of cardiopulmonary resuscitation after manual or mechanical chest compressions in a swine model of ventricular fibrillation. In this retrospective study, 106 swine were treated with either manual (n=53) or mechanical chest compressions with the LUCAS device (n=53). All swine cadavers underwent necropsy. The animals with no autopsy findings were significantly fewer in the LUCAS group (P=0.004). Sternal fractures were identified in 18 animals in the manual and only two in the LUCAS group (P=0.003). Rib fractures were present in 16 animals in the manual and only four in the LUCAS group (P=0.001). Nine animals in the manual, and two in the LUCAS group had liver hematomas (P=0.026%). In the manual group, eight animals were detected with spleen hematomas whereas no such injury was identified in the LUCAS group (P=0.003). LUCAS devise minimized the resuscitation-related trauma compared with manual chest compressions in a swine model of cardiac arrest.

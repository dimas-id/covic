In a 2-month-old female savannah kitten that died unexpectedly, the pathologic findings of significance were restricted to the heart and included abnormal Purkinje fibers and biventricular myocardial trabeculation or noncompaction. The Purkinje fibers were large, angular, and tightly packed. They contained few disorganized myofibrils among a rarified cytoplasm. The fibers were distinct from adjacent myocytes and were immunohistochemically positive for desmin, muscle actin, myoglobin, sarcomeric actin, and chromogranin A. These findings are identical to those that occur in children with histiocytoid cardiomyopathy, a fatal genetic mitochondrial disorder of Purkinje fibers. Ventricular noncompaction likely has a multifactoral cause that results from fetal arrest of ventricular organizational development that might occur in conjunction with, or independent of, histiocytoid cardiomyopathy.

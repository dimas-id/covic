Intramuscular (IM) immunization is generally considered incapable of generating a protective mucosal immune response. In the swine industry, attempts to develop a safe and protective vaccine for controlling porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) via an IM route of administration have been unsuccessful. In the present study, porcine chemokine ligand proteins CCL25, 27, and 28 were constructed and stably expressed in the mammalian expression system. IM co-administration of inactivated PEDV (iPEDV) particles with different CC chemokines and Freundâ€™s adjuvants resulted in recruiting CCR9+ and/or CCR10+ inflammatory cells to the injection site, thereby inducing superior systemic PEDV specific IgG, fecal IgA, and viral neutralizing antibodies in pigs. Moreover, pigs immunized with iPEDV in combination with CCL25 and CCL28 elicited substantial protection against a virulent PEDV challenge. We show that the porcine CC chemokines could be novel adjuvants for developing IM vaccines for modulating mucosal immune responses against mucosal transmissible pathogens in pigs.

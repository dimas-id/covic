PURPOSE Propofol clearance can be reduced when cardiac output (CO) is decreased. This clearance reduction may alter the pharmacokinetics of propofol and worsen the predictive performance of target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. The head-down position (HDP) and CO2 pneumoperitoneum, which are required for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), may cause changes in CO. We investigated the predictive performance of propofol TCI during CO2 pneumoperitoneum in patients who underwent RALP in the HDP. METHODS Fifteen male patients received propofol TCI using the Diprifusor model. Propofol concentrations were measured at seven time points: (T1) 15 min after anesthesia induction; (T2) before the insufflation; (T3, T4, and T5) 15, 60, and 90 min, respectively, after insufflation in the HDP; (T6) before the release of pneumoperitoneum in the HDP; and (T7) 15 min after the release of pneumoperitoneum in the supine position. Cardiac index (CI) was assessed using an arterial pulse contour CO monitor. The predictive performance of propofol TCI was evaluated by calculating the performance errors (PE) in propofol concentrations for each data point. The relationship between CI and PE was examined. Median PE (MDPE) and median absolute PE (MDAPE) were calculated as measures of bias and accuracy, respectively. RESULTS A total of 104 blood samples were analyzed. There was significantly negative correlation between CI and PE. The predictive performance of propofol TCI during pneumoperitoneum in the HDP was acceptable (MDPE = - 1.5% and MDAPE = 18.8%). CONCLUSION The predictive performance of propofol TCI during RALP with CO2 pneumoperitoneum in the HDP was acceptable.

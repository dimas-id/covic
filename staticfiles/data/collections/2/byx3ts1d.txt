The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late 2019. Since then, the virus has spread globally and caused a pandemic. Assays that can measure the antiviral activity of antibodies or antiviral compounds are needed for SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine and drug development. Here, we describe in detail a microneutralization assay, which can be used to assess in a quantitative manner if antibodies or drugs can block entry and/or replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic Protocol 1: Microneutralization assay to test inhibition of virus by antibodies (purified antibodies or serum/plasma) Basic Protocol 2: Screening of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 compounds in vitro Support Protocol: SARS‐CoV‐2 propagation

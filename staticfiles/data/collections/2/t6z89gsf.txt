BACKGROUND Initial reports confirm the safety and feasibility of natural orifice transluminal eendoscopic surgery (NOTES) transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy (TVC). Benefits of TVC include no visible scars, less pain, and shorter recovery. The authors describe a single surgeon's initial experience with TVC through his first 20 cases. METHOD Under direct visualization from a 5-mm umbilical trochar, a 12-mm trocar, or in 2 cases a SILS port was introduced through the posterior vagina into the cul-de-sac. The gallbladder was visualized using an endoscope introduced through the vaginal port. Using extracorporeal stay sutures for retraction, the cystic duct and artery were dissected free, clipped, and divided. The gallbladder was then removed through the vaginal port. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent a successful TVC. The average age was 34.9 years (21-55 years), average body mass index was 29.9 kg/m2 (18.3-38.1 kg/m2), and the mean operative time was 71.4 minutes (42-116 minutes). CONCLUSION TVC is a safe, feasible, and attractive alternative to traditional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

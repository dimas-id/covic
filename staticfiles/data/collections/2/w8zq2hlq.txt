Abstract. Nine species of Electrogena from thirty‚Äêone populations were investigated on the basis of five meristic and five ratio characters of the larvae. The attribution of populations to species was checked by a cluster analysis based on the generalized distances between pairs. Groups representing species were then subjected to a multiple discriminant analysis; discriminant functions and loadings were calculated. The correct attribution of individuals to species by the discriminant functions ranged from 97% to 100%. The analysis of discriminant loadings shows which characters contribute more to the discrimination of species. Although many species could be identified with some confidence by a sequential monothetic key based on meristic and qualitative characters, the discriminant analysis improves the effectiveness of identification of all species.

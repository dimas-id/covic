Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor that evades therapy regimens. Since cellular dormancy is one strategy for surviving, and since chemokines determine the environmental conditions in which dormancy occurs, we investigated how chemokines affect temozolomide (TMZ)-promoted cellular dormancy entry and exit in GBM cells. TMZ administration over ten days promoted cellular dormancy entry, whereas discontinuing TMZ for a further 15 days resulted in resumption of proliferation. Co-administration of a chemokine cocktail containing CXCL12, CXCL16, and CX3CL1 resulted in both delayed entry and exit from cellular dormancy. A microarray-based transcriptome analysis in LN229 GBM cells revealed that cellular dormancy entry was characterized by an increased expression of CCL2 and SAA2, while THSD4, FSTL3, and VEGFC were upregulated during dormancy exit. Co-stimulation with the chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes. After verifying the appearance of identified genes in human GBM primary cultures and ex vivo samples, we clarified whether each chemokine alone impacts cellular dormancy mechanisms using specific antagonists and selective CRISPR/Cas9 clones. While expression of CCL2 and SAA2 in LN229 cells was altered by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CXCR7 axis, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 contributed to reduced upregulation of THSD4 and, to a weaker extent, of VEGFC. The influence on FSTL3 expression depended on the entire chemokine cocktail. Effects of chemokines on dormancy entry and exit-associated genes were detectable in human GBM primary cells, too, even if in a more complex, cell-specific manner. Thus, chemokines play a significant role in the regulation of TMZ-promoted cellular dormancy in GBMs.

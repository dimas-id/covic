The animal gastrointestinal tract is a tube with two open ends; hence, from the microbial point of view it constitutes an open system, as opposed to the circulatory system that must be a tightly closed microbial-free environment. In particular, the human intestine spans ca. 200 m(2) and represents a massive absorptive surface composed of a layer of epithelial cells as well as a paracellular barrier. The permeability of this paracellular barrier is regulated by transmembrane proteins known as claudins that play a critical role in tight junctions.

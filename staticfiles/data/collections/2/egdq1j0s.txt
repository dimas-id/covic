A high incidence of spontaneous lower-limb paralysis occurred in a population of wild mice (Mus musculus) which had a high incidence of naturally occurring lymphoma and elevated indigenous type-C virus activity. Experimental transmission evidence indicated that both the neurologic and lymphomatous disorders almost certainly were caused by the indigenous type-C virus. The virus appeared to have a direct neurotropic effect on anterior horn neurons in the lower spinal cord.

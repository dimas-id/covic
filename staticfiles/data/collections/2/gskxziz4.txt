Abstract WU and KI polyomaviruses represent novel viruses discovered in respiratory secretions from human patients with acute respiratory tract infection. However, the association between WU/KI polyomaviruses and human disease has remained unclear. In this study, the prevalence of these two novel viruses and occurrence of co-infection with other respiratory viruses were determined in Thai pediatric patients with respiratory disease. Previously described PCR assays were applied to detect WU/KI polyomaviruses as well as other respiratory viruses in 302 nasopharyngeal suction specimens collected from February 2006 through February 2007. The results revealed the anneal prevalence of WU and KI polyomaviruses in the Thai population was 6.29% and 1.99%, respectively. The frequency of co-detection of WU and KI polyomaviruses with other respiratory viral pathogens was 42.11% and 33.33%, respectively. Moreover, each of the two complete genome sequences of WU (CU_295 and CU_302) and KI (CU_255 and CU_258) polyomaviruses were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Sequence analysis showed that they contained features common to those found in previous studies. However, there were several nucleotide variations within the non-coding regulatory regions and various non-synonymous mutations within the coding regions which may influence virulence and pathogenesis of these viruses. Nevertheless, it is still possible that these viruses are not the causative agents of clinical respiratory disease. Therefore, judging the association of WU/KI polyomavirus infections with a particular disease will be challenging and require more comprehensive case control investigations.

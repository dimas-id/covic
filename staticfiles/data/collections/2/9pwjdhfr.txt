We present the case of a 56-year-old patient suffering from an aorto-esophageal fistula after complex treatment of acute Type A dissection including thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of the descending aorta. Open surgical descending replacement using a pericardial patch, as well as esophagectomy, was performed. After a long and complicated hospital stay, the patient finally recovered and was discharged in stable condition. By choosing an aggressive surgical approach the patient survived this devastating complication of TEVAR, which is associated with high mortality.

Patch-based methods such as 3D block matching (BM3D) and the non-local Bayes (NLB) approach produce state-of-the-art results for removing Gaussian noise from single-frame images. In this work, we propose two extensions for these filters when there exist multiple frames of the same scene. To this end, we combine two novel inter-frame connectivity strategies with robust optical flow methods. Our extensions do not require additional parameters and outperform existing techniques qualitatively by a significant margin. By exploiting spatial and temporal separability, one of our approaches is also faster than its competitors. Since our strategy is not restricted to BM3D and NLB, it can be generalised to other similar single-frame patch-based methods.

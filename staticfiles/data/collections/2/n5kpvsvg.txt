The CRISPR/Cas12a RNA-guided complexes have a tremendous potential for nucleic acid detection due to its ability to indiscriminately cleave ssDNA once bound to a target DNA. However, the current CRISPR/Cas12a systems are limited to detecting DNA in a picomolar detection limit without an amplification step. Here, we developed a platform with engineered crRNAs and optimized conditions that enabled us to detect DNA, DNA/RNA heteroduplex and methylated DNA with higher sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection of in femtomolar range without any target pre-amplification step. By extending the 3’- or 5’-ends of the crRNA with different lengths of ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA, we discovered a new self-catalytic behavior and an augmented rate of LbCas12a-mediated collateral cleavage activity as high as 3.5-fold compared to the wild-type crRNA. We applied this sensitive system to detect as low as 25 fM dsDNA from the PCA3 gene, an overexpressed biomarker in prostate cancer patients, in simulated urine over 6 hours. The same platform was used to detect as low as ~700 fM cDNA from HIV, 290 fM RNA from HCV, and 370 fM cDNA from SARS-CoV-2, all within 30 minutes without a need for target amplification. With isothermal amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-LAMP, the modified crRNAs were incorporated in a paper-based lateral flow assay that could detect the target with up to 23-fold higher sensitivity within 40-60 minutes.

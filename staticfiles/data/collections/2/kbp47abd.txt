Aim: We aimed to explore the biomarkers for disease progression or the risk of nonsurvivors. Materials & methods: This study included 134 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The outcome of moderate versus severe versus critically ill patients and survivors versus nonsurvivors were compared. Results: An increase in the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was positively associated with lower levels of platelets and albumin (all p < 0.05). In the critical group, the plasma levels of albumin continued to have a significant association for the risk of nonsurvivors (p < 0.05), even after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusion: Albumin levels could be used as an independent predictor of the risk of nonsurvivors in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

This chapter provides an overview of reproductive biology and husbandry and management of captive nonhuman primates for breeding purposes. The reproductive biology section includes overviews of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function and puberty as well as specific sections on female and male reproductive physiology. The breeding overview is generally limited to taxonomic groups most commonly bred for use in research facilities: macaques, baboons, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and marmosets. For each of these taxonomic groups, the review provides information on typical group compositions; enclosure types; factors used in decisions regarding retention or removal of offspring and breeders; island/semi-free ranging production systems, if relevant; Specific-Pathogen-Free colony production and management, if relevant; and population management, including expected production figures. Pregnancy management is described in more detail, primarily for macaques and marmosets, including methods to detect ovulation and pregnancy, tracking of prenatal growth and development, maternal changes during pregnancy, and prevalence and causes of prenatal mortality. Finally, an overview of acquisition of nonhuman primates from foreign breeding programs is provided.

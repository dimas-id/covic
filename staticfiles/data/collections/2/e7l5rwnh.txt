Recently, bats have gained attention as potential reservoir hosts for emerging zoonotic single-stranded (ssRNA) viruses that may prove fatal for humans and other mammals. It has been hypothesized that some features of their innate immune system may enable bats to trigger an efficient early immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a first line defense within the innate immune system and lie directly at the hostâ€“pathogen interface in targeting specific microbe-molecular patterns. However, the direction and strength of selection acting on TLRs are largely unknown for bats. Here, we studied the selection on viral ssRNA sensing TLR8 based on sequence data of 21 bat species. The major part (63 %) of the TLR8 gene evolved under purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. We also found evidence for persistent positive selection acting on specific amino acid sites (7 %), especially when compared to viral TLR evolution of other mammals. All of these putatively positively selected codons were located in the ligand-binding ectodomain, some coincidenced or were in close proximity to functional sites, as suggested by the crystallographic structure of the human TLR8. This might contribute to the inter-species variation in the ability to recognize molecular patterns of viruses. TLR8 evolution within bats revealed that branches leading to ancestral and recent lineages evolved under episodic positive selection, indicating selective selection pressures in restricted bat lineages. Altogether, we found that the TLR8 displays extensive sequence variation within bats and that unique features separate them from humans and other mammals.

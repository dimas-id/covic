COVID-19 has spread in all continents in a span of just over three months, escalating into a pandemic that poses several humanitarian as well as scientific challenges. We here investigated the geographical character of the infection and correlate it with several annual satellite and ground indexes of air quality in China, Iran, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, U.K. and U.S.A. Adjusting for population size, we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high PM 2.5 and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. In Italy, the correspondence between the Po valley pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality was the starkest, originating right in the most polluted European area. Air pollution appears to be for this disease a risk factor similar to smoking. This suggests the detrimental impact climate change will have on the trajectory of future respiratory epidemics.

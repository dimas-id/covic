Abstract Alarms periodically emerge for viral pneumonia infections due to coronavirus. In all cases, these are zoonoses passing the barrier between species and infect humans. The legitimate concern of the international community is due to the fact that the new identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (previously called 2019-nCoV), has a quite high mortality rate, around 2%, and a strong ability to spread, with an estimated reproduction number higher than 2. Even though all countries are doing their utmost to stop the pandemic, the only reliable solution to tackle the infection is the rapid development of a vaccine. For this purpose, the means of bioinformatics, applied in the context of reverse-vaccinology paradigm, can be of fundamental help to select the most promising peptides able to trigger an effective immune response. In this short report, using the concept of nullomer and introducing a distance from human self, we provide a list of peptides that could deserve experimental investigation in the view of a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.

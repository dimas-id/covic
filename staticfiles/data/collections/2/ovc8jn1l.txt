Objective: The chest CT findings of the pneumonia patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) were summarized to provide an auxiliary diagnostic basis for the early detection of infected patients. Methods: Clinical data and CT images of 23 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University were retrospectively collected, and the chest CT findings were summarized and analyzed. Result: Of the 23 patients, 56.5% (13/23) had bilateral disease, 69.6% (16/23) had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundle, 65.2% (15/23) had lesions distributed periphery, 82.6% (19/23) involved in the basal segment of lower lobe, 82.6% (19/23) had ground-glass opacities, 30.4% (7/23) had ground-glass opacities with consolidation, 26.1% (6/23) had reticular changes. In the stage of disease progression, 54.6% (6/11) had an increased number of lesions, and 63.6% (7/11) had the scope of lesions enlarged and density increased. In the remission stage, 25.0% (4/16) had reduced number of lesions, 81.3% (13/16) had scope of lesions reduced, 62.5% (10/16) had density of lesions decreased, and 37.5% (6/16) had fibrosis. Conclusions: As an important diagnostic examination method for COVID-19, CT is conducive to the rapid diagnosis of the disease in patients with epidemiological history.

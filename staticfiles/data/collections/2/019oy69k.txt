BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stent-assisted coiling may result in less aneurysm recanalization but more complications than coiling alone. We evaluated outcomes of coiling with and without stents in the multicenter Matrix and Platinum Science Trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients in the Matrix and Platinum Science Trial with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated per protocol were included. Baseline patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, neurologic outcomes, angiographic outcomes, and safety data were analyzed. RESULTS Overall, 137 of 361 (38%) patients were treated with a stent. Stent-coiled aneurysms had wider necks (≥4 mm in 62% with stents versus 33% without, P < .0001) and lower dome-to-neck ratios (1.3 versus 1.8, P < .0001). Periprocedural serious adverse events occurred infrequently in those treated with and without stents (6.6% versus 4.5%, P = .39). At 1 year, total significant adverse events, mortality, and worsening of mRS were similar in treatment groups, but ischemic strokes were more common in stent-coiled patients than in coiled patients (8.8% versus 2.2%, P = .005). However, multivariate analysis confirmed that at 2 years after treatment, prior cerebrovascular accident (OR, 4.7; P = .0089) and aneurysm neck width ≥4 mm (OR, 4.5; P = .02) were the only independent predictors of ischemic stroke. Stent use was not an independent predictor of ischemic stroke at 2 years (OR, 1.1; P = .94). Stent use did not predict target aneurysm recurrence at 2 years, but aneurysm dome size ≥10 mm (OR, 9.94; P < .0001) did predict target aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Stent-coiling had similar outcomes as coiling despite stented aneurysms having more difficult morphology than coiled aneurysms. Increased ischemic events in stent-coiled aneurysms were attributable to baseline risk factors and aneurysm morphology.

Internet-of-Things has reshaped the way people interact with their surroundings. In a smart home, controlling the lights is as simple as speaking to a conversational assistant since everything is now Internet-connected. But despite their pervasiveness, most of the existent IoT systems provide limited out-of-the-box customization capabilities. Several solutions try to attain this issue leveraging end-user programming features that allow users to define rules to their systems, at the cost of discarding the easiness of voice interaction. However, as the number of devices increases, along with the number of household members, the complexity of managing such systems becomes a problem, including finding out why something has happened. In this work we present Jarvis, a conversational interface to manage IoT systems that attempts to address these issues by allowing users to specify time-based rules, use contextual awareness for more natural interactions, provide event management and support causality queries. A proof-of-concept was used to carry out a quasi-experiment with non-technical participants that provides evidence that such approach is intuitive enough to be used by common end-users.

The ability to precisely model mortality rates [Formula: see text] plays an important role from the economic point of view in healthcare. The aim of this article is to propose a comparison of the estimation of the mortality rates based on a class of stochastic Milevsky-Promislov mortality models. We assume that excitations are modeled by second, fourth and sixth order polynomials of outputs from a linear non-Gaussian filter. To estimate the model parameters we use the first and second moments of [Formula: see text]. The theoretical values obtained in both cases were compared with theoretical [Formula: see text] based on a classical Lee-Carter model. The obtained results confirm the usefulness of the switched model based on the continuous non-Gaussian processes used for modeling [Formula: see text].

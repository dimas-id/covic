OBJECTIVE To describe the Single port access (SPA) laparoscopic entry technique for canine ovariectomy (OVE), report complications, and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN Pilot study. ANIMALS Intact female dogs (n = 6). METHODS With owner consent, 6 intact female dogs had SPA laparoscopic OVE. Data, including signalment, surgical time (from incision to completion of closure), size and location of port placement, need for conversion (both to standard multiport laparoscopy and laparotomy), as well as any intraoperative complications including blood loss or tissue injury were recorded. RESULTS Mean surgical time was 52.5 minutes (range, 45-60 minutes) and mean incision length, 1.8 cm (range, 1.5-2.0 cm). In an 18-kg mix breed dog (dog 3), a "single port rescue" was required and located on midline 2-cm caudal to the umbilicus. Close positioning of the trocars caused instrument interference, limited viewing, and prevented safe ligation of the ovarian vessels vein with a vessel-sealing device. OVE was successfully completed laparoscopically in all dogs. CONCLUSION The SPA laparoscopic entry technique can be used in dogs, although instrument and camera interference can occur if trocar placement is too consolidated within the initial skin incision.

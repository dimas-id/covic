COVID-19, is caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been started on December/2019 in Wuhan/China and spread all over the world. We analyzed RT-PCR results of 10,000 cases from April-2 to May-30, 2020 in three neighbor cities located on the Eastern of Turkey. The final study population was 7853 cases after excluded screening tests. RT-PCR were performed to detect the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp (RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase) gene fragment. The number of total positive samples out of 7853 were 487; however, the number of non-repeating positive patient was 373 (4.8%). The cough and fever were the most common symptoms in positive cases. The epidemiologic studies should be performed about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to better understand the effect of the virus all over the world.

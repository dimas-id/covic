The use of a supraglottic airway, also called laryngeal mask airway (LMA), is gaining in popularity for delivery of general anesthesia in certain situations and is shown to be safe. Use of infraglottic airways (tracheal tubes) allows for positive pressure ventilation and maneuvers, such as holding continuous positive pressure in the airway to check for pleural and dural leaks. We describe the successful use of the LMA (Teleflex Inc) for general anesthesia, in which continuous positive airway pressure of 15 cm H2O held for 20 seconds allowed the neurosurgeon to identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and successfully repair the leak. A well-seated LMA can be successfully used to produce continuous positive pressure in the airway not exceeding 20 cm H2O for 20 seconds to facilitate surgical identification of CSF leaks.

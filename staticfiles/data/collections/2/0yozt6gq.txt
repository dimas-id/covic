INTRODUCTION Giant Meckel's diverticula are a relatively rare form of Meckel's, and henceforth their natural history is not clearly defined. They're currently thought of as an infrequent form of ileal dysgenesis. Noted complications include perforation, torsion and bowel obstruction. A much rarer presentation is Giant Meckel's diverticulitis. CASE A 71 year old white female presented herself to the Emergency Department of a small urban community hospital, complaining of severe abdominal pain, nausea & vomiting. Her preoperative workup was consistent with Giant Meckel's diverticulitis, with evidence for perforation. She was taken for a laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis, and was treated with a small bowel resection. She made an otherwise uncomplicated recovery. CONCLUSION Giant Meckel's diverticula and their complications require a high index of suspicion and once diagnosed, they should be managed expeditiously to avoid complications.

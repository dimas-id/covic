"Will buddies." That was an unfortunate phrase a friend of mine and I coined together during a shift early in the pandemic. He was a resident in our program just a couple of years ago and is now one of my attendings. While we were working a shift in the ED swarming with critically ill COVID patients, it came up in the "doc box" that we were both drafting our wills.

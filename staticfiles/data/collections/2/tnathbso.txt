BACKGROUND To observe if closing the mesenteric defect with absorbable sutures creates a safe adhesion compared to non-absorbable suture after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS Rats were randomly assigned to 5 experimental groups according to the different suture materials used in closing the mesenteric defects (Peterson's space) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Group A (control group), Group B (non-absorbable suture, Prolene suture), Group C (biological glue), Group D (non-absorbable suture, polyester suture) and Group E (absorbable suture). All rats were followed up for 8 weeks postoperatively and underwent laparotomy to observe the degree of adhesion and closure of the mesenteric defect. RESULTS No significant difference was found in the decrease in food intake and body weight among all groups. No internal hernia (IH) occurred in any group. The mesenteric defects of Group A remained completely visible without any closure or adhesion. Multiple gaps were found between the Prolene suture and the mesentery along the suture line in Group B. The mesenteric defects of Group C were complete closed with multiple adhesions of the small intestine and the greater omentum. The mesenteric defects in both Group D and Group E closed completely. The average adhesion scores in Group A and Group B were 0 and 0.33 ± 0.52 respectively. The average adhesion score in group C (3.83 ± 0.41) was higher than the other groups (p<0.05). The average adhesion scores in Group D and E were similar (3.17 ± 0.41 and 3.00 ± 0.00 respectively). CONCLUSION Absorbable suture created a safe adhesion score between the mesentery which was not inferior to non-absorbable sutures.

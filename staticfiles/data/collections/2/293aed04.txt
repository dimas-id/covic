Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). No sustainable treatment option is available so far to tackle such a public health threat. Therefore, designing a suitable vaccine to overcome this hurdle asks for immediate attention. In this study, we targeted for a design of multi-epitope based vaccine using immunoinformatics tools. We considered the structural proteins S, E and, M of SARS-CoV-2, since they facilitate the infection of the virus into host cell and using different bioinformatics tools and servers, we predicted multiple B-cell and T-cell epitopes having potential for the required vaccine design. Phylogenetic analysis provided insight on ancestral molecular changes and molecular evolutionary relationship of S, E, and M proteins. Based on the antigenicity and surface accessibility of these proteins, eight epitopes were selected by various B cell and T cell epitope prediction tools. Molecular docking was executed to interpret the binding interactions of these epitopes and three potential epitopes WTAGAAAYY, YVYSRVKNL, and GTITVEELK were selected for their noticeable higher binding affinity scores −9.1, −7.4, and −7.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Targeted epitopes had 91.09% population coverage worldwide. In summary, we identified three epitopes having the most significant properties of designing the peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

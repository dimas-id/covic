The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread across the world becoming a pandemic and disrupting societies, economies, and public health. Digestive symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are increasingly being reported in patients with the virus. There is also a growing body of evidence to suggest that liver injury is frequent. We present a patient diagnosed with coronavirus who presented with several days of GI symptoms and discuss the relevance of GI disease and liver injury in these patients.

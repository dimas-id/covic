BACKGROUND The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on facial plastic and reconstructive surgery. Our review serves as a safety resource based on the current literature and is aimed at providing best-practice recommendations. Specifically, this article is focused on considerations in the management of craniomaxillofacial trauma as well as reconstructive procedures after head and neck oncologic resection. METHODS Relevant clinical data were obtained from peer-reviewed journal articles, task force recommendations, and published guidelines from multiple medical organizations utilizing data sources including PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and Google search queries. Relevant publications were utilized to develop practice guidelines and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS The global COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant strain on health care resources with resultant impacts on patient care. Surgeons operating in the head and neck are particularly at risk of occupational COVID-19 exposure during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and must therefore be cognizant of protocols in place to mitigate exposure risk and optimize patient care.

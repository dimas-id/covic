Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea in pigs of all ages and a high fatality rate in neonates. The PEDV membrane protein (M) plays crucial roles in viral assembly, viral budding and host immune regulation, most likely by interacting with host cell proteins that have yet to be identified. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) using an M-specific monoclonal antibody, coupled with LC-MS/MS, was employed to identify M protein-interacting proteins in PEDV-infected cells. Three viral proteins (S, E and ORF3) and 218 host cell proteins were identified as putative M-interacting partners. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the identified host cell proteins were related to 131 signal pathways and 10 biological processes. In addition, interaction between translation initiation factor 3(eIF3L) and M protein was validated by Co-IP. Down-regulation of eIF3L expression significantly increased viral production, which suggests that eIF3L could be a negative regulator in PEDV replication. This interactome study of the PEDV M protein will serve to clarify its function during viral replication.

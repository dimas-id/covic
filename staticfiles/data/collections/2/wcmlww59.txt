Biliary injury is a rare but a very serious complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Our aim was to analyse the incidence of the biliary injuries and its therapeutic outcome on patients who underwent LC or converted LC. Our research was conducted at the 1st Department of Surgery, Semmelweis University, Budapest between 2006 and 2016, retrospectively. We analysed the LCs and converted LCs performed at our Department and as well as cases where the primary operations were conducted at other institutions but they were unable to provide the adequate therapy for the injury, thus the patients were transferred to our institution. At the 1st Department of Surgery complications occurred in 0,66% (30/4885) of all LCs. 327 converted LCs were done, complications occurred in 26 (7.95%) times. 22 patients were transferred to the 1st Department of Surgery from other institutions. Bilio-vascular injuries occurred in 61% (41/78). ERCP was performed in 25 cases with a 92% success rate. Reoperation was needed in 41% (28/41). Biliary reconstruction during the reoperation was performed via hepaticojejunostomy in 82% of all reoperations. The therapeutic solutions of LC's complications are complex. Therefore, the treatment is recommended only in institutions with appropriate experience.

With the consideration of mechanism of prevention and control for the spread of viral diseases, in this paper, we propose two novel virus dynamics models where state feedback control strategies are introduced. The first model incorporates the density of infected cells (or free virus) as control threshold value; we analytically show the existence and orbit stability of positive periodic solution. Theoretical results imply that the density of infected cells (or free virus) can be controlled within an adequate level. The other model determines the control strategies by monitoring the density of uninfected cells when it reaches a risk threshold value. We analytically prove the existence and orbit stability of semi-trivial periodic solution, which show that the viral disease dies out. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the main results.

Interest in the use of simulation for acquiring, maintaining, and assessing skills in GI endoscopy has grown over the past decade, as evidenced by recent American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines encouraging the use of endoscopy simulation training and its incorporation into training standards by a key accreditation organization. An EndoVators Summit, partially supported by a grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health, (NIH) was held at the ASGE Institute for Training and Technology from November 19 to 20, 2017. The summit brought together over 70 thought leaders in simulation research and simulator development and key decision makers from industry. Proceedings opened with a historical review of the role of simulation in medicine and an outline of priority areas related to the emerging role of simulation training within medicine broadly. Subsequent sessions addressed the summit's purposes: to review the current state of endoscopy simulation and the role it could play in endoscopic training, to define the role and value of simulators in the future of endoscopic training and to reach consensus regarding priority areas for simulation-related education and research and simulator development. This white paper provides an overview of the central points raised by presenters, synthesizes the discussions on the key issues under consideration, and outlines actionable items and/or areas of consensus reached by summit participants and society leadership pertinent to each session. The goal was to provide a working roadmap for the developers of simulators, the investigators who strive to define the optimal use of endoscopy-related simulation and assess its impact on educational outcomes and health care quality, and the educators who seek to enhance integration of simulation into training and practice.

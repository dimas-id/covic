A survey of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genotypes in poultry flocks in selected countries in Western Europe was carried out between March 2002 and December 2006. Identification of IBV was by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of RNA extracted from oropharyngeal swabs taken from poultry flocks exhibiting signs of clinical disease thought to be attributable to IBV. Part of the hypervariable S1 gene of IBV was sequenced to differentiate between the various genotypes. During the survey, 4103 samples were processed, of which 2419 (59%) were positive for IBV. The predominant IBV genotypes detected were 793B and Massachusetts. The third and fourth most common genotypes were two new economically important field types: Italy02, and a virus similar to genotypes originally detected in China called QX. Analysis of the partial S1 sequences of the genotypes detected suggested that approximately 50% of all 793B, Massachusetts types and D274 IBVs were identical to the homologous commercially available live vaccines. Since 2004 the prevalence of Italy02 (present in all countries from which samples were received) has been declining in all countries except Spain, where it appeared to be the predominant genotype. Since 2004 an IBV genotype has been detected in Holland, Germany, Belgium and France similar to QX and the incidence has increased. QX was not detected in the United Kingdom or Spain. When detections thought to be attributable to vaccines were removed, the dominant genotype in France and Europe overall was 793B; in Germany, Holland and Belgium, it was QX-like IBV; and in the United Kingdom and Spain the dominant genotype was Italy02. The present study is the first to identify the prevalence of both Italy02 and QX field-type variants in poultry flocks in Western Europe. Several novel genotypes have also been detected.

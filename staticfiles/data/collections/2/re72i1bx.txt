Owing to increased detection rates, the diagnosis and management of incidental pancreatic cysts has become a common predicament. Up to 13% of patients undergoing cross-sectional imaging studies for other indications are found to have pancreatic cystic lesions. Although most cystic lesions are benign, the malignant potential of several types of pancreatic cysts makes accurate classification vital to directing therapy. To this end, advances in the last decade led to better characterization of pancreatic cyst morphology and hence enhanced the ability to predict underlying histopathology, and biological behavior. Although accurate classification remains a challenge, the utilization of complementary diagnostic tools is the optimal approach to dictate management. The following review includes a description of pancreatic cysts, a critical review of current and emerging diagnostic techniques and a review of recent guidelines in the management of incidental pancreatic cysts.

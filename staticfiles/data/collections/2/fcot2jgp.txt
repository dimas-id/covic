BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to analyze the surgical technique, postoperative complications, and possible recurrence after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) in comparison with open ventral hernia repair (OVHR), based on the international literature. DATABASE A Medline search of the current English literature was performed using the terms laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and incisional hernia repair. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is a safe alternative to the open method, with the main advantages being minimal postoperative pain, shorter recovery, and decreased wound and mesh infections. Incidental enterotomy can be avoided by using a meticulous technique and sharp dissection to avoid thermal injury.

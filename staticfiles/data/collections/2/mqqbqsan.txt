The first cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have turned up in the United States. First, in late April, a patient tested positive for the virus at a hospital in Munster, IN, and then shortly thereafter, a second patient tested positive at a hospital in Orlando, FL. While both patients have since recovered from the virus and been released, the cases have raised awareness of the infectious threat of MERS-CoV, and they have put EDs and other frontline providers on heightened alert for patients with severe respiratory symptoms and other risk factors. While MERS-CoV is not yet as contagious as seasonal influenza or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that started in China and then swept around the globe in 2003, it is more deadly. The World Health Organization reports that roughly one-quarter of 514 people who have tested positive for the virus have died. Experts note that health care workers make up a large percentage of the documented cases of MERS-CoV, and they point out that most human-to-human transmissions of the virus occur in the hospital setting. Public health officials urge emergency personnel to pay strict attention to infection control practices, and to query patients who present with fever and respiratory distress about recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula and/or close contact with a person who has a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV.

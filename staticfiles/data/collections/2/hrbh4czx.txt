The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted rapid restructuring of the healthcare system in an effort to stop the spread of the virus and to treat patients who are acutely ill with COVID-19, while continuing to provide outpatient care for the remainder of patients. To help control spread of this pandemic, many centers have boosted telemedicine capability to care for patients who would typically be seen in person in outpatient settings, including total joint arthroplasty clinics. We review key components relevant to the establishment and effective use of telemedicine, focused on patient education, practice logistics, technological considerations, and sensitive patient health information-associated compliance factors, which are necessary to provide care remotely for total joint arthroplasty patients.

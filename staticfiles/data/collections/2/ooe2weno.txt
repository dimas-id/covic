Infection of mice with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus induces primary demyelination in susceptible strains of rodents. Although demyelination is the primary pathological process detected in the central nervous system of infected mice, axonal dysfunction and damage also occur concomitantly with demyelination. This process is T cell mediated, with either CD4 or CDS T cells sufficient for MHV-induced axonal damage. A striking feature is that axonal damage occurs early in the disease process, at nearly the same time as demyelination is first observed. Axonal damage in MHV-infected mice has many similarities with the parallel process in humans with multiple sclerosis.

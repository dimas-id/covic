Rationale: Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules monitor the protein content of the cell by binding small derived peptides and presenting them to cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. The goal of the human MHC project is to predict the binding strength of any given peptide/MHC complex. This prediction allows the design of peptide‐based vaccines. The prediction requires representative binding data from MHC alleles from all the nine HLA supertypes. Here, we describe the genetic construction, protein production and purification as well as the establishment‐binding assays for two recombinant MHC supertype alleles, HLA‐B*1501 and HLA‐B*5801. Methods: Using the Quikchange Multisite Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), codon‐optimized genes encoding HLA‐B*1501 and HLA‐B*5801 are created. The two MHC I molecules are fermented and purified by ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The binding (KD) of natural T‐cell epitopes, as well as predicted peptide ligands, is described by radioactive immunoassays (RIAs) and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The MHC molecules are biotinylated during expression. Results: The expression of MHC I resulted in multiple disulfide bond isomers, which are separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and used in subsequent binding studies resulting in the determination of KD for various peptide ligands ranging from strong binders (KD < 50 nM) to low binders (KD > 5 µM). Tetramerization is visualized by SDS‐PAGE. Conclusion: An effective method for the production of highly pure MHC I molecules has been applied to HLA‐B*1501 and HLA‐B*5801, and RIA and ELISA binding assays for those alleles have been established, showing the binding of various peptide ligands to the MHC I molecules.

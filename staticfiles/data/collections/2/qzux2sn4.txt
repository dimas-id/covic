There are many ways regulatory agencies have moved aside to make way for a safer public during the COVID‐19 pandemic: more methadone take‐homes and even home deliveries, video buprenorphine inductions, insurance‐covered telehealth and takeaway alcohol (all safer because consumers and patients don't have to go into crowded areas where the virus could be transmitted). There's great hope by some that some of these will be continued post‐pandemic, especially the lowered barriers to treatment access. But what about takeaway drinks? In Texas, at least, this may be what's happening. Alcohol‐to‐go is very popular. Despite all the implications, including more DUIs and alcohol use disorders, it is so popular it may become permanent in that state, according to a report on the Houston Press website. And the alcoholic beverage industry — not surprisingly — supports it, as do restaurants. Stay tuned.

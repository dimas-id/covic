Our studies revealed that virus induced demyelination as well as human inflammatory demyelination involves upregulation of class I MHC genes and surface expression of antigens encoded by these genes. Induction involves the action of an intermediate soluble factor/s which is at present unknown. These findings suggest that MHC class I restricted, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) reactions, against self or foreign antigens may play a role in these conditions. These findings may help to elucidate the mechanism of coronavirus-induced demyelination as well as the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

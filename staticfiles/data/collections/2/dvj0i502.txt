Abstract The genus Hunnivirus, which has been identified in sheep, cattle, and rats, was first proposed in the family Picornaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 2013. In this study, a hunnivirus was detected in fecal samples collected from a diarrheic cat in Southern China in 2017. Genome sequencing and analysis indicated that the novel hunnivirus has the same genome organization as reported for other hunniviruses, 5′UTR-L-P1(VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1)-P2(2A-2B-2C)-P3(3A-3B-3Cpro-3Dpol)-3′UTR, but is genetically divergent. This hunnivirus is proposed as a novel genotype of the species Hunnivirus A and provisionally designated feline hunnivirus. Our study expands the host range of hunnivirus and enriches knowledge on picornaviruses.

AIDS is one of the most dreaded diseases of the twenty-first century caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Recently, there are reports which show decline in new infections due to better access to anti-retroviral drugs. Still on a daily basis, ~2356 new HIV infections are being reported globally. New treatments and anti-HIV drugs are being continuously developed with the aim to control and cure AIDS. The anti-HIV drugs that are in use usually target HIV entry and replication inside the host cells. However, these drugs are only partially effective in slowing the rate of HIV replication. Nevertheless, the virus manages to replicate at much slower rates even when anti-retroviral treatment is ongoing. The HIV seropositives who are on anti-retroviral treatment for long periods of time are now developing different kinds of other complications including neuroAIDS. The latest development in HIV therapy is a novel kind of bone marrow transplantation from donors who have a homozygous mutation in CCR5 gene.

INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has rapidly become a global pandemic, but little is known about its potential impact on patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). METHODS: We studied the clinical course of COVID‐19 in five hospitalized patients with autoimmune MG (four with acetylcholine receptor antibodies, one with muscle‐specific tyrosine kinase antibodies) between April 1, 2020‐April 30‐2020. RESULTS: Two patients required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure, whereas one required significant supplemental oxygen. One patient with previously stable MG had myasthenic exacerbation. One patient treated with tocilizumab for COVID‐19 was successfully extubated. Two patients were treated for MG with intravenous immunoglobulin without thromboembolic complications. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that the clinical course and outcomes in patients with MG and COVID‐19 are highly variable. Further large studies are needed to define best practices and determinants of outcomes in this unique population.

Abstract The way people have thought about disasters has changed in almost immeasurable ways. They are no longer considered as “Acts of God” but caused either by natural hazards or by human actions. This shift in thinking has led to different ways of dealing with disasters. What is becoming apparent is that more and more disasters are being produced by human actions. We cause them but seem unable to find the political will to stop doing so. Further, the role of humanitarian agencies has changed. At one time bodies such as the Red Cross would be associated with helping the injured in the battlefield. The nature of present-day warfare or complex emergencies and terrorism means that humanitarian bodies are dealing with many vulnerable refugees and internally displaced people. The following polemic reflects on these changes.

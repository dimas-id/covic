Reconstruction of the pharynx and upper esophagus uses various procedures, including pedicled or free flap. Pharyngoplasty with free forearm flap provides excellent functional results. In radiation-related pharyngeal stenosis, recipient vascularization is often poor, especially in the venous system. The authors describe pharyngeal reconstruction with semi-free forearm flap, pedicled on the cephalic vein, to minimize the risk of venous thrombosis, which is the main factor of free forearm flap necrosis. Taking the case of a laryngectomy with complete pharyngeal stenosis after radiation therapy and iterative neck surgery, the technique of pharyngeal-esophageal reconstruction by semi-free forearm flap is described in a context of impaired vascularization.

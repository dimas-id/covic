OBJECTIVES The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS Trial) has inspired many fetal therapy centers (FTCs) to offer open fetal surgery for myelomeningocele (MMC). This is an initial effort to create a candidate model that can be applicable to many parts of Asia. MATERIAL AND METHODS A limited selection of specialists from 4 established FTCs in Thailand, Hong Kong, India, and Singapore met for a round table discussion. Experts from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) involved in the Trial moderated the session. The practice suggestions in this statement were from a targeted literature review and expert opinion. RESULTS A high prevalence of MMC in Asia supports an effort to adopt the procedure, but only in established FTCs with good maternal and neonatal ancillary supports. The falling incidence of MMCs may affect case volume and maintenance of skill. A regional approach was recommended. Fetal benefits have to be weighed against maternal risks, with a consideration of recent outcome data from the endoscopic approach. Responsible FTCs need standardized diagnosis and management, with their long-term outcome data available for an audit. CONCLUSIONS It is envisaged that the information presented by this multidisciplinary team would be useful for FTCs in Asia or elsewhere that plan to establish more advanced fetal care in the future.

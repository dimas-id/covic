OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a new viral zoonosis of global concern that could cause psychological sequelae. We examined the levels of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak in a Mexican sample. METHODS: An online survey was applied which collected information on demographic and financial status data, physical status, contact history, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures concerning COVID-19. Impact of Event Scale-Revised and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale were included. RESULTS: 50.3% of respondents rated psychological distress as moderate-severe; 15.7% reported moderate-severe depressive symptoms; 22.6% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms; and 19.8% reported moderate-severe stress levels. Female gender, older age, divorced status, lack confidence related to security of the test, lower satisfaction of health information concerning COVID-19, history of direct or indirect contact with a COVID-19 confirmed case, live with just one other person and spent >9h per day at home were associated with greater psychological distress and/or higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. By contrast, precautionary measures as hand hygiene and wearing masks were associated with lower levels of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outbreak results in considerable psychological effects among the Mexican sample.

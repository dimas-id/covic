Laparoscopic repair of pelvic organ prolapse in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts has not been previously described. The optimum management of patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts undergoing laparoscopy is uncertain. We describe the case of a 21-year-old female patient with spina bifida and ventriculoperitoneal shunt who underwent laparoscopic hysteropexy for severe pelvic organ prolapse. The implications of performing laparoscopy on patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts are reviewed along with strategies to reduce potential intraoperative complications.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by an increase in aberrant plasma cells in the bone marrow leading to rising monoclonal protein in serum and urine. With the introduction of novel therapies with manageable side effects, this incurable disease has evolved into a chronic disease with an acceptable quality of life for the majority of patients. Accordingly, management of acute complications is fundamental in reducing the morbidity and mortality in MM. MM emergencies include symptoms and signs related directly to the disease and/or to the treatment; many organs may be involved including, but not limited to, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, and infectious complications. This review will focus on the numerous approaches that are aimed at managing these complications.

AIM: To determine if pain is associated with 12-month incidence of mood affective disorders (MAD) in adults with cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: Data from Optum ClinformaticsÂ® Data Mart (2013-2016) were used for this retrospective cohort study. Diagnostic codes were used to identify adults (&#8805;18y) with CP, incident cases of MAD, and covariates (other neurodevelopmental conditions, sleep disorders, arthritis). Pain (any type, location) was identified between 1st October 2014 and 30th September 2015. The pain group was divided into new or consistent pain if they had a history of pain (i.e. consistent) in the 12 months before their first pain claim date. Crude incidence rates of MAD (expressed per 100 person-years) were estimated. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) of MAD after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Adults that had new pain (n=859; incidence rate=15.5) or consistent pain (n=1303; incidence rate=17.9) had greater crude incidence rate of MAD compared to adults without pain (n=3726; incidence rate=5.9). The elevated rate of MAD remained after adjusting for covariates, for new pain (hazard ratio=2.4; 95% CI=1.9-3.0) and consistent pain (hazard ratio=2.1; 95% CI=1.7-2.7). INTERPRETATION: Pain is associated with greater incidence of MAD in adults with CP. This association remained after accounting for potential confounding factors. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What this paper adds Pain was associated with higher 12-month incidence of mood affective disorders (MAD). The 12-month MAD incidence was similar between new and consistent pain groups. The MAD incidence remained higher adjusting for neurodevelopmental comorbidities, sleep disorders, and arthritis.

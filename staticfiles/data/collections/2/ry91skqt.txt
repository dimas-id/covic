This report describes the use of the Edwards Sapien THV in a patient who had a short regurgitant/stenotic homograft with early bifurcation stenoses of the pulmonary arteries. A 48-mm AndraStent was positioned in the right pulmonary artery-homograft jailing the left pulmonary artery (LPA). To have an unobstructed access to the LPA, the stent strut leading to the LPA was broken using high-pressure balloon. A 23-mm Edwards Sapien THV was positioned in the stented homograft just proximal to the LPA origin with resolution of the stenosis and regurgitation.

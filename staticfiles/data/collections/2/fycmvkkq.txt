The numerous public health measures that were implemented as a result of the COVID‐19 pandemic and the subsequent impact on the nation's economy have created a new world of emergency planning at every educational institution and within every athletics department. Between the money that had to be returned for room and board and/or tuition reimbursements; the decline in or disappearance of digital rights payments, ticket sales, donations, and corporate sponsorships; the cancellation of March Madness, and the loss of many other revenue streams, the economic vise‐grip created by COVID‐19 tightened quickly and dramatically. Within the public sector, a future reduction in legislative appropriations in various states for higher education is likewise being discussed.

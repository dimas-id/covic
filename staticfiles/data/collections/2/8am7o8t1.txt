Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have resulted in significant economic losses in the swine industry, and another PED outbreak occurred in 2014 in Korea. Isolating and culturing PED virus (PEDV) allow investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines and diagnostic assays. In this study, we successfully isolated two PEDV isolates (QIAP1401 and QIAP1402) from naturally infected piglets at Jeju-do, Korea. Viral propagation was confirmed in Vero cells based on cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and electron microscopic analyses. The QIAP401 isolate propagated well in Vero cells for 70 passages, with titers of 10(6.5) to 10(7.0) 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL, which increased gradually with passaging. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the QIAP1401 isolate were determined and compared with those of other PEDV isolates. The QIAP1401 isolate was determined to be closely related to the USA/Minnesota271/2014 strain (> 99.9% nucleotide similarity) that was isolated in the USA in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis based on several PEDV genes suggested that a new PEDV variant is circulating in the Korean swine industry, with 93.08% similarity to the SM98 strain isolated in 1998. In addition, the QIAP1401 strain showed strong virulence in 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old growing pigs.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertension is either a cause or a consequence of the endothelial dysfunction and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In vitro and in vivo studies established that microRNAs (miRNAs) are decisive for endothelial cell gene expression and function in various pathological conditions associated with CVD. This review provides an overview of the miRNA role in controlling the key connections between endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: Herein we summarize the present understanding of mechanisms underlying hypertension and its associated endothelial dysfunction as well as the miRNA role in endothelial cells with accent on the modulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, nitric oxide, oxidative stress and on the control of vascular inflammation and angiogenesis in relation to endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. In particular, latest insights in the identification of endothelial-specific microRNAs and their targets are added to the understanding of miRNA significance in hypertension. SUMMARY: This comprehensive knowledge of the role of miRNAs in endothelial dysfunction and hypertension and of molecular mechanisms proposed for miRNA actions may offer novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for controlling hypertension-associated endothelial dysfunction and other cardiovascular complications.

OBJECTIVES To determine imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in different stages, and to provide foundations for early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS CT image data of 187 COVID-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization. CT scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days. The improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up CT were statistically analyzed. RESULTS All 187 patients' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early CT images of lung in 187 cases (100%) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade, which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura. In the progressive stage, the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases (78.1%) were mainly consolidation, accompanied by air bronchogram, thickening of blood vessels, and interstitial changes. Severe pulmonary CT images in 15 cases (8%) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs, displaying consolidation, or "white lung". The CT imaging features in 185 cases (98.9%) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis. The imaging features of 6 times of lung CT examination in one case showed continuous progress. The original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed, but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of CT scanning. The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Images of COVID-19 in various stages have special characteristics. The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT. Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes. Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient.

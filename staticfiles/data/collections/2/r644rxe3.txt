Hypercoagulability has been recognised as a common complication of COVID‐19. Exact mechanisms for this extreme coagulation activation have not yet been elucidated. However, one of the consistent laboratory finding is the increase in fibrinogen, in some cases, marked elevation. High circulating levels of fibrinogen have been linked to thrombosis for years and for this reason, hyper‐fibrinogenemia is considered one of the mechanisms for COVID‐19 coagulopathy. In this forum article, instead of the prothrombotic role, a protective function for fibrinogen is discussed. Fibrinogen, like the other well‐known acute phase reactants, is increased in COVID‐19 possibly to protect the host.

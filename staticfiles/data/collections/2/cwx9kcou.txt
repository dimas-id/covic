Elderly care services in Hong Kong began in the mid-1970s, with health and social services modelled on the UK experience. A major difference is the lack of a well-developed primary care system. As a result, geriatric service has evolved to encompass primary care, to include outreach geriatrics and psychogeriatric support to long-term residential care homes as well as frail elderly people living at home. There is room for innovation in the provision of community care, led by geriatricians, especially in management of chronic disease, incorporating the components of self management and use of telemedicine. Various models could be developed and evaluated to define which best meet the needs of the ageing population. The results would guide future government policy for health and social services for the elderly population in the community setting.

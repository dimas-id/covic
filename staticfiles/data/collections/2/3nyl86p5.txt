INTRODUCTION Type-III interferons (IFN-λ), the most recently discovered family of IFNs, shares common features with other family members, but also has many distinctive activities. IFN-λ uniquely has a different receptor complex, and a more focused pattern of tissue expression and signaling effects, from other classes of IFNs. Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and subsequent validation reports suggest a pivotal role for polymorphisms near the IFNL3 gene in hepatitis C clearance and control, as also for several other epithelial cell tropic viruses. Apart from its antiviral activity, IFN-λ possesses anti-tumor, immune-inflammatory and homeostatic functions. The overlapping effects of IFN-λ with type I IFN, with a restricted tissue expression pattern renders IFN-λ an attractive therapeutic target for viral infection, cancer and autoimmune diseases, with limited side effects. Areas covered: This review will summarize the current and future therapeutic opportunities offered by this most recently discovered family of interferons. Expert opinion: Our knowledge on IFN-λ is rapidly expanding. Though there are many remaining questions and challenges that require elucidation, the unique characteristics of IFN-λ increases enthusiasm that multiple therapeutic options will emerge.

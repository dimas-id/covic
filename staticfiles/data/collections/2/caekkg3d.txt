The Metastatic Spine Disease Multidisciplinary Working Group consists of medical and radiation oncologists, surgeons, and interventional radiologists from multiple comprehensive cancer centers who have developed evidence- and expert opinion-based algorithms for managing metastatic spine disease. The purpose of these algorithms is to facilitate interdisciplinary referrals by providing physicians with straightforward recommendations regarding the use of available treatment options, including emerging modalities such as stereotactic body radiation therapy and percutaneous tumor ablation. This consensus document details the evidence supporting the Working Group algorithms and includes illustrative cases to demonstrate how the algorithms may be applied.

BACKGROUND Challenging anatomy for carotid artery access can result in a delay to achieve successful recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Our objective was to study emergent direct percutaneous carotid artery puncture as an alternative access approach for acute endovascular stroke interventions. METHODS We reviewed cases of acute ischemic stroke in which direct carotid artery puncture was used for access. We also reviewed current literature relevant to this subject. RESULTS We describe the technical aspects, limits, and potential complications associated with direct carotid artery puncture for intracranial acute ischemic stroke interventions, and present cases to illustrate the utility of this access approach. CONCLUSIONS Direct carotid artery puncture is a feasible alternative to transfemoral artery access in cases of stroke with difficult anatomy, including unfavorable arch type, carotid tortuosity, or an ostial lesion.

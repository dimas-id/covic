During the 26 years that have elapsed since its discovery, activin-A, a member of the transforming growth factor Î² super-family originally discovered from its capacity to stimulate follicle-stimulating hormone production by cultured pituitary gonadotropes, has been established as a key regulator of various fundamental biological processes, such as development, homeostasis, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. Deregulated expression of activin-A has been observed in several human diseases characterized by an immuno-inflammatory and/or tissue remodeling component in their pathophysiology. Various cell types have been recognized as sources of activin-A, and plentiful, occasionally contradicting, functions have been described mainly by in vitro studies. Not surprisingly, both harmful and protective roles have been postulated for activin-A in the context of several disorders. Recent findings have further expanded the functional repertoire of this molecule demonstrating that its ectopic overexpression in mouse airways can cause pathology that simulates faithfully human acute respiratory distress syndrome, a disorder characterized by strong involvement of neutrophils. This finding when considered together with the recent discovery that neutrophils constitute an important source of activin-A in vivo and earlier observations of upregulated activin-A expression in diseases characterized by strong activation of neutrophils may collectively imply a more intimate link between activin-A expression and neutrophil reactivity. In this review, we provide an outline of the functional repertoire of activin-A and suggest that this growth factor functions as a guardian of homeostasis, a modulator of immunity and an orchestrator of tissue repair activities. In this context, a relationship between activin-A and neutrophils may be anything but coincidental.

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in Hong Kong in 2012 from samples taken from pigs in 2009. PDCoV was subsequently identified in the USA in 2014 in pigs with a history of severe diarrhea and the virus has now been detected in pigs in several countries around the world. Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to begin to address questions regarding virus-host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here we present a detailed study of PDCoV induced replication organelles. All positive strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. However the structures induced by deltacoronaviruses, in particular the presence of convoluted membranes or double membrane spherules, are unknown. Initially, the dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral RNA synthesis, protein synthesis and progeny particle release determined. Subsequently, virus induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. As has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, PDCoV replication was found to induce the formation of double membrane vesicles. Significantly however, PDCoV replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum and small associated tethered vesicles, double membrane spherules. These structures strongly resemble the replication organelle induced by avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.

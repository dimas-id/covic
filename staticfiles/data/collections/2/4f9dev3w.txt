There is growing concern over the potential for increased suicide risk in vulnerable populations as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. To contextualize this risk during the first weeks of the nationwide lockdown efforts, we had 1,013 U.S. adults complete questionnaires assessing worries over COVID-19, insomnia severity, and suicidal ideation. Anxiety about COVID-19 correlated positively with insomnia severity and suicidal ideation. Analysis revealed that the statistical association between pandemic fears and suicidal thinking was fully accounted for by insomnia severity, suggesting that interventions aimed at improving sleep may be useful in reducing suicide risk during the current pandemic.

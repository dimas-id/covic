The genome of equine arteritis virus (EAV) produces a 3′ coterminal-nested set of six subgenomic (sg) viral RNAs during virus replication cycle, and each set possesses a common leader sequence of 206 nucleotides (nt) in length derived from the 5′ end of the viral genome. Given the presence of the leader region within both genomic and sg mRNAs, it is likely to contain cis-acting signals that may interact with cellular or viral proteins for RNA synthesis. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that proteins in Vero cell cytoplasmic extracts formed complexes with the positive (+) and negative (-) strands of the EAV leader RNA. Several cell proteins with molecular masses ranging from 74 to 31 kDa and 58 to 32 kDa were detected in UV-induced cross-linking assays with the EAV leader RNA (+) and (-) strands, respectively. In both cases, intense bands were observed at the 58–52 kDa molecular weight markers. Results from competition gel mobility shift assays using overlapping cold RNA probes spanning the leader RNA (+) strand indicated that nt 140–206 are not necessary for binding to cell proteins.

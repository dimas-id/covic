In order to know reproduction-related complications due to standing laparoscopic peritoneal flap hernioplasty, histological characteristics of the testicles from five stallions one year after surgery were compared with seven testicles from four healthy stallions. Moreover, the daily sperm output (DSO) was determined before (T0) and one year after surgery (T12). DSO did not show significant differences between T0 and T12. The diameter of the seminiferous tubules was significantly decreased in the samples from the hernioplasty group. The percentage of tubules with full spermatogenesis was smaller in the hernioplasty group, but the difference was not significant. It can be concluded that standing laparoscopic peritoneal flap hernioplasty produced mild histological changes in the testicular parenchyma, epididymis and pampiniform plexus after one year follow-up.

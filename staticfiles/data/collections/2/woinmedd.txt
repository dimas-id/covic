The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with first presentation of atypical pneumonia, has spread rapidly from Wuhan, China on December 12, 2019 to over 200 countries, caused 2310572 infected individuals and 158691 mortalities, updated on 2020/4/19. Many studies have published timely to help global health-care workers to understand and control the disease. Vulnerable patients with risk factors such as elderly, cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension, coronary disease, or cardiomyopathy), diabetes, chronic kidney disease etc., have worse outcomes after covid-19 infection. COVID-19 could directly cause cardiovascular injuries such as pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias or thromboembolic events, which urge cardiologists to be involved in the frontline to practice. Here we provide a review of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system to assist clinical cardiologists to better understand the disease and being capable of providing comprehensive medical support.

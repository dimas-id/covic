In agreement with the evolution of histochemistry over the last fifty years and thanks to the impressive advancements in microscopy sciences, the application of cytochemical techniques to light and electron microscopy is more and more addressed to elucidate the functional characteristics of cells and tissue under different physiological, pathological or experimental conditions. Simultaneously, the mere description of composition and morphological features has become increasingly sporadic in the histochemical literature. Since basic research on cell functional organization is essential for understanding the mechanisms responsible for major biological processes such as differentiation or growth control in normal and tumor tissues, histochemical Journals will continue to play a pivotal role in the field of cell and tissue biology in all its structural and functional aspects.

Endoscopic interventions are first-line therapy for upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Injection therapy in combination with a second endoscopic modality has reduced re-bleeding, need for surgery and mortality in non-variceal bleeding. For variceal bleeding endoscopic banding or cyanoacrylate injection techniques are recommended interventions. However, despite ease of application and general acceptance of these techniques, there is an ongoing re-bleeding rate associated with significant in-hospital mortality. We discuss current literature on new advances in endoscopic technologies and procedural techniques that have emerged to improve patient outcomes.

Prevention of zoonoses in cancer patients is the theme of this chapter and it is hoped that it will encourage and help doctors caring for such patients to educate them to avoid the infections. Avoidance need not include separation from a pet or occupation or recreation, but the use of caution conditioned by knowledge of the sources of infection and the ways we contact them should lead to effective prevention.

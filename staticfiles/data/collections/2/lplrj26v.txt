Intestinal and cell culture-adapted viral populations of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine were compared by means of sucrose gradient centrifugation, immunnofluorescence, electron microscopy, immune electron microscopy, statistical analysis of the number of plaque-forming units, and ultraviolet sensitivity. Results indicated that the size range and general coronavirus morphologic characteristics were shared by both viral populations. Marked morphologic variations existed among particles from both populations. Unlike the cell culture-adapted virus, the Illinois virus of intestinal origin was infractions representing 2 bands of infectivity which were isolated by the sucrose gradient centrifugation method. The intestinal and cell culture-adapted TGE viruses were similar in antigenicity and in sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation. There was no indication of a 2nd virus in addition to the coronavirus described as the cause of TGE.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an essential treatment modality for many malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases. Advances in HSCT techniques have dramatically decreased peri-transplant morbidity and mortality, but it remains a high-risk procedure, and a significant number of patients will require critical care during the transplant process. Complications of HSCT are both infectious and non-infectious, and the intensivist must be familiar with common infections, the management of neutropenic sepsis and septic shock, the management of respiratory failure in the immunocompromised host, and a plethora of HSCT-specific complications. Survival from critical illness after HSCT is improving, but the mortality rate remains unacceptably high. Continued research and optimization of critical care provision in this population should continue to improve outcomes.

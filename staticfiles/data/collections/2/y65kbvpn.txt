Introduction This study aimed to evaluate the effects of aging on hydromorphone-induced thermal antinociception in cats. Methods In a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled design, 10 healthy female cats received each of the following treatments intramuscularly: hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg) and 0.9% saline (0.05 mL/kg) with a 1-week washout between treatments at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Skin temperature and thermal thresholds (TTs) were recorded before and up to 12 hours after injection. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures linear mixed model (α = 0.05). Results After saline treatment, TT was not significantly different from baseline at any time point for any age group. After hydromorphone treatment, TT was significantly higher than baseline at 6 months for up to 1 hour, and at 9 and 12 months for up to 4 hours. Peak TT at 6, 9, and 12 months were 50.4 ± 2.7, 50.9 ± 2.0, and 53.6 ± 2.0°C at 0.5, 1, and 1 hours, respectively. Mean TT was significantly higher after hydromorphone treatment when compared with saline treatment at 9 and 12 months for up to 4 hours but not at 6 months. Magnitude of antinociception was consistently larger at 12 months when compared with 6 months of age. Hydromorphone provided a shorter duration and smaller magnitude of antinociception at 6 months when compared with 9 and 12 months. Conclusion Pediatric cats may require more frequent dosing of hydromorphone than adults.

INTRODUCTION The "artery-first approach" (AFA) to the superior mesenteric artery allows an early assessment of resectability of pancreatic tumours and could improve the benefits of laparoscopy, reducing invasiveness, especially for unresectable tumours. AIM To describe our technique of pure laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (PLPD) with the AFA, and to report the surgical outcomes of this procedure in a small series of 12 patients through a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve selected patients underwent elective full laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy with the AFA. The technical aspects of the procedure are described in detail and the included images facilitate the understanding of the procedure. RESULTS The mean operative time was 300 min (range: 250-540 min). No intraoperative complications were observed. No conversion to laparotomy was necessary. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 18 days (range: 8-42). Mortality was null. There were 3 major complications at the 3rd post-operative month follow-up: 2 patients reporting a grade A pancreatic fistula and one biliary fistula. CONCLUSIONS Our work shows that pure laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (PLPD) with the AFA is feasible, in selected patients. The AFA could improve on the advantages of laparoscopy in the identification of unresectable patients, and it also allows early control of vascular structures.

The aims of the researchers were to develop and test initial psychometric properties of the Menstrual Health Instrument, a measure of menstrual health in adolescents that comprehensively evaluates menstrual health. Data were collected with a convenience sample of 230 Korean adolescent girls. As a result of exploratory factor analysis with the 29-item instrument, five factors were extracted: affective symptoms, somatic symptoms and school life, daily habits for menstrual health, menstrual cycle characteristics, and attitudes and perceptions on menstruation. The reliability and validity estimates indicate the Menstrual Health Instrument could be used for screening in school or community settings.

OBJECTIVE To investigate variations and significance of plasma fibrinogen in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS Totally 148 patients with SARS were divided into the following groups: initial stage group (44 cases) and after the initial stage group (104 cases), common type group (87 cases) and severe type group (61 cases), unilobar lung involvement group (49 cases), bilobar lung involvement group (53 cases) and diffuse lung involvement group (46 cases). The values of plasma fibrinogen of the 148 SARS patients were analyzed and compared among the different groups. RESULTS The mean value of plasma fibrinogen (x +/- SD, 522.29 +/- 154.87 mg/dl) of the 148 cases was higher than the normal value (p less than 0.01). There were significant differences between the initial stage and after initial stage groups, between the common and severe type groups, and among the unilobar, bilobar and diffuse lung involvement groups (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION theses results suggested that elevation of peripheral blood fibrinogen in SARS patients may play an important role in development and progress of the disease and its treatment.

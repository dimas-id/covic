Purpose: We present image classifiers based on Dense Convolutional Networks and transfer learning to classify chest X-Ray images according to three labels: COVID-19, viral pneumonia and normal. Methods: We fine-tuned neural networks pretrained on ImageNet and applied a twice transfer learning approach, using NIH ChestX-Ray14 dataset as an intermediate step. We also suggested an output neuron keeping strategy. In order to clarify the modus operandi of the models, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to generate heatmaps. Results: We were able to reach state-of-the-art test accuracy (99.4%) and F1 Score (0.994). Twice transfer learning improved classification performances in the first half of the training process but, after many epochs, we could achieve the same results using common transfer learning. Output neuron keeping improved twice transfer learning performances. Although LRP showed that words on the X-Rays can influence the networks predictions, we discovered this had only a very small effect on accuracy. Conclusion: The state-of-the-art performances we achieved show that, with the help of artificial intelligence, chest X-Rays can become a cheap and accurate auxiliary method for COVID-19 diagnosis. heatmaps generated by LRP improve the interpretability of the deep neural networks and indicate an analytical path for future research on diagnosis.

Cerebral vasospasm is a source of morbidity and mortality, not only associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but also with endovascular procedures. Treatment of vasospasm associated with SAH include trans-luminal balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial delivery of vasodilator medications. We present a case report of a patient who underwent a mechanical thrombectomy for stroke and suffered from vasospasm. This severe flow-limiting vasospasm was successfully treated with the Trevo stent device. Although stent retrievers have become more widespread for thrombectomy, vasospasm treatment has not been often described in the literature. Further study is needed to determine if this is a viable technique for treating resistant vasospasm.

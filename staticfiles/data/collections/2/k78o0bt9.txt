BACKGROUND: Cleft lip and palate is one of the most common developmental anomalies affecting the craniofacial region leading to an array of problems including the inability to feed properly. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of specially designed audio-visual module over traditional instructional module in improving the assisted breastfeeding habits. METHODOLOGY: Sixteen patients received training regarding the feeding practices through the traditional instructional method, and 16 subjects received training through audio-visual module. Infants in both the groups received the standard care. These infants were followed up longitudinally for 6 months. During the follow up period, the growth parameters were recorded monthly. The knowledge, attitude, and practices of the mothers regarding feeding practices were assessed using KAP questionnaire. RESULTS: There was significant improvement in the knowledge of the mothers from baseline to 6 months, however, the practices indicated that the mothers belonging to the audio-visual module group showed better understating of the condition and earlier adaptation of the breastfeeding practices. Correspondingly, the growth parameters also showed significant difference. CONCLUSION: The custom-made audio-visual module would help the mothers adapt better to the stressful situation following the birth of the infant affected with cleft lip and palate.

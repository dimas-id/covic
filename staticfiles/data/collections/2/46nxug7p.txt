OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and find out its effective treatment. METHODS A total of 106 cases of SARS were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS In this group, 56 were male and 50 female, aged from 15 to 81 years [average (36 +/- 10) years]. Common symptoms included fever (98.1%), chills (75.5%), cough (71.7%), headache and breathless (both 43.4%), diarrhea (24.5%) and rare rales in the lungs (11.2%). Laboratory test showed leukopenia (34.0%), lymphopenia (81.1%) and an extraordinary decrease of CD(4)(+) T cells (98.1%). Other rare abnormalities included liver injury (elevated alanine aminotransferase in 7.6%) and thrombocytopenia (3.8%). Almost all patients suffered from hypoxemia (PaO(2) less than 90 mm Hg in 90.2%, less than 70 mm Hg in 28.6%). Chest radiographs showed that unilateral focal patchy involvement in 34.0% of the patients, and unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement were 11.3% and 46.2% respectively. Treatment regimens included small doses of steroids (methylprednisolone 40-80 mg, q12 h recommended) accompanied with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as the second generation of cephalosporins and macrolides and some other antiviral drugs. Meanwhile, emphasis was placed on oxygen support and coping with their underlying diseases. CONCLUSIONS SARS has various presentations of clinical features and laboratory tests. Detection of CD(4)(+) T cell count is beneficial to diagnose SARS in early stage. Effective treatment includes various regimens, oxygen support and small doses of steroids.

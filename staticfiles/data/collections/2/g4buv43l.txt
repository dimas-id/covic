INTRODUCTION Since Pall-German stopped manufacturing ITLC-SG, it has become necessary to validate alternative stationary phases. OBJECTIVE To validate different stationary phases versus ITLC-SG Pall-Gelman in the determination of the radiochemical purity (RCP) of (111)In-pentetreotide ((111)In-Octreoscan) by planar chromatography. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a case-control study, which included 66 (111)In-pentetreotide preparations. We determined the RCP by planar chromatography, using a freshly prepared solution of 0,1M sodium citrate (pH 5) and the following stationary phases: ITLC-SG (Pall-Gelman) (reference method), iTLC-SG (Varian), HPTLC silica gel 60 (Merck), Whatman 1, Whatman 3MM and Whatman 17. For each of the methods, we calculated: PRQ, relative front values (RF) of the radiopharmaceutical and free (111)In, chromatographic development time, resolution between peaks. We compared the results obtained with the reference method. The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program. The p value was calculated for the study of statistical significance. RESULTS The highest resolution is obtained with HPTLC silica gel 60 (Merck). However, the chromatographic development time is too long (mean=33.62minutes). Greater resolution is obtained with iTLC-SG (Varian) than with the reference method, with lower chromatographic development time (mean=3.61minutes). Very low resolutions are obtained with Whatman paper, essentially with Whatman 1 and 3MM. Therefore, we do not recommend their use. CONCLUSIONS Although iTLC-SG (Varian) and HPTLC silica gel 60 (Merck) are suitable alternatives to ITLC-SG (Pall-Gelman) in determining the RCP of (111)In-pentetreotide, iTLC-SG (Varian) is the method of choice due to its lower chromatographic development time.

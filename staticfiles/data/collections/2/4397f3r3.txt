Introduction Endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke is more effective when performed quickly. In this report, we describe quality interventions to ensure fast endovascular treatment times in the ESCAPE (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal Occlusion with Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times) trial. Methods An "audit and feedback" intervention using webinar and letter was used to improve treatment time over the course of the trial. The time metrics were computed tomography-to-groin-puncture (target < 60 min) and computed tomography-to-first-reperfusion (target < 90 min). Each site was provided with their data for computed tomography-to-groin-puncture and computed tomography-to-first-reperfusion for all their patients that were randomized to the treatment arm, and their median time was compared to the overall median times of all sites in the trial. We assessed for changes in treatment time over the course of the trial. Results There were 165 patients enrolled into the endovascular arm from 22 sites. The computed tomography-to-groin-puncture time dropped from 57 to 47 min (p = 0.14) while computed tomography-to-reperfusion time dropped from 89 to 81 min (p = 0.48). Over the course of the trial, the absolute treatment benefit increased by 7.8% (p < 0.001). Conclusions An "audit and feedback" intervention throughout the conduct of the ESCAPE trial was a feasible way to ensure fast treatment times. Quality improvement processes should continue as standard practice beyond the trial to encourage good patient selection and the best clinical outcomes.

Abstract Parasitic, fungal, bacterial and viral diseases of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) are reviewed. Besides a general overview of parasites of carp, swimbladder inflammation, caused by Sphaerospora spp., is discussed in detail. Saprolegnia spp. is the most important fungal pathogen. Aeromonas hydrophila and the atypical Aeromonas salmonicida, as well as Flexibacter columnaris, are described as the major bacterial pathogens of carp. Spring viraemia of carp caused by Rhabdovirus carpio is presented as the main viral infection of common carp. Details on methods of treatment and prevention are presented together with a description of the given diseases. The role of environmental stress, including “normal” culture practice and pollution, in the outbreak of diseases of common carp is discussed. Prospective methods to minimize the risk of diseases as well as their limitations are presented.

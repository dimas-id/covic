A 70-year-old man, who had undergone the placement of an endovascular aneurysm repair graft for an abdominal aortic aneurysm 7 years previously, presented to our facility with the separation of a left iliac stent-graft limb from the main-body stent-graft, resulting in a type III endoleak. An attempt was made to repair the disconnected stent-graft limb with endovascular intervention. An extension stent-graft was successfully deployed using a pulled-through technique to connect the main-body stent-graft with the disconnected stent-graft limb. Endovascular intervention may be an acceptable treatment for type III endoleaks.

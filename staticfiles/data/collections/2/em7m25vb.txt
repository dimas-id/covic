INTRODUCTION This study aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of various published indices for identifying elderly Chinese females at risk of osteoporosis in Singapore. METHODS The indices considered were the Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE), the Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI), the Age Bulk One or Never Estrogens (ABONE), body weight (WEIGHT), and the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA). Altogether, 135 postmenopausal Chinese female subjects aged 55 years and older participated in the study, and their bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subjects were classified as osteoporotic if their femoral neck BMD T-score was -2.5 or lower. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the indices' cut-off points, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS OSTA had the highest discriminatory power, with an estimated area under the ROC curve of 0.82. This was followed by SCORE (0.80), WEIGHT (0.78), ORAI (0.76), and ABONE (0.70). At the cut-off point of -2, OSTA achieved sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 59%, respectively. CONCLUSION The study showed that OSTA is an effective index for identifying postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis.

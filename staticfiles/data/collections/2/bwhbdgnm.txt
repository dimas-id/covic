BACKGROUND The aim of our study is to report our initial clinical experience with robotically assisted single-site transabdominal preperitoneal (RASS-TAPP) hernia repair, to verify the safety and efficacy of the procedure and to describe the surgical procedure. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing RASS-TAPP at our institution from March 2013 through December 2013. Data regarding patient demographics, type and location of hernia, operative time and clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Fourty five hernias were repaired in 34 patients (30M, 4F) by a single surgeon. The mean age was 49.3 years and mean BMI was 26.5. 31 lateral defects, 13 medial defects and 1 femoral defect were repaired. Three patients presented with recurrent hernias and nine had bilateral defects. The mean operative time for all cases was 80.5 min and for all unilateral hernias 69 min. Considering just the unilateral hernias without any additional procedures, operative time was 63 min. The mean follow-up time was 5.5 months. There has been one superficial surgical site infection, but no observed clinical recurrence or neuralgia to date. CONCLUSION Robotically assisted single-site transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair is safe and effective. The absence of clinical evidence of recurrence or neuralgia is encouraging and should promote further study.

Typical configurations of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) include venovenous (VV) and venoarterial (VA) configurations; however, other configurations of ECMO may be necessary in certain situations. We performed VA ECMO for a 71-year-old man who experienced refractory hypoxaemia associated with a brief cardiac arrest after resection of the small intestine showing necrosis. As the cardiac function improved, the patient showed a complication of poor oxygenation in the upper body due to insufficient respiratory function. Therefore, we performed VA-venous ECMO, which further improved his cardiac function and allowed him to be converted to VV ECMO. It is very important to consider different configuration strategies of ECMO by adjusting the patient's cardiopulmonary conditions appropriately.

Diagnosing rashes in the emergency department can be challenging. If the rash is extensive and targetoid, include Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) on your differential and be sure to obtain a thorough history to identify possible offending agents. Additionally, prioritize supportive care and obtaining a dermatology/burn consult to coordinate appropriate care.

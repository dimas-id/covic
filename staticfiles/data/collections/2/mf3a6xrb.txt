Global efforts to monitor and contain the Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, currently rely on RT-qPCR-based diagnostic assays. Yet their high cost, moderate throughput, and dependence on sophisticated equipment limit a broad implementation. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an alternative detection method that has the potential to overcome these limitations. Here, we established a robust, highly sensitive and versatile RT-LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay that is insensitive to carry-over contaminations. Our approach uses a rapid upfront lysis step and hydroxy-naphthol-blue (HNB) for colorimetric detection, which enables the robust identification of Covid-19 infections from a variety of sample types within 30 minutes. By combining RT-LAMP with a simple nucleic acid enrichment method (bead-LAMP), we profoundly increased assay sensitivity to RT-qPCR-like levels, thereby extending applications to large-scale pooled testing. Finally, we developed HomeDip-LAMP for pipette-free SARS-CoV-2 detection for low-resource environments. Our combined optimizations set the stage for implementing RT-LAMP as SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics assay for population-wide and home-based testing.

OBJECTIVE To describe a laparoscopically assisted ovariectomy (LAO) technique in the cat with a bipolar vessel sealing device (BVSD) or suture ligation and to compare the outcomes to open ovariohysterectomy (OO). STUDY DESIGN Randomized prospective study ANIMALS: Healthy, adult, sexually intact female cats (n = 30). METHODS Ten cats were assigned to each group: LAO with BVSD (group A), LAO with ligation (group B), and OO with ligation (group C). Surgical times and complications were assessed. Serum glucose and cortisol were measured prior to surgery and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Pain was scored by using an interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after surgery. Rescue analgesia was provided when IVAS score was 4 or more. Physiological and serum values and IVAS scores were compared among groups with area under the curve (AUC) by using a 1-way ANOVA. RESULTS Surgical time was shortest for group C (19.1 ± 5.2 minutes; P < .0002); there was no significant difference between groups A (27.7 ± 6.6 minutes) and B (33.2 ± 8.2 minutes). All procedures were completed successfully. No significant differences among groups were found in IVAS scores (P = .36), rescue analgesia (P = .22), glucose AUC (P = .53), or cortisol AUC (P = .27). CONCLUSION The LAO technique was accomplished as described in all cats with no complications or failures. Pain scores were not different from cats undergoing OO. LAO can be performed efficiently to maximize the benefits of minimally invasive surgery and is amenable to clinical practice.

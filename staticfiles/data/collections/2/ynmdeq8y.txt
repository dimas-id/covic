Cochlosoma anatis is a flagellated intestinal parasite that infects a variety of avian species. C. anatis infections have been associated with decreased weight gain and increased morbidity and mortality. Conditions favoring the growth of this organism in birds are current pathogenic intestinal infections and/or young age. There is little data describing the life cycle of this parasite. In this study, electron microscopy images are presented that document longitudinal binary fission of the trophozoite stage and outline the events of pseudocyst formation, which includes a rounding stage. Evidence provided here indicates that the pseudocyst stage may be a mechanism for transmission of this organism. The observations reported here provide additional evidence of homology between Cochlosoma and members of the trichomonad order.

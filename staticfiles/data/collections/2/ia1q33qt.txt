Activation of macrophages is critical in the acute phase of wound healing after implantation of surgical biomaterials. To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) + polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET + sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials.

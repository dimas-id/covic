Our aim was to investigate the effects of interferons (IFNs)-λ (interleukin-29 [IL-29], IL-28A, and IL-28B) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation. The effects of these IFNs on HCV/HAV translation from HAV/HCV IRES were investigated using bicistronic reporter constructs. We transfected HCV/HAV IRES constructs into these IFN-expressing cell lines. IL-29 showed stronger inhibition of their IRES-mediated translation. Combining IL-29 with IFN-α or amantadine resulted in stronger inhibition of HAV IRES activity. Our findings demonstrated a novel antiviral effect of IFNs-λ against HAV and HCV through the suppression of IRES-mediated translation.

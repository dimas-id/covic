Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) offers excellent and lasting oncologic control. Technical refinements in apical dissection, such as the retroapical approach of synchronous urethral transection, and adoption of real-time frozen section analysis of the excised prostate during RARP have substantially reduced positive surgical margin rates, particularly in high-risk disease patients. Furthermore, precision offered by the robotic platform and technical evolution of radical prostatectomy, including enhanced nerve sparing (veil), have led to improved potency and continence outcomes as well as better safety profile in patients undergoing surgical therapy for prostate cancer.

Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) diseases (such as SARS, MERS, pH1N1) can rapidly progress to acute respiratory failure with high lethality. The outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection can lead to 15%~ 30% patients developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory support is the most important therapy for SARI patients with respiratory failure. However, respiratory support is a high skilled technology, which means inappropriate application may bring related complications and cross infection of SARI pathogens among medical staff and non-medical personnel in hospital. Therefore, it is meaningful to established a standardized indication of respiratory support and to prevent related nosocomial transmission in SARI patients.

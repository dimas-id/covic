Endovascular coil embolisation continues to evolve and remains a valid modality in managing ruptured and unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Technological advances in coil properties, adjunctive devices and interventional techniques continue to improve long-term aneurysm occlusion rates. This review elaborates on the latest advances in next-generation endovascular coils and adjunctive coiling techniques for treating cerebral aneurysms.

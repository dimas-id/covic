PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review summarises the results of randomised trials comparing closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) with antithrombotic therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke. RECENT FINDINGS Initially, three randomised trials failed to show superiority of PFO closure over antithrombotic therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Three recently performed trials and the prolongation of an earlier trial provided evidence that PFO closure in patients with cryptogenic stroke and an age range of 18-60 years is superior to stroke prevention with antiplatelet therapy. PFO closure was not superior to anticoagulation. Anticoagulation, however, has a higher long-term bleeding risk. PFO closure could result in atrial fibrillation (AF) in a small number of patients. In most patients, AF was transient in duration. Optimal patient selection requires future research. In patients with cryptogenic stroke aged < 60 years, PFO closure is superior to antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of recurrent stroke.

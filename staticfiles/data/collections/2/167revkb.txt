Banking sectors across the globe are under immense stress due to the evolving COVID-19 situation and policy responses thereto. This study investigates how COVID-19 impacted the systemic risk in the banking sectors of eight of the most COVID-19 affected countries. We find a significant increase in systemic risk among the sample countries initially, while stagnancy (at an elevated level) is observed during April 2020 except for China, which is showing some recovery. By using spillover measures, we also identify systemically important institutions. The findings of this study testify to the benefits of policy responses in containing systemic risk.

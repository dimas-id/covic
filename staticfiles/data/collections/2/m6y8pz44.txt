Network scientists proposed that infectious diseases may be effectively halted by targeting interventions at a minority of highly connected individuals, or hubs. Can this strategy be effective in combating a disease transmitted through physical proximity such as SARS-CoV-2? Effectiveness critically depends on high between-person variability in the number of close-range contacts. We analyze population survey data showing that indeed the distribution of close-range contacts across individuals is characterized by a small fraction of individuals reporting very high frequencies. Strikingly, the average duration of contact is mostly invariant in the number of contacts, reinforcing the criticality of hubs. We simulate a population with empirical contact distributions coming out of lockdown. Simulations show that targeting hubs dramatically improves containment. Our results further suggest two concrete procedures for identifying high-contact individuals: acquaintance sampling and employment-based targeting.

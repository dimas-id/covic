Introduction Throughout our 20 years of experience, we have used several different techniques for laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). However, two methods have been used most frequently: "vessels first" and "hilar transection". Aim To evaluate the outcomes of LS performed with these two different approaches. Material and methods It was an observational study based on retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing LS in a tertiary referral surgical center in the period 1998-2017. We excluded patients with splenic trauma, initially submitted to open surgery, stapled transection of splenic hilum, partial resections of the spleen and other spleen-preserving procedures. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 ("vessels first") with 188 patients, and group 2 ("hilar transection") with 287 patients. Results Mean operative time was shorter (p < 0.001) and blood loss was lower (p < 0.001) in group 2. The need for blood transfusions and the conversion rate were higher in group 1 (p = 0.044 and p = 0.003 respectively). There was no difference in intraoperative adverse events (p = 0.179). Overall postoperative morbidity did not differ between groups (p = 0.081) and we noted mortality of 0.21% (1 patient of group 2). The morbidity rate associated with accidental injury of the pancreatic parenchyma was significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.028). Median length of hospital stay was 4 days (range: 1-99) and did not differ between groups (p = 0.175). Conclusions The "vessels first" technique is associated with longer operative time, higher blood loss and increased risk of conversion. "Hilar transection" is associated with lower incidence of local complications related most likely to accidental injury of the pancreatic tail. In the case of a large caliber of splenic vessels the "vessels first" approach remains the technique of choice.

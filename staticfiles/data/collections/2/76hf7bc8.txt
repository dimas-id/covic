Infection control in the operation department is the result of many single factors and routines, based on experience, documentation and expert panels through more than a hundred years. Many factors and routines in surgery are evidence-based, but most of them are still lacking evidence and can probably never be investigated because of ethical problems. Consequently, consensus and guidance are used to a great extent. Surgery opens into sterile tissues for hours, where there is massive tissue damage by knife, diathermy, clogging of vessels, pressure against and drying of tissues, decreased blood supply, impaired phagocytosis and impaired infection defence. Microbes deposited in this devitalized tissues may find a good basis for growth and proliferation if there is lack of infection control and sterility. For patients with ongoing infections and who need surgery, special routines are made to prevent the spread of infections in the operation department. This chapter is a practical description of many important preventive procedures that may protect the surgical patient against surgical site infection (SSI).

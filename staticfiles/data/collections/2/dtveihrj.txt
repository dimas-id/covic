In 1992, a 27-year-old male with same sex exposure requested human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) testing anonymously at a walk-in clinic. He was advised that the test (HIV serology) was positive and he requested a repeat test (anonymously) 1 month later, which was also reported as being positive. About 2 years later, he was assessed by a general practitioner for symptoms of depression and continued medical care. At that time, investigations revealed a CD4 T-cell count of about 700 cells/uL. Sometime in 1996 a repeat blood test revealed a CD4 cell count just <500 cells/uL. No consultation to an infectious diseases specialist or HIV clinic was made. The GP(general practitioner) then initiated a regimen consisting of didanosine, lamivudine, and saquinavir for HIV infection. At that time, testing for HIV viral load was not generally available to the medical community, but became procurable in 1997. Initially, the patient tolerated the regimen well and over the next 3 years his CD4 cell count was maintained above 600â€“700 cells/uL and the HIV viral load remained undetectable (<50 copies). However, the patient started to show morphologic changes of moderate facial and peripheral lipoatrophy, developed mild sensory peripheral neuropathy, and increased liver enzymes attributable to fatty liver, and elevations of the fasting serum glucose. In the summer of 2000, although the CD4 cell count remained stable, the HIV viral load was reported as being over 7,000 copies/uL. At this time, the patient was referred to a university hospital HIV clinic.

Abstract Objective To compare analytical sensitivity and specificity of a newly described DNA amplification technique, LAMP and nested PCR assay targeting the RE and B1 genes for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) DNA. Methods The analytical sensitivity of LAMP and nested-PCR was obtained against10-fold serial dilutions of T. gondii DNA ranging from 1 ng to 0.01 fg. DNA samples of other parasites and human chromosomal DNA were used to determine the specificity of molecular assays. Results After testing LAMP and nested-PCR in duplicate, the detection limit of RE-LAMP, B1-LAMP, RE-nested PCR and B1-nested PCR assays was one fg, 100 fg, 1 pg and 10 pg of T. gondii DNA respectively. All the LAMP assays and nested PCRs were 100% specific. The RE-LAMP assay revealed the most sensitivity for the detection of T. gondii DNA. Conclusions The obtained results demonstrate that the LAMP technique has a greater sensitivity for detection of T. gondii. Furthermore, these findings indicate that primers based on the RE are more suitable than those based on the B1 gene. However, the B1-LAMP assay has potential as a diagnostic tool for detection of T. gondii.

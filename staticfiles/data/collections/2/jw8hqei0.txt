Clinical laboratories have traditionally relied on time-consuming phenotypic methods such as culture, serology, and biochemical tests for detection, identification, and characterization of microbial pathogens. Real-time polymerase chain reaction technology can now identify many pathogenic organisms that constitute infectious disease emergencies in normal and immune-compromised hosts. Use of this molecular technology for the accurate diagnosis of infectious disease agents by clinical laboratories reduces the time to diagnosis for many pathogens. This article is designed such that the clinician evaluating a patient with severe acute illness can reference the most relevant molecular diagnostics available pertinent to the predominant organ system involved.

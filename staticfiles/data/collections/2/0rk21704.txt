We tested the utility of the McGrath MAC(®) (McG) video laryngoscope during chest compression compared with the Pentax Airwayscope(®) (AWS). We recruited 59 participants into the simulation study. The difference in the time to intubation (TTI [sec]) between without and with chest compression was significant for the AWS attempts (median 13, range 6-28 vs. median 15, range 6-72, p = 0.0247) but not significant for the McG attempts (median 16, range 6-75 vs. median 16, range 6-71); however, the difference of the TTIs is not serious clinically. The utility of the two devices during chest compressions is almost similar although their characteristics are different.

Fundamental aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology remain to be described, having the potential to provide insight to the response effort for this high-priority pathogen. Here we describe the first native RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing the coronaviral transcriptome and epitranscriptome, and share these data publicly. A data-driven inference of viral genetic features and evolutionary rate is also made. The rapid sharing of sequence information throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents an inflection point for public health and genomic epidemiology, providing early insights into the biology and evolution of this emerging pathogen.

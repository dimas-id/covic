Bacterial zoonotic infections are rare in developed countries in the twenty-first century but may cause major morbidity and mortality in developing regions of the world. In addition, their potential use as biological weapons makes early recognition and effective empiric therapy important for the critical care practitioner. Anthrax, plague, and tularemia share overlapping presenting syndromes, including fulminant respiratory infections and less severe but still highly morbid lymphocutaneous infections. Although all three may be transmitted as infectious aerosols, only plague has a risk of direct human-to-human transmission. Diagnostic testing will require special precautions for laboratory staff and most often involvement of regional and national reference laboratories. Empiric therapy with aminoglycosides may be life-saving for plague and tularemia, while the treatment of anthrax is complex and varies depending on the site of infection. In outbreaks or for post-exposure prophylaxis, treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone is recommended for all three diseases.

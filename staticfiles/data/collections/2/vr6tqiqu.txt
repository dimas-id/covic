Autophagy signaling pathway is involved in cellular homeostasis, developmental processes, cellular stress responses, and immune pathways. The aim of this review is to summarize the relationship between autophagy and viruses. It is not possible to be fully comprehensive, or to provide a complete “overview of all viruses”. In this review, we will focus on the interaction of autophagy and viruses and survey how human viruses exploit multiple steps in the autophagy pathway to help viral propagation and escape immune response. We discuss the role that macroautophagy plays in cells infected with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, rotavirus gastroenteritis, immune cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus, and viral respiratory tract infections both influenza virus and coronavirus.

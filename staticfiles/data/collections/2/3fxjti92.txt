This chapter surveys the current detection technologies used in commercially available luminescence biosensor detection equipments currently employed for identifying warfare biological agents (BAs). Brief technical descriptions of these technologies are presented with emphasis placed on the principles of detection. Much of the content presented was obtained from the open-source literature and is an introduction to biosensor fundamentals

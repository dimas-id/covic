Cavernous hemangiomas with shunt formations have been a recently recognized entity. Arterioportal (AP) shunts with cavernous hemangiomas have been described. However, a combination of AP and portosystemic (PS) shunts causing portal hypertension has not been previously demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) imaging. In this study, we report an atypical cavernous hemangioma associated with portal hypertension. Cavernous hemangioma with AP and PS shunts formations was precisely demonstrated with dynamic multidetector CT imaging.

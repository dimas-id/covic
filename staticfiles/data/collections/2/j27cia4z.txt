OBJECTIVE The European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS) provider course aims at training doctors and nurses in the efficient and prompt management of cardiopulmonary arrest in children. EPLS is a 2-day European Resuscitation Council course, involving the teaching of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The aim of the study was to evaluate the retention of theoretical knowledge and certain skills of EPLS providers 4 months after the course. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 80 doctors and nurses who attended three EPLS provider courses, from May 2012 to December 2012, were asked to participate in the study and only 50 responded positively. Demographic data (age, sex, occupation) of the participants were collected. The European Resuscitation Council-approved EPLS written test was used to assess theoretical knowledge right after the course and after 4 months. The retention of certain skills (airway opening, bag-mask ventilation, chest compressions) was also examined. RESULTS The theoretical knowledge decreased significantly (P<0.001) 4 months after the course. Age, sex and occupational status (medical or nursing profession) had no effect in theoretical knowledge retention. Interestingly, certain skills such as the application of airway opening manoeuvres and effective bag-mask ventilation were retained 4 months after the course, whereas chest compression skill retention significantly declined (P=0.012). CONCLUSION According to our findings, theoretical knowledge of the EPLS course uniformly declines, irrespective of the provider characteristics, whereas retention of certain skills is evident 4 months after the course.

We examine the spatial modeling of the outbreak of COVID-19 in two regions: the country of Greece and the autonomous community of Andalusia in Spain. We start with an ODE version of a SEIHARD model that we optimize to obtain relevant parameters for these regions. Subsequently, spatially distributed versions of the corresponding models in the form of convection-reaction-diffusion equations are considered. We show that these models bear significant potential towards capturing the spatial expansion of the pandemic and veins of future work are considered to that effect.

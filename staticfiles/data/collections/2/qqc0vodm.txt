Poyang Lake represents a major wetland system in Asia fed by the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region. Poyang Lake has a deep legacy and affected many dynasties, cultures and their wealth and fate. Further, this region is a biodiversity hotspot of international relevance featuring fish abundances and major wintering sites for birds of international relevance, e.g. crane species (including the Siberian Crane), geese and songbirds. The status of this ecosystem is currently on the vast decline with water areas and amounts shrinking. Recent and modern upstream processes are a big driver of this situation such as the Three Gorges Dam and dykes, as well as new regional policies and activities related to farming, tourism, urbanization, sand mining. Poyang Lake plays a big international role and is to be considered in the globalization context if serious impacts like global change are to be handled in an effective and relevant measure to safeguard those landscapes and all its members.

Little is know about COVID-19 outcome in specific populations such as Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. We report three cases of adult patients with similar underlying disease with completely different clinical severity at the time of COVID-19 infection. The patient with the most severe clinical course was obese and diabetic, suggesting that COVID-19 mortality and morbidity in Adult congenital heart disease patients might be independent of anatomic complexity.

Ferrets may exhibit neurologic signs as a result of various conditions that may be of nervous or muscular origin. Neurologic examination follows the same principles as in small animal medicine. One of the main defect that may be screened during clinical examination is deafness. Congenital deafness in ferrets is associated with coat color patterns such as white markings and premature graying.In this species, paresis is a common presentation and may reflect a generalized weakness. Spinal disorder, intervertebral disk disease, and neoplasia are among the differential diagnosis. Diagnostic exams usually include advance diagnostic imaging such as CT-scan associated with myelography. Seizure is usually associated with hypoglycemia and insulinoma, but other causes such as hypocalcemia or intracranial disorders have been described. Ferrets are sensitive to various neurotropic infectious disease such as rabies, distemper, aleutian disease, or systemic coronavirus. Finally, muscular disorder such as disseminated idiopathic myofasciitis and myasthenia gravis have been recently described, and potential treatments have been intended.

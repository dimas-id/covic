2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) destroys angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and breaks the balance of renin-angiotension system (RAS) by interacting with ACE2. The imbalance of RAS takes part in the development of organ injury of different systems through pro-inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation and so on. 2019-nCoV not only attacks the lung, but also influences many other systems. It is speculated that RAS imbalance plays an important role in the development of multi-organ dysfunction caused by 2019-nCoV, and the usage of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) may become a new treatment of 2019-nCoV-related organ injury. Further studies are need to confirm the relationship between coronavirus infection, multi-organ injury and RAS imbalance.

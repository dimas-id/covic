Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR were used to detect 14 (6.6%) influenza C virus (InfC) among 213 clinical samples collected from children with respiratory symptoms in Mie Prefecture, Japan, between January 2012 and December 2012. Virus isolation using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and/or embryonated chicken eggs was also successful for 3 of the 14 PCR-positive samples. Eleven patients (78.6%) were aged <3 years. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin-esterase gene showed that the InfC detected in Mie Prefecture belonged to the C/Sao Paulo/82-related lineage. To determine the seroprevalence of InfC, a total of 575 serum samples from patients aged 1 month to 69 years in Mie Prefecture were screened by hemagglutination inhibition test using the C/Mie/199/2012 (C/Sao Paulo/82-related lineage) strain as the antigen. The samples with an antibody titer of â‰¥1:16 were designated as antibody-positive. The results showed that 53.7% of the 296 serum samples collected in 2011 and 85.3% of the 279 samples collected in 2012 were positive for antibodies against InfC, suggesting that an outbreak of InfC infection occurred in Mie Prefecture in 2012. Therefore, continuous and proactive monitoring is important to determine the number of InfC-infections and to better understand the epidemiology.

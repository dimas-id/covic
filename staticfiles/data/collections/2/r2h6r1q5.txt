Abstract Beyond the earlier skepticism that greeted its usefulness and applicability in public health practice, m-Health has continued to gain significant support and acceptability among public health practitioners in terms of the ease with which its features and reach have been harnessed to address global disease prevention and health promotion objectives. Research evidence over the past few decades suggest the positive effect of adopting m-Health in improving knowledge dissemination, creating and sustaining motivation for positive health behavior changes or practices, and empowering individuals, communities and populations to take greater responsibility for their health. This chapter examines historical and current literature evidence of m-Health application in public health practice, its impact on global population health and future prospects.

Publisher Summary This chapter concerns the breed of people who start by selecting a nonclinician path and eventually work in clinical simulation. Their new role requires their grasping a wide range of clinical and educational concepts and skills that should already be second nature to their new colleagues who are trained as an educator, a clinician, or health care professional. There are many different opportunities and responsibilities in the domain of clinical simulation, and nonclinicians could occupy almost any one of them. This ranges from educationalist, communication or team dynamic expert, technician, or technical manager, center coordinator, administrator, to operations manager. The background of potential simulation center employees will be an important asset in their new role as it could give them a different perspective, additional skills, and innovative ideas that complement those of their clinical colleagues.

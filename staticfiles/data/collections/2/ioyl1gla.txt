This study examines the association between community transmission of COVID-19 cases and climatic predictors, considering travel information and annual parasite index across the three climatic zones, i.e., tropical, subtropical, and temperate. A Boosted Regression Tree model has been employed to understand the association between the COVID-19 cases. The results show that average temperature and average relative humidity are the major contributors in explaining the differentials of COVID-19 transmission in temperate and subtropical regions whereas the mean diurnal temperature range and temperature seasonality are the most significant determinants in tropical regions. The average temperature is the most influential factor affecting the number of COVID-19 cases in France, Turkey, the US, the UK, and Germany, and the cases decrease sharply above 10oC. Among the tropical countries, India found to be most affected by mean diurnal temperature, and Brazil fazed by temperature seasonality. Most of the temperate countries like France, USA, Turkey, UK, and Germany with an average temperature between 5-12oC had high number of COVID-19 cases. The findings are expected to add to the ongoing debates on the influence of climatic factors influencing the number of COVID-19 cases and could help researchers and policymakers to make appropriate decisions for preventing the spread.

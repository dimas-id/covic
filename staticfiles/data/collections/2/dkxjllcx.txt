With a uniportal subxiphoid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy, the thymus is not accessed through the ribs, which avoids intercostal nerve damage. Furthermore, compared to a VATS thymectomy via the lateral chest, decreased use of postoperative analgesics (lower doses and shorter duration), decreased blood loss, and shorter surgical duration and hospital stay have been reported. Here we report our surgical method and solutions for a uniportal subxiphoid VATS thymectomy. A uniportal subxiphoid VATS thymectomy is indicated for patients with myasthenia gravis and anterior mediastinal tumors who do not require surgical suturing. The operator stands between the patient's legs and the scopist stands to the right of the patient to operate the camera scope. To begin with, a 3-cm transverse incision was made along Langer's lines 1 cm caudal below the xiphoid process. The CO2 insufflation is performed in the mediastinum at 8 mmHg. The pericardial adipose tissue and thymus are detached from the pericardium in an anterior manner from the bilateral phrenic nerves. The resected thymus is placed in a pouch in the mediastinum and removed from the body through the subxiphoid incision. The subxiphoid approach is highly beneficial for the patient in that it results in superior esthetic outcomes considering that there is no sternotomy and no intercostal nerve damage; thus, it is a surgical procedure that surgeons should learn.

Abstract Valosin-containing protein (VCP) plays roles in various cellular activities. Recently, Enterovirus A71 (EVA71) infection was found to hijack the VCP protein. However, the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear. Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71. Together, these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71.

The third edition of the Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes aims to be a comprehensive reference work for the enzymes that cleave proteins and peptides, and contains over 800 chapters. Each chapter is organized into sections describing the name and history, activity and specificity, structural chemistry, preparation, biological aspects, and distinguishing features for a specific peptidase. The subject of Chapter 501 is Rubella Virus Non-structural Protease. Keywords: Alphavirus protease, Ca binding motif, calmodulin binding motif, catalytic Cys-His dyad, papain-like cysteine protease, regulation of virus replication, regulation of virus RNA polymerase activity, togavirus protease, virus evolution, virus-encoded protease, virus peptidase, Zn binding motif.

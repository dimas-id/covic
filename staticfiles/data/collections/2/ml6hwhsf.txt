OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of a honeycomb appearance of the spleen in a population of referral cats presented for ultrasound examination, and to determine the diagnostic value of this finding vs the definitive diagnosis, the splenic cytological and haematological results. METHODS Data were obtained from the medical records (2016-2018) of cats that had an ultrasonographic honeycomb appearance of the spleen, a splenic cytological diagnosis and a complete blood count. RESULTS Twenty-five cats were included. Prevalence of the honeycomb pattern was 6.8%. None of the spleen was considered normal on cytology and four types of lesions were found: lymphoid hyperplasia (64%), neoplasia (16%), extramedullary haematopoiesis (12%) and splenitis (8%). A honeycomb pattern was successfully identified with a linear high-frequency probe in all cats, but only in 36% of cases with the micro-convex probe. Follow-up information was available for four cats, in which the honeycomb appearance persisted up to 105 days after the first examination; there was persistence of the honeycomb pattern in all cases. Cats with a splenic cytological diagnosis of extramedullary haematopoiesis had the lowest haemoglobin plasma concentration ( P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Honeycomb appearance of the spleen is uncommon in cats and, in our study, was systematically associated with cytological alterations; most of the time it was benign (84%). The use of a high-frequency linear probe improves its detection rate. No epidemiological, ultrasonographic or clinical criteria allow differentiation between the different types of infiltration and fine-needle aspiration is therefore recommended.

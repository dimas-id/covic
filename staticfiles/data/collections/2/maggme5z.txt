The concept of 3D is not new. But never like today, 3D is rapidly entering our life. Using 3D for education is an innovative yet challenging work. This chapter introduces the concept of 3D Immersive and Interactive Learning, which is also called In-depth Learning. In particular, the enabling technologies and the supporting learning environments behind 3D Immersive and Interactive Learning are discussed. The relationship between In-depth Learning and other Learning Paradigms, such as Visual Learning, Simulation-based Learning, Constructivism Learning, and Engaged Learning, etc., are studied. This chapter also serves as an overall introduction to the whole book which presents several efforts in Singapore using 3D for In-depth Learning. The book covers a wide spectrum of education including Gifted Program, Normal (technical) Stream, and Special Needs Education. The author(s) of each book chapter share their experiences from different angles on 3D In-depth Learning.

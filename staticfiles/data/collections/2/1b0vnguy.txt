Chronic ulcers remain a difficult challenge in healthcare systems. While treatment options are limited, stem cells may be a novel alternative. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) have become increasingly popular compared with bone marrow-derived stem cells as they are far easier to harvest. To summarize the current status of treating chronic ulcers with ADSC, this systematic review includes all clinical trials on the subject from PubMed and EmBase, as well as all registered clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.Gov. A total of nine clinical trials and fourteen registered trials were included. The studies were significantly different in terms of study design and patient population, and the overall quality of the studies was low to moderate. Despite the overall low study quality and the significant differences between the studies, some conclusions were consistent: ADSCs are safe, improve the healing of chronic ulcers, and reduce pain. As these results are consistent despite the shortcomings of the studies, they appear to highlight the efficacy of ADSCs in the treatment of chronic ulcers. Larger numbers of higher quality studies are needed to determine the precise role of ADSCs in treating chronic leg ulcers.

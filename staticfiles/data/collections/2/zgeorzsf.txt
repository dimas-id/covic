Eight specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated orally or parenterelly with a cell culture-adapted strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Faeces and oropharyngeal swabs were monitored daily for infectious virus by inoculation of feline embryo long cells. Virus was recovered from both sites for ∼ 2 weeks after inoculation, before clinical signs of disease developed. Peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from these cats were tested in an in-vitro blastogenic assay using concanavalin A (con A) and FIPV antigen. All cats showed a profound suppression of the response to con A which only recovered to pre-inoculation levels in 2 cats, one of which survived. These 2 cats also responded to FIPV antigen on the 21st day after infection, the greater response being in the survivor. The other cats, surviving 16–18 days, developed no response to FIPV antigen. Antibody titres, measured by immunofluorescence and by virus neutralization, rose rapidly to very high levels in all cats, regardless of the route of inoculation.

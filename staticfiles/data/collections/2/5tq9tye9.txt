OBJECTIVE To determine the number of use/cleaning/resterilization cycles that can be safely applied to a vessel sealing device intended for single use (LigaSure). STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo study. SAMPLE POPULATION LigaSure Small Jaw handsets (n = 6) and LigaSure Impact handsets (n = 6). METHODS Handsets underwent simulated splenectomy/cleaning/resterilization cycles until failure, defined as leaking vascular seal or blade retraction failure. Functional testing included assessment of vascular seal integrity, handset activation/tissue release, and cutting blade wear/retraction. Vascular seal failure was defined as a leak occurring at <300 mm Hg. Cycles to failure were recorded. Sealed vessels were evaluated by histology at first handset use and failure. RESULTS Vascular seals created with the Small Jaw handset failed at a mean (95% CI) of 17.2 cycles (9.6-24.8) and a minimum of 10 cycles. Vascular seals created with the Impact failed at a mean of 20 cycles (18.4-21.6) and a minimum of 17 cycles. The majority of seal failures (73%; 95% CI 39%-94%) immediate leaked during vessel filling. The rate of vascular seal failure increased after the initial failure. Failure was associated with histologic disparities in tissue apposition. CONCLUSION Repeated use and resterilization resulted in failure of the vascular seal due to inadequate tissue apposition after a minimum of 10 cycles. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Surgeons reusing and resterilizing LigaSure handsets (ForceTriad platform) should consider discarding handsets after 9 cycles for the Small Jaw and after 16 cycles for the Impact. Handsets should be immediately discarded after any intraoperative identification of vascular seal failure.

Single-incision laparoscopy is being used to carry out a wide variety of laparoscopic operations since its introduction in 2007. Various case reports and studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of single-incision laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and totally extra-peritoneal mesh hernioplasty. However, till date, its apparent advantages have been mainly cosmetic and related to patient satisfaction. We have been performing single-incision laparoscopic TAPP mesh hernioplasty since June 2009 using conventional laparoscopic instruments. Here, we describe our technique that is aimed at standardising the method.

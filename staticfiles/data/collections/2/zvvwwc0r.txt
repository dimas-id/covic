Several studies have confirmed the impact of weather conditions on the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic. We wanted to verify this phenomenon in the city of Oran in Algeria, which experienced its first case of Covid19 on March 19, 2020. The data studied are the new Covid19 cases, the average, minimum and maximum temperatures, as well as the relative humidity rate. A first analysis of the data with a Spearman rank correlation test did not yield significant results. Taking into account the average incubation period to adjust the data made it possible, during a second analysis, to show that the minimum temperature is significantly correlated with the new cases of Covid19 in Oran. This study can help establish prevention policies against Covid19, especially during fall in temperatures in autumn and winter.

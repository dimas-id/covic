BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 disease have not yet been fully described. OBJECTIVES: To describe cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 disease in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We examined the cutaneous manifestations of 210 hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Cutaneous findings were observed during COVID‐19 infection in 52 of the patients. Lesions may be classified as erythematous scaly rash (32.7%), maculopapular rash (23%), urticarial lesions (13.5%), petechial purpuric rash (7.7%), necrosis (7.7%), enanthema and apthous stomatitis (5.8%), vesicular rash (5.8%), pernio (1.9%) and pruritus (1.9%). Cutaneous manifestations were observed statistically significantly more in certain age groups: patients of 55 to 64 and 65 to 74 years of age complained of more cutaneous manifestations than the other age groups. As for gender, there was no significant difference between male and female patients in terms of cutaneus findings. The relationship between comorbidity and dermatological finding status was statistically significant. The relationship increases linearly according to the comorbidities. According the statistical results the patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit had a higher risk of having cutaneous findings due to COVID‐19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: With this study we may highlight the importance of overlooked dermatological findings in patients that are hospitalized. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

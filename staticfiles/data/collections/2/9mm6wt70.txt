Recently, the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in China and other countries in the world is serious. There are at present no effective treatments for COVID-19. The safety and effectiveness of western anti-coronavirus drugs are under investigation. In many places in China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat COVID-19 with a high clinical cure rate. The treatment economics of TCM is good. The immune-regulating and antiviral TCM can enhance human immunity and exert an antiviral effect. They have been widely used in the anti-COVID-19 treatment. We consulted the database of CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and PubMed for screening the immune-regulating and antiviral TCMs (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Pogostemonis Herba, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Scutellariae Radix, Forsythiae Fructus, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Bupleuri Radix, Isatidis Radix, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Astragali Radix, and Houttuyniae Herba). This article summarizes the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics, and the clinical application of the effective components of immune-regulating and antiviral TCM in the prescriptions and Chinese patent medicines, in order to provide a better reference for the clinical application of TCM.

Photogenic: The synthesis of linderaspirone A has been accomplished in only three steps by a Darzens cyclopentenedione synthesis and dioxygen‐assisted photochemical dimerization. Moreover, the thermal isomerization of linderaspirone A into bi‐linderone has been discovered, which may give clues to the biosynthetic pathway for bi‐linderone.[Image: see text]

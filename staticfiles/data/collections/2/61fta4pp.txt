Several studies suggested that the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism but the incidence of thrombotic complications in the late phase of the disease is currently unknown. The present article describes three cases of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and late occurrence of pulmonary embolism. Case 1: a 57-year-old man diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and type B aortic dissection after 12 days from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Laboratory panel at the time of pulmonary embolism showed no signs of ongoing inflammation but only an elevated D-dimer. Case 2: a 76-year-old man with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia followed by pulmonary embolism 20 days later, high-resolution computed tomography on that time showed a partial resolution of crazy paving consolidation. Case 3: a 77-year-old man with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who developed a venous thromboembolic event despite thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Also in this patients no markers of inflammation were present at the time of complication.The present cases raise the possibility that in SARS-CoV-2 infection the hypercoagulable state may persist over the active inflammation phase and cytokine storm. These findings suggest a role for medium-long term therapeutic anticoagulation started at the time of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosis.

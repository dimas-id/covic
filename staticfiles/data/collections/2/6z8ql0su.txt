OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe the radiographic findings and evolution of round pneumonia found in eight patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). CONCLUSION SARS may present as round pneumonia on chest radiographs initially or during the treatment course. It may remain unchanged for up to 9 days before evolution to ill-defined air-space opacities. Radiologists and physicians should consider the possibility of "SARS pneumonia" when spherical air-space opacities are noted on chest radiographs of febrile patients.

COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory disease that the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic. Although a global phenomenon, there is the need to react locally with swift and informed actions, as some of the essential plans are highly dependent on factors such as culture, geography, laws, and customs. This paper presents our approach to mapping the geospatial spread of COVID-19 in Mexico at the state and municipal level, the highest allowed possible resolution in the publicly available dataset provided by the Health Ministry. To visualize the magnitude of the infection, we offer a map for the confirmed positive, pending, and deceases cases, while to support mobility, we provide a geospatial visualization of $R_t$, the basic reproduction number. This document describes the structure of the dataset, the software tools employed, and a description of the functionality of the maps, which definition we make publicly available.

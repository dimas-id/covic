Abstract The gut virome is the viral component of the gut microbiome. Knowledge regarding its composition, interindividual and temporal variability is increasing, and the significance of its impact on human health, both in homeostasis and disease is being recognized. Here we review the recent advances in this field, and the questions that arise in the context of the rapidly increasing information regarding its composition and function. With the extending collection of human data, the power of next generation sequencing, and functional studies, the factors that influence the composition of the gut virome and its impact on human health will be further refined in the coming years.

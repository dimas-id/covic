Purpose To compare progression of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) before and after institution of an oxygen therapy protocol to inhibit active proliferation and progression of ROP in premature infants. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed of premature infants undergoing ROP screening before (cohort A) and after (cohort B) implementation of an oxygen therapy protocol to inhibit further progression for those with stage 2 ROP or worse. Statistical analysis with Ï‡2, Fisher's exact test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed; and logistic regression models were created to determine the odds ratio of cohort B developing ROP progression beyond stage 2, compared to cohort A, adjusting for other risk factors for ROP. Results In cohort A, without oxygen therapy protocol (2002-2007), 44% (54/122) of infants progressed beyond stage 2, compared to 23% (24/103) of infants after protocol implementation (cohort B, 2008-2012) (P = 0.001). No significant differences between cohort A and B were found for gestational age, birth weight, survival, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, oxygen at discharge, or need for diuretics. Infants with stage 2 ROP in cohort B, with oxygen therapy protocol, had significantly decreased risk of ROP beyond stage 2 (odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.67; P = 0.0013), compared to cohort A, correcting for differences in birth weight and necrotizing enterocolitis. Conclusions Progression from stage 2 to stage 3 ROP in premature infants was significantly decreased after implementation of an oxygen therapy protocol, without a corresponding increase in pulmonary morbidity. This study suggests that appropriate oxygen therapy may play a role in inhibiting progression of stage 2 ROP, potentially decreasing the risk of lifelong visual loss in this vulnerable population.

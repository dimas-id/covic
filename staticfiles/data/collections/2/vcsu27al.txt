Nitrogen is considered an essential nutrient element limiting water productivity, and its distribution in sediments directly affects its release potential. This study aimed to analyse the spatial characteristics, distribution, and influence of nitrogen forms in two different river catchments situated in eastern China. Using sequential extraction methods, the study divided sediment nitrogen into four forms, namely, an ion-exchangeable form (IEF-N), weak acid-extractable form (WAEF-N), strong alkali-extractable form (SAEF-N), and strong oxidant-extractable form (SOEF-N). The results for the two catchments showed significant differences in the physicochemical properties as well as variations in space. The mean proportion of total transferable nitrogen (TTN) in the Anhe, Suihe, Dongtiaoxi, and Xitiaoxi rivers accounted for 50.64%, 32.87%, 34.63%, and 40.45%, respectively. The results also revealed a higher total TTN in the Hongze watershed than in the Tiaoxi watershed. The order of mean TTN in sediments from the Hongze watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > IEF-N > WAEF-N, whereas that for the Tiaoxi watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > WAEF-N > IEF-N. The distribution of nitrogen forms in the sediments was significantly impacted by the sediment composition and environmental factors, as shown by correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA).

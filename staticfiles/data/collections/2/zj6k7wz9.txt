BACKGROUND: To characterize pediatric patients supported with continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP/BiPAP) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) during interfacility transport (IFT). METHODS: A retrospective study with a provincial pediatric transport team from a tertiary hospital pediatric intensive care unit. Pediatric patients aged 28 days to < 17 years, who required IFT between January 2017 and December 2018, were identified through a transport registry and were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 118 (26.7%) patients received CPAP/BIPAP or HFNC support for IFT. The most common respiratory diagnosis was bronchiolitis (46%). These patients were placed on respiratory support, 31.4 minutes after the transport teamâ€™s arrival. None required intubation during their IFT, despite mean transport times of 163 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide important information for programs with large catchment areas, in which large distances and transport times should not be barriers to NIV implementation.

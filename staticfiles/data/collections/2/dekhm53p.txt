We report a laboratory-based surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 using minipools of respiratory samples submitted for routine diagnostics. We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before the upsurge of cases in Germany. We identified one SARS-CoV-2 positive patient. Our approach proved its concept, is easily adaptable and resource-saving.

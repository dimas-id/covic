We develop fully glycosylated computational models of ACE2-Fc fusion proteins which are promising targets for a COVID-19 therapeutic. These models are tested in their interaction with fragments of the binding domain of the Spike Protein S1 of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We see that some ACE2 glycans interact with S1 and glycans are influencing the conformation of the ACE2 receptor. Additionally, we optimize algorithms for protein glycosylation modelling in order to expedite future model development. All models and algorithms are openly available.

Acute respiratory failure accounts for 25â€“40 % of ICU admissions and carries a mortality rate of 30 % or more. In this chapter, we classify acute respiratory failure in two main types, based on their primary physiologic abnormality: Disorders of the airways, where increase of airway resistance to gas flow determines pharmacologic treatment and ventilatory strategies. These disorders are mainly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disorders of the alveoli, where a decrease of lung compliance mandates the use of higher ventilatory pressures that can recruit but also damage the lung. These disorders include the acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and influenza. Additional types of acute respiratory failure are described elsewhere in this book: disorders that result from neuromuscular disease in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-19668-8_19 and pulmonary disorders of the circulation, including pulmonary thromboembolism, in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-19668-8_27. Finally, we provide a section on weaning from mechanical ventilation, which includes the pathophysiology of the ventilatory load imposed by the prolonged acute respiratory failure, the possible ways to support the weakened respiratory system, and the current process of screening and testing for readiness to remove the ventilator.

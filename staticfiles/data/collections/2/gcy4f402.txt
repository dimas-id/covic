We introduce new hybrid algorithms, DBSCAN Solver and Solution Partitioning Solver, which use quantum annealing for solving Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and its practical variant: Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Both algorithms contain important classical components, but we also present two other algorithms, Full QUBO Solver and Average Partitioning Solver, which can be run only on a quantum processing unit (without CPU) and were prototypes which helped us develop better hybrid approaches. In order to validate our methods, we run comprehensive tests using D-Waveâ€™s Leap framework on well-established benchmark test cases as well as on our own test scenarios built based on realistic road networks. We also compared our new quantum and hybrid methods with classical algorithms - well-known metaheuristics for solving VRP and CVRP. The experiments indicate that our hybrid methods give promising results and are able to find solutions of similar or even better quality than the tested classical algorithms.

Background. Opaganib is a selective sphingosine-kinase (SK)-2 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties. Methods. We provided opaganib on a compassionate-use basis to patients with severe COVID-19. Patients who required oxygen support via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) were offered the treatment. For comparison, we used a control group with same-sex, same-severity patients. Results. Seven patients received at least one dose of opaganib since April 2, 2020. One patient, who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, developed diarrhea and all his medications were stopped. This was the only adverse effect possibly related to opaganib. A second patient was weaned of oxygen and discharged after receiving two doses of opaganib. Therefore, five patients were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between cases and controls. Patients treated with opaganib had significantly faster increase in lymphocyte count. All other clinical outcomes had a non-statistically significant trend in favor of the treatment group: median time to weaning from HFNC was 10 and 15 days in cases vs. controls (HR= 0.3, 95% CI: 0.07-1.7, p=0.2) ,time to ambient air was 13 vs.14.5 days (HR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.15-1.5), none of the cases required mechanical ventilation compared with 33% of controls. Conclusion. In this small cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, opaganib was safe and well tolerated with improvement in both clinical and laboratory parameters in all treated patients. The efficacy of opaganib for COVID-19 infection should be further tested in randomized placebo-controlled trials.

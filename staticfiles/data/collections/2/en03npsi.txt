In this work, boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) were produced through chemical exfoliation of bulk boron nitride (BN). Furthermore, hydrothermal technique was used to incorporate various concentrations (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt%) of zirconium (Zr) as a dopant. The prepared undoped and doped BN samples were evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Structural analysis was undertaken using x-ray diffraction which identified the presence of hexagonal BN. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were utilized to outline IR fingerprint and electronic properties of the synthesized material. Morphological information was obtained through micrographs extracted using field emission scanning electron spectroscope (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), while d-spacing was also calculated through HRTEM analysis. Optical properties and emission spectra were examined by applying UV–vis and photoluminescence spectroscope (PL); whereas, band gap analysis was carried out via Tauc plot. Zr-doped BN nanosheets at increasing concentrations (0.5, 1.0 mg/50 μl) revealed enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli compared to S. aureus (p < 0.05).

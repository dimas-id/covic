PURPOSE The aim of the study was to offer a prospective comparative assessment of long-term outcomes for inguinal hernia repair using Valenti and Lichtenstein techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS 568 surgical procedures for unilateral inguinal hernia repair using the Valenti (group V) or the Lichtenstein technique (group L) were performed. After the mean follow-up time of 9 years (8-12), 185 patients (70.1%) treated using Valenti method and 186 patients (71.3%) treated using Lichtenstein method were clinically assessed. All clinical data were registered in National Hernia Registry. The rate of recurrence was assessed as primary outcome. The secondary outcome involved chronic pain (VAS). RESULTS 9-year recurrence rate was 2.2% in both groups. No significant difference in recurrence rate was demonstrated in analysis adjusted for surgeon's education, type of hernia, hernia size, hernia duration, or BMI between two groups (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.67; p = 1.0). In follow-up the majority of patients reported no pain (71.9% in V; 73.7% in L). A constant pain was reported by four patients in each group. Severe pain was reported by 1.6% in V and 2.1% in L (p = 0.192). CONCLUSIONS Inguinal hernia repairs using Valenti and Lichtenstein methods show high, long-term effectiveness and do not significantly differ in the recurrence rate. Both methods ensure a low rate of chronic pain. The use of a single mesh size with a precisely defined shape and of a uniform mesh fixation method ensures the standardization of surgical technique. The Valenti method is an uncomplicated, technically reproducible procedure with a low learning curve.

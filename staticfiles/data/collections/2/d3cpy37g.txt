Antibiotic resistance has become a problem since the discovery of antibiotics. Not long after the introduction of penicillin, Staphylococcus aureus, which can be also transmitted to humans via milk and milk products, began developing penicillin-resistant strains. Therefore, one approach that has been used for the discovery of new antimicrobial agents from natural sources is based on the evaluation of traditional plant extracts. Natural products have played a pivotal role in antibiotic drug innovation and include aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, macrolides, cycloserine, novobiocin, and lipoproteins. However, only a few antiviral agents are available on the market. To this purpose, we have screened a great number of herbal extracts along with some pure natural substances and obtained interesting findings. This chapter covers the results of our rigorous search for new antiviral and antimicrobial alternative compounds from a number of Turkish plants.

CONTEXT The University of Hawai'i Pacific Basin Bioterrorism Curriculum Development Project has developed a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum for teaching health professionals and health professional students about bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. These PBL cases have been incorporated into interdisciplinary training settings in community-based settings, such as in the small island districts of the U.S.-Affiliated Pacific Islands. METHODS Quantitative and qualitative methods have been utilized in the evaluation of the PBL cases, PBL tutorials, and the accomplishment of learning objectives. FINDINGS Evaluation of the PBL tutorials demonstrates that PBL is an educational and training modality appropriate for such settings. Participants found it helpful to learn in interdisciplinary groups. The educational process was modified in accordance with local culture. CONCLUSION PBL is a useful educational modality for settings where healthcare staffing and available resources are limited.

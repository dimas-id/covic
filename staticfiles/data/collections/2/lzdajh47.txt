OBJECTIVE An experience with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy using the natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) technique. BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is nowadays the only long term effective obesity treatment method. METHODS Twenty one consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with the use of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) in the Surgical Clinic of Faculty Hospital Ostrava between May 2012 and August 2012. Inclusion criteria were the body mass index (BMI) higher than 35 kg/m2 or higher than 32 kg/m2 accompanied with relevant comorbidities. RESULTS Among 21 patients in this series, there were three men (14.3%) and 18 women (85.7%). Their mean age was 40.9±10.2 years. Their mean preoperative BMI was 40.4±4.6 kg/m2. No patient had previous bariatric surgery, one patient had laparoscopic fundoplication. All operations were completed laparoscopically with no conversions to an open procedure. In two cases, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed and the gallbladder was extracted along with the gastric specimen by transgastric approach. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective bariatric procedure with low morbidity and mortality. Based on our initial experiences it could be an indication for NOSE with transgastric approach. Obese patients would benefit from this approach due to the elimination of wound complications (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 22).

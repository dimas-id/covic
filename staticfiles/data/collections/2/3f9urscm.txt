2019-nCoV is a novel coronavirus was isolated and identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. On 17th February and according to world health organization, a number of 71 429 confirmed cases worldwide, among them 2162 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours. There is no drug or vaccine for human and animal coronavirus. The inhibition of 3CL hydrolase enzyme provides a promising therapeutic principle for developing treatments against CoViD-19. The 3CLpro (Mpro) known for involving in counteracting the host innate immune response. This work presents the inhibitory effect of some natural compounds against 3CL hydrolase enzyme, and explain the main interactions in inhibitor-enzyme complex. Molecular docking study carried out using Autodock Vina. By screening several molecules, we identified three candidate agents that inhibit the main protease of coronavirus. Hispidin, lepidine E, and folic acid bound tightly in the enzyme, strong hydrogen bonds have been formed (1.69-1.80&[Aring]) with the active site residues. This study provides a possible therapeutic strategy for CoViD-19.

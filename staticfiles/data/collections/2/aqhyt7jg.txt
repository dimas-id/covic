Cryptosporidiosis was first identified as a disease of veterinary, rather than human medical, importance, and infection of farmed animals with different species of Cryptosporidium continues to be of veterinary clinical concern. This chapter provides insights into Cryptosporidium infection in a range of farmed animals – cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, cervids, camelids, rabbits, water buffalo and poultry – presenting not only an updated overview of the infection in these animals, but also information on clinical disease, infection dynamics and zoonotic potential. Although extensive data have been accrued on, for example, Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves, and calf cryptosporidiosis continues to be a major veterinary concern especially in temperate regions, there remains a paucity of data for other farmed animals, despite Cryptosporidium infection causing significant clinical disease and also, for some species, with the potential for transmission of infection to people, either directly or indirectly.

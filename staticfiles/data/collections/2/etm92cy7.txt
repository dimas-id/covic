Abstract Viruses are the leading causes of acute lower respiratory-tract infection in infancy. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen in severe disease, with hMPV, PIV-3, influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses accounting for the majority of the remainder of acute viral respiratory infections. Humans generally do not develop lifelong immunity to reinfection with these viruses; rather, specific immunity protects against severe and lower respiratory-tract disease.

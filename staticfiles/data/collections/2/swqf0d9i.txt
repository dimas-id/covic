BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has been established as one of the most effective treatments for morbid obesity. Surgical site infections are the most common complication after LRYGB surgery. OBJECTIVE To compare the superficial surgical site infections (sSSI) rate before and after the implementation of our intraoperative technique. SETTING Academic medical center. METHODS Our intraoperative technique relies on sterile coverage of the circular stapler, sterile specimen-bag retrieval of the gastrojejunostomy enteric remnant, and port site Penrose drainage. We analyzed our sSSI outcomes before and after implementation of our technique in all LRYGBs performed by a single surgeon from 2009 to 2015. We took into account patient age; sex; baseline body mass index (BMI); smoking status; and co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Ï‡(2) and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS We performed 486 LRYGBs in 2009-2015. The cohort before implementation of our technique (group 1) included 164 patients (33.7%) and the cohort after implementation (group 2) included 322 patients (66.3%). Both groups were similar in age, sex, smoking status, and rates of diabetes and hyperlipidemia but differed in BMI, operative time, and prevalence of hypertension. Hypertension was not a confounder for sSSI (P = .35). The sSSI rate was 9.15% for group 1 and 3.42% for group 2 (P = .0079). Controlling for BMI and operative time, multivariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in sSSI (odds ratio 2.98 [95% CI 1.33-6.69]) with our technique. CONCLUSIONS We describe a reproducible intraoperative technique that significantly reduces sSSI in LRYGB procedures. Our technique has the potential of hastening postoperative recovery.

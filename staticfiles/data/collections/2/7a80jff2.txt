Abstract In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, US hospitals stopped performing elective procedures. This led to cancellation of a large number of hip and knee arthroplasty cases. We aimed to assess the effect this had on our elective primary arthroplasty patients by distributing a specifically designed survey to patients across six institutions identified through the AAHKS Research Committee. Surveys were completed by 360 patients over the course of one week. Patients were most anxious about the uncertainty of when their operation could be rescheduled. Although 85% of patients understood and agreed with the cancellation of elective surgeries as part of public health measures to curb the spread of pandemic, almost 90% of patients plan to reschedule as soon as possible. Financial concerns were minimal in this cohort. Patients suffering from pain of hip and knee arthritis continue to struggle with their end-stage disease and despite anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic, plan to undergo arthroplasty as soon as possible.

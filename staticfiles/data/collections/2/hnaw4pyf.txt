As concerns increase about adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) being a safe gene transfer vector, it is important to evaluate its distribution, residence time, and possible toxicity in immunodeficient populations. To characterize the potential risk associated with different Ad5 vector delivery modes, we used immunocompetent and immunodeficient Rag2 (−/−) animals to establish mouse and rat models that could be monitored with bioluminescent imaging following intramuscular or intravascular infection with an engineered replication-incompetent Ad5 virus carrying the firefly luciferase gene (Ad5-Fluc). The Ad5 vector was less well-tolerated by Rag2 (−/−) animals than by wildtype ones, with delayed residence time, wider virus dissemination, less weight gain, and relatively severe pathological changes. In intravascularly Ad5-Fluc-infected Rag2 (−/−) mice, systemic virus dissemination extended from the abdomen to the limbs and head on day 9 post-infection. Additionally, significant increases in plasma TNF-α and IFN-γ, which may be important factors in the heightened immunopathology in the liver and brain, were detected in the Rag2 (−/−) mice 30 days after intravascular delivery. The Ad5 vector was better tolerated after intramuscular delivery than after intravascular delivery. Ad5-Fluc/Rag2 (−/−) mice and rats can be used as reliable models of an immunodeficient population in which to evaluate the safety of Ad5-vectored vaccines or gene therapy products.

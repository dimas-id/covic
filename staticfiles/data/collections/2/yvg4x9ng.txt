BACKGROUND Recent developments in minimal invasive surgery have led to laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS). This new approach has great potential but remains technically challenging. In order to relieve these difficulties many authors have adapted robotic technology to single site surgery. Numerous approaches have been developed and there is no real consensus. METHODS A transdisiplinary systematic review of the literature and analysis of the techniques were performed using PubMed up to 31 December 2011. RESULTS A total of 41 publications were found and included. Seven used the da Vinci Single Site Instrumentation (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) whereas others used various access devices including: GelPort/GelPOINT (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) and a glove technique. CONCLUSIONS The technical feasibility of robotic LESS is established for numerous and various procedures. However, each kind of procedure requires a customized selection from among the da Vinci new platform, glove technique or GelPort/GelPOINT as well as instrument crossing with respect to minimal distances.

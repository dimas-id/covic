With the advancement of laparoscopic devices and surgical technology, the era of minimal invasive surgery has progressed to reduced-port surgery, and finally to single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). Several reports show successful application of SILS to various types of bariatric surgery. Oftentimes, this requires a skilled and experienced scopist to perform the procedure. To overcome the technical difficulties of single-incision Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a manual scope holder was used instead of an assistant scopist, greatly stabilizing the field of view. This allows the surgery to be performed at any time without being influenced by the need of a highly experienced scopist. In this report, we describe in detail the world's first solo single-incision laparoscopic resectional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

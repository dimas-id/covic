NOD2 is an intracellular receptor for the bacterial cell wall component muramyl dipeptide. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat region of NOD2, which lead to an impaired recognition of muramyl dipeptide, have been associated with chronic inflammatory diseases of barrier organs such as Crohn disease, asthma and atopic eczema. In this study we identify CD147 (also known as BSG and EMMPRIN), a membrane-bound regulator of cellular migration, differentiation and inflammatory processes, as a protein interaction partner of NOD2. We demonstrate a complex influence of the CD147-NOD2 interaction on NOD2-dependent signaling responses. We show that CD147 itself acts as an enhancer of the invasion of Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular bacterial pathogen. We propose that the CD147-NOD2 interaction serves as a molecular guide to regulate NOD2 function at sites of pathogen invasion.

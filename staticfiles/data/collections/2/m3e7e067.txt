Organizations are operating within dynamic environments that present changes, opportunities and threats to which they need to respond by adapting their capabilities. Organizational capabilities can be supported by Information Systems during their design and run-time phases, which often requires the capabilitiesâ€™ adaptation. Currently, enterprise modeling and capability modeling facilitate the design and analysis of capabilities but improvements regarding capability change can be made. This design science research study introduces a capability change meta-model that will serve as the basis for the development of a method and a supporting tool for capability change. The meta-model is applied to a case study at a Swedish public healthcare organization. This application provides insight on possible opportunities to improve the meta-model in future iterations.

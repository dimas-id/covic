Various models have been recently proposed to reflect and predict different properties of complex networks. However, the community structure, which is one of the most important properties, is not well studied and modeled. In this paper, we suggest a principle called"preferential placement", which allows to model a realistic community structure. We provide an extensive empirical analysis of the obtained structure as well as some theoretical results.

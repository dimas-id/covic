The MinION was used to evaluate upper respiratory disease infections using both whole genome amplification (WGA), targeted sequencing, and was found to have tremendous potential for field use. The MinION nanopore sequencer was been released to community testers for evaluation using a variety of sequencing applications. The MinION was used to evaluate upper respiratory disease infections using both whole genome amplification and targeted sequencing, and was found to have tremendous potential for field use. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION nanopore sequencer to accurately identify and differentiate clinical bacterial and viral samples via targeted sequencing and whole genome sequencing. The current nanopore technology has limitations with respect to error rate but has steadily improved with development of new flow cells and kits. Upper respiratory disease organisms were successfully identified and differentiated down to the strain level with 87-98% alignment to our reference genome database. The ability to differentiate strains by amplicon and whole genome sequencing on the MinION was accomplished despite the observed average per 100-base error rate averaged 1.2E-01. This study offers evidence of the utility of sequencing to identify and differentiate both viral and bacterial species present within clinical samples.

Unique challenges posed by complex public health emergencies have often called for institutions, responsible for restoring health, well-being, and order among affected populations, to realign their operating procedures and work in concordance with each other. To ensure optimal health, the growth of the individuals and societies, and development in a greater sense, it is essential to understand the scope of collaboration between law enforcement agencies and public health institutions during emergencies and their aftermath. To foster such partnerships, policy-level advocacy to overcome challenges posed by existing policies and legislation that limit the autonomy of the law enforcement and public health institutions for making informed decisions would be necessary. Human resources working at different levels should be sensitized about the nature and significance of the kind of collaboration, and they should be allowed to express and clarify their doubts about the same. Evidence-based standard operating procedures should be developed for different cadres of professionals, keeping harmony with the operational diversities. Critical issues such as financing the ventures, coordinating and implementing the protocols and projects, following up the cases and suspects, and examining every scenario using evidence-based scientific and legal methodologies would be crucial for the success of such collaborations.

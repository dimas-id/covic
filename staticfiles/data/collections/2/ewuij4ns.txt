Continuing medical education (CME) is an obligation in France. The evaluation of professional practices joined in 2004 the obligation to acquire knowledge, becoming the Continuing professional development (CPD) in 2009. Currently, the system is complete: definition, organization and validation. However, the individual obligation to validate the CPD has never been applied. The recertification process provided for by the 2019 law will not be operational until 2021, at the earliest. Its essential pillar is CPD. The recertification mission who prepared the law excludes all knowledge verification tests. Recertification is done by promoting the professional career path including, in addition to CPD, a maintained and regular activity, an improvement in the relationship with the patient, taking into account the doctor's health and the absence of undesirable events. Seeing that the French Medical Council oversees the professional skills of physicians, it is the Council that receives the validation of the CPD and will receive that of recertification.

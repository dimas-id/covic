BACKGROUND: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is associated with marginal decrease in chronic lung disease (CLD). This study aims to report outcomes, with focus on CLD, of preterm infants managed with a bubble CPAP (b-CPAP) bundle of care. METHODS: Infants <1500 g were stratified into four groups depending on intubation status through first 3 days of life. The incidence of mortality, CLD and other morbidities were compared over four chronological epochs. Outcomes of the most recent epoch were compared to contemporaneous benchmarks from Vermont Oxford Network (VON). RESULTS: Of 773 infants (median GA = 28 weeks, average BW = 995 g), 24.5% were intubated in DR and 11.7% in the first day of life. Mechanical ventilation, bCPAP and oxygen days in survivors were 1.5, 29 and 14, respectively. Overall incidence of CLD was 6.4% that remained consistent in the four epochs (7.6%, 7.5%, 5.8% and 5%), respectively. In comparison to VON, CLD was significantly less (p < 0.001). Initial DR intubation was not associated with increased CLD compared to initial management with CPAP that required subsequent intubation. CONCLUSION: It is feasible and sustainable to administer a b-CPAP bundle of care to decrease CLD. Cluster randomized trials are needed to validate the reproducibility of this approach.

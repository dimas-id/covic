INTRODUCTION Marginal ulcer perforation is a known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and laparoscopic repair may be a feasible option minimizing the morbidity associated with a large laparotomy incision. We present our experience with laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcers in patients who have previously undergone RYGB. METHODS A retrospective chart review from August 2005 to April 2007 was performed identifying all patients who underwent laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcer after RYGB at one hospital. The perforation was repaired either by laparoscopic primary suture closure followed by application of an omental patch or by laparoscopic Graham patch without primary suture repair. Operative time, duration of hospitalization, postoperative follow-up, and postoperative complications were recorded. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS Six patients underwent laparoscopic repair of a perforated marginal ulcer. Operative time was 101.8 ± 50 minutes with a mean hospitalization of 5.3 ± 2.7 days. Follow-up was 6.2 ± 7.5 months. Postoperative complications included 2 patients with nausea and vomiting related to an exposed suture at the gastrojejunostomy, 1 patient with chronic gastritis, and 1 patient developed a stricture at the gastrojejunostomy. CONCLUSIONS We present the largest series to date of laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcers utilizing an omental patch for repair. We demonstrate that a laparoscopic repair can be completed in a reasonable operative time, with minimal postoperative hospitalization, and low associated morbidity. Patients who develop a perforated marginal ulcer after RYGB can be safely and effectively treated with laparoscopic repair with an omental patch.

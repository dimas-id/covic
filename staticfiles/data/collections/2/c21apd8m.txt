The news was reported from the Wuhan region of China about a novel corona virus in the end of 2019. After spreading around the world, a pandemic was declared by the WHO. Depending on the different involvement of the disease, the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, some indeterminate symptoms that make diagnosis difficult, such as myalgia and fatigue, can also be seen alone, without the typical clinical picture. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, the only complaint of which is myalgia, and the first diagnosis is mild rhabdomyolysis. The patient had no evidence or history other than viral infection that could explain muscle pain and also increased level of muscle enzymes. When mild rhabdomyolysis lack of myoglobinuria and complications was diagnosed, treatment-related rhabdomyolysis was also avoided as no treatment related to COVID-19 was initiated yet. Apart from the typical symptoms leading to the typical diagnosis of COVID-19 at the first admission, SARS-CoV-2 related with rhabdomyolysis should also be kept in mind.

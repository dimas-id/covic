An apparent wasting syndrome was observed in newly arriving 3 to 4 week old guinea pigs characterized by anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, perineal staining and death. Diagnostic efforts to attribute the disease to husbandry, environmental factors or to known guinea pig pathogens were unsuccessful. Clinical signs, enteric histopathological lesions and diagnostic transmission electron microscopy identification of typical coronavirus-like virions in fecal samples were consistent with enteric coronaviral diseases seen in other species.

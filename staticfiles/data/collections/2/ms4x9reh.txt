It is well known that in a given cell, at a particular time, only a fraction of the entire genome is expressed. Expression of a gene, nuclear, or organellar starts with the onset of transcription and ends in the synthesis of the functional protein. The regulation of gene expression is a complex process that requires the coordinated activity of different proteins and nucleic acids that ultimately determine whether a gene is transcribed, and if transcribed, whether it results in the production of a protein that develops a phenotype. The same also holds true for transgenic crops, which lie at the very core of insert design. There are multiple checkpoints at which the expression of a gene can be regulated and controlled. Much of the emphasis of studies related to gene expression has been on regulation of gene transcription, and a number of methods are used to effect the control of gene expression. Controlling transgene expression for a commercially valuable trait is necessary to capture its value. Many gene functions are either lethal or produce severe deformity (resulting in loss of value) if over-expressed. Thus, expression of a transgene at a particular site or in response to a particular elicitor is always desirable.

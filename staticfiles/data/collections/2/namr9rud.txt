Reproductive surgery employs microsurgical techniques to achieve preservation of natural fertility and enhancement of assisted reproductive technologies. The minimalist approach of this branch of gynecology has made it the natural trailblazer of laparoscopic surgery. Minimally invasive conservative treatment of uterine, tubal, ovarian, and peritoneal pathology has long been the gold standard for women of reproductive age. Advanced laparoscopic surgery provides clear advantages over classic microsurgery, at the cost of significant technical challenges. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery is now posed to bridge this technical gap and promises to be the next revolution in the field of reproductive surgery.

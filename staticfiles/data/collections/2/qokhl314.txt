The sialic acid-based molecular mimicry in pathogens and malignant cells is a regulatory mechanism that leads to cross-reactivity with host antigens resulting in suppression and tolerance in the immune system. The interplay between sialoglycans and immunoregulatory Siglec receptors promotes foreign antigens hiding and immunosurveillance impairment. Therefore, molecular targeting of immune checkpoints, including sialic acid-Siglec axis, is a promising new field of inflammatory disorders and cancer therapy. However, the conventional drugs used in regular management can interfere with glycome machinery and exert a divergent effect on immune controlling systems. Here, we focus on the known effects of standard therapies on the sialoglycan-Siglec checkpoint and their importance in diagnosis, prediction, and clinical outcomes.

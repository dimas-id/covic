The use of e-health services has for many years gradually increased in Norway as in most European countries. Searching for information about health and illness has previously by far been the most popular service. In this study, we review the literature with the aim of examining any changes in e-health use during the Covid-19 pandemic. We find that there has been a marked change in Norway, with an extreme increase in video consultations, especially in primary care and in the mental health field. The government has also released an app for tracking the illness, which so far has been downloaded by approximately 1/4 of the population. These changes are likely to impact the use of e-health also after the pandemic.

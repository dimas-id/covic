BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to delineate the learning curve of single-port laparoscopic appendectomy for noncomplicated appendicitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic appendectomy between July 2009 and June 2010 were compared retrospectively with 30 prior consecutive patients who underwent surgery in the three-port manner. Operative duration, number of conversions, time to resumption of oral intake, length of hospital stay, and complications were used as the indicators of the learning curve. RESULTS Demographics were similar between the single-port and three-port groups. A significant decrease in operative duration was noted after a surgical experience of 10 patients. An operative duration equivalent to that of the conventional three-port method could be achieved after 30 cases. CONCLUSIONS Single-port laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe and feasible procedure. The learning curve could be overcome safely without major complications. Our preliminary analysis showed that 30 cases are sufficient to achieve an equivalent operative duration compared with conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy.

COVID 19 is disease caused by novel corona virus, SARS-CoV2 originated in China most probably of Bat origin. Till date, no specific vaccine or drug has been discovered to tackle the infections caused by SARS-CoV2. In response to this pandemic, we utilized bioinformatics knowledge to develop efficient vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV2. Designed vaccine was rich in effective BCR and TCR epitopes screened from the sequence of S-protein of SARS-CoV2. Predicted BCR and TCR epitopes were antigenic in nature non-toxic and probably non-allergen. Modelled and refined tertiary structure was predicted as valid for further use. Protein-Protein interaction prediction of TLR2/4 and designed vaccine indicates promising binding. Designed multiepitope vaccine has induced cell mediated and humoral immunity along with increased interferon gamma response. Macrophages and dendritic cells were also found increased over the vaccine exposure. In silico codon optimization and cloning in expression vector indicates that vaccine can be efficiently expressed in E. coli. In conclusion, predicted vaccine is a good antigen, probable no allergen and has potential to induce cellular and humoral immunity.

In December 2019, following a cluster of pneumonia cases in China caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infection disseminated worldwide and, on March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the pandemic of the relevant disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In Europe, Italy was the first country facing a true health policy emergency, and, as at 6.00 p.m. on May 2nd, 2020, there have been more than 209,300 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Due to the increasing number of patients experiencing a severe outcome, global scientific efforts are ongoing to find the most appropriate treatment. The usefulness of specific anti-rheumatic drugs came out as a promising treatment option together with antiviral drugs, anticoagulants, and symptomatic and respiratory support. For this reason, we feel a duty to share our experience and our knowledge on the use of these drugs in the immune-rheumatologic field, providing in this review the rationale for their use in the COVID-19 pandemic.

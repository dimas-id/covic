The retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients suffering from COVID-19 has indicated that statin therapy, used to lower plasma cholesterol levels, is associated with a better clinical outcome. We therefore investigated the effect of statins on SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that selective statins reduced SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and inhibited high and low pathogenic coronavirus infection in human cells. A retrospective study on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 implies that reduced high density lipoprotein levels, which are typically counteracted by statin therapy, are associated with aggravated disease outcome. These results suggest that statin therapy poses no additional risk to individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and that some statins may have a mild beneficial effect on COVID-19 outcome.

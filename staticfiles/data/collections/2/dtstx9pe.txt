The origin and distribution of hexavalent chromium, Cr (VI) over four seasonal cycles was investigated through a conceptual model that included three aquifer systems in Cyprus. An extensive water sampling grid covered two sea water intruded coastal aquifers, namely the Kokkinochoria (A1) and Kiti-Pervolia (A2) aquifers and the Troodos massif (A3). Analytical results give a first insight to the presence of Cr (VI) in Cyprus ground and surface waters. The highest Cr (VI) value of 26 μg L-1 is observed in the Troodos area (A3) where Cr(VI) is detected in all sampled water systems (surface and ground/spring). Nonetheless, the highest median values of 4.6 and 4.5 μg L-1 are observed in the Kokkinochoria (A1) and Kiti-Pervolia (A2) study areas respectively, where the local aquifers are under increased pressure from agriculture, urbanization and seawater intrusion. Stable isotopes were used to discern the effect of return irrigation and seawater intrusion. Stable isotope analyses from Troodos samples show two distinct groups of meteoric and near meteoric waters whereas isotopically enriched water is shown to correspond to the Kiti and Kokkinochoria area.

In cases of severe cardiopulmonary deterioration, quick establishment of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) represents a support modality. After successful arterial peripheral cannulation, a certain grade of peripheral limb malperfusion is a fairly common phenomenon. Detection of peripheral malperfusion is vital, since it can result in compartment syndrome or even loss of the affected limb. To prevent or resolve emerging lower limb ischaemia, a newly designed perfusion catheter is placed into the superficial femoral artery, distal to the arterial cannula via ECMO. The aim of our study was to evaluate flow and haemodynamic characteristics of this novel distal limb perfusion cannula for ECMO therapy and present these important findings for the first time. The distal perfusion cannula blood flow increases in linear correlation with ECMO blood flow The variability of distal perfusion cannula blood flow with a 15 Fr cannula ranges between 160 ± 0.40 mL min-1 at 1.5 L min-1 ECMO flow rate and 480 ± 80 mL min-1 at 5.0 L min-1 ECMO blood flow, respectively. Comparatively, the 17-Fr-sized cannula performs on a scale of 140 ± 20 to 390 ± 60 mL distal perfusion cannula blood flow at 1.5-5.0 L min-1 ECMO blood flow, respectively. The quantitative assessment of the distal perfusion cannula blood flow has revealed that distal perfusion cannula blood flow can measure up to 10% of the ECMO blood flow. Furthermore, it has been also well demonstrated that the novel distal perfusion cannula is sufficient to compensate peripheral limb ischaemia.

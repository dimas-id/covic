Following acute ischemic stroke, isolated subcortical lesions induce gray matter atrophy in anatomically connected, yet distant cortical brain regions. We expand on previous studies by analyzing cortical thinning in contralesional, homologous regions indirectly linked to primary stroke lesions via ipsilesional cortical areas. For this purpose, stroke patients were serially studied by magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion tensor imaging and high-resolution anatomical imaging) in the acute (days 3-5) and late chronic stage one year after stroke. We analyzed changes of gray and white matter integrity in 18 stroke patients (median age 68 years) with subcortical stroke. We applied probabilistic fiber tractography to identify brain regions connected to stroke lesions and contralesional homologous areas. Cortical thickness was quantified by semi-automatic measurements, and fractional anisotropy was analyzed. One year after stroke, significant decrease of cortical thickness was detected in areas connected to ischemic lesions (mean -0.15 mm; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.07 mm) as well as homologous contralateral brain regions (mean -0.13 mm; 95% CI -0.07 to -0.19 mm). We detected reduced white matter integrity of inter- and intrahemispheric fiber tracts. There were no significant associations with clinical recovery. Our results indicate that impact of subcortical lesions extends to homologous brain areas via transcallosal diaschisis.

Introduction. Several studies have shown the feasibility and safety of both transperitoneal and posterior retroperitoneal approaches for single incision laparoscopic adrenalectomy, but none have compared the outcomes according to the left- or right-sided location of the adrenal glands. Materials and Methods. From 2009 to 2013, 89 patients who received LAMP (laparoscopic adrenalectomy through mono port) were analyzed. The surgical outcomes attained using the transperitoneal approach (TPA) and posterior retroperitoneal approach (PRA) were analyzed and compared. Results and Discussion. On the right side, no significant differences were found between the LAMP-TPA and LAMP-PRA groups in terms of patient characteristics and clinicopathological data. However, outcomes differed in which LAMP-PRA group had a statistically significant shorter mean operative time (84.13 ± 41.47 min versus 116.84 ± 33.17 min; P = 0.038), time of first oral intake (1.00 ± 0.00 days versus 1.21 ± 0.42 days; P = 0.042), and length of hospitalization (2.17 ± 0.389 days versus 3.68 ± 1.38 days; P ≤ 0.001), whereas in left-sided adrenalectomies LAMP-TPA had a statistically significant shorter mean operative time (83.85 ± 27.72 min versus 110.95 ± 29.31 min; P = 0.002). Conclusions. We report that LAMP-PRA is more appropriate for right-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomies due to anatomical characteristics and better surgical outcomes. For left-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomies, however, we propose LAMP-TPA as a more suitable method.

A 59-year old incarcerated woman who was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in 2016 was brought in for evaluation of the breast cancer. Upon evaluation of the CT chest for breast cancer restaging, diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities and a reverse halo sign in the right lower lobe concerning for atypical viral pneumonia were discovered. The patient was afebrile, had an oxygen saturation of 100%, and denied chest pain as well as shortness of breath. On physical exam, she exhibited decreased breath sounds bilaterally and expiratory wheezing. She later received a COVID-19 test, which came back positive. Infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19) may remain asymptomatic in the initial phase, leading to under-recognition and incidental detection on procedures for standard clinical indications. Hospitals, in particular nuclear medicine services, should prepare accordingly in regard to health precautions while keeping in mind the potential discrepancies between clinical presentation and resultant radiologic patterns. This awareness should be heightened in patients at higher risk (i.e. prisoners). Furthermore, by acting upon the incidental detection of this virus during its early stages, subsequent steps could help prevent the spread of the virus.

Tracheobronchitis can be broadly defined as inflammation of the airways between the larynx and the bronchioles. Clinically, this syndrome is recognized by an increase in the volume and purulence of the lower respiratory tract secretions and is frequently associated with signs of variable airflow obstruction. In the intensive care unit (ICU), tracheobronchitis is a relatively common problem with an incidence as high as 10.6% [1]. Although tracheobronchitis is associated with a significantly longer length of ICU stay and a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, it has not been shown to increase mortality. These outcomes can be improved through the use of antimicrobial agents [1].

PURPOSE OF REVIEW In advanced cardiogenic shock, early mechanical circulatory support may prevent multiorgan failure and death. In this article, we are describing our experience with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) application. RECENT FINDINGS Venoarterial ECMO has been used successfully as a therapeutic option for patients with advanced cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. SUMMARY In this review, based on the daily routine of the Hershey group using ECMO for therapy of advanced cardiogenic shock, the application of ECMO is described. The aim is to share our hands-on experience during emergent implantation and to contribute to the knowledge within the field of mechanical circulatory support.

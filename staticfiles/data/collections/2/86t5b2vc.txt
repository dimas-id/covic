Abstract Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new coronavirus that emerged in 2012, causes severe and fatal acute respiratory illness in man. Its high mortality (roughly 38%) has raised public fear worldwide, calling for the development of effective and safe therapeutics to combat MERS-CoV infection. On the basis of our previous work in development of peptide fusion inhibitors against HIV and SARS-CoV, and the crystal structure of the six-helix-bundle core of the MERS-CoV spike protein, we identified a peptide derived from the MERS-CoV S protein S2 subunit HR2 domain (HR2P) with a potent inhibitory activity against S-protein-mediated cell–cell fusion. Here, we tested an HR2P analogue with improved pharmaceutical properties, HR2P-M2, for its inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo (appendix). Methods We assessed the anti-MERS-CoV activities of HR2P-M2 in vitro with pseudotyped MERS-CoVs in cell culture and in vivo with live MERS-CoVs in hDPP4-transgenic mice. The activities of HR2P-M2 to form six-helix bundles with HR1 peptides and to block fusion core formation between HR1 and HR2 peptides were studied using methods such as circular dichroism, N-PAGE, and FN-PAGE. Findings HR2P-M2 was highly effective in blockade of cell–cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S proteins and inhibition of infection by MERS pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region, with IC50 (the concentration causing 50% inhibition) less than 0·7 μM. HR2P-M2 bound to the HR1 peptide to form stable six-helix bundles and blocked fusion core formation between the HR1 and HR2 peptides. Intranasal administration of HR2P-M2 before viral challenge fully protected hDPP4-transgenic mice (n=5) from MERS-CoV infection, whereas all the untreated mice (n=5) died 8 days after viral challenge. Interpretation Our findings suggest that the HR2P-M2 peptide merits further development as an effective and safe anti-MERS-CoV drug, alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs, to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients and to prevent the disease in high-risk populations, including health-care workers and family members of patients.

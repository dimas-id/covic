Objective To evaluate possible severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection associated risk factors in a SARS affected hospital in Beijing by means of a case control study. Methods Fifty‐one infected and 426 uninfected staff members were asked about risk behaviours and protective measures when attending to SARS patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the major risk and protective factors. Results Multivariate analysis confirmed the strong role of performing chest compression (or intubation, which is highly correlated), contact with respiratory secretion, and emergency care experience as risk factors to acquire SARS infection. For the studied protective measures, wearing 16‐layer cotton surgical mask, wearing 12‐layer cotton surgical mask, wearing multiple layers of mask, taking prophylactic medicine, taking training and nose washing turned out to be protective against infection. Conclusions This study highlighted activities associated with increased and decreased risk for SARS infection during close contact with SARS patients. These findings may help to guide recommendations for the protection of high‐risk occupational groups.

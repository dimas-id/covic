Background/aim Regional anesthesia for surgery is associated with increased anxiety for patients. This study aimed to compare the effect of propofol and dexmedetomidine infusion on perioperative anxiety during regional anesthesia. Materials and methods Eighty-four patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving either study drug infusion. Anxiety score, level of sedation using the Bispectral Index and Observer’s Assessment of Alertness and Sedation, hemodynamic stability, and overall patient’s feedback on anxiolysis were assessed. Results Both groups showed a significant drop in mean anxiety score at 10 and 30 min after starting surgery. Difference in median anxiety scores showed a significant reduction in anxiety score at the end of the surgery in the dexmedetomidine group compared to the propofol group. Dexmedetomidine and propofol showed a significant drop in mean arterial pressure in the first 30 min and first 10 min respectively. Both drugs demonstrated a significant drop in heart rate in the first 20 min from baseline after starting the drug infusion. Patients in the dexmedetomidine group (76.20%) expressed statistically excellent feedback on anxiolysis compared to patients in the propofol group (45.20%). Conclusion Dexmedetomidine infusion was found to significantly reduce anxiety levels at the end of surgery compared to propofol during regional anesthesia.

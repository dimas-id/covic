We present METATRYP version-2 software that identifies shared peptides across organisms within environmental metaproteomics studies to enable accurate taxonomic attribution of peptides during protein inference. Improvements include: ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the Least Common Ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine database confirms low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed for ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic. A Coronavirus-focused METATRYP database identified potential SARS-CoV-2 peptide biomarkers and indicated very few shared tryptic peptides between SARS-CoV-2 and other disparate taxa, sharing 0.1% peptides or less (1 peptide) with the Influenza A & B pan-proteomes, establishing that taxonomic specificity is achievable using tryptic peptide-based proteomic diagnostic approaches. Statement of significance When assigning taxonomic attribution in bottom-up metaproteomics, the potential for shared tryptic peptides among organisms in mixed communities should be considered. The software program METATRYP v 2 and associated interactive web portals enables users to identify the frequency of shared tryptic peptides among taxonomic groups and evaluate the occurrence of specific tryptic peptides within complex communities. METATRYP facilitates phyloproteomic studies of taxonomic groups and supports the identification and evaluation of potential metaproteomic biomarkers.

To date, there is no licensed treatment or approved vaccine to combat the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the number of new cases and mortality multiplies every day. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective treatment strategy to control the virus spread and prevent the disease. Here, we summarized the therapeutic approaches that are used to treat this infection. Although it seems that antiviral drugs are effective in improving clinical manifestation, there is no definite treatment protocol. Lymphocytopenia, excessive inflammation, and cytokine storm followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome are still unsolved issues causing the severity of this disease. Therefore, immune response modulation and inflammation management can be considered as an essential step. There is no doubt that more studies are required to clarify immunopathogenesis and immune response; however, new therapeutic approaches including mesenchymal stromal cell and immune cell therapy showed inspiring results.

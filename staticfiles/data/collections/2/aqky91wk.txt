BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China spread worldwide, resulting in a large number of deaths. METHODS: Temporary Ark hospitals (TAH) have played an important role in controlling the spread of the epidemic in the city of Wuhan. Taking one TAH with 800 beds as an example, we summarized details of the layout, setting, working mode of medical staffs, patient management, admission standards, discharge standards, and standards for transferring to another hospital, hospital operation, and so on. RESULTS: Over the period of operation, a total of 1,124 patients were admitted for treatment. Of these, 833 patients were cured and discharged from the hospital and 291 patients were transferred to other designated hospitals owing to aggravation of their condition. The achievement is to have zero infection for medical staff, zero in‐hospital deaths among admitted patients, and zero readmission for discharged patients. CONCLUSION: The rapid deployment of TAH provided a suitable place for treating mild/moderate or no asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients and successfully helped to control the infection in Wuhan. The successful model of TAH would rapidly and effectively control the spread of COVID‐19 in other cities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

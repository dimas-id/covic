Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the most rapidly increasing gastrointestinal cancer. Barrett's esophagus has been identified as a precancerous condition and major risk factor for esophageal cancer. Radiofrequency ablation has been shown to be a highly efficient in promoting remission of intestinal metaplasia. This technology has seen widespread clinical use since 2005. Radiofrequency ablation is common with all other ablative techniques; the concern that sound oncological principles are not being adhered to, that is, appropriate pathological staging, followed by appropriate definitive therapy. Endoscopic mucosal excision techniques are technically demanding; however, they are more attractive from an oncological perspective. Future research endeavors focusing on facilitation of large population screening, the identification of high risk phenotypes, endoscopic mucosal resection techniques will combat the esophageal adenocarcinoma epidemic.

The solution and a portable implementation of the inverse kinematics computation of a 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator using Gröbner bases are presented. The main system was written Python with computer algebra system SymPy. Gröbner bases are computed with computer algebra system Risa/Asir, called from Python via OpenXM infrastructure for communicating mathematical software systems. For solving a system of algebraic equations, several solvers (both symbolic and numerical) are used from Python, and their performance has been compared. Experimental results with different solvers for solving a system of algebraic equations are shown.

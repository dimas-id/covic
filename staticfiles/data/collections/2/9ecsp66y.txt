Accommodating large increases in sample workloads has presented one of the biggest challenges to clinical laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the implementation of new automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the 24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.

Case summary A 14-year-old male neutered Maine Coon cat presented with a 6-month history of polyphagia and one recent episode of tremors and weakness. Blood work revealed profound hypoglycemia and results of a paired insulin glucose test were consistent with an insulinoma. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a solitary pancreatic mass, and results of a fine-needle aspirate (FNA) gave further support for the location of the neuroendocrine tumor. After unsuccessful medical management of the hypoglycemia, the mass was surgically removed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that it was an insulinoma. At the time of writing, the patient had been in clinical remission for 9 months. Relevance and novel information Feline insulinomas are rare and there is very little information on their behavior, clinical course and histologic characteristics. This is the first reported case of an insulinoma in a Maine Coon cat and the first to describe results of an ultrasound-guided FNA of the mass. In addition, the progression of disease, histopathology and immunohistochemistry results add to the currently minimal database for feline insulinomas.

Total elbow arthroplasty is a common surgical procedure used in the management of advanced rheumatoid arthritis, posttraumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, and unfixable fracture in elderly patients. Total elbow prostheses have evolved over the years and now include the linked, unlinked, and convertible types. However, long-term complications, including infection, aseptic loosening, instability, and periprosthetic fracture, remain a challenge. Here, we introduce each type of implant and evaluate clinical outcomes and complications by reviewing the previous literature.

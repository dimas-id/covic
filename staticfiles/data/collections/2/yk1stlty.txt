Acute promyelocytic leukaemia and COVID-19 are two conditions associated with severe coagulopathy. We present here the multiple haemostasis abnormalities observed in a patient with concomitant acute promyelocytic leukaemia and COVID-19. The clinical consequences were dramatic and led to the death of the patient. A 62-year old woman was admitted on April 13, 2020 for unexplained asthenia, dyspnoea, and uncontrolled epistaxis. Clinical examination revealed pallor, left periorbital ecchymosis due to a recent fall, intrabuccal haemorrhagic bullae, persistent epistaxis, and mild splenomegaly. Oxygen saturation was 96%. Chest computed tomography (CT) was consistent with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (9 points on a 0-25 scale)(Pan, et al 2020). The qRT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV2.

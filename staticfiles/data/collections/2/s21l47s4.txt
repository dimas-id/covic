BACKGROUND A number of technical improvements regarding the pancreatic anastomosis have decreased the morbidity and mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains is the most feared complication, and the ideal technique for pancreatic reconstruction is undetermined. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study is a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database. Data were collected from all consecutive robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomies (RAPD), performed by a single surgeon, at the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System, between September 2007 and January 2016. RESULTS A total of 28 consecutive patients (16 male and 12 female) who underwent a RAPD were included in this study. Patients had a mean age and mean BMI of 61.5 years (SD = 12.3) and 27 kg/m2 (SD = 4.9), respectively. The mean operative time was 468.2 min (SD = 73.7) and the average estimated blood loss was 216.1 ml (SD = 113.1). The mean length of hospitalization was 13.1 days (SD = 5.4). There was no clinically significant POPF registered. CONCLUSION Trans-gastric pancreaticogastrostomy (TPG) represents a valid and feasible option as a pancreatic digestive reconstruction during RAPD. Initial results showed decreased incidence of POPF with an increased risk of postoperative bleeding. Our experience suggests that TPG might be safer than pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ); further studies are needed in order to confirm.

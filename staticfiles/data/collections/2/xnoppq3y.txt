We propose here that one of the potential mechanisms for the relapse of the COVID-19 infection could be a cellular transport pathway associated with the release of the SARS-CoV-2-loaded exosomes and other extracellular vesicles. It is possible that this "Trojan horse" strategy represents possible explanation for the re-appearance of the viral RNA in the recovered COVID-19 patients 7-14 day post discharge, suggesting that viral material was hidden within such exosomes or extracellular vesicles during this "silence" time period and then started to re-spread again.

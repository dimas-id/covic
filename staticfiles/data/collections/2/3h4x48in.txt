SARS-CoV-2 marks a new era in the medical field. The literature has outlined several signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (Lake, 2020), but there are some manifestations not yet confirmed or not entirely described. There have been reported several dermatological conditions associated with COVID-19: rash, urticaria and chickenpox-like vesicles (Recalcati, 2020) and studies on cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been announced (Fernandez-Nieto et al., 2020). The main path of COVID-19 transmission is through droplets (The Chinese Preventive Medicine Association, 2020) from the oral cavity. This is why dental professionals are widely exposed to be infected, but they could also be the first ones to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Carreras-Presas et al. published a paper presenting three case reports describing oral mucosa vesiculobullous lesions developed by COVID-19 positive or suspected to be positive patients.

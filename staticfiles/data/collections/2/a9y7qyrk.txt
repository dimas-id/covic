We simulated three transmission modes including close contact, respiratory droplets and aerosol routes in labratory. SARS-CoV-2 can be highly transmitted among naive hACE2 mice via close contact because 7/13 naive hACE2 mice were SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seropositivity on 14 days after introduced into the same cage with 3 infected-hACE2 mice. For respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from 3/10 naive hACE2 mice showed seropositivity on 14 days after introduced into the grids separated same cage from 3 infected-hACE2 mice. Additionally, hACE2 mice cannot be experimentally infected via aerosol inoculation until continued up to 25 min with high virus concentrations.

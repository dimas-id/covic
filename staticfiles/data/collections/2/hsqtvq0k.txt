Abstract Bioterrorism is intentional use of bioweapons (bacteria, viruses, or fungi or their toxins) to harm people, animals, agriculture, or environment of a country. Its impact can cause high mortality and morbidity and serious disruption of economy and social and political life. Countries must be fully equipped to respond through adequate surveillance systems and management, containment, and preventive policies.

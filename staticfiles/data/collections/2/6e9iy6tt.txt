Abstract SARS-CoV-2 infection displays immense inter-individual clinical variability, ranging from silent infection to lethal disease. The role of human genetics in determining clinical response to the virus remains unclear. Studies of outliers – individuals remaining uninfected despite viral exposure and healthy young patients with life-threatening disease – presents a unique opportunity to reveal human genetic determinants of infection and disease.

In many mammals, viruses cause hepatitis. Despite many efforts a specific virus responsible for canine idiopathic hepatitis has not been identified. The discovery of a viral etiology in canine hepatitis will promote the development of specific drugs and vaccines for the treatment of idiopathic hepatitis in dogs. The objective of this study was the application of the sequence-independent Virus Discovery cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (VIDISCA) technique combined with high through-put sequencing on a Roche-454 sequencer to identify unknown viruses. Liver tissue of a dog with idiopathic acute hepatitis was cultured on a canine liver cell line and the cell culture medium was submitted to the VIDISCA-454 technique. Without prior knowledge of the viral species involved, this technique identified Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) as the infecting agent. This demonstrates the power of VIDISCA-454 to identify viruses, independent of preliminary information about the genomic sequence. Consequently, the strategy of propagation in this cell line followed by the VIDISCA-454 technique is valuable to identify the viral etiology of idiopathic hepatitis in dogs.

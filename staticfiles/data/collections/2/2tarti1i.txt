Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), defined as hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract distal to the ligament of Treitz, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among adults. Overall, mortality rates are estimated between 2.4% and 3.9%. The most common etiology for LGIB is diverticulosis, implicated in approximately 30% of cases, with other causes including hemorrhoids, ischemic colitis, and postpolypectomy bleeding. Transcatheter visceral angiography has begun to play an increasingly important role in both the diagnosis and treatment of LGIB. Historically, transcatheter visceral angiography has been used to direct vasopressin infusion with embolization reserved for treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, advances in microcatheter technology and embolotherapy have enabled super-selective embolization to emerge as the treatment of choice for many cases of LGIB.

Neurological complications are increasingly recognized with SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen for COVID-19. We present a single-center retrospective case series reporting the EEG and outcome of de novo status epilepticus (SE) in two African-American women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus. SE was the initial presentation in one asymptomatic individual. Patient 2 had COVID-19 pneumonia, and fluctuating mental status that raised the suspicion of subclinical SE. The patient with older age and higher comorbidities failed to recover from the viral illness that has no definitive treatment.

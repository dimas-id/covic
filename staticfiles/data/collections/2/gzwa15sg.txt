Background The aim of this study was to analyse the demographic data and peri-operative outcomes of women undergoing a laparoscopic myomectomy and assess what factors, if any, precluded using the laparoscopic approach. Methods A single surgeon observational study of 323 patients undergoing a laparoscopic myomectomy was undertaken. Data was collected prospectively over a 12-year period and analysed using SPSS. Surgical outcomes included operating time, estimated blood loss, conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative and postoperative complications and duration of inpatient stay. Results A total of 323 patients underwent a laparoscopic myomectomy over the 12-year period. The majority of fibroids removed were intramural (49%) and subserosal (33%). The mean size of fibroids removed was 7.66 ± 2.83 (7.34-7.99) cm, and the mean number was 4 ± 3.62 (3.6-4.39), with the greatest being 22 removed from a single patient. Average blood loss was 279.14 ± 221.10 (254.59-303.69) ml with mean duration of surgery and inpatient stay recorded as 112.92 ± 43.21 (107.94-117.91) min and 1.88 ± 0.95 (1.77-1.99) days, respectively. No major intraoperative complications were noted, and the conversion to laparotomy rate was 0.62%. All histology following morcellation was benign. Over the 12-year period despite increasingly large and more numerous fibroids being tackled, increasing experience resulted in a simultaneous reduction in overall blood loss, operating time and duration of inpatient stay. Conclusions Laparoscopic myomectomy is a safe and efficacious procedure that should be considered the gold standard surgical treatment option for fibroids. With experience, the procedure can be undertaken with minimal complications, a low risk of conversion to laparotomy and early discharge from hospital, even in cases of large and multiple fibroids that historically would have required the open approach. This allows even the most complex of cases to now benefit for the advantages of the minimal access approach.

The current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the world's largest and most pervasive public health emergency in more than one hundred years. Although neonatal units have not been at the epicentre of the current health crisis, they have also been forced to adopt contingency plans with the aim of protecting hospitalised neonates, their families, and professionals. Neonatal units have been forced to alter the neonatal care framework based on promoting neurodevelopment and family-centred care. The peak of the pandemic is falling in most countries, but COVID-19 infection is not eradicated and there is uncertainty about new outbreaks. It is time to reflect about better strategies to preserve the rights and excellence of care for newborns and their families. This column will highlight the changes that have occurred in neonatal units, and their impact on neonatal care and families. It is a time for critical reflection on nursing practice.

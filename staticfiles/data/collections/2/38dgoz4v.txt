BACKGROUND Laparoscopic techniques have allowed surgeons to perform complicated intraabdominal surgery with minimal trauma. Recent innovators have pioneered the use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), which has the potential of further reducing the trauma of surgical access. This may lead to reduced postoperative pain and improved patient cosmesis. METHODS This article reports the authors' method of performing SILS cholecystectomy, with carefully placed sutures used to puppeteer the gallbladder and thus aid retraction. RESULTS The authors have performed SILS cholecystectomy for 23 patients with good results. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a feasible way to perform cholecystectomy. Further work in the form of randomized controlled trials is needed to investigate the advantages of this new technique.

The COVID-19 epidemic has unexpectedly affected everyone, both professionals and lay people, although the possibility of a global pandemic has long been theoretically considered by epidemiologists, infectologists on the one hand, and sociologists, communication and even social behavioral behaviorists in theory. Yet, faced with "real-time" events, daily infection and mortality statistics, almost everyone feels ignorant or confusingly inexperienced. This summary is intended to provide an overview of scientific evidence. Compiled at the end of March 2020, the not-so-complete material, of course, contains quite a few elements that will be surpassed in a few weeks. The authors hope that in a forthcoming publication we can all report on a much better and more hopeful outlook. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161 (17): 644-651.

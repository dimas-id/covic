A multilevel antimicrobial coating with "release-killing", "contact-killing" and "anti-adhesion" properties was prepared from polymer-encapsulated chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)), water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsion. A slow sustained release of gaseous ClO(2) at a rate sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth (approximately 1300 microg of ClO(2).g(-1).day(-1)) was demonstrated for a prolonged period of time (i.e., 28 days). Touch and infectious droplets triggered an increased release of the biocides at the sites of contamination, resulting in rapid disinfection. Zinc chloride (i.e., 30 ppm) was added to provide "contact-killing" properties, while bacterial adhesion was prevented by the Pluronic polymer used to encapsulate ClO(2). The new antimicrobial coating is effective against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis , Staphylococcus aureus , and Escherichia coli. A greater than 5 log (i.e., >or= 99.999%) reduction of viable bacteria was obtained at a short contact time of 10 min.

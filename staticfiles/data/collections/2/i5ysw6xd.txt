The yrast lines in Kr isotopes with $N=42$, 44, and 46 are investigated in a beyond mean field framework with both prolate-oblate coexistence and quasiparticle alignment taken into account. Quasiparticle orbitals with high-$j$ and low-$\Omega$ on the oblate side are shown to be responsible for the sharp backbending observed in $^{82}$Kr, by driving the yrast shape from prolate to oblate. This suggests that quasiparticle alignment may not be neglected in the investigation of the shape evolution along the yrast line.

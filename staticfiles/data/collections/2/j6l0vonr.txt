PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gram-negative resistance is a growing concern globally. Enterobacterales, formerly Enterobacteriaceae, have developed resistance mechanisms to carbapenems that leave very few antimicrobial options in the clinician’s armamentarium. RECENT FINDINGS: New antimicrobials like ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, cefiderocol, and plazomicin have the potential to overcome resistance mechanisms in Enterobacterales including different classes of carbapenemases. SUMMARY: Novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, plazomicin, and cefiderocol give the clinician options that were once not available. Utilizing these options is of the utmost importance when treating carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is associated with lower rates of endotracheal intubation and decreased mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure. Therefore, NIV should be preferred to invasive ventilation whenever possible [1]. In clinical settings, most of the patients were treated by NIV because of pulmonary edema or exacerbated chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) [2]. With endemic and high-risk infection, most of the critically ill patients develop acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, NIV, an “aerosol-producing factor” might be regarded as a high-risk procedure for medical staff [3].

In To Have or to Be?, psychoanalyst Erich Fromm writes about pursuit after domination of nature, material abundance, and unlimited happiness, which made modern society become more interested in having than in being. Income, in his view, should not be as accentuated as to create different experiences of life for different groups [1]. Of the concepts that Fromm presents, the domination of nature, which facilitates zoonotic spillover events by increasing the overlap between the habitat of various species with that of humans [2‐5], and the gap between the rich and the poor, which recently has become the widest in years [6], become particularly relevant in context of the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Abstract Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus which encodes two surface glycoproteins: the receptor-binding protein G and the fusion protein F. As for all paramyxoviruses, proteolytic activation of the NiV-F protein is an indispensable prerequisite for viral infectivity. Interestingly, proteolytic activation of NiV-F differs principally from other paramyxoviruses with respect to protease usage (cathepsins instead of trypsin- or furin-like proteases), and the subcellular localization where cleavage takes place (endosomes instead of Golgi or plasma membrane). To allow efficient F protein activation needed for productive virus replication and cell-to-cell fusion, the NiV-F cytoplasmic tail contains a classical tyrosine-based endocytosis signal (Y525RSL) that we have shown earlier to be needed for F uptake and proteolytic activation. In this report, we furthermore revealed that an intact endocytosis signal alone is not sufficient for full bioactivity. The very C-terminus of the cytoplasmic tail is needed in addition. Deletions of more than four residues did not affect F uptake or endosomal cleavage but downregulated the surface expression, likely by delaying the intracellular trafficking through endosomal-recycling compartments. Given that the NiV-F cytoplasmic tail is needed for timely and correct intracellular trafficking, endosomal cleavage and fusion activity, the influence of tail truncations on NiV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion and on pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is discussed.

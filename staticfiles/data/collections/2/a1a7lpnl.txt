BACKGROUND: The corona pandemic poses enormous financial challenges for hospitals. Using the example of a clinic for orthopaedics and trauma surgery, the performance development of the first 5 weeks in comparison to last year and an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law will be evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison is made between the period 16.03 to 17.04.2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case-mix index and day-mix index, as well as the occupancy days are recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act are applied to these changes, and the adequacy is evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to last year, there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of nâ¯= 307 patients in the observation period. As a result, there was a decrease of 595 points in case mix and 2320 days of occupancy. This results in a decrease in revenue of approximately EUR 1.9 million. The flat rate for empty beds represents the largest monetary compensation for the loss of revenue. It amounts to approximately EUR 1.3 million. Taking into account further support and an adjustment for variable costs, a deficit of EUR 382,069 remains for 5 weeks. DISCUSSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important pillar for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to insufficient compensation for orthopaedics and trauma surgery.

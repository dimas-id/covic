The most widely-used assays for studying viral entry, including infectivity, cofloatation, and cell-cell fusion assays, yield functional information but provide low resolution of individual entry steps. Structural characterization provides high-resolution conformational information, but on its own is unable to address the functional significance of these conformations. Single virion tracking microscopy techniques provide more detail on the intermediate entry steps than infection assays and more functional information than structural methods, bridging the gap between these methods. In addition, single virion approaches also provide dynamic information about the kinetics of entry processes. This chapter reviews single virion tracking techniques and describes how they can be applied to study specific virus entry steps. These techniques provide information complementary to traditional ensemble approaches. Single virion techniques may either probe virion behavior in live cells or in biomimetic platforms. Synthesizing information from ensemble, structural, and single virion techniques ultimately yields a more complete understanding of the viral entry process than can be achieved by any single method alone.

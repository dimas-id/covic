Currently, the world is facing the pandemic of a novel strain of beta-coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most devastating complication of SARS-CoV-2. It was indicated that cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and dominantly IL-6 play a central role in the pathophysiology of ARDS related to the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite the global emergency of the disease, at this time, there are no proven therapies for the management of the disease. Tocilizumab is a potential recombinant monoclonal antibody against IL-6 and currently is under investigation for the management of ARDS in patients with COVID-19. Given these points, we reviewed the current evidence regarding the potential therapeutic role of tocilizumab and its important clinical issues in the treatment of ARDS related to COVID-19.

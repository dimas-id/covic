The concentrations of free amino acids in plasma change coordinately and their profiles show distinctive features in various physiological conditions; however, their behavior can not always be explained by the conventional flow-based metabolic pathway network. In this study, we have revealed the interrelatedness of the plasma amino acids and inferred their network structure with threshold-test analysis and multilevel-digraph analysis methods using the plasma samples of rats which are fed diet deficient in single essential amino acid. In the inferred network, we could draw some interesting interrelations between plasma amino acids as follows: 1) Lysine is located at the top control level and has effects on almost all of the other plasma amino acids. 2) Threonine plays a role in a hub in the network, which has direct links to the most number of other amino acids. 3) Threonine and methionine are interrelated to each other and form a loop structure.

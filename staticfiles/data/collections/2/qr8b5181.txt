In Y-stenting, stabilization of the first stent may be problematic as in some cases it migrates during second stent insertion. This report evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the technique and presents the long-term results of hybrid, Y-configured, dual stent-assisted coil embolization in the treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. We retrospectively evaluated the patients treated endovascularly due to cerebral aneurysms. Twenty patients treated with hybrid Y-stent-assisted coil embolization were enrolled in the study. In hybrid stenting, an open-cell intracranial stent (Neuroform) was used as a first stent to prevent stent migration. A closed-cell stent (Enterprise or Acclino) was used as a second stent and the aneurysm was embolized with coils between the stent struts. In all patients, hybrid Y-stenting and coil embolization were accomplished successfully. No stent migration occurred. Clinically, neither symptomatic neurologic complication nor death was seen. Of 20 wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms, nine were at the basilar tip, while seven were at the middle cerebral artery and three at the anterior communicating artery. In one patient, the aneurysm was at the A2-3 junction of the anterior cerebral artery. One of the patients had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mean angiographic follow-up was 25.6 months. No in-stent stenosis was seen in any of the patients and recanalization in only one. Hybrid, Y-configured, dual stent-assisted coil embolization is a safe and effective method in the treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms to prevent stent migration and aneurysm recanalization, and is a viable alternative to microsurgery.

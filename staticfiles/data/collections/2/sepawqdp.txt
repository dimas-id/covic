The virus responsible for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV is a lineage C betacoronavirus similar to the mouse hepatitis virus type A59 (MHV-A59). The first reported case of MERS occurred in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and resulted in 76 deaths(1). Outbreaks of MERS have since occurred not only in the Middle East but South Korea as well(2). Rapid, efficient, and automated methods of disinfecting surfaces contaminated with the MERS-CoV virus may prevent the spread of the virus in the healthcare setting. Here we report on the use of an automated triple-emitter whole room disinfection system to inactivate the MHV-A59 and the MERS-CoV viruses on surfaces with a greater than 5 log(10) reduction on MERS in 5 minutes of UV-C exposure.

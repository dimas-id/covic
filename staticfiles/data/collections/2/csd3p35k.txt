School closures, home quarantine, and social distancing implemented worldwide can cause a sudden anxiety even among teachers. A designed online survey collected data from Filipino teachersâ€™ practices on how they deal with anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The practices include information seeking, preventive measures, and other coping mechanisms to deal with anxiety during the quarantine period. Results revealed that teachers practice virtual learning, communicate with the professional community, adhere to quarantine requirements, and find purposeful activities to deal with anxiety due to the suspension of national school-related activities in the country brought by the pandemic.

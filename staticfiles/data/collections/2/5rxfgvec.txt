Brachytherapy has a major role in patientâ€™s cure and cannot be substituted or excessively delayed in rapidly growing tumors (e.g.; cervical cancer). However, COVID-19 pandemic infection requires workflow adaptation in order to ensure treatment continuity for patients while ensuring safety of health care professionals. Because of a drastic reduction of all operating room capacity with exception of critical emergencies, it is mandatory to have COVID-19 recommendations applicable to the field of brachytherapy, taking into account specific constraints. Strategies for infection prevention and rationalization of health care resources are discussed. Herein we place brachytherapy in the context of reduced access to radiotherapy facilities and underscore strategies to be implemented in order to protect patients and health workers while ensuring that patients will still receive the most appropriate curative treatment.

Sialic acids (Sias) are fascinating nine‚Äêcarbon monosaccharides that are primarily found on the terminus of the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids on cell surfaces. These Sias undergo a variety of structural modifications at their hydroxy and amine positions, thereby resulting in structural diversity and, hence, coordinating a variety of biological processes. However, deciphering the structural functions of such interactions is highly challenging, because the monovalent binding of Sias is extremely weak. Over the last decade, several multivalent Sia ligands have been synthesized to modulate their binding affinity with proteins/lectins. In this Minireview, we highlight recent developments in the synthesis of multivalent Sia probes and their potential applications. We will discuss four key multivalent families, that is, polymers, dendrimers, liposomes, and nanoparticles, and will emphasize the major parameters that are essential for the specific interactions of these molecules with proteins in biological systems.

BACKGROUND Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) is a suitable procedure to treat unremitting abdominal pain of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in the presence of a markedly dilated pancreatic duct containing stones and when an inflammatory mass in the head of the gland is absent; this procedure is rarely performed laparoscopically. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman with alcohol-related calcific CP and pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency suffered with opiate-dependent abdominal pain that was associated with a dilated pancreatic duct of 8.5 mm containing several calculi, but no mass in the head of the pancreas. A laparoscopic LPJ was performed successfully with no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on day 5, and reported complete relief from abdominal pain at follow up 7 months later. CONCLUSIONS In selected patients, laparoscopic LPJ is feasible, safe, and effective in treating abdominal pain of CP.

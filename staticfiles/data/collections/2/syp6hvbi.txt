Lateral flow assay (LFA) has become one of the most widely used point-of-care diagnostic methods due to its simplicity and low cost. While easy to use, LFA suffers from its low sensitivity and poor quantification, which largely limits its applications for early disease diagnosis and requires further testing to eliminate false-negative results. Over the past decade, signal enhancement strategies that took advantage of the laser excitation of plasmonic nanomaterials have pushed down the detection limit and enabled quantification of analytes. Significantly, these methods amplify the signal based on the current LFA design without modification. This review highlights these strategies of signal enhancement for LFA including surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photothermal and photoacoustic methods. Perspectives on the rational design of the reader systems are provided. Future translation of the research toward clinical applications is also discussed.

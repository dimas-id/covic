We describe an 85-year-old man suffering lower urinary tract symptoms, who underwent prostatic artery embolization (PAE) based on a prostate-supplying arteriogram created with multidetector-row computed tomography during pelvic arteriography. This arteriogram was synthesized from a background bone volume-rendered (VR) image, an aorta-pelvic artery VR image, and a prostate-supplying artery VR image. Because the bone background VR image is combined with the aorta-pelvic artery VR image, the prostate-supplying arteriogram can simultaneously show the pelvic branch arteries present on the ventral side, inside, and the dorsal side of the pelvic bone. It showed that the left prostatic artery supplied the urethra at the outlet of the urinary bladder. PAE of the left prostatic artery was performed with catheter navigation based on the prostate-supplying arteriogram. There was marked relief of the lower urinary tract symptoms at the 12-month follow-up.

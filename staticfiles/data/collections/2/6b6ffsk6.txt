The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the conditions for total flavonoid extraction from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. The influences of the ethanol concentration, extraction time, temperature, and the liquid–solid ratio on flavonoid yield were investigated. Based on ANOVA results, a second-order quadratic polynomial model could be applied to characterize the extraction process. The following optimal extraction conditions were identified: ethanol concentration, 52.98 %; extraction time, 2.12 h; extraction temperature, 62.46 °C; and liquid–solid ratio, 35.23. The predicted extraction yield was 19.437 mg/g when these optimal conditions were used. The proposed method was successfully employed to extract flavonoids from S. baicalensis.

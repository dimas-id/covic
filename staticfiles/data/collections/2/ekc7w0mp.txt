OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effects of static stretching on peroneal and tibialis anterior reaction characteristics. DESIGN All 23 participants who volunteered for this study were randomly divided into static (n = 12) and control (n = 11) groups. The subjects in the static stretching group performed stretching exercises for the ankle evertor and dorsiflexor muscles 5 days a week for 6 wks. Peroneal and tibialis anterior muscle reaction characteristics were evaluated at the beginning (2 times for acute effect) and end of this period. Electromyographic activity parameters of the muscles were measured using an ankle inversion tilting platform that simulated a sudden ankle inversion. The following were the four different ankle inversion conditions: (a) ankle-neutral, 15-degree inversion; (b) ankle-neutral, 30-degree inversion; (c) ankle-20-degree plantarflexion, 15-degree inversion; and (d) ankle-20-degree plantarflexion, 30-degree inversion. RESULTS Either in terms of acute or chronic effects, no significant differences were found after static stretching exercises for peroneal and tibialis anterior muscle reaction time, reaction duration, and muscle activity evaluated in four positions on the ankle inversion simulation platform (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In light of these results, it is possible to state that the short duration of static stretching exercises can still be applied before sports activities.

Outbreaks of infectious diseases at mass gatherings can strain the health system of the host region and pose a threat to local and global health.

We review novel approaches to disease surveillance utilizing the Internet, mobile phone applications, and wireless sensor networks. These novel approaches to disease surveillance can result in prompt detection.

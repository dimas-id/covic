The pandemic Covid-19 is responsible for a major education crisis globally and has a drastic impact on medical training as well. The objective of the present study was to envision the present and future impact of Covid-19 on anatomy learning and research. The virtual education is the only mode of teaching in current scenario. Every anatomist is unlocking technology to deliver best education however understanding of the subject without dissections or other practical teaching aids like bones, specimens, embryology models, microscopic slides etc. is challenging. This approach misses the feel and human visual impacts. Potential educational disruption is felt currently and will be experienced even after the pandemic is over due to scarcity of cadavers. As the body donor may be carrier or died of Covid-19 and there is no proven screening to rule out this infection in donor, so the acceptance of body donations is not advisable for the safety of medical students and health care workers. To conclude, anatomy education is cadaverless currently due to Covid-19 lockdown and it is prophesied that after the pandemic, real cadavers will be replaced by virtual cadavers because of paucity of cadavers. Research in the field of anatomy will also be adversely affected.

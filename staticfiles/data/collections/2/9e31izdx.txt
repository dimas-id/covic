Protecting immunosuppressed patients during infectious disease outbreaks is crucial. During this novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, preserving "clean areas" in hospitals assisting organ transplant recipients is key to protect them and to preserve transplantation activity. Evidence suggests that asymptomatic carriers might transmit the SARS-CoV-2, challenging the implementation of transmission preventive strategies. We report a single-center experience using universal SARS-CoV-2 screening for all inpatients and newly admitted patients to an Organ Transplant Unit located in a region with significantly high community-based transmission.

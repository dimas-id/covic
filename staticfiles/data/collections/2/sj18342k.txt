PURPOSES This study quantified performance, physiological, and perceptual responses during resistance exercise to task failure with blood flow restriction (BFR), in systemic hypoxia, and with these stimuli combined. METHODS Fourteen young men were tested for 1-repetition maximum (1RM) in the barbell biceps curl and lying triceps extension exercises. On separate visits, subjects performed exercise trials (4 sets to failure at 70% 1RM with 90 s between sets) in six separate randomized conditions, i.e., in normoxia or hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 20.9% and 12.9%, respectively) combined with three different levels of BFR (0%, 45%, or 60% of resting arterial occlusion pressure). Muscle activation and oxygenation were monitored via surface electromyography and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, and perceptual responses were assessed following each set. RESULTS Compared to set 1, the number of repetitions before failure decreased in sets 2, 3, and 4 for both exercises (all P < 0.001), independently of the condition (P > 0.065). Arterial oxygen saturation was lower with systemic hypoxia (P < 0.001), but not BFR, while heart rate did not differ between conditions (P > 0.341). Muscle oxygenation and activation during exercise trials remained unaffected by the different conditions (all P â‰¥ 0.206). A significant main effect of time, but not condition, was observed for overall perceived discomfort, difficulty breathing, and limb discomfort (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Local and systemic hypoxic stimuli, or a combination of both, did not modify the fatigue-induced change in performance, trends of muscle activation or oxygenation, nor exercise-related sensations during a multi-set resistance exercise to task failure.

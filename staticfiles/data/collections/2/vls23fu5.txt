Summary A new virus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread world-wide since December 2019, probably affecting millions of people and killing thousands.

We have designed a model for predicting the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France, which is based on seroprevalence and makes it possible to anticipate the deconfinement strategy.

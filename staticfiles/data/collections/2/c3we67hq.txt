Objective: To explore high chest resolution CT (HRCT) manifestations of early stage corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Methods: Chest HRCT findings of 31 COVID-2019 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Chest HRCT showed vary degrees changes of pneumonia within 1 week of onset. Multiple lesions (3 or more lesions) were found in 23 cases. Lesions affected 2 and more pulmonary lobes were observed in 24 cases, while single pulmonary lobe involvement was observed in 7 cases. Multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO) was noticed in 22 patients, while in other 9 cases multiple GGO mixed consolidation were found, all had fuzzy boundaries. The lesions presented at peripheral lungs in 25 cases, while in 6 cases presented at peripheral combined and central lungs. Lesions of irregular morphology were observed in 26 cases, while rounded morphology and sphericity were observed in the other 5 cases. Air bronchogram was noticed in 26 cases, thickening vascular in the lesions were found in 29 case, thickened intralobular interstitium in 24 cases, thickened interlobular interstitium in 6 cases, centrilobular nodules in 2 cases and a small amount of pleural effusion in 1 case. Conclusion: The early chest HRCT manifestations of COVID-2019 have certain characteristics. Combination of clinical history and chest HRCT manifestations is conducive to early diagnosis COVID-2019.

Abstract This study describes a novel blocking microsphere-based immunoassay for highly sensitive and specific detection of antibodies against bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). The intra- and inter-assay variability are 4.9% and less than 7%, respectively, and variability of bead conjugations is less than 6.6%. The diagnostic performance of the assay was evaluated by testing a total of 509 serum samples. Based on a negative/positive cut-off value of 30.3%, the assay has a sensitivity of 99.4% and a specificity of 98.3% relative to ELISA. The new microsphere immunoassay provides an alternative to conventional ELISA systems and can be used for high-throughput screening in the BVD control programmes.

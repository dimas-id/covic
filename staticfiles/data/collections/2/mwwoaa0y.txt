Hip distraction is necessary for safe arthroscopic entry into the hip joint. Achieving sufficient distraction is difficult in exceedingly tall patients (>190.5 cm) because of size limitations of currently available hip distraction systems. Inadequate distraction can delay the surgical procedure and potentially lead to complications. By repurposing a foam head-positioning block, we report a safe and inexpensive positioning technique for extending the traction distance for tall patients by 2 inches.

Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) with or without splenic preservation is increasingly performed for benign or border-line neoplasms of the body and tail of the pancreas. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors appear as an excellent indication for laparoscopic resection and this procedure is becoming the gold standard for the surgical treatment of such neoplasms. The safety and advantage of laparoscopic resection over open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) have been proven. In this video, we present a LDP with splenectomy for a neuroendocrine tumor of distal pancreas, with associated wedge resection of a liver nodule. Technical considerations were also discussed.

The term “immune” pertains to the body keeping itself free from diseases, not to trigger any diseases. In this regard, it makes sense for us to divide antigenicity into immunogenicity and allergenicity. This distinction allows for the characterization of all types of modern antigens, i.e., to evaluate and modify a priori the allergenicity of an antigen before it is applied to humans. In this chapter, we also formulated the hypothesis that “Balanced Stimulation by Whole Antigens” is essential for immune development. This hypothesis revives the practicality of the “Hygiene Hypothesis” and can provide a fundamental solution to curb the increasing prevalence of allergic disease, namely, early exposure, at 0–1 year old or earlier, in utero, of representative allergens/protein antigens with immunogenicity retained or improved and allergenicity attenuated or eliminated.

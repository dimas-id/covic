Obesity is associated with a decrease in mortality in patients with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is referred to as the obesity paradox.1 ARDS is a type of respiratory failure characterised by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs and is usually the result of infectious or chemical injury. The obesity paradox in ARDS patients has been investigated by Ni et al,1 who conclude that obesity and morbid obesity were associated with a lower mortality rate in patients with ARDS.

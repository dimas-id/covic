The purpose of this study was to compare diaphragmatic motion on dual-source high-pitch (DS-HP) and conventional single-source (SS) CT scans in trauma patients. Seventy-five consecutive trauma patients who presented to a level one trauma center over a 6-month period were scanned with a standardized whole body trauma CT protocol including both DS-HP chest (pitch = 2.1-2.5) and SS abdominal CT scans. Subjective analysis of diaphragmatic motion was performed by two readers using a four-point motion scale in seven regions of the diaphragm on coronal and axial slices. An overall confidence score to exclude a diaphragmatic tear was determined (1 to 10, 10: completely confident and 1: impossible to exclude). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Mean confidence score of 9.85 for DS-HP was significantly better than the mean score of 7.66 for SS images (p < 0.0001). Diaphragmatic motion scores and subjective diaphragmatic motion artifact on coronal and axial images were significantly better for DS-HP images in all areas when compared individually (p < 0.0001) and overall (p < 0.0001). Regions of DS-HP (99.2 %) were diagnostic, whereas only 87.0 % % regions on SS were. Complete agreement of motion scores was present in 92 % of cases, with moderate overall agreement for confidence to exclude a diaphragmatic tear (Îº = 0.45). Dual-source high-pitch CT scanning is advantageous as it allows for significantly better evaluation of diaphragmatic structures by minimizing motion artifacts on images of freely breathing trauma patients.

OBJECTIVE To compare the in vitro biomechanical properties of a novel subcuticular stapling device to current methods of abdominal skin closure for equine abdominal surgery. STUDY DESIGN In vitro randomized, matched design. SAMPLE POPULATION Equine ventral median abdominal skin specimens (n = 24 horses). METHODS Subcuticular absorbable staples (SAS), metallic staples (MS), polyglyconate suture (PG), and nylon monofilament (NYL) were applied to longitudinally transected portions of equine ventral midline skin. Loads that resulted in an initial failure point and the ultimate failure load and mechanism were recorded. RESULTS Mean ± SD loads at initial failure for PG (86 N ± 64 N), NYL (81 N ± 142 N), and SAS (70 N ± 20 N) were not significantly different from each other. PG and SAS were significantly higher than MS (43 N ± 17 N; P < .05). Ultimate failure load for PG (563 N ± 157 N) and NYL (558 N ± 162 N) were significantly higher than either MS (175 N ± 44 N) or SAS (96 N ± 20N; P < .001). For the suture groups, nearly all failures occurred because of skin pull through whereas all SAS staples failed because of staple fracture. Failure patterns were mixed for MS. CONCLUSIONS SAS had the lowest ultimate failure load; however, other measured variables identified characteristics of SAS that may be clinically beneficial.

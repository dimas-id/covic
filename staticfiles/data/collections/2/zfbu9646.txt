Threatening sporadic outbreaks of avian influenza and the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 highlight the need for rapid and accurate detection and typing of influenza viruses. In this paper, we describe the validation of the VereFlu™ Lab-on-Chip Influenza Assay, which is based on the integration of two technologies: multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR followed by microarray amplicon detection. This assay simultaneously detects five influenza virus subtypes, including the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), seasonal H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and influenza B virus. The VereFlu™ assay was clinically validated in Singapore and compared against reference methods of real-time PCR, virus detection by immunofluorescence of cell cultures and sequencing. A sensitivity and specificity of 96.8% and 92.8%, respectively, was demonstrated for pandemic H1N1; 95.7% and 100%, respectively, for seasonal H1N1; 91.2% and 97.6%, respectively, for seasonal H3N2; 95.2% and 100%, respectively, for influenza B. Additional evaluations carried out at the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre, Melbourne, Australia, confirmed that the test was able to reliably detect H5N1. This portable, fast time-to-answer (3 hours) device is particularly suited for diagnostic applications of detection, differentiation and identification of human influenza virus subtypes.

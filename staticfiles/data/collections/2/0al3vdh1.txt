The Covid-19 outbreak threatens to saturate healthcare systems in most Western countries. We describe how digital technologies may be used to automatically and remotely monitor patients at home. Patients answer simple self-reported questionnaires and their data is transmitted, in real time, to a Command Centre in the nearest reference hospital. Patient reported data are automatically filtered by algorithms to identify those with early warning signs. Open-source code of all software components required to deploy the remote digital monitoring platform and Command Centres is available.

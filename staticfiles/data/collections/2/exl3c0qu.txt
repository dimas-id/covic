Viruses are considered to be the most abundant biological particles and have the capability to infect all forms of life leading to a variety of diseases. American workers in specific occupational environments are threatened by viral exposures, highlighting the importance to recognize the type and risk of exposure, as well as the preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of exposure. For example, healthcare workers can potentially be exposed to air and blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis and the human immunodeficiency virus. These types of exposures have led to the development of preventive equipment and regulations intended to reduce viral exposures in occupational settings. This chapter will discuss the characteristics of viruses and the occupationally relevant viruses of which people in varying occupations can potentially encounter. Regulatory guidelines and protective strategies will also be reviewed.

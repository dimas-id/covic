Human migration during the Chinese Spring Festival (SF) is the largest collective human activity of its kind in the modern era-involving about one-tenth of the world population and over six percent of the earth's land surface area. The festival results in a drop of air pollutant emissions that causes dramatic changes of atmospheric composition over China's most polluted regions. Based on satellite and in-situ measurements for the years 2005-2019 over 50 cities in eastern China, we find that the atmospheric NO2 pollution dropped by ~40% during the SF week, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by ~30% in the following week, reflecting the effectiveness of precursor emission controls on the mitigation of secondary PM2.5 formation. However, although human activity and emissions are at the lowest level, air pollution over eastern China during the SF still far exceeds that over other worldwide pollution hotspots. Our analyses suggest that measures based solely on end-of-pipe controls and industry upgrades may not suffice to meet air quality goals. Further cleaning of the air in China depends fundamentally on sustainable advances in both heavy industry upgrades and clean energy transition.

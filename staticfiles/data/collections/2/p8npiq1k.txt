INTRODUCTION Current trends in dementia research focus on early and accurate diagnosis. In clinical practice however, this is not always possible, as multiple underlying pathologies produce mixed dementia syndromes. Furthermore, patients with severe dementia are often underestimated. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of a 71 year old Caucasian male with severe Alzheimer's Disease, bedridden and fully dependent in activities of everyday living, whose general cognitive function is almost intact. We emphasize on the diverse underlying pathologies contributing to this intriguing clinical presentation and to diagnostic uncertainty. CONCLUSION Understanding the complexity of the dementia process in every patient using a multidimensional approach, contributes to more rational management strategies and finally to high quality care for patients and caregivers.

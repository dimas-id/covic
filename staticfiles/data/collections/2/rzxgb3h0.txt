Coronavirus disease COVID-19 is caused by the recently discovered corona virus that can spread between animals and humans. The outbreak of the corona virus was begun in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The most com-mon symptoms are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some individuals also develop aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diar-rhea. It was reported that traditional remedies may alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19. Ayurveda is the worldâ€™s oldest medical system that can manage any disease without side effects. Ayurveda is equipped with varieties of treatment modalities to handle with any type of deadly diseases. However, a major drawback is a lack of adequate scientific basis. Tulsi has multi-modal therapeutic effects, we hypothesize that tulsi may be effective in the prevention and management of COVID-19. Though the existing literature supports the management of symptoms of COVID-19 using tulsi, a lack of standard formulation limits its use. This is the need of time to start with translational research to provide scientific evidence for the efficacy and to establish the standard formulation of tulsi in the management of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION Acute cerebral ischaemia with main cerebral artery occlusion requires treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator administration and/or endovascular thrombectomy. However, some patients fail to recover even after recanalisation because of ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We hypothesised that regional transarterial hypothermic infusion would be effective for patients with I/R injury. The aim of this study is to validate the safety of this procedure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a clinical exploratory study to evaluate safety of regional transarterial hypothermic infusion in combination with endovascular thrombectomy. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 5-29 who require endovascular thrombectomy are eligible for the study. When no improvement in NIHSS score after the recanalisation is achieved by thrombectomy, cold saline (15Â°C) will be administered through a microcatheter located in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. The primary endpoints of this study are mortality and morbidity. The secondary endpoint is deleterious effects on clinical data such as symptoms, radiographic findings and physiological data. The primary and secondary endpoints will be accumulated as case series because this study will be conducted on a small sample of seven patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION All protocols and the informed consent form comply with the Ethics Guideline for Clinical Research (Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare). Ethics review committees at the Hokkaido University Hospital approved the study protocols. The results of the study will be disseminated at several research conferences and also contributed to peer-reviewed journals. The study will be implemented and reported in line with the SPIRIT statement. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER UMIN Clinical Trails Registry (UMIN000018255); pre-results.

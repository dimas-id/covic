Many statisticians, epidemiologists, economists and data scientists have registered serious reservations regarding the reported coronavirus case-counts. Limited testing capacity across the country has been widely identified as a key driver of suppressed coronavirus case-counts. The calls to increase testing capacity are well-justified as they become a more frequent point of discussion in the public sphere. While expanded testing is a laudable goal, selection bias will impact estimates of disease prevalence and the effective reproduction number until the entire population is sampled. Moreover, tests are imperfect as false positive/negative rates interact in complex ways with selection bias. In this paper, we attempt to clarify this interaction. Through simple calculations, we demonstrate pitfalls and paradoxes that can arise when considering case-count data in the presence of selection bias and measurement error. The discussion guides several suggestions on how to improve current case-count reporting.

A new sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, was developed to detect transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigens from cell culture and from intestinal wash or feces obtained from experimentally infected pigs. This technique was shown to be suitable for the detection of virulent field strain unadapted to cell culture. Cross reactions had not been observed with other enteric pathogens, rotavirus, porcine epizootic diarrhea virus, and Escherichia coli.

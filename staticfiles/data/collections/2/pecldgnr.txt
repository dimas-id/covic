BACKGROUND Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG; DuodopaÂ®) is used for continuous infusion in advanced Parkinson's disease. To achieve optimal effect, the LCIG dose is individually titrated, traditionally conducted during hospitalization in Sweden. However, dose adjustment depends on surrounding conditions, physical activity, and emotional stress, which is why titration at home could be beneficial. Telemedicine (TM) using a video communication system offers alternative titration procedures, allowing LCIG initiation at home. OBJECTIVE Study objectives were to show the feasibility of TM for LCIG home titration, evaluate resource use, and assess patient, neurologist, and nurse satisfaction. METHODS Four clinics enrolled 15 patients to observe efficiency and feasibility of TM-based monitoring. RESULTS Patient median (range) age was 67 (52-73) years and time since diagnosis was 10 (7-23) years. Median time between LCIG initiation and end of TM-assisted titration was 2.8 (2.0-13.8) days. Median time required for home titration by neurologists, nurses, and patients was (hours:minutes) 1 : 14 (0 : 29-1 : 52), 5 : 49 (2 : 46-10 : 3), and 8 : 53 (4 : 11-14 : 11), respectively. Neurologists and nurses considered this to be less time than required for hospital titration. TM allowed patients 92% free time from start to end of titration. Technical problems associated with TM contacts were rare, mostly related to digital link, and quickly resolved. Patients, neurologists, and nurses were satisfied using TM. No serious adverse events were reported; there was one device complaint (tube occlusion). CONCLUSIONS In this study, TM-assisted LCIG titration at home was resource-efficient, technically feasible, well-accepted and was deemed satisfactory by patients, neurologists, and nurses.

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s greatest impact is among older adults. Management of the situation requires a systemic response, and post-acute care (PAC) can provide an adequate mix of active treatment, management of associated geriatric syndromes and palliative care, both in the acute phase, and in post-COVID-19 recovery. In the region of Catalonia, Spain, selected PAC centers have become a site to treat COVID-19 older patients. Referrals come from the emergency department (ED) or COVID-19 wards of the acute reference hospitals, nursing homes or private homes. We critically review the actions taken by Parc Sanitari Pere Virgili, a PAC facility in Barcelona, to manage the pandemic, including its administration, healthcare, communication, psychological support and ethical frameworks. We believe that the strategies we employed and the lessons we learned can be useful for other sites and countries where similar adaptation of existing facilities may be implemented.

Proteins are the most abundant biological macromolecules, occurring in all cells and all parts of cells. Moreover, proteins exhibit enormous diversity of biological function and are the most final products of the information pathways. Protein is a major component of protoplasm, which is the basis of life. It is translated from RNA and composed of amino acid connected by peptide bonds. It participates in a series of complicated chemical reactions and finally leads to the phenomena of life. So we can say it is the workhorse molecule and a major player of life activity. Biologists focus on the diction of structure and function of proteins by the study of the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary dimensional structures of proteins, posttranscriptional modifications, protein-protein interactions, the DNA-proteins interactions, and so on.

Aichivirus B has been reported worldwide in calves and adult cattle with and without diarrhea. The aim of this study was to describe the molecular characteristics of the RdRP and VP1 genes of aichivirus B strains identified as the most frequent etiologic agent in a neonatal diarrhea outbreak in a high-production Brazilian dairy cattle herd. Preliminary laboratory analysis ruled out important enteropathogens (Cryptosporidium spp; Eimeria spp., E. coli F5, and bovine coronavirus). Fecal samples from diarrheic (n = 24) and asymptomatic (n = 5) calves up to 30 days old were collected for virological analysis. RT-PCR assays were performed for the detection of aichivirus B RdRP and VP1 genes and for rotavirus A VP7 and VP4 genes in fecal samples. Asymptomatic calves (control group) were negative for both viruses. Aichivirus B and rotavirus A G10P[11] genotypes were found in 54.2% (13/24) and 25% (6/24) of the diarrheic fecal samples, respectively. Aichivirus B was only identified (83.3%, 10/12) in calves up to two weeks old. Phylogenetic analysis based on the RdRP gene grouped the Brazilian strains in a new branch within the aichivirus B group. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the VP1 gene of Brazilian and Chinese aichivirus B strains allowed the strains identified in this study to be classified in the putative lineage 1. This is the first description of a high rate of aichivirus B detection in a diarrhea outbreak in dairy calves, and the first phylogenetic study of the VP1 gene of aichivirus B wild-type strains performed in South America.

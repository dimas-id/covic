INTRODUCTION: Distal arthrogryposis type 5D (DA5D) is an autosomal recessive disease. The clinical symptoms include contractures of the joints of limbs, especially camptodactyly of the hands and/or feet, unilateral ptosis, a round-shaped face, arched eyebrows, and micrognathia, without ophthalmoplegia. ECEL1 is a DA5D causative gene that encodes a membrane-bound metalloprotease. ECEL1 plays important roles in the final axonal arborization of motor nerves in limb skeletal muscles and neuromuscular junction formation during prenatal development. METHODS: A DA5D family with webbing of the elbows and fingers was recruited. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and filtered mutations by disease-causing genes of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). Mutational analysis and cosegregation confirmation were then performed. RESULTS: We identified novel compound heterozygous mutations of ECEL1 (NM_004826: c.69C>A, p.C23âˆ— and c.1810G>A, p.G604R) in the proband. CONCLUSIONS: We detected causative mutations in a DA5D family, expanding the spectrum of known ECEL1 mutations and contributing to the clinical diagnosis of DA5D.

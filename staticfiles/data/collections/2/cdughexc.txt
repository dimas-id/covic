BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As community-based ambulatory endoscopy centers across the nation are trying to reopen and safely resume outpatient endoscopic procedures after the unprecedented lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, guidelines recommend pre-testing and screening for COVID-19 along with other mitigation measures for the safety of patients and staff. The impact of such changes in the workflow of ambulatory endoscopy centers on throughput and other performance indicators is largely unknown although a significant reduction in revenue stream is expected. METHODS: A discrete event simulation-based model was developed in the setting of a small to medium community-based single-specialty ambulatory endoscopy center to quantify the impact of COVID-19 related workflow changes on performance indicators and cost per case compared with the pre-COVID-19 baseline. RESULTS: In the simulation model, post-COVID-19 recommended workflow changes significantly impacted the operational and productivity metrics and, in turn, adversely affected the financial metrics. Overall, there was a significant decrease in staff utilization, and consequent increase in total facility time, waiting time for patients, and cost per case because of a bottleneck at the time of preprocedure COVID-19 screening and testing while practicing social distancing. Strategies to minimize this adverse impact on productivity were assessed. CONCLUSION: Pretesting and screening for COVID-19 as recommended by current guidelines will significantly impact the productivity and revenue stream of ambulatory endoscopy centers. Urgent measures by the payors are needed to adjust the facility reimbursement of endoscopy centers to ensure successful reopening and ramping up outpatient endoscopy services in these facilities already hit hard by the pandemic.

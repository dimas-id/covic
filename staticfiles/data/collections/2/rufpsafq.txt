Shenzhen, a city located on the border between Mainland China and Hong Kong, is populated primarily by internal Chinese migrants. After the 2003 SARS epidemic, the pressure in Shenzhen to contain infectious disease has been considerable. By engaging with issues of global biosecurity, migration and citizenship, and intersubjectivity in medicine, I argue that in their attempts to prevent another SARS and protect their own subject positions as modern, urban citizens, Shenzhen's public health professionals worked to maintain precarious boundaries between themselves and their city's majority migrant population. However, by establishing the migrants as dangerous, biological noncitizens, by denying connections between the migrants' experiences and their own experiences of migration, by failing to engage with the migrants as subjects, and by defending structures that institutionalized these exclusions, they undermined both the health of the migrants and the stability of the city they were trying to protect.

Methods to check the antiviral activities of mononuclear phagocytes or macrophages are described. Two types of antiviral activities are defined. The intrinsic antiviral activity is determined as the outcome of virus replication in the macrophage per se whereas the extrinsic antiviral activity refers to the ability to reduce virus production in other surrounding cells that are normally permissive. The interpretation of the data are discussed.

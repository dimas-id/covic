BACKGROUND This study was conducted to evaluate the amount of weight loss and weight regain and also remission rate of obesity-related comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and dyslipidemia in patients who underwent LRYGB or LSG during 5 years of follow-up. METHODS A total of 120 patients who underwent LRYGB or LSG from 2011 to 2013 were enrolled and followed-up for 5 years. Changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), percent weight loss (%WL), and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were recorded. RESULT %WL and %EWL were similar between two procedures at 1 year following operation. In patients who underwent LSG, %WL and %EWL were 24.6 ± 1.3% and 61.9 ± 3.5%, respectively, and in LRYGB were 30.4 ± 1.3% and 79.4 ± 3.6%, respectively, 5 years after surgery. Weight regain was 32.0% in LSG and 9.3% in LRYGB after 5 years. The remission rate of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was 70%, 54%, and 100%, respectively, after 5 years of surgery. CONCLUSION Comparing the 5-year success rate of these two techniques, LRYGB seems to be superior to LSG, with lower weight regain and higher weight loss. The short- and long-term effects of two procedures on remission of comorbidities were comparable.

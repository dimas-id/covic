Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is being used with increasing frequency in the treatment of many conditions requiring surgery. Experience with SILS for hepatectomy is limited. This is one of the first reports of SILS hepatectomy in the treatment of hepatic hydatid disease. A 17-years-old female who has 89 Ã— 59-mm cystic mass in the left lobe of the liver was admitted with abdominal pain persisting for several months. For treatment of the mass, SILS hepatectomy performed. Although complexity of the liver structure and the technical difficulties of SILS restrict its applications in hepatic surgery, the treatment of liver hydatid disease with SILS in selected patients is safe and efficient. Moreover, it allows a better cosmetic result and rapid recovery.

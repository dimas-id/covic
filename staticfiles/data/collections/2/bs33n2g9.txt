Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a major cause of diarrhea in human and animal. In piglets, ETEC having F4 fimbriae (F4(+) ETEC) induce severe diarrhea, dependent on the presence of receptors for F4 (F4R). In this study, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was identified as an F4R by comparative proteomic analysis of brush border proteins of F4R(+) and F4R(âˆ’) pigs and by adherence/internalization experiments on pAPN-transfected cells. Binding of F4 fimbriae to pAPN depended on sialic acid containing carbohydrate moieties, and resulted in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the fimbriae. Endocytosis via pAPN was not restricted to F4 fimbriae, but was also observed for anti-pAPN antibodies. Both F4 fimbriae- and pAPN-specific antibodies were taken up in vivo by porcine enterocytes and induced subsequently a rapid immunoglobulin A and G response. In conclusion, we identified pAPN as an endocytotic receptor for F4 fimbriae and highlight the opportunity to target vaccine antigens to this epithelial receptor.

The genetic variation in equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein-encoding open reading frames (ORFs) 3 and 4 genes was investigated. Nucleic and deduced amino acid sequences from seven different EAV isolates (one European, one American and five Canadian isolates) and the Arvac vaccine strain were compared with those of Bucyrus reference strain. ORF 3 nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities between these isolates (including the Arvac vaccine strain) and the Bucyrus reference strain ranged from 85.6 to 98.8%, and 85.3 to 98.2%, respectively, whereas ORF 4 nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities ranged from 90.4 to 98.3%, and 90.8 to 97.4%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis and estimation of genetic distances based on the ORF 3 nucleic acid sequences showed that the European Vienna isolate could be classified into a genetically divergent group from all other isolates and the Arvac vaccine strain. In contrast, the nucleic acid sequences of ORF 4 were found to be less variable, with a closer phylogenetic relationship evident among the EAV isolates and the Arvac vaccine strain.

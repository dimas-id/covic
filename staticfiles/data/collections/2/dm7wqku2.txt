Although long-term weight gain has been associated with cardiovascular risk and intima-media thickening (IMT), no sufficient data exist on possible associations of such weight changes with more advanced stages of subclinical atherosclerosis. Moreover, the value of self-reported weight changes, a more practical approach to assess long-term history in adiposity status, is still a matter of debate. In this longitudinal study, long-term changes in BMI and overweight status were assessed in 106 healthy young adults (age 40.5 ± 1.1 years, 60 males). These were a subgroup of adolescent school students who had originally been examined in 1983 initially aiming to assess cardiovascular risk factor prevalence. Markers of early (carotid IMT) and advanced (presence of plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries and ankle-brachial index, ABI) subclinical atherosclerosis were measured in all individuals. By multivariate analysis, among other risk factors, IMT and the presence of plaques were independently determined by BMI change, while a low ABI was also determined by changes in overweight status. An adverse long term adiposity profile change (≥ +4 kg/m(2) and/or change into overweight/obese status from normal weight since adolescence) incrementally determined a low ABI over current risk factors. Self-reported and actual BMI changes were correlated (r = 0.587) but their means significantly differed, while the former significantly correlated with IMT only (P = 0.032). In conclusion, an adverse long term adiposity status change was more prominently associated with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and particularly low ABI. These results also suggest that the utility of self-reported weight changes may be limited in primary prevention practice.

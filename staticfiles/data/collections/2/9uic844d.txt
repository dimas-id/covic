Screening for total pain and sharing of patient information including adverse events for patients receiving chemotherapy by medical staff is needed in clinical practice. We introduced a sharing system for patient-oriented outcome sheets via a touch panel at an outpatient chemotherapy clinic. This study aimed to assess whether the system contributes to the improved management of treatment-related adverse events. We retrospectively analyzed data from a total of 215 patients at Ehime University Hospital using their electronic medical records from April to August 2015. Forty of these patients had received interventions relating to treatment-related adverse events. The proportion of a total number of interventions before and after the sharing system was 42/282(14.9%)and 45/215(20.9%), respectively. The proportion of a total number of interventions at the first course of outpatient chemotherapy also increased from 9/40(22.5%)to 14/40(35%)compared with before the sharing system. The purpose of interventions were for insomnia, anorexia, and cancer-related pain, etc., listed in order of degree of frequency. These results suggest that a sharing system of patient-reported interview sheets contributes to tracking treatment -related adverse events and aids in ensuring interventions can be efficiently performed by multidisciplinary team members.

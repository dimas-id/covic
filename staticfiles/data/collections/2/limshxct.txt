Development of microcantilever biosensors for small molecules was exemplified with the beta-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol and the antibiotic chloramphenicol. In this paper, antibody sulfhydrylation and protein A were used to modify the microcantilever Au surface, and the antibody activities on the microcantilever were evaluated with direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dcELISA). The activity of the antibodies immobilized on the microcantilever via protein A was 1.7-fold of that via the sulfhydrylation reagent 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride. A microcantilever immunosensor method with protein A as the functionalization reagent was established to detect the residues of clenbuterol and chloramphenicol at limits of detection (LOD) of approximately 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Such LODs were better than that of the corresponding dcELISAs. The concentration of clenbuterol in a fortified feed sample detected with the microcantilever immunosensor after thorough extraction and purification agreed well with that detected with the dcELISA. Protein A showed to be simple and reproducible for functionalization of the antibodies on the Au surface and, thus, has common application values in microcantilever immunosensor development. The results suggest that microcantilever immunosensors be suitable for detection of small molecules, and the assay sensitivity is mainly related to the quality and activities of the antibodies.

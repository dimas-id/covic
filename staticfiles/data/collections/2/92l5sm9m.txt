Coronavirus infection is associated to life-threatening respiratory failure. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was recently identified as a host factor for Zika and dengue viruses; AHR antagonists decrease viral titers and ameliorate ZIKV-induced pathology in vivo. Here we report that AHR is activated during coronavirus infection, impacting anti-viral immunity and lung basal cells associated to tissue repair. Hence, AHR antagonists are candidate therapeutics for the management of coronavirus-infected patients.

Over the past 20 years bariatric surgery proved to be a valid treatment for reduction and elimination of obesity-related diseases and long-term sustainable weight loss. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic techniques such as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y (LRNY) have replaced open procedures. Many factors play important roles in the small intricacies and variations of the procedure, chief of which is the creation and size of the gastrojejunostomy. Regardless of the variations in technique, the LRNY remains the gold standard for the surgical treatment of clinically severe or morbid obesity, with relatively low morbidity and mortality.

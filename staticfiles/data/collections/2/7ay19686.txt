The past two decades have witnessed a major shift in humanitarian operations to respond to more internal conflicts instead of the traditional cross-border wars. Over the recent years, two major shifts have taken place within the WHO to orient toward response to emergencies, namely the introduction of the Humanitarian Reform and the Cluster Approach in 2005 and the introduction of the Emergency Response Framework (ERF). The financing of the agency in humanitarian operations is adding emerging elements to the WHO operations, especially because of the constantly higher contribution from non-state- and state- funding agencies. Pending issues include aspects like health strategy, conflict analysis, legal issues of aid delivery, impartiality in delivering services, and other aspects and needs.

We report a novel solution for patients suffering from adult acquired retractile penis. Three patients complained of retractile penis (when standing) and/or prepubic recession. Physical examination confirmed the shaft of the penis was buried with only the glans visible. All three patients reported lower levels of self-confidence, self-esteem, and sexual confidence prior to their procedure. The three patients received surgical treatment with the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant and two of the three also received removal of the suprapubic fat pad. Over one year post operatively, the penile shaft and glans was visible and appeared natural. All patients reported an increase in self-confidence and self-esteem. The insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant may prove to be a viable solution to reverse retractile penis and to increase patient quality of life when compared to more invasive current surgical treatments.

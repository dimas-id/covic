The aetiological contribution of viral agents in the causation of acute diarrhoea was studied prospectively in 915 infants and young children aged 1–35 months. This was a hospital-based study, selection being carried out by proportionate random sampling; 587 matched controls were also investigated simultaneously. Methods of detection included direct electron microscopy, ELISA for rotaviruses and immune electron microscopy. Rotaviruses emerged as the single most important cause with highest prevalence in the 6–11-month age group. The contribution of other agents was negligible. Electron microscopy, though a ‘catch-all’ technique, is not a cost-effective diagnostic method for developing countries.

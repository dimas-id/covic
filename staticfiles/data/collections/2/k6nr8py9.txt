BACKGROUND Long-term outcomes and predictors of success after transoral stapling for Zenker diverticulum are still unclear. METHODS Between 2001 and 2010, 91 patients with Zenker diverticulum underwent transoral stapling under general anesthesia. Since 2008, the technique was modified by applying traction sutures to ease engagement of the common septum inside the stapler jaws. Perioperative variables, distribution of symptoms, and outcome of surgery were analyzed. Long-term results were compared between patients undergoing standard versus modified technique of transoral stapling. RESULTS The transoral approach was successfully completed in 79 (86.8 %) patients with a median age of 74 years. Overall morbidity was 5 %, and there was no mortality. The median length of hospital stay was 2 days. Six patients were lost to follow-up. After a median follow-up of 53 (range, 12-114) months, an improvement of dysphagia and regurgitation scores (p < 0.001) and a reduction in the number of pneumonia episodes per year (p < 0.001) was recorded. The long-term success rate of the procedure was 80.1 %. At a median time of 12 months, 14 patients complained of recurrent symptoms, 7 of whom needed an open (n = 4) or transoral (n = 3) reoperation. Use of traction sutures resulted in a greater long-term success compared with the standard procedure (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Transoral stapling is a safe and effective technique. A repeat procedure is feasible in case of recurrent diverticulum. The use of traction sutures applied at the apex of the common septum before stapling might increase the long-term success of the technique.

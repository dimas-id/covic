Abstract Nanoparticles, novel in size, shape, and surface chemistry when compared to more conventional materials, offer additional functional properties to a range of possible oral applications, from drug-delivery systems to dental implant coatings. Exploitation of the toxic properties of nanoparticles to bacteria, viruses, and fungi has increased markedly over recent years. Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and their incorporation into other materials have been of particular interest. The potential of nanoparticles to control the formation of biofilms within the oral cavity, as a function of their antimicrobial, anti-adhesive, and delivery capabilities, is coming under close scrutiny. However, optimum formulation of materials at the nanoscale does require innovative physical and chemical approaches.

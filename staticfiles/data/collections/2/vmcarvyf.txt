BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) has been introduced for totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this study was to report our initial experience with SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair in 100 patients by a single-port laparoscopic surgeon who had no prior experience of conventional TEP hernia repair. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between October 2012 and December 2013, 100 patients underwent SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair by a single surgeon. The procedures that were performed in the preperitoneal space did not differ from those in conventional TEP repair. Patient demographics, type of hernia, and operative and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Also, we compared the results of current series with the data of the other studies for single-port TEP inguinal hernia repair. RESULTS Among the 100 patients, SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair was successful in 99 patients; 1 patient required additional incisions for inserting the trocar. The mean operative time and postoperative length of stay were 97.8 minutes (range, 55-185 minutes) and 1.3 days (range, 1-4 days), respectively. In the current series, the operation time was longer than those in the other studies for SPLS TEP repair. Recurrent hernia, history of lower abdominal surgery, and peritoneal tear during the operation were significantly associated with prolonged operation time. The other data, including perioperative complications, were similar. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the transition from standard hernioplasty to SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair by an experienced SPLS surgeon was feasible. However, a learning curve is necessary.

BACKGROUND Nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion is an easy procedure that can be routinely performed under general anesthesia. However, for difficult cases, there are limited insertion techniques available in routine clinical practice, considering the flexibility of NGTs. The SUZY curved forceps are designed for the removal of pharyngolaryngeal foreign bodies under guidance of the McGRATH MAC (McG) videolaryngoscope. Because McG enables clear visualization of the esophageal inlet, we hypothesized that the SUZY forceps can facilitate easier NGT insertion compared with the conventional Magill forceps under McG guidance and designed a randomized, crossover manikin study to test this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten anesthesiologists participated in this study. Each participant was instructed to insert an NGT using either the SUZY or the Magill forceps under McG guidance. Both types of forceps were used by each participant in a computer-generated random order. The primary outcome measure was the number of "strokes" (1 stroke was defined by a specific sequence of participant actions) required to advance the NGT 30 cm from the starting point. Data are expressed as medians (interquartile ranges [ranges]). RESULTS The number of strokes required for NGT insertion was fewer in the SUZY group than in the Magill group {7 [7.0-12.5 (5-14)] vs 16.5 [13.5-20.3 (7-22)]; P <.05}. The time required for NGT insertion was also lesser in the SUZY group than in the Magill group {15.4 [13.7-20.0 (7.0-38.3)] seconds vs 30.3 [22.0-42.3 (12.8-47.5) seconds]; P <.05}. CONCLUSIONS The SUZY curved forceps facilitated NGT insertion more effectively than the Magill straight forceps under McG guidance. Our results suggest that NGT insertion using the SUZY forceps under McG guidance is a secure and easy procedure.

BACKGROUND Rhinorrhea and nasal congestion are simultaneous symptoms associated with the common cold. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of a combination nasal spray of ipratropium and xylometazoline for simultaneous treatment of these symptoms. METHODS The trial was a multicenter double-blind, parallel-group, randomized design on patients with common cold symptoms. Patients scored symptoms of runny nose and nasal congestion and recorded adverse events in a diary for up to 7 days. Patients also recorded tissue use. The five test treatments consisted of ipratropium, 0.6 mg/mL, and xylometazoline, 1.0 mg/mL; ipratropium, 0.6 mg/mL, and xylometazoline, 0.5 mg/mL; ipratropium, 0.6 mg/mL; xylometazoline, 1.0 mg/mL; and placebo solution. RESULTS Eight hundred sixty-four patients were screened and 786 patients received treatment. One day after treatment there was a clear separation between the scores for the placebo and ipratropium treatment groups for rhinorrhea and between the placebo and xylometazoline treatment groups for congestion. Both ipratropium/xylometazoline 1.0 and ipratropium/xylometazoline 0.5 treatments were superior to xylometazoline with respect to rhinorrhea (p < 0.0001) and superior to ipratropium with respect to nasal congestion scores (p < 0.001). Both the ipratropium combination treatments had significantly lower tissue use than the xylometazoline treatment group (p < 0.0001). Adverse events were distributed equally between the treatments, except mucus tinged with blood, epistaxis, nasal passage irritation, and nasal dryness, which had a higher incidence in the three groups that received medicines containing ipratropium. CONCLUSION The results indicate that a combination medicine of ipratropium and xylometazoline is safe and effective for treatment of rhinorrhea and nasal congestion associated with common cold.

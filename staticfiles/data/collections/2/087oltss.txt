Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has been devastating the global swine industry for more than a decade, and current strategies to control PRRS are inadequate. In this study we characterized the inhibition of PRRS virus (PRRSV) replication by antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). Of 12 peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO), four were found to be highly effective at inhibiting PRRSV replication in cell culture in a dose-dependant and sequence-specific manner. PPMO 5UP2 and 5HP are complementary to sequence in the 5â€² end of the PRRSV genome, and 6P1 and 7P1 to sequence in the translation initiation regions of ORF6 and ORF7, respectively. Treatment of cells with 5UP2 or 5HP caused a 4.5log10 reduction in PRRSV yield, compared to a control PPMO. Combination of 6P1 and 7P1 led to higher level reduction than 6P1 or 7P1 alone. 5UP2, 5HP, and a combination of 6P1 and 7P1 inhibited PRRSV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages and protected the cells from PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect. Northern blot and real-time RT-PCR results demonstrated that the effective PPMO led to a reduction of PRRSV RNA level. 5UP2 and 5HP inhibited virus replication of 10 other strains of PRRSV. Results from this study suggest potential applications of PPMO for PRRS control.

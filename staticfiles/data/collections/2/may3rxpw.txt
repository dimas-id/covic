Several complex set of engineering and scientific challenges in the food and bioprocessing industries for manufacturing high quality and safe food through efficient and sustainable means can be solved through nanotechnology. Bacteria identification and food quality monitoring using biosensors; intelligent, active, and smart food packaging systems; and nanoencapsulation of bioactive food compounds are few examples of emerging applications of nanotechnology for the food industry. We review the background about the potential of nanotechnology, provide an overview of the current and future applications of nanotechnology relevant to food and bioprocessing industry, and identify the societal implications for successful implementation of nanotechnology.

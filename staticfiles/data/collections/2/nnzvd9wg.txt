Objective: This article presents additional strategies to the medical professional and support tactics to keep both the health care provider and patient as safe as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic Observations: Follicular conjunctivitis has been reported as an early sign of infection or during hospitalization for severe COVID-19 disease It has been confirmed that COVID-19 is transmitted through both respiratory droplets and direct contact Another possible route of viral transmission is entry through aerosolized droplets into the tears, which then pass through the nasolacrimal ducts and into the respiratory tract For nonemergent care, eye care providers should use telehealth Eye care providers should prioritize patient care in order of absolute necessity, such as sudden vision loss, sudden onset flashes and floaters, and eye trauma In those cases, exposure should be minimized The close proximity between eye care providers and their patients during slit-lamp examination may require further precautions, such as shields, barriers, and mask use to lower the risk of transmission via droplets or through hand to eye contact Conclusions: All nonemergent eye care appointments should be delayed or conducted remotely For emergent in-person appointments, careful and appropriate adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations may minimize exposure for both the health care provider and patient

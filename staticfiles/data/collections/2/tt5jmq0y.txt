There have been many advances in the perfusion equipment used for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. A key component, the membrane oxygenator, has had a number of modifications in recent years and a recent clinical evaluation demonstrated disparity in various aspects of device performance. One difference among oxygenators, which to-date has received little attention, was the impact on the patient's immune cells, with some oxygenators producing a significantly greater increase in immune cell numbers after cross clamp. Such increases in immune cell proliferation may contribute to the development of a systemic inflammatory response (SIR), which has been demonstrated to have a negative impact on patient outcomes. Although factors contributing to immune cell proliferation during CPB are recognized to be multi-factorial, the goal of the current communication was to perform an ad hoc analysis of these raw data for evidence that pressure gradients through an oxygenator contributes to this outcome. Despite the observation that higher-pressure gradient oxygenators appeared to associate with increased immune cell proliferation, no correlation was detected in this analysis. This finding, however, provides further evidence for the complex nature of inflammation during CPB, which deserves ongoing discussion and investigation.

INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and other advantages of closing the appendicular stump with a polymeric clip in laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). METHODS In this study, 121 pediatric patients who underwent LA between July 2009 and July 2011 were included. Age and gender of the patients, the number of clips, operative time and length of hospitalization, complications, and follow-up periods were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS Of appendicular stump of a total of 121 patients who were underwent LA, 71 were closed with double polymeric clips and 50 were closed with a single polymeric clip. Patients were between the ages of 3 and 15 years (mean 8.3 years). Out of the 121 patients, 54 were female and 67 were male. The duration of the operation was ranged from 13 to 55 minutes (mean 28 minutes). Of these, 83 patients were discharged in less than 24 hours. The cost of a single clip was 10 USD. The follow-up period of patients were ranged between 1 and 23 months (mean 13 months). No operative or postoperative complications occurred depending on the application of the polymeric clip. CONCLUSION LA using polymeric clip/s to close appendicular stump in children is a safe, feasible, and inexpensive method.

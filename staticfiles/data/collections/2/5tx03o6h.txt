AIM: COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide since it began, greatly affecting peoples' lives, social economies and medical systems. At present, little is known about the disease, and vaccines are still under development. Therefore, in the face of severe outbreaks, previous effective experience can help people better protect themselves and their families. The aim of this article is to discuss the social distancing measures for COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Literature and document search. RESULTS: Recent research and a novel coronavirus pneumonia prediction model revealed social distancing measures and wearing masks are required to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent pathogen exposure. After a series of social distancing measures, there are 309 cities with zero cases and 34 cities with confirmed cases in China as of April 13, 2020. CONCLUSION: From China's experience with novel coronavirus pneumonia, we know that social distancing is the most effective measure at present. We need to win more time to allow limited medical resources to save lives.

BACKGROUND Late outcomes after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication are only now becoming available. This study was undertaken to document late outcomes after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. METHODS Five hundred ten patients underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication >10 years ago and were prospectively followed. Preoperatively and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms (from 0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Symptom scores before and after fundoplication were compared. Median symptom scores are presented. RESULTS Early after fundoplication, significant improvements were noted in the frequency and severity of symptoms (e.g., for heartburn, from 8 to 0 and from 8 to 0, respectively, P < .001 for each). Late after fundoplication, significant improvements were maintained in the palliation of symptoms (e.g., frequency and severity for heartburn, 2, 1; respectively). At latest follow-up, 89% of patients were pleased with their symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS With long-term follow-up, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication durably and significantly palliates symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This trial promotes the application of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

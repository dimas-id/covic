While there has been a shift of attention in global health towards non-communicable diseases, we still know little about the social mechanisms that have allowed these diseases to emerge as topics of global concern. We employ a sociological approach to globalisation in order to reconstruct how cardiology, with our special focus being on heart failure research, has become global, and thereby placed cardiovascular diseases on the agenda of global health. Following sociological theories of world–society and world–polity, we identify a number of preconditions that had to be met so that the globalisation of cardiology could set in. Amongst them were technological innovations, the emergence of an organisational infrastructure on the national level, the appearance of cardiological journals, and an internationally standardised nomenclature. More recently, new drugs and treatment strategies, new specialist journals, and new international standards allowed the subspeciality of heart failure to globalise. Our findings are based on the history and sociology of cardiology, and on our analysis of a broad range of other documents, including scientific articles, guidelines, and policy documents. Additionally, our analysis included two datasets, one containing information on national cardiac societies, and the other containing data on publication output in cardiology.

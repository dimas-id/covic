This retrospective chart review of patients at a tertiary referral center compares characteristics and clinical features of patients diagnosed with human rhinovirus (HRV) infection to those of patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza A (pH1N1) during the pandemic respiratory season of 2009 to 2010. Hospital admission rates, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality were not statistically different between the HRV and pH1N1 groups; however, more patients in the HRV group were considered immunocompromised.

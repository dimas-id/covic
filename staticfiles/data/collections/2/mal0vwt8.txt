To determine the optimal number of specimens for virus detection in a respiratory outbreak, laboratory results from 2 Canadian public health laboratories were reviewed. The evidence suggests that 3 specimens are sufficient for detection of a virus in >95% of outbreaks, thereby reducing laboratory costs.

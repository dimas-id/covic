This paper highlights application challenges for GIS interoperability for emergency management with emphasis on critical infrastructure sectors. In the first part, this paper provides a comparative analysis of emergency management operations in the City of Vancouver; the City of Toronto, the Kitchener Waterloo Region, and the Dufferin County. A variety of qualitative research methods were employed for gathering information from key decision-makers involved with emergency management. The second part of this paper presents a scenario-based case study, which aims to provide a demonstration of the utility of GIS interoperability, for disaster management. This paper also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of leveraging GIS interoperability for disaster management.

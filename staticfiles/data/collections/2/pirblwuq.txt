Abstract Background HHV-6 has been implicated in a number of neurological disorders. Recent evidence has suggested high incidence of HHV-6 infection in patients (46%) undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). Objective To investigate whether HHV-6 plays a role in the development of fatal encephalopathy in an allogeneic post-BMT patient using an unbiased approach. Results Detection of HHV-6 viral DNA sequence and RNA expression were demonstrated in fresh frozen post-mortem autopsy material derived from the insular cortex using a multi-virus array platform. In addition, PCR analysis by real-time quantitative TaqMan demonstrated high viral burden in multiple brain regions tested. Sequencing analysis of PCR product confirmed the virus to be HHV-6 variant B. Conclusions Active infection as demonstrated by expression of viral RNA and high viral load in the CNS suggest a possible pathogenic role of HHV-6 in development neurologic complications post-BMT.

In 2015, we investigated Bartonella quintana and typhus group rickettsiae in body lice from homeless persons in Bogot√°, Colombia. We found B. quintana-infected body lice and seroprevalence of this microorganism in 19% of homeless persons and typhus group rickettsiae in 56%. Public health professionals should start preemptive measures and active vector control.

Abstract The study objectives were: 1) to characterise the development of immunocompetence in beef suckler calves from birth to three months of age, and 2) to trace glycoprotein E (gE)-negative bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) antibodies from dam to calf and subsequent vaccination against pneumonia. Thirty multiparous beef suckler, spring-calving cows, consisting of two genotypes were involved; Limousin×Friesian (LF) and Charolais×Limousin (CL). Cows were immunised against the inactivated antigen strain of BoHV-1 (gE- (IBR marker vaccine) at day −84 and received a booster at day −56 relative to the expected calving date (d 0). Calves were immunised at 14 and 42days of age against PI-3 virus, BRSV and Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica serotype A1 using a commercial vaccine administered subcutaneously. Additionally, calves were immunised against BoHV-1 at 42days of age, using 1 dose of a live commercial vaccine administered intranasally. Blood samples were collected from all calves (n=30) via jugular venipuncture at birth, prior to colostrum feeding (0h), at 12h (h), 24h, 72h and 168h after the initial feeding of colostrum, and at d 7, 14, 28, 42, 56 and 84 post birth. The mean ratio of gE negative antibodies circulating in the blood of LF and CL dams pre-partum scored negative to gE ab (S/N≥0.70). Antibody levels of BoHV-1 (wild type (wt)) peaked at 12h post-birth in calves and declined thereafter, as the maternal antibodies decayed. There was no difference in BoHV-1 and BRSV antibody levels in calves post vaccination.

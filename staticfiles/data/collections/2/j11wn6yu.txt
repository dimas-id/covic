PURPOSE To describe a green-laser marking technique to assist partial cystectomy, which allows accurate identification of tumour margins, and provide our initial experience with ten patients. METHODS Between January 2014 and February 2018, ten patients suspected with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and request of bladder-preserving treatment were selected. In each case, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed before green-laser assisted laparoscopic partial cystectomy. Under the direct view of cystoscope, the front-firing green-laser incision was performed 0.5-1 cm away from the exterior margin of lesion with adequate depth into the fat tissue. Tumours were then en bloc removed via laparoscope under the tracing of laser beam. RESULTS The location of 12 tumours in 10 patients was superior wall in 7 cases, lateral wall in 3 cases, anterior wall in 1 case, and posterior wall in 1 case. All procedures were completed without serious complications. The median operating time was 270 (210-360) min with a median haemoglobin decrease of 11 (3-38) g/L. Nine patients were high-grade transitional cell carcinoma and one patient was urachal carcinoma, and the clinical stage was pT1 in 1 case, pT2 in 4 cases, and pT3 in 5 cases. The pathological evaluation of tumour margins was negative in 10 patients. During the follow-up, no recurrence or metastasis were detected in 8 patients, but 2 patients presented regional recurrence. CONCLUSION The use of green-laser marking technique during laparoscopic partial cystectomy is a feasible manoeuvre in assisting the accurate incision and minimizing injury to the remaining bladder.

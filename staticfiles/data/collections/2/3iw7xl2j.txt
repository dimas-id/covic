This chapter explores the relationship between human security and borders, specifically the borders of sovereign States. Seen through the lens of human security, it argues that on the one hand the right of migrants to move across borders is fundamental, and on the other hand, the human rights and human security of both sedentary and migrant populations across borders are paramount to the security of both the States on either side of any border. It asks the questions: Whose rights are met with responsibilities? What options are there? Answering these questions sheds light on the tensions between State-citizen security and (non-)citizen security and human security, all of which are likely to become more acute; accentuated as they are by political instabilities and exacerbated by climate change, among other co-factors.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), spread largely via droplets. Patients present with rapidly progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of epidemiological linkage, clinical profiles, and virological evidence of SARS-CoV infection. Treatment of SARS is largely anecdotal. High-dose corticosteroid therapy might be useful for critically ill patients, but previous use of ribavirin (a broad-spectrum antiviral agent) was probably not efficacious. Some survivors of SARS suffer from avascular necrosis of hip and knee joints. Poor prognostic factors include advanced age, comorbidities, and high serum lactate dehydrogenase and neutrophil levels.

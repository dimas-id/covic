Like it or not, patients with respiratory complaints are a part of our practice. The common cold is often referred to as the most frequent illness occurring in humans: over 40% of Americans suffer from a “cold” each year, accounting for more lost productivity than any other illness. Pharyngitis affects almost 30 million patients annually, with over 10% of all school-aged children seeking medical care each year. Seventeen million patients a year are diagnosed with asthma, with more females than males among adult-onset patients. Whether it is the reason for our patient’s visit or an incidental complaint, we are involved with the diagnosis and management of these problems.

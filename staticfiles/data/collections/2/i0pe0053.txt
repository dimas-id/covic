INTRODUCTION To assess the feasibility of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in some urological surgeries. MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted on 40 patients (27 males and 13 females) from January 2010 to June 2011. Six procedures were done, SILS renal cyst decortication (n = 10), SILS varicocelectomy (n = 10), SILS orchiopexy (n = 10), SILS nephrectomy (n = 3), SILS pyelolithtomy (n = 6) and SILS adrenalectomy (n = 1). RESULTS Postoperative complications included ileus (10%) and fever (10%) in SILS renal cyst ablation. SILS varicocelectomy had postoperative sequalae as persistent varicocele (10%) and hydrocele (10%). SILS orchiopexy was also done with a success rate 100% in this series. SILS pyelolithotomy was successfully done in 5 out of 6 patients and only 1 patient was converted to conventional laparoscopy. In SILS nephrectomy 1 patient out of 3 was converted to conventional laparoscopy. CONCLUSION SILS in urology has proven to be safe and feasible in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, using specially designed ports and instruments in selected patients.

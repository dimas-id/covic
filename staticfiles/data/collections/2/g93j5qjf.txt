OBJECTIVE A number of new techniques have been developed to prevent lymphocele formation after pelvic lymphadenectomy in gynecologic cancers. We assessed whether the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing device (EBVSD) could decrease the incidence of postoperative lymphocele secondary to pelvic lymphadenectomy. METHODS A total of 321 patients with gynecologic cancer underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy from 2005 to 2011. Pelvic lymphadenectomy without EBVSD was performed in 134 patients, and pelvic lymphadenectomy with EBVSD was performed in 187 patients. We retrospectively compared the incidence of lymphocele and symptoms between both groups. RESULTS Four to 8 weeks after operation, 108 cases of lymphocele (34%) were detected by computed tomography scan examination. The incidence of lymphocele after pelvic lymphadenectomy was 56% (75/134) in the tie ligation group, and 18% (33/187) in the EBVSD group. We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of lymphocele between both groups (p<0.01). To detect the independent risk factor for lymphocele development, we performed multivariate analysis with logistic regression for three variables (device, number of dissected lymph nodes, and operation time). Among these variables, we found a significant difference (p<0.001) for only one device. CONCLUSION Use of the EBVSD during gynecological cancer operation is useful for preventing the development of lymphocele secondary to pelvic lymphadenectomy.

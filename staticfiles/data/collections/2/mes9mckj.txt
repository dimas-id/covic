We report a case of obturator neuropathy induced by trans-obturator vaginal mesh surgery for symptomatic cystocele. Initial electromyography excluded genito-femoral and pudendal nerve deficiency. Typical clinical arguments for severe obturator neuropathy at physical examination led to vaginal revision surgery with hemi-resection of the mesh to the ischio-pubic branch. This fully relieved obturator-induced pain and reversed adductor muscle motor deficiency.

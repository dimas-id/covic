Ant Colony algorithm has been applied to various optimization problems, however most of the previous work on scaling and parallelism focuses on Travelling Salesman Problems (TSPs). Although, useful for benchmarks and new idea comparison, the algorithmic dynamics does not always transfer to complex real-life problems, where additional meta-data is required during solution construction. This paper looks at real-life outbound supply chain problem using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and its scaling dynamics with two parallel ACO architectures - Independent Ant Colonies (IAC) and Parallel Ants (PA). Results showed that PA was able to reach a higher solution quality in fewer iterations as the number of parallel instances increased. Furthermore, speed performance was measured across three different hardware solutions - 16 core CPU, 68 core Xeon Phi and up to 4 Geforce GPUs. State of the art, ACO vectorization techniques such as SS-Roulette were implemented using C++ and CUDA. Although excellent for TSP, it was concluded that for the given supply chain problem GPUs are not suitable due to meta-data access footprint required. Furthermore, compared to their sequential counterpart, vectorized CPU AVX2 implementation achieved 25.4x speedup on CPU while Xeon Phi with its AVX512 instruction set reached 148x on PA with Vectorized (PAwV). PAwV is therefore able to scale at least up to 1024 parallel instances on the supply chain network problem solved.

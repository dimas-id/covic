Different skin presentations and patterns of cutaneous signs were reported in COVID19 patients. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is responsible for two very common skin conditions. Varicella (chichkenpox) is the initial presentation for infection with VZV and is characterized by a diffuse vesicular rash. It is after this initial attack, that VZV remains latent in the dorsal root ganglia before reactivating to present as herpes zoster (HZ) in middle age groups. Cutaneous skin findings remain to be emerging every day as a marker or a complication of COVID 19. We report a case of HZ complication in a 44 years old COVID 19 positive male.

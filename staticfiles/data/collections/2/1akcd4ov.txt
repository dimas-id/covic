We present a highly suspicious case of COVID-19 infection, incidentally found on F-FDG PET/CT images. Patient was scanned on February, 25, 2020, when COVID-19 outbreak was unrecognized in our country. She admitted having recent occasional dry cough and fever. A retrospective review of her clinical and laboratory data was strongly suggestive for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. PET/CT images demonstrated hypermetabolic diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs with bilateral nodules. There was no evidence of pleural effusion or prominent mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Radiologists must be aware of COVID-19 presentations on PET/CT scan images during COVID-19 outbreak.

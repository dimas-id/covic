BACKGROUND Tiny, wide-necked intracranial aneurysms pose a significant therapeutic challenge for interventional neuroradiologists because of the small volume for microcatheterization and coil stabilization inside the aneurysm sac. We report our preliminary experience of stent-assisted coiling embolization of these aneurysms. METHODS A total of 50 patients with 52 tiny, wide-necked aneurysms who were treated with stent-assisted coiling from January 2007 to December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline characteristics, procedure-related complications, angiographic follow-up results and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. RESULT All aneurysms were successfully treated with the stent-assisted coiling technique, and at the end of the procedure, aneurysm occlusion was complete for 45 (86.5 %), near complete for 3 (5.8 %) and incomplete for 4 (7.7 %). Procedural complications (1 intraprocedural rupture, 2 coil migrations and 1 aneurysm re-rupture) occurred in 4 (8 %) of 50 patients, resulting in permanent morbidity in 1 (2 %) patient and death in 1 (2 %) patient. Follow-up imaging was available in 43 (84.3 %) aneurysms for 6-31 months (mean, 13 months). Complete occlusion was achieved in 40 (93 %) of 43 aneurysms on long-term follow-up. One aneurysm with complete occlusion and one with incomplete occlusion after the initial embolization developed a significant recurrence (4.7 %). Clinical follow-up was available for 43 (86 %) of 50 patients at a mean of 36.7 months (range 15-66 months). Of these 43 patients, 42 (97 %) made an excellent recovery achieving a GOS of 5. None of the patients died or experienced re-bleeding or ischemic cerebral vascular events during follow-up. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling embolization is feasible and relatively safe for tiny, wide-necked intracranial aneurysms of carotid arteries. Furthermore, long-term follow-up angiography indicated stent-assisted coiling seems to be effective in preventing early recanalization.

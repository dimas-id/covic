Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been identified as important host restriction factors in mammals for the control of infection by multiple viruses. However, the antiviral functions of IFITMs against fish viruses remain largely uncertain. In this study, the IFITM3 homolog from orange spotted grouper (EcIFITM3) was cloned and its roles in grouper virus infection were investigated. The full-length cDNA of EcIFITM3 was 737 bp, which was composed of a 16 bp 5′-UTR, a 274 bp 3′-UTR, and a 447 bp ORF. EcIFITM3 encodes a 148-amino-acid polypeptide, which contains five domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (aa 1–65), TM1 (aa 66–90), the cytoplasmic domain (aa 91–110), TM2 (aa 111–140), and the C-terminal domain (aa 141–148), and shares 78% and 47% identity with IFITM3 of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. EcIFITM3 mRNA was detected in 12 tissues of healthy groupers, with the highest expression levels in the head kidney. Additionally, the in vitro mRNA levels of EcIFITM3 were significantly upregulated by infection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), or treatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subcellular localization analysis showed that EcIFITM3 was mainly distributed in the cell membrane of grouper cells. In vitro, the ectopic expression of EcIFITM3 inhibited SGIV and RGNNV infection, as demonstrated by the reduced severity of the cytopathic effect, decreased virus production, and low levels of viral mRNA and proteins. Consistently, knockdown of EcIFITM3 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) enhanced SGIV and RGNNV replication. EcIFITM3 overexpression and knockdown experiments both suggested that EcIFITM3 inhibits the infection of SGIV and RGNNV by restricting virus entry.

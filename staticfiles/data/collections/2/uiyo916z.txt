UNLABELLED Recent decades have witnessed a tremendous shift from laparotomy to laparoscopy as the surgical approach of choice in gynecology. Completion of increasingly complicated procedures has been facilitated by technical advances in instrumentation. Lately, increasing attention has been paid to reducing both the number and size of laparoscopic incisions, with the ultimate goal being the absence of any visible scar. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), or single-incision laparoscopy, describes the use of 1 small skin incision to complete laparoscopic surgical procedures where traditionally multiple incisions were created. In addition to examining the developing literature related to LESS in gynecology, the aims of this review were to describe the technical challenges encountered during performance of LESS and to provide practical solutions for instrumentation and surgical techniques that allow them to be overcome. TARGET AUDIENCE Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians LEARNING OBJECTIVES After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to identify potential benefits of LESS, and implement practical solutions for instrumentation and surgical techniques to overcome technical challenges faced during LESS.

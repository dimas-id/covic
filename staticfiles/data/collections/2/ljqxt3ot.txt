PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Present an overview of perioperative considerations specific to endoscopic skull base surgery necessary to maximize successful outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of perioperative considerations for endoscopic skull base surgery lack strong supporting evidence and frequently have varied use or implementation amongst institutions. A notable exception comes from a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrating the benefit of lumbar drainage in high-risk cerebrospinal fluid leaks. SUMMARY: Skull base surgeons must consider a multitude of perioperative factors. While many components of perioperative management are extrapolated from related fields such as endoscopic sinus surgery or open cranial base surgery, additional high-quality studies are needed to delineate best practices specific to endoscopic skull base surgery.

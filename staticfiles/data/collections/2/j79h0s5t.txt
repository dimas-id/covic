The initial evidence supporting the prone position in non-ventilated awake patients with COVID-19 infection was anecdotal and theoretical. However, several early studies support the potential role of this practice to improve oxygenation, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce the need for intensive care admission. Although there is not a set amount of time that has been proven to be optimal for awake proning, we recommend sessions of 2 to 3 hours for at least a total 4 to 5 hours a day as tolerated based on the existing data and our anecdotal experience. Despite the low-risk and low-cost nature of proning awake patients, there are still logistical concerns that may prevent adequate proning, the most significant of which is patient comfort and compliance.

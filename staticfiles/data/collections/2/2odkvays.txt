OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of perihematomal edema (PHE) volume in non-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) to discriminate neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS In this retrospective study, from 560 patients with acute ICH 91 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were classified into neoplastic and non-neoplastic ICH. For each patient, ICH and total hemorrhage volume (ICH + PHE) were segmented semiautomatically. The PHE volume and relative PHE were further calculated and all parameters were compared between the different groups. Additionally, hematoma density was measured and compared between the groups. RESULTS The PHE volume and relative PHE on NECT were significantly higher in neoplastic vs. the non-neoplastic ICH (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Absolute ICH volume, symptom time onset to CT and ICH localization showed no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.1). Univariate receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed a high diagnostic performance for relative PHE in the discrimination of neoplastic and non-neoplastic ICH with an optimal cut-off of 0.50 (area under the curve, AUC 0.81, 60.0% sensitivity, 91.8% specificity), followed by PHE (AUC 0.69) and hematoma density (AUC 0.68). CONCLUSION Relative PHE with a cut-off of >0.50 is a specific and simple indicator for neoplastic causes of acute ICH and a potential tool for clinical implementation. This observation needs to be validated in an independent patient cohort.

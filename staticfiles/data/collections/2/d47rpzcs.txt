Tight control of gene expression is highly characteristic of virus replication, although the mechanisms used to achieve this vary depending on the host cell. There are considerable differences in patterns of gene expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Control of gene expression is also achieved at a posttranscriptional level by control over translation of proteins using a number of different mechanisms. Finally, epigenetics plays a significant role in controlling virus gene expression, just as it does for cellular genes. The net results of all these interlocking processes are a complex web of interactions between the virus genome and the machinery of the host cell.

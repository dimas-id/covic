Consumers today are increasingly demanding goods which not only conform to the public’s image of being ‘eco‐friendly’ and ‘organic’ but of having been produced ‘ethically’. Meeting such high ideals has a down side, both in higher costs and often in that of having to accept more distant suppliers. Present trends in the coloration of foods with natural dyes rather than synthetic ones, increasing consumption of organic products (including fibres) and energy‐saving trends in dye application methods, fuels and lighting, as well as the means of capturing solar energy, are discussed. The discovery of some interesting and historic green colours, the wider use of green (in both senses of the word) products and green chemistry’s future role in producing them are also reviewed.

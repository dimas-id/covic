Major studies designed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of TMA have been conducted over recent years. This improved knowledge opens up new perspectives for more targeted treatment. However, until these innovative treatments become available, early diagnosis of these diseases is essential in order to rapidly initiate specific treatment, as the interval between diagnosis and initiation of plasma exchange is a decisive element in the prognosis of TTP. Treatment must not be stopped too early or too rapidly and must take into account the various associated factors, especially the presence of infection.

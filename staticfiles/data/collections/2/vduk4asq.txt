The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Here, we have investigated the ability of adenoviral delivery of codon-optimised SARS-CoV strain Urbani structural antigens spike protein S1 fragment, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein to induce virus-specific broad immunity in rhesus macaques. We immunised rhesus macaques intramuscularly with a combination of the three Ad5-SARS-CoV vectors or a control vector and gave a booster vaccination on day 28. The vaccinated animals all had antibody responses against spike protein S1 fragment and T-cell responses against the nucleocapsid protein. All vaccinated animals showed strong neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV infection in vitro. These results show that an adenoviral-based vaccine can induce strong SARS-CoV-specific immune responses in the monkey, and hold promise for development of a protective vaccine against the SARS causal agent.

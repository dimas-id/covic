Disasters have been described as “events of sufficient scale, asset depletion, or numbers of victims to overwhelm medical resources” [1] or as “a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses that exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources” [2]. Importantly, that definition goes on to state: “A disaster is a function of the risk process. It results from the combination of hazards, conditions of vulnerability and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce the potential negative consequences of risk.”

The physical basis and algorithm of the ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) scientific calculator are presented herein. The algorithm was implemented in the web application UVGI Scientific Calculator (found at www.covid-19-clean.org) that has been used to facilitate the engineering and design of air-purifying equipment being developed for use in hospitals, commercial and residential applications. Presented examples of the calculations illustrate how different factors of the construction of a UVGI air-purifier may influence the degree of virus inactivation.

we read with great interest the article entitled “SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in a psoriatic patient treated with IL‐23 inhibitor” published by Messina F. and Piaserico S. in the JEADV.(1) This is the first report of COronaVIrus DIsease 2019 (COVID‐19) in a psoriatic patient treated with a biologic. Whilst the authors reported an infection that occurred during therapy with an IL‐23 inhibitor, we would like to briefly report one that occurred during therapy with an IL‐17 inhibitor.

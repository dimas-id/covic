The chronic respiratory disease of tuberculosis (TB) has become one of the most significant infectious diseases because of its high mortality. It also results in serious social and economic problems that challenge global public health. Anti-TB treatment has achieved satisfactory results; however, concurrence with other diseases such as diabetes, silicosis, malnutrition, or immunosuppressive therapy can significantly interfere with the treatment of TB. Though irregular treatment is the overriding cause of treatment failure, drug-resistant TB or severe TB and complications are also significant factors. Respiratory tract infection and respiratory failure are the leading cause of death for TB.

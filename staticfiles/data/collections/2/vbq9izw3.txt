Systemic inflammation mediated by Plasmodium parasites is central to malaria disease and its complications. Plasmodium parasites reside in erythrocytes and can theoretically reach all host tissues via the circulation. However, actual interactions between parasitized erythrocytes and host tissues, along with the consequent damage and pathological changes, are limited locally to specific tissue sites. Such tissue specificity of the parasite can alter the outcome of malaria disease, determining whether acute or chronic complications occur. Here, we give an overview of the recent progress that has been made in understanding tissue-specific immunopathology during Plasmodium infection. As knowledge on tissue-specific hostâ€“parasite interactions accumulates, better treatment modalities and targets may emerge for intervention in malaria disease.

Abstract Identification of viral B-cell epitopes is of importance in the selection of peptides for inclusion into subunit vaccines, the development of virus-specific serological tests and understanding the interaction of antibodies with viruses at a molecular level. B-cell epitopes can often be determined unequivocally by X-ray analyses of antibody-antigen complexes. This technique is, however, time-consuming and alternative strategies have now been developed for identifying epitopes. This article provides an overview of approaches which are currently available for mapping and imitating B-cell epitopes.

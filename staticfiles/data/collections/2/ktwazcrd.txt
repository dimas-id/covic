Introduction: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin is currently still debated as a potential treatment for the COVID-19 epidemic. Some studies showed discrepant results. However, timing for the treatment initiation and its setting (in-hospital or out-patient) are not consistent across studies. Methods: Monocentric retrospective study conducted from 2th March to 17th April 2020, in adults hospitalized in a tertiary hospital for COVID-19. Patients characteristics were compared between groups depending on the therapy received (HCQ/azithromycin taken [≥] 48 hours or other treatment). Outcomes were evaluated from admission, by the need for intensive care unit (ICU) support and/or death. Univariate analyses were performed using non-parametric tests and confirmed by a multiple logistic regression using Pearson correlation test. Results: Among 132 patients admitted for COVID-19 in the medicine ward, 45 received HCQ/azithromycin [≥] 48 hours, with a favorable outcome in 91.1% of cases (OR=6.2, p=0.002) versus others regimen (n=87). Groups were comparable at the baseline in terms of age, sex, comorbidities, extend in thoracic imaging, and severity. Among patients that required to be transferred to ICU (n=27) (for mechanical ventilation), median delay for transfer was 2 days (IQR 1-3). We report only 1 patient that presented an adverse event (a prolonged QT interval on EKG) that required to discontinue HCQ. Conclusion: The present study suggests a potential interest of the combination therapy using HCQ/azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 in in-hospital patients.

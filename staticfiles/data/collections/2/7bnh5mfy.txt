A wide spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations has been documented in patients suffering from coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Usually associated with a poor prognosis, these manifestations include thrombo-embolic events, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and cardiogenic shock. We describe a COVID-19 patient who presented with subacute myocardial infarction, biventricular thrombi and bilateral pulmonary emboli. Biventricular thrombi are rare, and their presence raises concern for an underlying prothrombotic condition.

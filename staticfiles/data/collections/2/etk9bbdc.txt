UNLABELLED Megalin-mediated renal retention of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs may lead to nephrotoxicity during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). The cytoprotective agent amifostine protected rats from long-term nephrotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)-octreotate. This study describes the direct effect of amifostine on kidney and tumor uptake of (111)In-DOTA,Tyr(3)-octreotate. METHODS In vivo biodistribution studies were performed using CA20948 tumor-bearing rats, with or without amifostine coadministration, via several routes. In vitro uptake was studied in somatostatin receptor-expressing CA20948 and megalin or cubilin receptor-expressing BN-16 cells, in the absence or presence of amifostine or its active metabolite WR-1065. RESULTS Coadministration of amifostine decreased renal uptake of radiolabeled octreotate in vivo, whereas tumor uptake was not affected. In agreement, amifostine and WR-1065 coincubation reduced uptake in BN-16 but not in CA20948 cells. CONCLUSION Amifostine may provide renal protection during PRRT using somatostatin analogs, both by mitigation of radiation damage and the currently observed reduction of absorbed kidney radiation dose.

ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19 disease presents a major healthcare challenge of global dimensions. Laboratory diagnostics of infected patients, and the assessment of immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus presents a major cornerstone in handling the pandemic. Currently there is an increase in demand of antibody testing and a large number of tests are already marketed or in the late stage of development. However, the interpretation of test results depends on many variables and factors, including sensitivity, specificity, potential cross-reactivity and cross-protectivity; the diagnostic value of antibodies of different isotypes, the use of antibody testing in identification of acutely ill patients or in epidemiological settings. In this article the recently established COVID-19 Task Force of the German Society for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (DGKL) addresses these issues based on the currently available datasets in this rapidly moving field.

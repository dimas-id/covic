Because other coronaviruses enter the cells by binding to dipeptidyl‐peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4), it has been speculated that DPP‐4 inhibitors (DPP‐4i) may exert an activity against SARS‐CoV‐2. In the absence of clinical trial results, we analyzed epidemiological data to support or discard such hypothesis. We retrieved information on exposure to DPP‐4i among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized for COVID‐19 at an outbreak hospital in Italy. As reference, we retrieved exposure to DPP‐4i among matched T2D patients in the same Region. Of 403 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients, 85 had T2D. The rate of exposure to DPP‐4i was similar between T2D patients with COVID‐19 (10.6%) and 14 857 matched patients in the Region (8.8%), or 793 matched patients in the local outpatient clinic (15.4%), 8284 matched patients hospitalized for other reasons (8.5%), and when comparing 71 patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 pneumonia (11.3%) to 351 matched patients with pneumonia of other etiology (10.3%). T2D patients with COVID‐19 who were on DPP‐4i had a similar disease outcome as those who were not. In summary, we found no evidence that DPP‐4i might affect hospitalization for COVID‐19.

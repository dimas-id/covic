AIM To evaluate the efficacy of ethanolic extract of Salvadora persica (S. persica) and BioPure MTAD (a mixture of a tetracycline isomer, an acid, and a detergent) in removing the intracanal smear layer of primary teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS The root canal of 40 extracted human primary anterior teeth were cleaned, shaped and grouped into experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 10). The root canals of the positive (n = 5) and the negative control (n = 5) were irrigated for 3 minutes with 5 ml of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or saline respectively. The canals in the experimental groups were irrigated for 3 minutes with 5 ml of 1 mg/ml ethanolic extract of S. persica (n = 15) or BioPure MTAD (n = 15) and then flushed with 2 ml of saline. The presence or absence of smear layer at the coronal and middle portion of each canal were examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS A significant difference (p = 0.004) in smear layer removal between S. persica and MTAD at the middle third of the canal was observed. MTAD solution was as effective as 17% EDTA in removing the smear layer. CONCLUSION MTAD was significantly more effective in smear layer removal than S. persica solution at the middle third of the canal wall. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Both tested irrigant solutions have the ability to remove the intracanal smear from primary root dentin following cleaning and shaping of the root canal and could be an alternative to EDTA.

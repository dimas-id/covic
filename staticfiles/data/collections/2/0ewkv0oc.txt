Millions of people were infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) all over the world. Data on clinical symptoms of pediatric inpatients with COVID‐19 infection were unclear. The aim of study was to investigate the clinical features of pediatric inpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to seek for studies providing details on pediatric inpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection which were published from 1‐January‐2020 to 21‐April‐2020. Studies with more than 5 pediatric inpatients were included in our meta‐analysis.This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020183550). As the results shown, fever (46%) and cough (42%) were the main clinical characters of pediatric inpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and the other clinical characters such as Diarrhea, Vomiting, Nasal congestion, and Fatigue account for 10% in pediatric inpatients. The proportion of asymptomatic cases was 0.42 (95%CI: 0.27‐0.59) and severe cases was 0.03(95%CI: 0.01‐0.06). For the laboratory result, leukopenia (21%) and lymphocytosis (22%) were the mainly indicators for pediatric inpatients, followed by high aspartate aminotransferase(AST) (19%), lymphopenia (16%), high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (15%), high C‐reactive protein (CPR) (17%), lymphopenia (16%), leukocytosis (13%), high D‐dimer (12%) and high creatine kinase‐MB (CK‐MB)(5%). Regard to chest imaging features, unilateral and bilateral accounts for 22% in pediatric inpatients, respectively. In conclusion, compared with adult inpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the pediatric inpatients had mild clinical characters, lab test indicators, and chest imaging features. More clinical studies focus on the pediatric patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in other countries should be conducted. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The mushroom Agaricus bisporus secretes biologically active compounds and proteins with benefits for human health. Most reported proteins from A. bisporus are tyrosinases and lectins. Lectins are of therapeutic or pharmaceutical interest. To date, only limited information is available on A. bisporus lectins and lectin-like proteins. No therapeutic products derived from A. bisporus lectin (ABL) are available on the market despite its extensive exploration. Recently, A. bisporus mannose-binding protein (Abmb) was discovered. Its discovery enriches the information and increases the interest in proteins with therapeutic potential from this mushroom. Furthermore, the A. bisporus genome reveals the possible occurrence of other lectins in this mushroom that may also have therapeutic potential. Most of these putative lectins belong to the same lectin groups as ABL and Abmb. Their relationship is discussed. Particular attention is addressed to ABL and Abmb, which have been explored for their potential in medicinal or pharmaceutical applications. ABL and Abmb have anti-proliferative activities toward cancer cells and a stimulatory effect on the immune system. Possible scenarios for their use in therapy and modification are also presented.

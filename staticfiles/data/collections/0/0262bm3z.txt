Publisher Summary Lectins can also be classified according to their binding specificity or selectivity with carbohydrates. This type of classification is helpful for selection of lectins as structural probes in biomedical applications. This chapter summarizes the concept and the updated information regarding the specificity-based lectin classification. Lectins are functionally classified based on their relative binding reactivities with the structural units of carbohydrate or glyco-epitopes. They are grouped according to their monosaccharide specificities and then further sub-grouped based on their reactivities with more complex structures. Carbohydrate specificities of biomedically important lectins are classified into six groups according to their specificities to monosaccharides. The chapter introduces a practical platform of carbohydrate microarrays that is useful for lectin characterization and classification. Finally, the chapter discusses a few examples to illustrate the application of this technology in lectin-related experimental investigations.

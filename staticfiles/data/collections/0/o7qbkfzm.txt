SUMMARY The explosion of vaccines during the 20th century allowed the control of numerous infectious plagues but multiple challenges oppose conservation and extension of these successes. The hesitation of modern societies in front of vaccinations requires researches in life, human and social sciences in order to reach a better understanding of vaccines mechanism of action and to improve the tolerance and acceptability of vaccines and additives. The ageing of the populations and the increase of subjects at risk also require to improve the immunogenicity and the efficiency of existing vaccines. The constant emergence of new epidemics or the development of the antibio-resistance imposes innovation and development of new vaccines. The recent difficulties faced by the development of vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis or AIDS illustrate the necessity of moving beyond classical recipes and of elaborating new vectors and new adjuvants, of better understanding the heterogeneity of vaccine immunity and of developing alternative routes of immunization. Multidisciplinary researches using the most recent advances in molecular, structural and cellular biology, in microbiology, immunology and of genetic engineering to answer these worldwide challenges.

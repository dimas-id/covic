OBJECTIVE We have previously documented the utility of calcium phosphate cement cranioplasty following retromastoid craniectomy. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate its efficacy following a supraorbital approach for tumor resection. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was conducted of eight patients (7 female, 1 male) with anterior cranial fossa meningiomas resected via a supraorbital approach followed by cranioplasty involving adjunctive or sole use of calcium phosphate cement. RESULTS Cranioplasty was achieved in all patients. No patient developed an incisional leak. The cohort had a mean follow-up of approximately 3.1 months (range: 0.5-7 months) in which time no further complications were noted. No patients developed post-surgical infections. CONCLUSION In our experience, a low incidence of infection or CSF leaks has been noted after the use of calcium phosphate cement retromastoid cranioplasty. Extending this technique to supraorbital craniotomies may minimize incisional CSF leak.

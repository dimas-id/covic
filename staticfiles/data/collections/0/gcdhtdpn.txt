This paper aimed to assess the usefulness and safety of video-EEG (video-electroencephalography) monitoring in patients with refractory epilepsy. We analysed the video-EEG recordings of consecutive patients over a 3-year period from 2002 to 2005. The pre-admission diagnosis, demographic information, number of ictal episodes, adverse events, and final diagnosis were recorded in all patients. The diagnostic labels before and after monitoring were compared in order to assess whether it had led to a change in diagnosis and management. Of the 100 patients who underwent video-EEG, 227 clinical events were recorded in 62 cases. The most common events were complex partial seizures followed by non-epileptic attacks. Video-EEG allowed a diagnosis to be made in 81 patients and the diagnosis at discharge was altered in 19 cases. Major injuries and status epilepticus did not occur during monitoring. In our experience video-EEG is safe and provides important clinical information in over 80% of patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic impacting 213 countries/territories and more than 5,934,936 patients worldwide. Cardiac injury has been reported to occur in severe and death cases. This meta-analysis was done to summarize available findings on the association between cardiac injury and severity of COVID-19 infection. Online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 20 May 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. In total, 22 studies with 3684 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases=1095 and death cases=365) were included in this study. Higher serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (weighted mean difference (WMD) =108.86 U/L, 95% confidence interval (CI)=75.93-141.79, p<0.001) and creatine kinase-MB (WMD=2.60 U/L, 95% CI=1.32-3.88, p<0.001) were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, higher serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (WMD=213.44 U/L, 95% CI=129.97-296.92, p<0.001), cardiac troponin I (WMD=26.35 pg/mL, 95% CI=14.54-38.15, p<0.001), creatine kinase (WMD=48.10 U/L, 95% CI=0.27-95.94, p = 0.049) and myoglobin (WMD=159.77 ng/mL, 95% CI=99.54-220.01, p<0.001) were associated with a significant increase in the mortality of COVID-19 infection. Cardiac injury, as assessed by serum analysis (lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase (-MB) and myoglobin), was associated with severe outcome and death from COVID-19 infection.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex remains a significant cause of calf morbidity and mortality in both dairy and beef production in the UK. The respiratory tract offers a vulnerable interphase between the animal and the viruses and commensal bacteria involved in the complex. The defence systems of the respiratory tract are described and the main factors that impair these are explained, allowing a systematic farm specific approach to the management and prevention of BRD to be developed. The article is further informed by the experience and views of four bovine practitioners.

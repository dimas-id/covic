Effective policy making based on ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent issue. We present a mathematical model describing the viral infection dynamics, which reveals two transmissibility parameters influenced by the management strategies in the area for control of the current pandemic. The parameters readily yield the peak infection rate and means for flattening the curve. Model parameters are shown to be correlated to different management strategies by employing machine learning enabling the comparison among different strategies. Treatment of population data with the model shows that restricted non-essential business closure, school closing and strictures on mass gathering influence the spread of infection. While a rational strategy for initiation of an economic reboot would call for a wider perspective of the local economics, the model can speculate on its timing based on the status of the infection as reflected by its potential for an unacceptably renewed viral onslaught.

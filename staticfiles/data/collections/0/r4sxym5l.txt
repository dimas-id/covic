At the end of December, 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was found in China. COVID-19 spreads all over 268 countries, and more than 70 000 people got infected till February 23th, 2020. COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure due to its strong infectivity and extensive spread. These severe complications are believed to be the consequence of cytokine storm caused by the virus infection. In the “Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia”, glucocorticoid is recommended as the immunosuppressive agents to prevent acute immune reaction in critical patients.

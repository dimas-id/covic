The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, well known as COVID-19 has become the current health distress to the entire world. In the pandemic scenario the research on the rapid development of new drug molecules is highly risky and tedious process. The current COVID-19 emergency demands an urgent development of possible strategies to protect people at high risk of infection and hence the drug repurposing became an emerging approach to fight COVID-19. This review summarizes an update on various therapeutic strategies with special attention on repurposing of drugs to fight against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes is one line of scientific research followed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) that have been believed to be safe through testing on early phase clinical trials have been hyped as good drug repurposing candidates. Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs such as Ribavirin, Umifenovir were advised for COVID-19 treatment. Some antibiotics may be repurposed as COVID-19 treatments such as teicoplanin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, monensin and azithromycin. Ivermectin an antiparasitic is recently repurposed. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, having immunomodulating effect on humans, have been shown to have antiviral activity at starting and post-entry stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a need for global health emergency to call for a courageous, global response at the political and governmental levels. Therefore, the regulatory agencies must act swiftly to lessen any financial obstacles involving private companies and update guidelines for drug licenses by repurposing if necessary.

In recent years edible vaccine emerged as a new concept developed by biotechnologists. Edible vaccines are subunit vaccines where the selected genes are introduced into the plants and the transgenic plant is then induced to manufacture the encoded protein. Foods under such application include potato, banana, lettuce, corn, soybean, rice, and legumes. They are easy to administer, easy to store and readily acceptable delivery system for different age group patients yet cost effective. Edible vaccines present exciting possibilities for significantly reducing various diseases such as measles, hepatitis B, cholera, diarrhea, etc., mainly in developing countries. However, various technical and regulatory challenges need to overcome in the path of this emerging vaccine technology to make edible vaccine more efficient and applicable. This chapter attempts to discuss key aspects of edible vaccines like host plants, production, mechanism of action, advantages and limitations, applications, and different regulatory issues concerned to edible vaccines.

A boy aged 6 months who presented with poor weight gain, diarrhoea, and infection with Pneumocystis carinii was found to have congenital hypogammaglobulinaemia, which did not improve despite monthly treatment with intravenous gammaglobulin. At the age of 3 years and 2 months he developed severe vomiting and diarrhoea due to cryptosporidiosis, which failed to respond to conventional treatment. Infusion of hyperimmune bovine colostrum produced against parasite antigen, given by nasogastric tube, was started after symptoms had persisted for three weeks. His vomiting and diarrhoea resolved within five days of treatment, and oocysts were no longer seen in the stools after eight days. Later, however, he developed a rare complication, and oocysts were found in the common bile duct. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum may be useful in the treatment of many patients with immunodeficiency disorders.

BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct intralesional ethanol sclerotherapy for venous malformations (VMs) with oropharyngeal involvement after a temporary tracheotomy. METHODS A retrospective assessment was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of direct intralesional ethanol sclerotherapy on 21 consecutive patients presenting with extensive VMs involving the oropharynx in the head and neck and who had undergone tracheotomy. RESULTS Of the 21 patients, 4 were treated once and 17 were treated from 2 to 5 times. The duration of follow-up was, on average, 9.1 months. Of the 21 patients, 7 (33.3%) had complete palliation, whereas the rest (66.7%) achieved partial palliation. Minor complications occurred in 12 of the 21 patients. CONCLUSION Direct intralesional ethanol sclerotherapy after a temporary tracheotomy is a safe and effective treatment for extensive VMs involving oropharyngeal areas of the head and neck.

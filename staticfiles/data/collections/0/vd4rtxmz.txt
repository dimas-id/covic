Twitter has become an instrumental source of news in emergencies where efficient access, dissemination of information, and immediate reactions are critical. Nevertheless, due to several challenges, the current fully-automated processing methods are not yet mature enough for deployment in real scenarios. In this dissertation, I focus on tackling the lack of context problem by studying automatic geo-location techniques. I specifically aim to study the Location Mention Prediction problem in which the system has to extract location mentions in tweets and pin them on the map. To address this problem, I aim to exploit different techniques such as training neural models, enriching the tweet representation, and studying methods to mitigate the lack of labeled data. I anticipate many downstream applications for the Location Mention Prediction problem such as incident detection, real-time action management during emergencies, and fake news and rumor detection among others.

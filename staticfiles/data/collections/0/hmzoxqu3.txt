Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a form of heart lung bypass that is used to support neonates, pediatrics, and adult patients with cardiorespiratory failure for days or weeks till organ recovery or transplantation. Venoarterial (VA) and venovenous (VV) ECLS are the most common modes of support. ECLS circuit components and monitoring have been evolving over the last 40 years. The technology is safer, simpler, and more durable with fewer complications. The use of neonatal respiratory ECLS use has been declining over the last two decades, while adult respiratory ECLS is growing especially since the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. This review provides an overview of ECLS evolution over the last four decades, its use in neonatal, pediatric and adults, description of basic principles, circuit components, complications, and outcomes as well as a quick look into the future.

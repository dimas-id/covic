This review highlights the ultrasound findings reported from a number of studies and case reports and discusses the unifying findings from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and from the avian (H7N9) and H1N1 influenza epidemics. We discuss the potential role for portable point-of-care ultrasound (PPOCUS) as a safe and effective bedside option in the initial evaluation, management, and monitoring of disease progression in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.

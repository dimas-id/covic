Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) refers to persistent, chronic pain following spinal surgery. Spinal cord stimulation with dorsal epidural leads can be used to treat back and leg pain in FBSS patients. This paper presents a detailed protocol for using spinal cord stimulation with surgical leads in FBSS patients. In our department, with the patient under general anesthesia, we place the lead in the epidural space by means of a small laminectomy at the 10th thoracic level. Placement of the lead is followed by a 1 month trial period with an externalized lead. If pain relief is greater than 50% at the end of this 1 month stimulation trial (required by Belgian reimbursement criteria), an internal pulse generator is then placed under the skin and connected to the lead in a second surgical procedure. We have demonstrated that using this technique in rigorously selected FBSS patients can significantly improve back pain, leg pain, patient activity, and quality of life for a sustained period of time.

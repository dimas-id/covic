COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused by Severe Adult Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently the role of HCQ in COVID-19 remains controversial but HCQ continued to be used in the absence of any effective therapy. We showed that cardiac conduction abnormalities were common in patients with HCQ added on to lopinavir/ritonavir. After starting HCQ, there were 5 (45.5%) new events of which four (36.3%) were attributed to HCQ: QTc prolongations in 3 patients with additional development of conduction blocks (fascicular block and right bundle brunch block in one patient respectively) and one patient with bradycardia. All conduction abnormalities settled after discontinuation of HCQ. Therefore monitoring is recommended when considering HCQ in treating patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Contact tracing is a key tool in the fight against COVID-19. Its effectiveness depends on the ability of traced contacts to quarantine and then isolate on symptom onset. We show that these factors crucially affect the reduction in the effective transmission number, but make it difficult to measure the effectiveness of the system using routinely collected data. This implies that provision of universal support systems to enable people to quarantine and isolate effectively, coupled with investment in trained public health professionals to undertake contact tracing, are crucial to success. We predict that a high-quality, rapid contact tracing system with strong support structures in place, combined with moderate social distancing measures, is required to contain the spread of COVID-19.

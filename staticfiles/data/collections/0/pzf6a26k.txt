The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is the worst healthcare emergency of this century, and its impact on pediatrics and neonatology is still largely unknown. The European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) launched the EPICENTRE (ESPNIC Covid pEdiatric Neonatal Registry) international, multicenter, and multidisciplinary initiative to study the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. EPICENTRE background and aims are presented together with protocol details. EPICENTRE is open to centers all over the world, and this will allow to provide a pragmatic picture of the epidemic, with a particular attention to pediatric and neonatal critical care issues.Conclusions: EPICENTRE will allow researchers to clarify the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, refining its clinical management and hopefully providing new insights for clinicians. What is Known: â¢ COVID19 is the new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is spreading around the globe. â¢ Majority of data available about SARS-CoV-2 infections originates from adult patients. What is New: â¢ EPICENTRE is the first international, multicenter, multidisciplinary, meta-data driven, hospital-based, online, prospective cohort registry dedicated to neonatal and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections. â¢ EPICENTRE will allow to understand epidemiology and physiopathology of COVID19.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that control a multitude of critical processes in mammalian cells. Increasing evidence has emerged that host miRNAs serve in animal cells to restrict viral infections. In turn, many viruses encode RNA silencing suppressors (RSS) which are employed to moderate the potency of the cellâ€™s miRNA selection against viral replication. Some viruses also encode viral miRNAs. In this review, we summarize findings from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that illustrate examples of host cell miRNAs that target the viruses, of RSS encoded by viruses, and of host cell miRNA profile changes that are seen in infected cells.

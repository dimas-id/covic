We continue to learn about cardiac involvement in patients with COVID-19. These patients can develop acute coronary syndrome and severe myocarditis with a reduced ejection fraction. We describe two critically ill COVID-19 patients who developed ST elevation that resolved on repeat ECG without any intervention. LEARNING POINT: ST elevation may occur in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

The twin impacts of pandemic disease and severe economic repercussions of lockdown have led us to call for creation of a rapid vaccine rollout infrastructure to support medicine which is the front line of biodefense. There will be other, and worse pandemics to come, some of which are likely to be man-made. So we need increased surveillance of both human and animal diseases. We also call for recognition that economic damage can be as great as, or more severe than, the pandemic itself, which needs to be taken into account when weighing risk of withholding vaccines. We discuss how in the modern world, we know enough to make and deploy safe vaccines in as little as a few weeks. There are multiple types of vaccines now, and each type should be handled differently. We have nucleotide (RNA & DNA), component protein, killed, whole killed, live recombinant, and live attenuated vaccines today. Particularly in a crisis, nucleotide vaccines can be released immediately. Component, killed, and whole killed can also be rolled out rapidly. Live vaccines can be examined and released much more quickly than they are. This is not 1955, we know far more about vaccines and immunology today. For those advocating for increased longevity, pandemic response strategy is as important as any possible treatments to extend life span. #ReleaseTheVacc.

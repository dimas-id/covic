OBJECTIVE To assess the long-term outcome of computed tomography-guided radiofrequency ablation (CT-guided RFA) in patients with suspected osteoid osteoma (OO). MATERIALS AND METHODS Single-center retrospective study. Patients with clinical suspicion and imaging diagnosis of osteoid osteoma were treated by CT-guided RFA using the same device with either a 7- or 10-mm active tip electrode. Specific precautions were applied in case of articular or spinal OO. Patients were contacted by phone to evaluate the long-term outcome in terms of pain, ability to perform daily activities (including sports), and long-term complications. Success was defined as the absence of residual pain and ability to perform daily activities normally. RESULTS From 2008 to 2015, 126 patients were treated by CT-guided RFA for OO in our institution. Mean patient age was 26.1 years (SD = 11, range 1-53); mean delay to diagnosis was 16.9 months (SD = 15.2, range 1-120). Among patients who answered the follow-up call (n = 88), the overall success rate was 94.3%: 79/88 (89.8%) had primary success of the procedure, and 4/88 (4.5%) had a secondary success (repeat-RFA after pain recurrence). Mean follow-up time was 34.6 months (SD = 24.7, range 3-90). Few complications occurred: two mild reversible peripheral nerve injuries, one brachial plexus neuropathy, one broken electrode tip fragment, and one muscular hematoma. CONCLUSION Osteoid osteoma can be effectively and safely treated by CT-guided RFA using the presented ablation protocol. Beneficial effects of the treatment persist at long-term follow-up.

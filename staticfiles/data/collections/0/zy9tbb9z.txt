BACKGROUND Ileostomy closure is an operation with an underappreciated morbidity, including surgical-site infection, small bowel obstruction and anastomotic leakage. Surgical-site infections, in particular, are a frequent occurrence following closure of contaminated wounds. This randomized controlled trial compared a purse-string closure technique with conventional linear closure. METHODS Sixty-one patients were randomized to conventional or purse-string closure of ileostomy wounds. The primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical-site infection, including infections requiring hospital or community treatment. RESULTS Purse-string closure resulted in fewer surgical-site infections than conventional closure: two of 30 versus 12 of 31 respectively (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION The purse-string method results in a clinically relevant reduction in surgical-site infections after ileostomy closure.

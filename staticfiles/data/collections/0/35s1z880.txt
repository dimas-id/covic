In earth science education, observation of field geological phenomena is very important. Due to China's huge student population, it is difficult to guarantee education fairness and teaching quality in field teaching. Specimens are indispensable geo-education resources. However, the specimen cabinet or picture specimen library has many limitations and it is difficult to meet the internet-spirit or geo-teaching needs. Based on photo modeling, this research builds a 3D Geo-Resource Sharing Library (3DGRSL) for Geo-Education. It uses the Cesium engine and data-oriented distributed architecture to provide the educational resources to many universities. With Browser/Server (B/S) architecture, the system can realize multi-terminal and multi-scenario access of mobile phones, tablets, VR, PC, indoor, outdoor, field, providing a flexible and convenient way for preserving and sharing scientific information about geo-resources. This makes sense to students who cannot accept field teaching in under-funded colleges, and the ones with mobility problems. Tests and scoring results show that 3DGRSL is a suitable solution for displaying and sharing geological specimens. Which is of great significance for the sustainable use and protection of geoscience teaching resources, the maintenance of the right to fair education, and the construction of virtual simulation solutions in the future.

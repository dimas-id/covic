The relationship between right ventricular (RV) function and cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity and cerebral oxygenation was assessed in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Echocardiographic, transcranial Doppler, and hemodynamic data from 37 neonates with moderate-severe HIE + TH were reviewed. Twenty healthy newborns served as controls. Cardiac dysfunction in HIE + TH was characterized by a predominant RV dysfunction, with concomitantly reduced CBF velocity. A significant correlation was found between CBF velocity and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV output (RVO), and stroke volume (SVRV), as well as with left ventricular output and stroke volume. Brain oxygenation (rSO2) correlated significantly with RVO, SVRV, TAPSE, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, whereas cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEc) correlated with RVO, SVRV, RV myocardial performance index, and superior vena cava flow. CBF velocity and cerebral NIRS correlations were stronger with parameters of right ventricular performance.Conclusion: CBF velocity and brain oxygenation correlate predominantly with RV function in HIE + TH. This suggests a preferential contribution of RV performance to cerebral hemodynamics in this context.What is Known:• Neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy frequently exhibit alterations of cardiac function and cerebral blood flow.• These are considered organ-specific consequences of perinatal asphyxia.What is New:• We show that cerebral blood flow velocity and brain oxygenation are correlated predominantly with right ventricular function during therapeutic hypothermia.• This suggests a potential direct contribution of right ventricular performance to cerebral hemodynamics in this context.

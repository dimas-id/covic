Enteric drainage (ED) using duodenojejunostomy (DJ) is an established technique in pancreatic transplantation. Duodenoduodenostomy (DD), an alternative ED technique, may provide unique advantages over DJ. We compared our experience with these two types of ED through a retrospective review of all pancreas transplants performed at our institution from November 2007 to November 2009. The allograft duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient jejunum or duodenum. Duodenal drainage was performed by a stapled or hand-sewn technique. Patient demographics, operative times, major post-operative complications, and graft survival data were analyzed. Of 57 pancreas transplants, DJ was performed in 36 patients, stapled DD in 14 patients, and hand-sewn DD in seven patients. Two DD grafts (9.5%) thrombosed compared with no DJ grafts (p = NS). Enteric leak and small-bowel obstruction occurred in 3 of 36 DJ patients and in two DD patients (p = NS). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred more frequently in stapled DD compared with DJ (4 vs. 0, p < 0.015). In conclusion, DD is technically feasible with no increase in operative time or enteric complications. GI bleeding rates appear to be higher following DD (stapled) technique. Potential complications of DD should be balanced against the benefits conferred by this technique.

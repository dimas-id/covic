Imaging techniques were used to document and monitor physical damage to the unique wall paintings at the Ch√¢teau de Germolles, Burgundy, France. Photogrammetry combined with scanning are the most appropriate techniques to monitor the evolution of microcrack networks in the cornice overhanging the paintings and preserved as a witness to 19th century additions. However, the application of these techniques was challenged due to the given constraints of a working height of 4 m and the required accuracy of a tenth of a millimetre. A special effort was therefore necessary to ensure sufficient stability of the acquisition protocol and to make it relevant during the four measurement campaigns planned over the two years of the project. The analysis of photogrammetric data has made it possible to document certain macro-deformations of the cornice according to the seasons of the year. The microcracks could be visualized and monitored from transformed 3D models of each segment for the different campaigns. The results obtained show only local movements, mainly on the walls that are most exposed to the specific climatic conditions of each season.

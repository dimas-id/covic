OBJECTIVE To study the influence of the acute blood gas analysis index change on the prognosis of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS Artery blood gas analysis indexes were determined in 38 of 103 cases of SARS patients during acute stage, the relationship between the change of blood gas analysis index and prognosis of patients with SARS was analyzed. RESULTS The lower partical pressure of carbon dioxide in artery (PaCO2), partical pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) in blood was, the higher death rate was. pH in blood had no significant influence on the prognosis of SARS patients. The prognosis of SARS patients were worse and the death rate was higher when patient had two or more acid-base disturbance. CONCLUSION The artery blood gas analysis is useful for judging the conditions and prognosis of patients with SARS, and is beneficial for clinical treatment.

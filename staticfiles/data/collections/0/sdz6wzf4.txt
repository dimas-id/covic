Abstract Measurement is at the core of the research process. At the PhD level, students need to develop an in-depth understanding of measures relevant to their area of work and refine their knowledge of measurement issues. Traditionally, measurement coursework in Nursing focused on the psychometric evaluation of instruments measuring cognition and behavior. However, in the age of Big Data, precision medicine, and translational science, PhD students need to develop knowledge and skills relevant to these fields and to collaborate with experts from the different disciplines. Therefore, Nursing faculty need to recognize the state-of-the-science of nursing research and tend to a variety of measurement issues across a spectrum of operationalized concepts. Herein we present an overview of learning outcomes, instructional content and methods of delivery for a contemporary PhD-level course on measurement for Nursing Science. We also present our experience in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel PhD measurement course.

We describe the case of a 61-year-old patient with significant medical co-morbidities and tortuous vascular anatomy presenting with a large middle cerebral artery aneurysm. To avoid the risks of general anesthesia and circumvent a majority of the tortuous vessels, the aneurysm was accessed by direct open exposure of the common carotid artery under conscious sedation and local anesthesia. We were able to achieve complete endovascular occlusion of the aneurysm and the patient tolerated the procedure well with no intra- or post-operative complications. Use of conscious sedation is possible and safe for direct open common carotid artery access in patients with significant vascular tortuosity that makes the standard trans-femoral approach difficult or impossible.

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is the only known human satellite virus, and it requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) to form infectious particles. Until 2018 HDV was the sole representative of the genus Deltavirus. The subsequent identification of HDV-like agents in non-human hosts indicated a much longer evolutionary history of deltaviruses than previously hypothesized. Interestingly, none of the HDV-like agents were found in co-infection with an HBV-like agent suggesting that these viruses use different helper virus(es). Here we show, using snake deltavirus (SDeV), that HBV represents only a single example of helper viruses for deltaviruses. We cloned the SDeV genome into a mammalian expression plasmid, and by transfection could initiate SDeV replication in cultured snake and mammalian cells. By superinfecting SDeV infected cells with arenaviruses, or by transfecting different viral surface proteins, we could induce infectious SDeV particle production. Our findings indicate that deltaviruses can likely use a multitude of helper viruses or even viral glycoproteins to form infectious particles. Persistent and recurrent infections would be beneficial for the spread of deltaviruses. It seems plausible that new human and veterinary disease associations with deltavirus infections will be identified in the future.

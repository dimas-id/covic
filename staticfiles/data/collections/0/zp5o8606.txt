Abstract This paper discusses fatigue life prediction of laser and mechanically formed commercially pure grade 2 titanium alloy plates. It should be noted that predicting fatigue damage for structural components is a complex issue that needs various factors involved in fatigue analysis to be taken into account. This paper looked at available fatigue life prediction theories as a start which then helped formulate and develop the fatigue life prediction analysis used in this study. The predicted fatigue life was not off the mark as it also incorporated the effects of residual stresses which are usually disregarded in studies of this nature. The validity of the fatigue life prediction concept is shown with the aid of calculations versus actual fatigue data results. The results show fatigue life prediction that is stable and less erratic on certain irradiation parameters, while other formed components behaved in a predictable manner. Fatigue life prediction analysis is a challenging undertaking and the behavior of benchmarking components is explained and possible reasons for this elucidated.

Abstract To determine if individuals with allergic rhinitis are hyperresponsive to upper respiratory tract viral infections, 20 allergic and 18 nonallergic, susceptible, adult volunteers were challenged and infected with rhinovirus type 39 before the pollen seasons. Before challenge and on each of 6 days of cloister, all volunteers were interviewed for symptoms and completed a test battery consisting of evaluations of secretion production by weighed tissues, nasal patency by active posterior rhinomanometry, nasal clearance by the dyed saccharin technique, pulmonary function by spirometry, eustachian tube function by sonotubometry, and middle ear status by tympanometry. The symptomatology and pathophysiology resulting from the rhinovirus infection were consistent with those reported in previous studies with this challenge system. Between-group comparisons revealed no differences in symptom presentation, nasal secretion production, or overall pathophysiologic response. However, for decreased mucociliary clearance rate, increased nasal congestion, eustachian tube dysfunction, and symptoms of sneezing, the allergic group demonstrated an earlier onset compared with that of the nonallergic group. The biologic significance of the differences in onset of dysfunction is tempered by the observation that the temporal pattern of responses in the allergic group was similar with that of nonallergic subjects in previous studies. The results of the present study do not support the hypothesis of a physiologic hyperresponsiveness to rhinovirus type 39 infection in allergic subjects during nonallergy seasons.

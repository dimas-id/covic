BACKGROUND: We aim to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotional symptoms, identify gender differences, and study the relationship between the emotional state and environmental features in the elderly. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. RESULTS: 1639 [150 (9.2%) aged ≥60] participants completed the survey. The ≥60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the <60 group [3.02 (3.28) vs. 4.30 (4.93)]; and lower mean (SD) ASDI scores than the <60 group [3.68 (3.20) vs. 4.45 (3.06)]. There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. CONCLUSIONS: Older people has shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women. Economic loss and substance use should be monitored to guarantee the emotional well-being of the elderly.

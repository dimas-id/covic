Ventilation systems for commercial airliner cabins are important in reducing contaminant transport and maintaining thermal comfort. To evaluate the performance of a personalized displacement ventilation system, a conventional displacement ventilation system, and a mixing ventilation system, this study first used the Wells-Riley equation integrated with CFD to obtain the SARS quanta value based on a specific SARS outbreak on a flight. This investigation then compared the three ventilation systems in a seven-row section of a fully occupied, economy-class cabin in Boeing 737 and Boeing 767 airplanes. The SARS quanta generation rate obtained for the index patient could be used in future studies. For all the assumed source locations, the passengers' infection risk by air in the two planes was the highest with the mixing ventilation system, while the conventional displacement ventilation system produced the lowest risk. The personalized ventilation system performed the best in maintaining cabin thermal comfort and can also reduce the infection risk. This system is recommended for airplane cabins.

OBJECTIVE To determine if there is a difference in the amounts of air (A), low-viscosity fluid (LV), or high-viscosity fluid (HV) that can be aspirated from the pleural cavity of canine cadavers using small-bore (SB) or large-bore (LB) thoracostomy tubes. DESIGN Prospective experimental ex vivo study. SETTING University teaching hospital. ANIMALS Thirty-six canine cadavers. INTERVENTIONS Each cadaver was randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups (SB-A, LB-A, SB-LV, LB-LV, SB-HV, LB-HV). In each cadaver bilateral thoracostomy tubes (either SB or LB) were placed and 20 mL/kg of air, LV fluid, or HV fluid was instilled via 1 thoracostomy tube. Both tubes were aspirated and the volume aspirated was recorded and analyzed as a percentage of instilled air or fluid volume. The procedure was repeated on the contralateral hemithorax. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There was no significant difference in air or fluid recovery when SB and LB groups were compared. Median (range) air recovery volumes in the SB-A and LB-A groups were 101.5% (94.4-115.8%) and 102.8% (94.1-107.8%), respectively (P = 0.898). Recovery of LV fluid was 93.5% (79.2-99.0%) for SB-LV and 85.8% (77.1-101.8%) for LB-LV cadavers (P = 0.305) and recovery percentages of HV fluid were 92.6% (86.1-96.2%) and 91.4% (74.2-96.4%) for SB-HV and LB-HV groups, respectively (P > 0.999). There was no significant difference between SB and LB groups when all substances were combined (94.1% [79.2-115.8%] and 93.5% [74.2-107.8%], respectively, P = 0.557). CONCLUSIONS SB and LB thoracostomy tubes demonstrated similar efficacy in removing known amounts of air, LV fluid, and HV fluid from the pleural space of canine cadavers. Further study is necessary to determine if SB and LB thoracostomy tubes demonstrate similar efficacy in clinical veterinary patients.

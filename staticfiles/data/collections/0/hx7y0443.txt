ABSTRACT: New series of Schiffâ€™s bases, hydrazones, thiosemicarbazones, thiazoles, and thiocarbohydrazones of 5-fluoroisatin were synthesized by the reaction of 5-fluoroisatin with primary amines, hydrazine hydrate, and thiocarbohydrazides. Thiosemicarbazones were prepared by reacting hydrazone derivatives with isothiocyanates. Upon treatment of thiosemicarbazone derivatives with chloroacetone, the thiazole derivatives were obtained. Some of the prepared compounds exhibited antiviral activity. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]

We have read the short communication "Oral vesiculobullous lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection" (Martin Carreras-Presas, Amaro Sanchez, Lopez-Sanchez, Jane-Salas, & Somacarrera Perez, 2020) by Dr. Mart√≠n Carreras-Presas et al. with great interest. We congratulate the team for contributing to the knowledge about this devastating infection in such challenging times. However, we raise some concerns that must be addressed.

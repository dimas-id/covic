Responding to the will of the people or the will of the government after a focusing event is complex and fraught with perils; this is none more so than after a major disaster that has brought on the sudden death of many people or the initial incalculable destruction of property or the environment. Korea has experienced several of these types of focusing events that have had major social and policy implications between the years 1948 and 2015. We analyzed them to glean their impact on disaster response policy, organizational and law reform, and first response and national countermeasures â€“ and presented them in a clear and logical array so that the information could lead to a new type of disaster management model. Additionally, we look at how these focusing events altered the political, policy alternative and problem streams, as well as media coverage and policy change in the wake of the focusing event. And finally, we analyze disaster-triggered policy change in Korea to find out if the relation between the focusing event and institutional reforms for disaster response is path-dependent.

Arterial hypertension is the most common comorbid disease in patients who died as a result of SARS-Cov-2 infection Numerous observational studies indicate a relationship between arterial hypertension and its treatment and SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus infection It is known from experimental studies that SARS-Cov-2 enters the cells by interacting with the ACE2 enzyme, while it is not known whether ACE2 is the only factor that allows the virus to enter the cell There is no clear evidence of a link between the use of medications such as ACE and ARB and an increased risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection It has been shown that the use of recombinant ACE2 can be potentially beneficial in COVID-19 therapy by limiting the entry of the virus into the cell Blood glucose as well as lipid profile should be monitored during SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus infection This article attempts to gather key information on arterial hypertension and COVID-19

PURPOSE To compare the outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery for totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (SILS-TEP) and conventional three-port totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 137 patients (SILS-TEP, 100; conventional TEP, 37) scheduled to undergo elective inguinal hernia from January 2011 to July 2013 at Osaka Police Hospital. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the patient demographics. There were no significant differences in the length of the operation between the two groups (SILS-TEP group, 93 min vs. conventional TEP group, 92 min for unilateral hernias, p = 0.8; SILS-TEP group, 142 min vs. conventional TEP, 128 min for bilateral hernias, p = 0.4). The postoperative hospital stay, total medical charge for the hospital stay and the numerical rating scale before and 3 months after surgery were comparable in both groups. Two cases treated by SILS-TEP repair were converted to conventional three-port TEP repair (one case) and mesh-plug method (one case). The postoperative complications were comparable in both groups, and these were managed conservatively. One recurrence (2 %, 1/37) developed in the conventional TEP group, compared with 0 recurrences (0/100) in the SILS-TEP group. CONCLUSIONS SILS-TEP repair seems to be safe and feasible, with no significant differences in the total medical charges for the hospital stay or the postoperative pain score 3 months after surgery compared with conventional three-port TEP repair.

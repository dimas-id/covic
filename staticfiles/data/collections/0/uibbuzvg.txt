Barrett's esophagus (BE) is more common in developed countries. Endoscopic therapy is an effective treatment method in management of dysplastic BE. Ablation by thermal energy, freezing, or photochemical injury completely eradicates dysplasia and specialized intestinal metaplasia resulting in neosquamation of esophagus. Among the ablative modalities, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most studied with safe, effective, and durable long-term outcomes. Cryotherapy, argon plasma coagulation, and photodynamic therapy can be offered in select patients when RFA is unavailable, has failed, or is contraindicated. Future research on natural disease progression, biomarkers, advanced imaging, and application of endoscopic techniques will lead to better clinical outcomes for BE-associated neoplasia.

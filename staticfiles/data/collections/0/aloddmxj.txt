BACKGROUND: Despite medical advances, we are often unable to rapidly protect non-immune populations from infectious agents. Passive immunotherapy is a fast method of protection, but large-scale administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in unpractical. The delivery of mAbs using a viral vector can be an attractive alternative to direct mAbs injection. Integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV) have several advantages including the absence of pre-existing anti-vector immunity and the safety features of non-integration and non-replication. IDLV are maintained in non-dividing cells, and can express steady levels of functional proteins in vivo. We engineered IDLV to express mAbs against the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin, and tested their ability to protect from IAV in vivo. METHODS: IDLV were produced by co-transfection of transfer, packaging, and envelope plasmids in 293T cells and purification on sucrose gradients. IDLV were normalized using a colorimetric reverse transcriptase assay. Plasmid expressing mAb VN04-2 was provided by B. Hanson. mAb in the supernatant of transduced cells were detected by western blot and quantified by the Easy-Titer Human IgG Assay Kit. For in vivo studies, groups of 6â€“8 weeks old mice received IDLV either by intranasal (in) or intramuscular (im) route. mAb production was detected by western blot and ELISA. Mice were challenged using the recombinant IAV VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG derived from IAV A/Vietnam/1203/2004. RESULTS: We engineered IDLV producing the humanized mAb VN04-2 (IDLV-VN4-2), which is broadly neutralizing against H5 IAV. We found that after transduction of 293T cell with different dosages IDLV-VN4-2, the production of mAb was time and dose dependent. mAb were also functional, and bind specifically H5 HA but not other IAV proteins. We also measured VN04-2 production in the serum of mice 3, 6, 9, 14, 21 and 30 days after in or im administration of IDLV-VN4-2. We found that levels of mAb were sustained. In separate experiments 5/5 mice receiving IDLV-VN4-2 by the in route and 2/5 mice receiving it by the im route were protected from lethal IAV challenge. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IDLV may represent an attractive candidate for vector-mediated immunization against infectious disease. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.

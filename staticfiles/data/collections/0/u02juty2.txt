During the COVID‐19 outbreak that took place in early 2020, the economic activities in China were drastically reduced and accompanied by a strong reduction in the emission of primary air pollutants. On the basis of measurements made at the monitoring stations operated by the China National Environmental Monitoring Center, we quantify the reduction in surface PM(2.5), NO(2), CO and SO(2) concentrations in northern China during the lockdown, which started on 23 January 2020. We find that, on the average, the levels of surface PM(2.5) and NO(2) have decreased by approximately 35 and 60 percent, respectively, between the period 1‐22 January 2020 and the period 23 January‐29 February 2020. At the same time, the mean ozone concentration has increased by a factor 1.5–2. In urban area of Wuhan, where drastic measures were adopted to limit the spread of the coronavirus, similar changes in the concentrations of PM(2.5), NO(2) and ozone are found.

Current evidence highlights the importance of developing a healthy intestinal microbiota in the neonate. Many aspects that promote health or disease are related to the homeostasis of these intestinal microbiota. Their delicate equilibrium could be strongly influenced by the intervention that physicians perform as part of the medical care of the neonate, especially preterm infants. As awareness of the importance of the development and maintenance of these intestinal flora increase and newer molecular techniques are developed, it will be possible to provide better care of infants with interventions that will have long-lasting effects.

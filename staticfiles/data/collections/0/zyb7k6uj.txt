Primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in children typically presents as infectious mononucleosis and in immunocompetent individuals severe pneumonitis proves to be a rare complication. Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is associated with multiple life-threatening conditions, including interstitial lung disease with fibrosis and lymphoid and lymphohistiocytic infiltrations. We report on a pediatric patient in whom CAEBV resulted in severe pneumopathy with a fatal outcome.

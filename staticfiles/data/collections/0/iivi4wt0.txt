Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) vaccines are among the most advanced vaccines for COVID-19 under development. The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) has prepared a standardized template to describe the key considerations for the benefit-risk assessment of nucleic acid vaccines. This will facilitate the assessment by key stakeholders of potential safety issues and understanding of overall benefit-risk. The structured assessment provided by the template can also help improve communication and public acceptance of licensed nucleic acid vaccines.

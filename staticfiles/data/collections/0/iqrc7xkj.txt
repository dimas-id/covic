Our health care landscape is rapidly changing. With the aging population and seemingly increasing outbreak of communicable diseases, it is expected that there will be a continued demand for inpatient/critical care providers. The current COVID-19 pandemic provides a glimpse of a health care system in severe provider shortage. Adult-gerontology acute nurse practitioners (GACNPs) can play a vital part in relieving that shortage. But with the increased role, there is an increased responsibility and need for expansion of AGACNP skill set. This includes the training and utilization of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). The case reports and data available from countries that have already combated COVID-19 outbreak show POCUS can play a key part in managing critically ill patients on isolation precautions. This article provides my perspective on POCUS training and competency achievement for AGACNPPs.

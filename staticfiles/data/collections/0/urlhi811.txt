In this paper, we investigate a special case of an open problem that is related to the exchange principle, a property of fuzzy implications. We focus on the cases of (S,N)– implications and the preservation of the exchange principle via lattice operations. We present and prove some sufficient conditions such that the exchange principle is preserved under the join and meet operations if we use (S,N)– implications.

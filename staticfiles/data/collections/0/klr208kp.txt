ABSTRACT Introduction As part of the COVID-19 outbreak response, numerous technology-based solutions have been created to enable contact tracing, track movements of the population and ensure social control. Wearable biometric bracelets are widespread and commonly used in the form of wrist-worn activity trackers that are both familiar and liked by the general population. Objectives/Study Design/Methods The authors propose an innovative approach - a wearable bracelet that can be used to curb the spread of Covid-19. The bracelet would facilitate 3 functions; screening on a population level, digital contact tracing and real-time immunity status tracking. Results/Conclusions Utilising the Internet of Things, data would then be transfer over a network to interactive web-based dashboard and big data analytics employed to augment response within a defined geographic region.

The development of cross-section imaging increased the number of diagnosed pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs). Many of these lesions, located frequently in the body or tail of the organ, require resection. We present three cases of patients undergoing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy because of PCNs, describing the technique along with the post-operative course. The reviewed literature confirms the benefits of the laparoscopic approach, yet it lacks randomized, controlled trials. We also present two spleen-preserving surgical techniques - with and without ligation of the splenic vessels. Both of these procedures can be performed with laparoscopy or laparotomy, but there is no consensus which should be the method of choice.

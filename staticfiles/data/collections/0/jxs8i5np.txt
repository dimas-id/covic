BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a major complication leading to death after stroke. The risk factors of pneumonia in convalescent patients who have experienced stroke remain poorly defined. METHODS: To identify the risk factors of pneumonia, we applied logistic regression as a statistical method using SPSS23.0 statistical software, based on a sample of 380 patients. And statistical description method was used to analyze pathogens’ characteristics and drug resistance. RESULTS: Ultimately, the obtained logistic model has statistical significance (χ(2)(13) = 91.560, P <0.0005). The sensitivity of the model is 41.7%, the specificity is 97.6%, the positive predictive value is 76.9%, and the negative predictive value is 89.8%. The Barthel index (BI) (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.87), basic lung diseases (OR=4.24, 95% CI: 1.02-17.61), trachea ventilation (OR=6.56, 95% CI: 1.18-36.34), feeding tube (OR=6.06, 95% CI: 2.59-14.18), and hypoproteinemia (OR=3.97, 95% CI: 1.56-10.10) were statistically significant (P<0.05). Among patients who have pneumonia, the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungal infection is 10.00%, 54.29%, 5.71% respectively. The study most frequently isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.57%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.00%,) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.00%). The drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics ranged from 0.00-37.77%, 0.00-85.71% and 0.00-57.14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lower BI scores, basic lung diseases, trachea ventilation, tube feeding, and hypoproteinemia are independent risk factors of pneumonia among convalescent patients with stroke. The main pathogens that caused pneumonia were gram-negative bacteria, and such organisms have different degrees of resistance to drugs.

Over the past decade biophysics has become an established discipline in HTS hit triaging, owing to its high fidelity in detecting protein-ligand interactions. Many pharma companies are using biophysical techniques to filter HTS output for false positives, as will be discussed in this review. Moreover, I will demonstrate how the earlier application of biophysics, already at the HTS assay development stage, is potentially even more impactful. Two key areas here are early mode-of-action studies and ensuring that the HTS assay and subsequent cascade are fit for purpose. Top-level results from 20 in-house projects are shown to underpin the impact of these studies.

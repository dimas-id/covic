BACKGROUND Acute appendicitis is the most common emergency in abdominal surgery, but remains a continuing controversy regarding the most appropriate method of removing the inflamed appendix. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2002 to December 2012, 1037 women underwent appendectomy (average age: 25±15.7 y; range: 6 to 91 y). Of these, 519 underwent open appendectomy (OA) and 518 underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). For all the patients we determined the postoperative hospital stay, the eventual readmissions within 30 days after discharge, the length of surgical procedures (data were available only for the period from January 2008 to December 2012), the costs for the OA and LA, and the rate of negative appendicitis. RESULTS In our cohort of patients, 189 women (18.2%) had a negative appendectomy. Considering the postoperative hospital stay (average: 4.2±3.6 d; range: 1 to 32 d in OA group and average: 3.9±3.1 d; range: 1 to 21 d in LA group; P=0.15) there were no statistical differences between 2 groups. The average length of surgical procedures in LA group was 42.3±18.4 minutes (range: 8 to 135 min) and 43.2±19 minutes in the OA group (range: 10 to 135 min) (P=0.63). The average net cost of LA was 1203.61 euros, whereas for OA it was 95.18 euros. In this study, we considered only the surgical materials. CONCLUSIONS LAs are not associated with a lower complication rate than the OAs and, above all, LAs are more expensive than OAs. Also we believe that laparoscopic approach should be used only in case of unclear abdominal pain and not for the treatment of clear acute and uncomplicated appendicitis.

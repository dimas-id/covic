CONTEXT: Limited access to opioids for cancer patients has been reported as a potential unintended consequence of recent regulations restricting opioid use and prescribing practices. To our knowledge, there are a limited number of peer-reviewed studies that evaluate cancer patients' perceived difficulties when filling their opioid prescription. To understand these difficulties, we surveyed patients receiving opioids in our outpatient Supportive Care Center (SCC). OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate cancer patients' perceptions of overall difficulties when filling their opioid prescription. Secondary objectives included determining associations between patient characteristics and difficulty, and comparing difficulty between filling opioid and non-opioid prescriptions. METHODS: Cancer patients receiving opioids that had been seen two times or more at our SCC were asked to complete a survey. The information collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and patients' experiences filling their opioid prescription. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 60 years; 54% were female and 69% were white. Forty-four patients (32%) reported that they have experienced difficulty filling their opioid prescription. More than 25% of those 44 patients perceived difficulty from interactions with the pharmacy/pharmacist. Forty-six patients (33%) reported more difficulty filling their opioid prescriptions than filling their non-opioid prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that patients with cancer visiting our SCC perceived difficulties obtaining their opioid prescriptions. The results suggest that negative interactions with the pharmacy/pharmacist contributes to their perceived difficulty. Additional research is needed to further characterize the contributors of the difficulties cancer patients face in filling their opioid prescriptions.

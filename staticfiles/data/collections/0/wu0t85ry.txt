RATIONALE The etiology and outcome of diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis (DAIB) in adults is not well known. OBJECTIVES To retrospectively review adult patients with DAIB without pneumonia, document the etiologies and outcomes, and assess the relation between DAIB and postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 1,664 patients with lower respiratory tract infections admitted to our institution in Saitama, Japan. DAIB was diagnosed when patients developed acute feverish lower respiratory tract infection and chest computed tomography demonstrated mainly multiple centrilobular nodules in four or more lobes. Pneumonia was diagnosed when patients developed acute feverish lower respiratory tract infection and chest computed tomography demonstrated consolidation and/or ground-glass opacities with or without centrilobular nodules. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of the 1,664 patients, 20 (1.2%) and 1,644 (98.8%) patients were diagnosed as having DAIB and pneumonia, respectively. Of the 20 patients with DAIB, the etiology was determined in 16 (80%): 13 (65.0%) had a single pathogen and 3 (15.0%) had two pathogens. Detected organisms included Mycoplasma pneumoniae in eight (40.0%) patients, influenza virus in two (10.0%), influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in two (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae in three (15.0%), and respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in one (5.0%) patient. All patients improved and none developed postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. CONCLUSIONS The three most common etiologies of DAIB in the studied adults were M. pneumoniae, influenza virus, and H. influenzae. None of the patients with DAIB developed postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans.

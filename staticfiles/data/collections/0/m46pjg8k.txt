BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a minimally invasive technique which can be used for treatment of gallbladder disease. To evaluate our initial experience, patients treated with SILS cholecystectomy were compared with a comparable group of patients treated with a conventional four trocart technique (LC). METHODS Between May 2009 and April 2010, 60 SILS cholecystectomies were performed. These patients were matched by Body Mass Index (BMI) with 60 cases of conventional LC. RESULTS The operative time was significantly longer in the SILS group 55 min (range, 25-126 min) compared to 49 min (range, 28-75 min) for the LC group. Excluding the first 15 SILS cases the operative time became comparable to the conventional technique, with a mean operative time of 51 min (range, 25-90 min). No patients were converted to open cholecystectomy. In the SILS group 3 patients developed a wound infection, in the conventional LC group 2. CONCLUSION SILS cholecystectomy seems to be a safe and feasible procedure when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Complication rates are comparable to conventional LC. With a learning curve of around 10 to 15 procedures, operative times approach those of conventional LC.

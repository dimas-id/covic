Health care workers have been asked to do their part to make a difference and give back to their community. This personal reflection is a result of an experience as a medical reserve corps nurse volunteer for a local health department in the northeastern United States. Volunteering resulted in positive social and personal benefits for me. It inspired a sense of pride in helping others and knowing that someone's well-being may be enhanced. The individuals whom I spoke with via the phone appreciated the concern for their health, and some individuals seemed to enjoy the interaction with another person, possibly due to their isolation. Descriptions of interactions via phone calls with coronavirus positive individuals are provided that support the benefits of volunteering. Volunteerism has personal value in its ability to inspire someone to continue to make an impact. Volunteerism allowed me to give to others and to gain a sense of purpose.

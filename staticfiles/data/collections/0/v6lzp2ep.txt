This paper presents an dashboard developed to analyse the outbreak of the Covid-19 infection in Italy considering daily NUTS-3 data on positive cases provided by the Italian Ministry of Health and on deaths derived from Italian regional authorities' official press conferences. Descriptive time series plots are provided together with a map describing the spatial distribution of province cumulative cases and rates. A section on a proposed time-dependent adjusted SIRD model for NUTS-3 regions is also provided in the dashboard.
